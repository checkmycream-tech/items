            <li>Ginny  Covered the grey in the eye brows perfectly</li>
            <li>Easy to apply to eyebrows and authentic looking.</li>
            <li>Great eyebrow filler which looks very natural.</li>
            <li>product is great,  and I am an old lady (70)......</li>
            <li>This is really great as it looks so natural and fills in a thinning brow.  </li>

            <li>Product goes on easily.</li>
            <li>.. i have been using this for many years... it did cost more  than the 2 stores i mentioned... but it was worth it...</li>
            <li>This brow powder applies easily and blends well with existing brow color.</li>
            <li>It blends easy and does not leave &amp;#34;pencil&amp;#34; lines at all.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I have used this for years, it is easy to apply and the correct color for me.</li>
            <li>Happy I was able to finally find it.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>THAT FOR SUCH A GOOD BRAND I WOULD HAVE NICE LOOKING RICH BROWS.</li>
            <li>It fits me fine...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m feeling lucky to still be able to get it.  </li>
            <li>The brow colors are good and look natural and it&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I also asked to exchange it for the light and you refunded me the money instead.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know this was still available until I saw it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I kept changing my mind and went with the light brown.  </li>
            <li>all the stores had was the light brown</li>
            <li>I would not pay more than it is worth.</li>
            <li>I have used this brow liner for quit a few years and have been very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Easiest for an amature to get a good natural look.  </li>
            <li>This does a good job of covering it to blend with my natural color of brow hairs.</li>
            <li>it comes with, but use my full size angled bare minerals liner brush which works great.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what i wanted and arrived very quickly!  </li>
            <li>I  was happy to find this product again, as it works better than&lt;br /&gt;any other powder with the exception of Max Factor, which I&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was quick and easy....</li>
            <li>so was so excited to find it on line.</li>
            <li>The applicator is the best, as its a small, angled brush.</li>
            <li>Quickly arrived as shown with FREE shipping.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making this product available for those of us who like powers more than gunk.</li>
            <li>Okay, maybe I didn&#x27;t really jump</li>
            <li>Better than a pencil and much easier to apply and form the brow.</li>
            <li>recently got my good friend using this product.</li>
            <li>Delivered as advertised and quick.</li>
            <li>The  Maybelline New York Ultra-Brow Brow Powder,Shade #20 / #404 Dark Brown is perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>Good price too, considering how long it lasts.</li>
            <li>My new favorite product.</li>
            <li>not sure it is better than eyebrow pencil, but it is just as good</li>
            <li>I would really be in a bind if they quit making this altogether!!</li>
            <li>I was not able to find the Maybelline Brow Powder at any of the local cosmetic counters, so I was very happy that I was able to find it on the Amazon site.</li>
            <li>Just exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t like brow pencils, too harsh, but the powder is great and Maybelline discontinued it for whatever asinine reason, probably a guy made that decision.</li>
            <li>the only brow color I can use that really looks good.  </li>
            <li>It looks so much more natural than what some women are using today, some look like they&#x27;ve just drawed their eye brows on with a pencil.</li>
            <li>The brush fills the color in between the hairs of the brows giving  a more natural look, without it looking like you used a brow pencil.</li>
            <li>It really isn&#x27;t worth the price it is offered for here.</li>
            <li>She likes using the brush-on powder because it gives a more natural look.</li>
            <li>I rarely have to touch my brows up with anything else.</li>
            <li>It covers very well and is very easy to use and looks natural on your face.</li>
            <li>It has just the right stiffness and is the right size for applying the color.</li>
            <li>The price is right, too.</li>
            <li>Its a new product, so should be easy to find.  </li>
            <li>What really makes it great is the little brush that you can use to feather on the color.</li>
            <li>While I was looking I tried several different eyebrow products that were more than twice the amount of money and not half as good.</li>
            <li>Price higher than what I used to pay</li>
            <li>I am no longer able to find this product in our local pharmacy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for many years and always keep an extra one on hand.</li>
            <li>I use this daily to fill in my eyebrows and I love it so much.</li>
            <li>My hope is that it would also be of great help to other visually impaired women.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was thrilled and purchased 2 , one in the dark brown and one in another shade.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed and seems to not be available in local drug store</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t have enough pigment and comes off easily.  </li>
            <li>I love this brow powder, I use it every single day and never skip a day.</li>
            <li>I REALLY THISNK</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>thanks i  ordered 2...</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I do wish the microscopic handle on the brush could be bigger, but then it wouldn&#x27;t fit in the case, so</li>
            <li>and this is so much softer than any pencil.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear much make up, so I wanted a softer look.</li>
            <li>It arrived in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>everything on here is so much cheaper</li>
            <li>She was very upset to find out that Maybelline is no longer making it.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it as much as I thought I would.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the brow pencils and could never make them work to look &amp;#34;natural.&amp;#34;  I searched for the old-fashioned brush on brow powder that I was familiar with, and it again worked so well that I bought a second one &amp;#34;just in case&amp;#34</li>
            <li>This product helps define my eyebrows more than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>because people don&#x27;t buy it more frequently, the companies think people don&#x27;t like it, when in actuality, it either lasts a long time, or people stock up on it for fear they will discontinue it......</li>
            <li>I love Maybelline Powder for eyebrows and they no longer make it but this dark brown is mismarked.  </li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted I am so surprised that Maybelline obsoleted it.</li>
            <li>This product was recommended on an makeup website for older women.</li>
            <li>Decent quality product.</li>
            <li>I like the product, but it was a classic case of price gouging.  </li>
            <li>Several other women per store personnel were also trying to find it but the distributor &amp;#34;decided to go with something else&amp;#34; even though it was a popular product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been told that the product won&#x27;t be available in the near future, but I tried their replacement products and they don&#x27;t look as natural.</li>
            <li>THE RIGHT COLOR AND SAME QUALITY  </li>
            <li>Brown is a little dark; light brown might be better.</li>
            <li>Please consider returning this makeup item, Maybelline New York Ultra-Brow Brow Powder,Shade #20 / #404, to your catalogue.  </li>
            <li>Though I don&#x27;t consider myself old or older (37), I do have some gray hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a subtle yet effective product.  </li>
            <li>Brow looks very natural and not a &amp;#34;painted</li>
            <li>Looks very natural, unlike pencil.</li>
            <li>I got the dark brown and when I received it I thought it looked light and that it wouldn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>This is an overall good product, but if you have over-tweezed brows like I do, it just isn&#x27;t heavy enough.</li>
            <li>the brush is a little cheap but</li>
            <li>Have not been able to find it in drug stores lately.</li>
            <li>It gives you a natural look.</li>
            <li>It blends with my natural hairs and keeps it looking natural and groomed.</li>
            <li>I have almost no eyebrows and to my amazement, this looked so natural.</li>
            <li>and I am 72 years old, so</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like using eyebrow pencils, because I never felt that I could get a natural look with them.  </li>
            <li>It is the medium brown; not dark.  </li>
            <li>When I went to purchase a new one, they no longer stock this product in the local drug stores (</li>
            <li>The only truly natural look I have found &amp; I have been in the entertainment industry &amp; worked with professional makeup artists.</li>
            <li>It looks very natural and with a substitute applicator (I never use the tiny brush included)</li>
            <li>there is no other powder brow makeup</li>
            <li>Found 2 for .50 at wags, works ok, powder is very hard.</li>
            <li>This product accomplishes this without looking hard or stenciled into the brow area like eyebrow pencils and products that are a stenciled shape that is meant to be filled in.</li>
            <li>I could never believe this product was apparently discontinued.</li>
            <li>She attempted to use a pencil many years ago and was not happy with the results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not worth returning it, but I&#x27;ll order the dark brown while it&#x27;s still available.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Maybelline New York Ultra-Brow Brow Powder for a long time, it&#x27;s the only brow product I would use.  </li>
            <li>My mother and I dont have the nicest, thick and full eyebrows.</li>

            <li> this product is wonderful; don&#x27;t know why Maybelline has taken it off their current inventory of product</li>

            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Very excited to find it here</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product very successfully for several years.</li>
            <li> It does the job perfectly, and lasts for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Ginny  Covered the grey in the eye brows perfectly</li>
            <li> Easy to apply to eyebrows and authentic looking.</li>
            <li> Great eyebrow filler which looks very natural.</li>
            <li> product is great,  and I am an old lady (70)......</li>
            <li> This is really great as it looks so natural and fills in a thinning brow.  </li>
            <li> There is a perfect little brush inside that I have not been able to replace with any brand.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and stays on.  </li>
            <li> Product goes on easily.</li>
            <li> .. i have been using this for many years... it did cost more  than the 2 stores i mentioned... but it was worth it...</li>
            <li> This brow powder applies easily and blends well with existing brow color.</li>
            <li> It blends easy and does not leave &amp;#34;pencil&amp;#34; lines at all.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years, it is easy to apply and the correct color for me.</li>
            <li> Happy I was able to finally find it.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> THAT FOR SUCH A GOOD BRAND I WOULD HAVE NICE LOOKING RICH BROWS.</li>
            <li> It fits me fine...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m feeling lucky to still be able to get it.  </li>
            <li> The brow colors are good and look natural and it&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I also asked to exchange it for the light and you refunded me the money instead.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know this was still available until I saw it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I kept changing my mind and went with the light brown.  </li>
            <li> all the stores had was the light brown</li>
            <li> I would not pay more than it is worth.</li>
            <li> I have used this brow liner for quit a few years and have been very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Easiest for an amature to get a good natural look.  </li>
            <li> This does a good job of covering it to blend with my natural color of brow hairs.</li>
            <li> it comes with, but use my full size angled bare minerals liner brush which works great.  </li>
            <li> It was exactly what i wanted and arrived very quickly!  </li>
            <li> I  was happy to find this product again, as it works better than&lt;br /&gt;any other powder with the exception of Max Factor, which I&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was quick and easy....</li>
            <li> so was so excited to find it on line.</li>
            <li> The applicator is the best, as its a small, angled brush.</li>
            <li> Quickly arrived as shown with FREE shipping.</li>
            <li> Thanks for making this product available for those of us who like powers more than gunk.</li>
            <li> Okay, maybe I didn&#x27;t really jump</li>
            <li> Better than a pencil and much easier to apply and form the brow.</li>
            <li> recently got my good friend using this product.</li>
            <li> Delivered as advertised and quick.</li>
            <li> The  Maybelline New York Ultra-Brow Brow Powder,Shade #20 / #404 Dark Brown is perfect for me.  </li>
            <li> Good price too, considering how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> My new favorite product.</li>
            <li> not sure it is better than eyebrow pencil, but it is just as good</li>
            <li> I would really be in a bind if they quit making this altogether!!</li>
            <li> I was not able to find the Maybelline Brow Powder at any of the local cosmetic counters, so I was very happy that I was able to find it on the Amazon site.</li>
            <li> Just exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like brow pencils, too harsh, but the powder is great and Maybelline discontinued it for whatever asinine reason, probably a guy made that decision.</li>
            <li> the only brow color I can use that really looks good.  </li>
            <li> It looks so much more natural than what some women are using today, some look like they&#x27;ve just drawed their eye brows on with a pencil.</li>
            <li> The brush fills the color in between the hairs of the brows giving  a more natural look, without it looking like you used a brow pencil.</li>
            <li> It really isn&#x27;t worth the price it is offered for here.</li>
            <li> She likes using the brush-on powder because it gives a more natural look.</li>
            <li> I rarely have to touch my brows up with anything else.</li>
            <li> It covers very well and is very easy to use and looks natural on your face.</li>
            <li> It has just the right stiffness and is the right size for applying the color.</li>
            <li> The price is right, too.</li>
            <li> Its a new product, so should be easy to find.  </li>
            <li> What really makes it great is the little brush that you can use to feather on the color.</li>
            <li> While I was looking I tried several different eyebrow products that were more than twice the amount of money and not half as good.</li>
            <li> Price higher than what I used to pay</li>
            <li> I am no longer able to find this product in our local pharmacy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for many years and always keep an extra one on hand.</li>
            <li> I use this daily to fill in my eyebrows and I love it so much.</li>
            <li> My hope is that it would also be of great help to other visually impaired women.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was thrilled and purchased 2 , one in the dark brown and one in another shade.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed and seems to not be available in local drug store</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t have enough pigment and comes off easily.  </li>
            <li> I love this brow powder, I use it every single day and never skip a day.</li>
            <li> I REALLY THISNK</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> thanks i  ordered 2...</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I do wish the microscopic handle on the brush could be bigger, but then it wouldn&#x27;t fit in the case, so</li>
            <li> and this is so much softer than any pencil.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear much make up, so I wanted a softer look.</li>
            <li> It arrived in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> everything on here is so much cheaper</li>
            <li> She was very upset to find out that Maybelline is no longer making it.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it as much as I thought I would.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the brow pencils and could never make them work to look &amp;#34;natural.&amp;#34;  I searched for the old-fashioned brush on brow powder that I was familiar with, and it again worked so well that I bought a second one &amp;#34;just in case&amp;#34</li>
            <li> This product helps define my eyebrows more than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> because people don&#x27;t buy it more frequently, the companies think people don&#x27;t like it, when in actuality, it either lasts a long time, or people stock up on it for fear they will discontinue it......</li>
            <li> I love Maybelline Powder for eyebrows and they no longer make it but this dark brown is mismarked.  </li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted I am so surprised that Maybelline obsoleted it.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended on an makeup website for older women.</li>
            <li> Decent quality product.</li>
            <li> I like the product, but it was a classic case of price gouging.  </li>
            <li> Several other women per store personnel were also trying to find it but the distributor &amp;#34;decided to go with something else&amp;#34; even though it was a popular product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been told that the product won&#x27;t be available in the near future, but I tried their replacement products and they don&#x27;t look as natural.</li>
            <li> THE RIGHT COLOR AND SAME QUALITY  </li>
            <li> Brown is a little dark; light brown might be better.</li>
            <li> Please consider returning this makeup item, Maybelline New York Ultra-Brow Brow Powder,Shade #20 / #404, to your catalogue.  </li>
            <li> Though I don&#x27;t consider myself old or older (37), I do have some gray hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a subtle yet effective product.  </li>
            <li> Brow looks very natural and not a &amp;#34;painted</li>
            <li> Looks very natural, unlike pencil.</li>
            <li> I got the dark brown and when I received it I thought it looked light and that it wouldn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> This is an overall good product, but if you have over-tweezed brows like I do, it just isn&#x27;t heavy enough.</li>
            <li> the brush is a little cheap but</li>
            <li> Have not been able to find it in drug stores lately.</li>
            <li> It gives you a natural look.</li>
            <li> It blends with my natural hairs and keeps it looking natural and groomed.</li>
            <li> I have almost no eyebrows and to my amazement, this looked so natural.</li>
            <li> and I am 72 years old, so</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like using eyebrow pencils, because I never felt that I could get a natural look with them.  </li>
            <li> It is the medium brown; not dark.  </li>
            <li> When I went to purchase a new one, they no longer stock this product in the local drug stores (</li>
            <li> The only truly natural look I have found &amp; I have been in the entertainment industry &amp; worked with professional makeup artists.</li>
            <li> It looks very natural and with a substitute applicator (I never use the tiny brush included)</li>
            <li> there is no other powder brow makeup</li>
            <li> Found 2 for .50 at wags, works ok, powder is very hard.</li>
            <li> This product accomplishes this without looking hard or stenciled into the brow area like eyebrow pencils and products that are a stenciled shape that is meant to be filled in.</li>
            <li> I could never believe this product was apparently discontinued.</li>
            <li> She attempted to use a pencil many years ago and was not happy with the results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth returning it, but I&#x27;ll order the dark brown while it&#x27;s still available.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Maybelline New York Ultra-Brow Brow Powder for a long time, it&#x27;s the only brow product I would use.  </li>
            <li> My mother and I dont have the nicest, thick and full eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I tried other eyebrow products and this wins hands down!</li>
            <li> it last for a very long time too....  </li>
            <li> I ordered #404 DARK brown and was shipped the #402 light brown which is not good for me at all.</li>
            <li> It was hard to fine in my usual stores</li>
            <li> I am not happy with my order as I ordered the Light Brown Ultra Brow and you sent the dark.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I did not open this package right away and left it on table until a couple days ago.  </li>
            <li> Way more expensive than it used to be in a pharmacy, but I&#x27;ve had trouble finding it.  </li>
            <li> I am partially sighted.  </li>
            <li> if one spent $35.00 there would be no shipping charge.</li>
            <li> It appears that this item is no longer carried in drug stores or other outlets.</li>
            <li> This may be something that your company did not think about in the past, but I hope you will take it into your consideration in the future.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used eyebrow pencils and just figured that everyone struggled with their inconsistent performance - some days the color won&#x27;t stick without a fight, and other days it goes on like a felt pen.  </li>
            <li> etc., like other products I have tried...</li>
            <li> I like the color and it stays on when it gets wet!</li>
            <li> I had a little left over of the real dark brown and it does not match at all.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only eyebrow make-up that I&#x27;ve used in at least 20 years</li>
            <li> and i needed dark brown</li>
            <li> Two powders for $25 is a complete rip-off.</li>
            <li> the color they sent for me is useless for me and a big hassle to deal with sending it back....</li>
            <li> I wet this and use a small brush for eye liner and it stays on all day.</li>
            <li> I am unable to purchase it in any of the stores in Whatcom county, Washington where I live.</li>
            <li> I also have a few  thick all white and thick dark black hair that does grow in my brow line.  </li>
            <li> This Maybelline Ultra-Brow powder with its little brush has been around for YEARS</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;It was a little pricy online</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the little brush</li>
            <li> The brush is too wide and hard to manuliplate,  </li>
            <li> what a waste</li>
            <li> it came in a few days after i made my order....</li>
            <li> Using anything other than your packed powder and the little brush along with a magnifying mirror is next to impossible.  </li>
            <li> They totally sent me the wrong color..</li>
            <li> /&gt;which wipe off after a few hours!</li>
            <li> They usually carry two brands.  </li>
            <li> With the price I paid for shpping I am not very happy about it as it was a waste of money on something I can&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> This has been a must-have product for her for at least 20 years if not more.</li>
            <li> I have used it for years and am most unhappy and disappointed to hear that this product has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> ITS SEEMS HARD</li>
            <li> I thin the secret is on the brush.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years to fill in my eyebrows which are thin at the ends.</li>
            <li> When they discontinued it, I was broken hearted.</li>
            <li> and i was disappointed when i could not fine it in the stores.</li>
            <li> It does not make your eyebrows look fake either.</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> this product is difficult to find and I have used it for years.  </li>
            <li> So sorry this item has been discontinued.  </li>
            <li> SORRY, WONT DO IT.</li>
            <li> I was unable to find this in stores.</li>
            <li> I desperately needed this brown eyebrow liner.</li>
            <li> Her eyebrows are almost non-existent so for her, using a pencil to fill in the eyebrows is nearly impossible.</li>
            <li> Idiots</li>
            <li> So disappointed this product has been discontinued by Maybelline!  </li>
            <li> Im very very disappointed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for decades and was very disappointed when I could no longer find it in the drug store.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in Amazon.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> If you want your eyebrows to look drawn in, use a pencil! but if you want a soft&lt;br /&gt;natural look, use this Maybelline brow powder with brush. It is easy to use and stays on.  I could only give 4 stars because the plastic case soon comes apart at the hinges and is troublesome to fasten on again.</li>
            <li> It appears that this item is no longer carried in drug stores or other outlets. I was thrilled to be able to purchase it on e-bay.</li>
            <li> How fantastic to be able to get something I&#x27;ve used for many years! Several other women per store personnel were also trying to find it but the distributor &amp;#34;decided to go with something else&amp;#34; even though it was a popular product. HA !</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed and seems to not be available in local drug store</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and could not find it in stores any longer so was very happy to find it on Amazon.  Thank you, I love it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product daily for over 20 years and think it&#x27;s perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Been using for years and love it.</li>
            <li> I was very glad to find this online at Amazon.  I could not find it in the stores anymore.  Works great and a good price.</li>
            <li> I was satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> Love it and can&#x27;t find it anymore in the stores.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply to eyebrows and authentic looking.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with my order as I ordered the Light Brown Ultra Brow and you sent the dark. I also asked to exchange it for the light and you refunded me the money instead.</li>
            <li> This is the best eyebrow makeup ever!!! The only truly natural look I have found &amp; I have been in the entertainment industry &amp; worked with professional makeup artists.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved this product forever, and I hope you will continue to carry it. I used to buy it in the drug stores but they stopped carring it.</li>
            <li> This product is adaquate.  I liked the color the brush is a little cheap but overall works well.</li>
            <li> I DONTLIKE IT I ACTUALLY GAVE IT AWAY. IT DOENST COME OFF THE BRUSH TO YOUR BROW, ITS SEEMS HARD , COLOR LOOKS GOOD BUT WHEN U TRY TO BRUSH YOUR BROW , I DONT KNOW.... I REALLY THISNK THAT FOR SUCH A GOOD BRAND I WOULD HAVE NICE LOOKING RICH BROWS. I AM DISSAPPOINTED</li>
            <li> This product was recommended on an makeup website for older women. Though I don&#x27;t consider myself old or older (37), I do have some gray hair. In any case, I LOVE this product. What really makes it great is the little brush that you can use to feather on the color. It has just the right stiffness and is the right size for applying the color. I&#x27;m so excited to find a great makeup product that&#x27;s CHEAP.</li>
            <li> I have used it for years and am most unhappy and disappointed to hear that this product has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> I reallly like the ultra-brow shade #20 for many reasons.  It is easy to use, the shade matches my hair color perfectly, and acheive the perfect natural shape eyebrows.  I have been using this product for several years.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Used this product for years, couldn&#x27;t find it in any of the stores in my area. So glad I can get it thru Amazon!</li>
            <li> It was quick and easy....product is great,  and I am an old lady (70)......so if I can do this, anyone can!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know this was still available until I saw it on Amazon.  What a great surprise.  There is a perfect little brush inside that I have not been able to replace with any brand.  I&#x27;m so happy I&#x27;ve found this product again.  Delivery was great too.</li>
            <li> I love Maybelline Powder for eyebrows and they no longer make it but this dark brown is mismarked.  It is the medium brown; not dark.  I had a little left over of the real dark brown and it does not match at all.  Im very very disappointed but Im stuck with it.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 5*s for the product but this IS MISMARKED.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It does the job perfectly, and lasts for a long time.  When I went to purchase a new one, they no longer stock this product in the local drug stores (Wallgreen&#x27;s and CVS).  I visited 4 in the area, and then ordered it online.  Thank goodness you carry it.  I use it every day.  Hope Maybelline will reconsider stocking it in local drug stores, once again.</li>
            <li> They totally sent me the wrong color..I checked my order many times to be sure I wrote the correct color and I did.....the color they sent for me is useless for me and a big hassle to deal with sending it back....never again...what a waste</li>
            <li> I am delighted that I located a  source where I could purchase this type of eyebrow makeup.  I have been searching for about 2 years. The  Maybelline New York Ultra-Brow Brow Powder,Shade #20 / #404 Dark Brown is perfect for me.  A question that I have is, &amp;#34;Why was this taken off of the market?&amp;#34;  This may be something that your company did not think about in the past, but I hope you will take it into your consideration in the future.  I am partially sighted.  In fact, my situation is referred to as &amp;#34;statutory blindness&amp;#34;  I don&#x27;t run into walls :)  However, I can&#x27;t recognize faces across the room.  I enlarge almost everything that I read.  I use my iPhone camera to take pictures of many items and their price when we go shopping.  Seeing details is a great challenge for me.  Using anything other than your packed powder and the little brush along with a magnifying mirror is next to impossible.  Please consider returning this makeup item, Maybelline New York Ultra-Brow Brow Powder,Shade #20 / #404, to your catalogue.  My hope is that it would also be of great help to other visually impaired women.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Louise Frier</li>
            <li> I had about given up trying to find this product and then decided to search Amazon.com.  There it was and I jumped for joy.  Okay, maybe I didn&#x27;t really jump but I bought.  Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for over 40 years and i was disappointed when i could not fine it in the stores. So this makes me happy that i can now get at amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years.  Better than a pencil and much easier to apply and form the brow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been told that the product won&#x27;t be available in the near future, but I tried their replacement products and they don&#x27;t look as natural.</li>
            <li> It fits me fine...the only brow color I can use that really looks good.  I am a clutz so this is an easy product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for decades and was very disappointed when I could no longer find it in the drug store. I tried other eyebrow products and this wins hands down!</li>
            <li> Product goes on easily. It is not powdery and stays in place. Great eyebrow filler which looks very natural. Have not been able to find it in drug stores lately. Great product.</li>
            <li> Way more expensive than it used to be in a pharmacy, but I&#x27;ve had trouble finding it.  Decent quality product.</li>
            <li> I wish I could find this in store.</li>
            <li> My mother and I love Maybelline. We have used their products for years! When we found out this wasnt sold in stores any longer, we were upset! Glad to have found it here! My mother and I dont have the nicest, thick and full eyebrows. But this product fills them in perfectly! Even when were on the go, it is so easy to apply and it stays on through out the day! It does not make your eyebrows look fake either. It gives you a natural look. It is the perfect shade of brown if you have fair or any darker skin, with medium brown-black shade of hair.</li>
            <li> thanks i  ordered 2... i guess cvs and walgreen no longer carry this product... i am so glad i looked on amazon for this.. i have been using this for many years... it did cost more  than the 2 stores i mentioned... but it was worth it... it last for a very long time too....  it came in a few days after i made my order.... thanks</li>
            <li> So disappointed this product has been discontinued by Maybelline!  I ordered several so I could stock up.  If you use these, better stockpile now before they are all gone.</li>
            <li> I love ultra brow powder. I will never understand why Maybelline stopped production.  I wish Maybelline would bring it back</li>
            <li> Easiest for an amature to get a good natural look.  Much better than pencils  Maybelline PLEASE bring this product back !!!</li>
            <li> So happy to find it, been using it for about 30 years.  I looked everywhere for it before going online.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this product since the stores where I used to buy it stopped carrying it.  I have turned many of my friends on to the Ultra-Brow Brow Powder.  It&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> Another discontinued item that I and two of my friends used all the time. Was happy to find it on E-bay..bought 3!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gloria</li>
            <li> Thank goodness for people who have the foresight to snag discontinued products, such as this one, to re-sell to those of us who don&#x27;t want to do without them. I&#x27;ve used this brow powder for years and love it!! Don&#x27;t like brow pencils, too harsh, but the powder is great and Maybelline discontinued it for whatever asinine reason, probably a guy made that decision. ha,ha</li>
            <li> This fills in brows well. I line my brows with a pen and then fill them in with the Maybelline. It blends with my natural hairs and keeps it looking natural and groomed. I&#x27;ve never used the brush it comes with, but the brow powder works great with my makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> And why on earth has Maybelline stopped making this product???  Idiots I suppose as everyone on their site is telling them to bring it back. It looks so much more natural than what some women are using today, some look like they&#x27;ve just drawed their eye brows on with a pencil.</li>
            <li> I  was happy to find this product again, as it works better than&lt;br /&gt;any other powder with the exception of Max Factor, which I&lt;br /&gt;cannot find.</li>
            <li> I could never believe this product was apparently discontinued. After checking local stores I turned to AMAZON. I was thrilled and purchased 2 , one in the dark brown and one in another shade. Price higher than what I used to pay but I was so happy, I did not hesitate. Thank you for supplying my go to for brows.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years. It works great. I could not find it in stores anymore so was so excited to find it on line.</li>
            <li> So I read he reviews and decided to try. I have almost no eyebrows and to my amazement, this looked so natural. I got the dark brown and when I received it I thought it looked light and that it wouldn&#x27;t work but I was wrong. I thin the secret is on the brush. My new favorite product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT , I SHOULD HAVE ORDERED MORE! THANK YOU .&lt;br /&gt;JUST THE RIGHT COLOR AND SAME QUALITY  I AM USED TO USING</li>
            <li> This brow powder applies easily and blends well with existing brow color.</li>
            <li> I like the product, but it was a classic case of price gouging.  Two powders for $25 is a complete rip-off.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years.  Maybelline has discontinued it.  I am so glad I found it on your sight.</li>
            <li> This is an overall good product, but if you have over-tweezed brows like I do, it just isn&#x27;t heavy enough. Perfect for filling in some bare spots, but not defining the brow.</li>
            <li> this product is difficult to find and I have used it for years.  Very excited to find it here</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Maybelline New York Ultra-Brow Brow Powder for a long time, it&#x27;s the only brow product I would use.  It covers very well and is very easy to use and looks natural on your face.</li>
            <li> I desperately needed this brown eyebrow liner. This powder has helped made my eyebrows looks so much more translucent. If I didn&#x27;t wear this eyebrow liner, my eyebrows would not be visible. My eyebrows are bleach blond!</li>
            <li> This brand and style has been my favorite for decades!  I kept changing my mind and went with the light brown.  Big mistake.  It&#x27;s not worth returning it, but I&#x27;ll order the dark brown while it&#x27;s still available.</li>
            <li> this product is wonderful; don&#x27;t know why Maybelline has taken it off their current inventory of product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  Imagine my dismay when it was discontinued.  I bought two of them just to be sure I don[&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted I am so surprised that Maybelline obsoleted it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Maybelline is no longer producing this.  Color is as stated. Works perfectly. Does not break up</li>
            <li> This Maybelline Ultra-Brow powder with its little brush has been around for YEARS and I&#x27;m feeling lucky to still be able to get it.  It&#x27;s the only eyebrow make-up that I&#x27;ve used in at least 20 years and I know it was on the market longer than that.  The brow colors are good and look natural and it&#x27;s easy to use.  The price is right, too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the brow pencils and could never make them work to look &amp;#34;natural.&amp;#34;  I searched for the old-fashioned brush on brow powder that I was familiar with, and it again worked so well that I bought a second one &amp;#34;just in case&amp;#34; I would never find one again.</li>
            <li> I love this brow powder and am sorry it has been discontinued at stores by Maybelline.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and was glad to find it on Amazon. I am no longer able to find this product in our local pharmacy&#x27;s. The brush fills the color in between the hairs of the brows giving  a more natural look, without it looking like you used a brow pencil.</li>
            <li> works great on sparse brows.</li>
            <li> Delivered as advertised and quick.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I don&#x27;t know why Maybelline stopped putting it in stores.  Now I have to look for it online.</li>
            <li> Seems too powderery when applied.</li>
            <li> This product helps define my eyebrows more than any other product I&#x27;ve tried. The brush is a perfect design and the color is great for medium to dark brown brows.</li>
            <li> So sorry this item has been discontinued.  It&#x27;s a subtle yet effective product.  Maybelline should reinstate it to their catalog of products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost 40 years. Nothing compares. Nothing!</li>
            <li> Ginny  Covered the grey in the eye brows perfectly</li>
            <li> This product is completely matte and blends in perfectly with the brows. You can use an angled liner brush to distribute the product on the brows but there is a brush included in this brow powder. The brush that is included works well.</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d discovered this form of colorant years ago!  I&#x27;ve always used eyebrow pencils and just figured that everyone struggled with their inconsistent performance - some days the color won&#x27;t stick without a fight, and other days it goes on like a felt pen.  But this powder is great!  It sticks every time, and if I want it darker, I just keep adding more.  I do wish the microscopic handle on the brush could be bigger, but then it wouldn&#x27;t fit in the case, so I guess I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> i use this all the time. all the stores had was the light brown and i needed dark brown so i was happy to find the right color.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product! I cannot find it in any of the local stores!</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t understand why Mabelline has discontinued this item.  there is no other powder brow makeup and this is so much softer than any pencil.  hope they re-introduce it soon.</li>
            <li> Found 2 for .50 at wags, works ok, powder is very hard. I would not pay more than it is worth.</li>
            <li> I could not find this product in local stores in the color I wanted, so I was very happy to find it online. I don&#x27;t wear much make up, so I wanted a softer look. This product accomplishes this without looking hard or stenciled into the brow area like eyebrow pencils and products that are a stenciled shape that is meant to be filled in. I would buy this product again. It arrived in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> I love this.  It blends easy and does not leave &amp;#34;pencil&amp;#34; lines at all. Brow looks very natural and not a &amp;#34;painted on&amp;#34; look at all.  I also have a few  thick all white and thick dark black hair that does grow in my brow line.  This does a good job of covering it to blend with my natural color of brow hairs.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been using it for years. The applicator is the best, as its a small, angled brush. Looks very natural, unlike pencil. Brown is a little dark; light brown might be better.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe they stopped carrying them in the drugstores in my area. I have been using this for over 30 years! Thank goodness&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has it - the only product I like. I wet this and use a small brush for eye liner and it stays on all day. Not like pencil products&lt;br /&gt;which wipe off after a few hours! I would really be in a bind if they quit making this altogether!!</li>
            <li> I love it. Just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I have used this brow liner for quit a few years and have been very happy with it. It seems that now Maybelline had discontinued it, and now the price gouging starts. It really isn&#x27;t worth the price it is offered for here. I had been buying it at Walmart for 1/4 to 1/3 the price here. Time to look for a comparable product.</li>
            <li> I love this brow powder, I use it every single day and never skip a day. i just absolutely love it and havent found anything else like it. But I buy mine at CVS, Rite Aid, Walmart etc for between 3-5$ so there is NO WAY IN ---- I WOULD EVER PAY $23.95 THATS LIKE 20$ MORE, R U KIDDING ME? NOPE SORRY, WONT DO IT. I love amazon bc everything on here is so much cheaper ( i think) so when i saw this i just couldnt believe it! im telling u go to CVS and say 20$ and a 3 day wait. just an FYI</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years, and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Ultra Brow for many years and when I went to buy more, I couldn&#x27;t find it any stores. Thank goodness for Amazon. While I was looking I tried several different eyebrow products that were more than twice the amount of money and not half as good. I&#x27;m so glad to be able to use Ultra Brow again. It&#x27;s the best. Easy to use and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Love this. Can&#x27;t find in stores. Works best when you moisten the powder and the brush. Nothing I&#x27;ve tried works as well! I especially love this color!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for fifty years and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;It was a little pricy online but my local store was out of the product.&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t use anything else!!&lt;br /&gt;I recently got my good friend using this product.</li>
            <li> Greatest eyebrow powder I have ever used this and I am 72 years old, so I know how many years that I used Brow Powder!</li>
            <li> This product irritates my eyes - so I cannot use it. The product works well - but my eyes cannot tolerate it.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years to fill in my eyebrows which are thin at the ends.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product.  I don&#x27;t like using eyebrow pencils, because I never felt that I could get a natural look with them.  I was not able to find the Maybelline Brow Powder at any of the local cosmetic counters, so I was very happy that I was able to find it on the Amazon site.</li>
            <li> I use this daily to fill in my eyebrows and I love it so much. Matches my eyebrow color perfectly!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my wife. She was very upset to find out that Maybelline is no longer making it. Her eyebrows are almost non-existent so for her, using a pencil to fill in the eyebrows is nearly impossible. She attempted to use a pencil many years ago and was not happy with the results. A line does not make an eyebrow!! She likes using the brush-on powder because it gives a more natural look. This has been a must-have product for her for at least 20 years if not more.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what i wanted and arrived very quickly!  thanks</li>
            <li> I have used this for years, it is easy to apply and the correct color for me. I am unable to purchase it in any of the stores in Whatcom county, Washington where I live. I understand it has been discontinued.  That is the reason I purchased 5.  Actually I guess I must have made a mistake when I ordered as I received 8.  I have returned 3.  I do not understand why I was charged shipping as it stated if one spent $35.00 there would be no shipping charge. I received  6 in one package with two shipping&lt;br /&gt;orders in it and on each one I was charged $7.48 total $14.96 shipping and handling and then several days later I received two separate packages with just 1 Brow powder in each package and no shipping orders.  I don&#x27;t think I should have been charged&lt;br /&gt;any shipping and handling at all as that is what it said when I ordered if the order was over $35.00.  Hope you can straighten this out for me. I will hesitate ordering anything from Amazon in the future, unless you can let me know why this happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for many years and always keep an extra one on hand. It looks very natural and with a substitute applicator (I never use the tiny brush included) I rarely have to touch my brows up with anything else. Good price too, considering how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> Great item I have used for years but no longer available in stores</li>
            <li> It is OK.  I don&#x27;t use it as much as I thought I would.  Still like my pencil--also made by Maybelline.  I do find that Maybelline does not cause my eyes to tear, etc., like other products I have tried...</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t have enough pigment and comes off easily.  There is another product you can get in the beauty supply stores.  They usually carry two brands.  You want the cheaper one.  I paid $3.99.  It has lots of pigment.  Another product I discovered is Maybelline define fill pencil.  I don&#x27;t have eyebrows .  This was better than the one at the beauty supply store.  Its a new product, so should be easy to find.  I paid $8.00 ar Walgreens.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brow powder for years, and love it.  I was unable to find this in stores. So glad I was able to find it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Great product and arrived quickly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product very successfully for several years. Thank goodness only the packaging changes, NOT the quality of the product. Quickly arrived as shown with FREE shipping.</li>
            <li> Could not find this product anywhere. Happy I was able to finally find it. Excellent powder, does a great job.</li>
            <li> Does not deliver desired results.</li>
            <li> Please let me know if you get anymore because I think it&#x27;s been discontinued.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at 1st to try this, but found it is an excellent product.  I don&#x27;t care for the little brush it comes with, but use my full size angled bare minerals liner brush which works great.  Once you get it on, and its set, it STAYS ON ALLLLLLL DAY!!!  Which surprised me beings that you don&#x27;t have to get it wet or anything, it&#x27;s just a powder.  And if you make an error @ 1st application, its very easy to correct with a qtip, or your finger.  I hope they continue to make this product/carry it..I would say it is one of the BEST on the market.  I think it will last forever...&amp; I think what happens is because people don&#x27;t buy it more frequently, the companies think people don&#x27;t like it, when in actuality, it either lasts a long time, or people stock up on it for fear they will discontinue it......hopefully not though....  :)</li>
            <li> This is really great as it looks so natural and fills in a thinning brow.  It was hard to fine in my usual stores</li>
            <li> nice product..not sure it is better than eyebrow pencil, but it is just as good</li>
            <li> I like the color and it stays on when it gets wet! It&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve used so far!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I did not open this package right away and left it on table until a couple days ago.  I ordered #404 DARK brown and was shipped the #402 light brown which is not good for me at all. With the price I paid for shpping I am not very happy about it as it was a waste of money on something I can&#x27;t use. Very disappointed in Amazon.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t go on the brush so you cant get it on your eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Just exactly what I was looking for!  Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t ever stop making this product.  Thank goodness I can still find it on Amazon.  I&#x27;ve been using it for decades as a fill in for my brows as well as an eyeliner.  I suffer from Alopecia as well and it works great to camouflage bald spots.</li>
            <li> This item wasn&#x27;t as good as I had hoped.  The brush is too wide and hard to manuliplate,  Thank you for letting me tell you my experience with the product.</li>
            <li> I purchased a similar product years ago from a department store cosmetics company. When they discontinued it, I was broken hearted. Thanks for making this product available for those of us who like powers more than gunk.</li>
