            <li>It&#x27;s also nice that we can have them auto shipped with the subscribe and save shipments; that also reduces our cost.</li>
            <li>has never felt more amazing.</li>
            <li>so I use the Pantene 2 minute mask every time I shampoo (it&#x27;s really good and cheap).  </li>
            <li>but this stuff made my hair feel so soft and it smelled wonderful.</li>
            <li>I love the exotic, floral scent of this shampoo as well as its amazing hydrating qualities.  </li>
            <li>I thoroughly recommend this line. :)</li>
            <li>My daughter and I both love these shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fabulous!</li>
            <li>Does not smell close to Paul Michells Awapuhi Ginger shampoo or conditioner set, otherwise it is an ok shampoo to use.</li>
            <li>Love this brand.</li>
            <li>I love this line.</li>
            <li>I love that Organix never uses sulfates.  </li>
            <li>It feels silky &amp; more hydrated, but not greasy.</li>
            <li>Consequently, there are more uses to the bottle.</li>
            <li>I need more \\&quot;slip\\&quot; in order to detangle my hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I discovered this shampoo</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I discovered this shampoo</li>
            <li>This product was delivered on time, and my oh my am I glad it did.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love these products.</li>
            <li>however I had put the product away and over the many months forgot about it.  </li>
            <li>I love how my hair feels and looks.</li>
            <li>This particular formula doesn&#x27;t smell as strong as nice as some of the others, but it is a pleasant fragrance nonetheless.</li>
            <li>This particular formula doesn&#x27;t smell as strong as nice as some of the others, but it is a pleasant fragrance nonetheless.</li>
            <li>They smell great and are thick and rich ( the sea moisture formula smells the best IMHO).  </li>
            <li>but it has left my hair incredibly soft/shiny.  </li>
            <li>Gentle, smells good, cleans hair.</li>
            <li>I have never had hair this easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this product to any girl who needs to soften their hair or bring out their curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair has never been as silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing at mending very damaged hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is color treated and therefore I need a sulfate free shampoo to protect it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not one of those who believes that a shampoo can smooth frizz, add volume or prevent breakage.  </li>
            <li>Originally, I purchased this product just for my extensions</li>
            <li>hair is cleaner longer (honestly, it still looks super shiny even 12 hrs after washing), my tangles and frizzies are way more under control, and there is a major reduction in split ends.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that is completely straight.</li>
            <li>My hair is so much softer and more manageable and it looks great all day long.</li>
            <li>I really like the shape of the bottle :)</li>
            <li>This was on sale at my local supermarket it sounded so good.</li>
            <li>I love the mild scent and really wanted to like this product</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried several different formulas and all of them have been excellent.  </li>
            <li>The addition of oil (I always make sure oil appears in the ingredients list) will help prevent static and likely adds some lipids</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND :)</li>
            <li>I have normal, considerably healthy hair</li>
            <li>Like I said in the review of this shampoos matching conditioner, I have baby fine straight hair</li>
            <li>I have naturally straight fine hair, but it is course, and I have a ton of it.  </li>
            <li>But I do know that a sulfate free shampoo is much gentler to color treated hair and many people are sensitive to sulfates.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is worth it.</li>
            <li>THIS IS WORTH THE MONEY.</li>
            <li>I gave Organix Ginger shampoo a high rating because it smells good, I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and its bringing my hair back to life.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t believe how amazing it felt the next day after the first use.</li>
            <li>I tried the hair mask first</li>
            <li>THE FIRST DAY I USED IT.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that using it once a week as a mask is better than daily use.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this shampoo, my hair just clumped into one big chunk after rinsing and there was no way I would be able to detangle unless I follow up with conditioner.</li>
            <li>Actually all organix products  are phenomenal, no lie.</li>
            <li>My hair is in much better condition than prior use.</li>
            <li>we&#x27;re unbelievably soft and frizz free.</li>
            <li>Its so soft smooth and doesn&#x27;t tangle anymore.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure (but not positive) that this shampoo gets rid of that buildup</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure (but not positive) that this shampoo gets rid of that buildup</li>
            <li>Best shampoo for thick dry hair.</li>
            <li>It certainly did what it was meant to do, it left my hair looking flatter than usual, but it really smelled good!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like it, it is very drying for my hair.</li>
            <li>Organix products are sulfate-free, and it really makes a difference.  </li>
            <li>So whatever is really is suspect...  </li>
            <li>I have no idea of this shampoo makes much difference for my hair, but I loooove it.</li>
            <li>I have the most unmanageable dry/ frizzy hair and even after the first use I could tell my hair was noticeably softer and less frizzy .</li>
            <li>I really prefer the formulas that contain oil of some kind because with long hair, dryness is a constant concern.  </li>
            <li>and I pay particular attention to lathering up the lengths and giving them a gentle scrub, as my stylist is fond of doing.  </li>
            <li>and I pay particular attention to lathering up the lengths and giving them a gentle scrub, as my stylist is fond of doing.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it smell great, but I can use it at night after getting out of the shower (applying to damp hair) and again in the morning to tame some frizz and as a touch up; no greasy residue from using 2x/day!</li>
            <li>This scent was different and does a great job of smoothing my thick almost straight hair.</li>
            <li>my become to soft to style in certain ways, but is that really something to complain about?&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.considerable buildup.  </li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing, but the smell doesn&#x27;t last all day like my other shampoos.</li>
            <li>I dye my hair quite a bit and use a flat iron religiously and while using this product you would never be able to tell.</li>
            <li>It will make your hair REALLY silky and soft, I just can&#x27;t deal with the heaviness of it.</li>
            <li>At least that&#x27;s when I started loving my hair.</li>
            <li>Unlike other sulfate free shampoos, it doesn&#x27;t take a ton of shampoo to make a decent lather with the Organix shampoos.  </li>
            <li>It smells really good and it lasted me a long time, plus it was a little cheaper than it would have been in the store!</li>
            <li>Have thin, fine, soft hair that tangles and frizzes easily.</li>
            <li>The smell is wonderful and tropic-like; what I don&#x27;t like about it is the heavy residue it leaves behind.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair very soft.</li>
            <li>This gave my hair second day shine on the first day as well.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried other Organix products, but after using this I will be sure to try others in the future.</li>
            <li>I have extremely thick/color treated/curly hair and this line keeps my hair looking super soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sometimes it literally feels like my hair is too soft.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and it feels moisturized without being \\&quot;oily\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I use a considerable amount of hairspray and wash my hair 2 to 3 times a week</li>
            <li>so there&#x27;s considerable buildup.  </li>
            <li>I was also looking for something to bring out my natural curls without again, looking greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but now I want to use this product for my natural hair.</li>
            <li>and did I mention how soft it is.  </li>
            <li>I suggest making absolutely sure that you&#x27;ve rinsed it really well, because if you don&#x27;t by the end of the day (for me at least) my hair looks like it hasn&#x27;t been washed the entire week.</li>
            <li>I have pretty sun-damaged, dry hair, but this shampoo makes my hair soft and hydrated, even before I condition.  </li>
            <li>First I was looking for something that wasn&#x27;t greasy to use in my fried hair (as a result of multiple colorings, coloring back, and straightening to my bangs).</li>
            <li>I will continue to use Organix shampoos because it&#x27;s a good brand and is far less expensive than salon products and does the exact same thing.  </li>
            <li>When I ordered it, along with the conditioner, I didn&#x27;t notice it was for coarse hair that needed straightening, I was too busy imagining the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That being said, however, this shampoo is really nice and it&#x27;s not too expensive.  </li>
            <li>My hair was so bouncy and silky when I flat ironed it, and my dry scalp felt really refreshed</li>
            <li>Not long after I started using this shampoo (and the accompanying conditioner), my hair started coming out - like twenty strands each time</li>
            <li>I am not sensitive at all and have been subjected to harsh products probably more than the average person.</li>
            <li>The Organix conditioner is simply too thin to do the job, as are most regular conditioners.  </li>
            <li>First off everyone and their hair is different so just for a clearer understanding I have thin and VERY oily hair</li>

            <li> Organix products are sulfate-free, and it really makes a difference.  </li>
            <li> So whatever is really is suspect...  </li>
            <li> I have no idea of this shampoo makes much difference for my hair, but I loooove it.</li>
            <li> I have the most unmanageable dry/ frizzy hair and even after the first use I could tell my hair was noticeably softer and less frizzy .</li>
            <li> I really prefer the formulas that contain oil of some kind because with long hair, dryness is a constant concern.  </li>

            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, but the smell doesn&#x27;t last all day like my other shampoos.</li>
            <li> I dye my hair quite a bit and use a flat iron religiously and while using this product you would never be able to tell.</li>
            <li> It will make your hair REALLY silky and soft, I just can&#x27;t deal with the heaviness of it.</li>
            <li> At least that&#x27;s when I started loving my hair.</li>
            <li> Unlike other sulfate free shampoos, it doesn&#x27;t take a ton of shampoo to make a decent lather with the Organix shampoos.  </li>
            <li> It smells really good and it lasted me a long time, plus it was a little cheaper than it would have been in the store!</li>
            <li> Have thin, fine, soft hair that tangles and frizzes easily.</li>
            <li> The smell is wonderful and tropic-like; what I don&#x27;t like about it is the heavy residue it leaves behind.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> This gave my hair second day shine on the first day as well.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried other Organix products, but after using this I will be sure to try others in the future.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick/color treated/curly hair and this line keeps my hair looking super soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sometimes it literally feels like my hair is too soft.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and it feels moisturized without being \\&quot;oily\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I use a considerable amount of hairspray and wash my hair 2 to 3 times a week</li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s considerable buildup.  </li>
            <li> I was also looking for something to bring out my natural curls without again, looking greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but now I want to use this product for my natural hair.</li>
            <li> and did I mention how soft it is.  </li>
            <li> I suggest making absolutely sure that you&#x27;ve rinsed it really well, because if you don&#x27;t by the end of the day (for me at least) my hair looks like it hasn&#x27;t been washed the entire week.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sun-damaged, dry hair, but this shampoo makes my hair soft and hydrated, even before I condition.  </li>
            <li> First I was looking for something that wasn&#x27;t greasy to use in my fried hair (as a result of multiple colorings, coloring back, and straightening to my bangs).</li>
            <li> I will continue to use Organix shampoos because it&#x27;s a good brand and is far less expensive than salon products and does the exact same thing.  </li>
            <li> When I ordered it, along with the conditioner, I didn&#x27;t notice it was for coarse hair that needed straightening, I was too busy imagining the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That being said, however, this shampoo is really nice and it&#x27;s not too expensive.  </li>
            <li> My hair was so bouncy and silky when I flat ironed it, and my dry scalp felt really refreshed</li>
            <li> Not long after I started using this shampoo (and the accompanying conditioner), my hair started coming out - like twenty strands each time</li>
            <li> I am not sensitive at all and have been subjected to harsh products probably more than the average person.</li>
            <li> The Organix conditioner is simply too thin to do the job, as are most regular conditioners.  </li>
            <li> First off everyone and their hair is different so just for a clearer understanding I have thin and VERY oily hair</li>
            <li> Its curly and hard to tame most of the time.</li>
            <li> I bought this particular line from Ulta a little over a week ago.</li>
            <li> and I have long hair to the middle of my back.</li>
            <li> Not sure what else to say about this particular product.</li>
            <li> Then just a week ago I had run out of shampoo and did the desperate search through the cupboard and found it and tried once more.  </li>
            <li> Bought this not too long ago I noticed a difference in my hair</li>
            <li> I have used other shampoos by this company (the coconut one and the tea tree oil one) and didn&#x27;t have the same problem ...</li>
            <li> I have very long hair with lots of body.  </li>
            <li> I saw this one and like that it provided protection for dry, damaged hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was shiny without putting the Organix Awapuhi dry oil in my hair.</li>
            <li> This also seems to have helped ease my dry scalp.  </li>
            <li> and I have never used a single OGX shampoo/conditioner that I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> so I switched back to my previous shampoo.</li>
            <li> first few times I used the shampoo I did experience the \\&quot;tangled\\&quot; hair, especially where the damage was the worse, but after I used the conditioner that was not a problem.</li>
            <li> My bathtub does seem a bit more slippery, but it&#x27;s a bad trade off.  </li>
            <li> I have been using OGX products for roughly a three months now.</li>
            <li> Even if I go to sleep with it wet no tangles in the morning</li>
            <li> My hair is smoother, not as dry and less</li>
            <li> I use it every other day when my hair is damp after washing.</li>
            <li> Also wary to try any of the other shampoos in this line, now ... pretty freaky.</li>
            <li> The other formulas just didn&#x27;t do all that for my hair.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to trying other organix products.</li>
            <li> but because shampoo is rinsed away, I&#x27;m hard pressed to think that any oil actually makes it through the water barrier and penetrates the hair shaft.</li>
            <li> so I look for something that&#x27;s a LITTLE heavier than other products, but not quite to this extent.</li>
            <li> In fact, after each use of the shampoo and conditioner, the tangled hair was less an issue.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> like must wash everyday oily, no exceptions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I usually get their shampoos and conditioners.  </li>
            <li> I reserved reporting my negative reactions to this product</li>
            <li> For the record, I have incredibly thick hair</li>
            <li> Disappointed that this product leads you to believe it&#x27;s organic when it has Red 33 in it and just says &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; which means the fragrant oils are probably synthetically made in a lab.</li>
            <li> Only used a couple of times, no great results, but it&#x27;s not like it was an awful product.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad product, but it&#x27;s VERY heavy.</li>
            <li> However, everywhere I went the Moroccan Oil products were either sold out or too expensive.</li>
            <li> disappointed me.</li>
            <li> Within 24 hours I was sadly reminded of the horrible scabing and itching it made all over my scalp.  </li>
            <li> Truly horrible.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> My hair has never been as silky and smooth.  Love the smells too, intoxicating!</li>
            <li> It is a good product for wavy hair, I recommend the conditioner as well.</li>
            <li> First off everyone and their hair is different so just for a clearer understanding I have thin and VERY oily hair like must wash everyday oily, no exceptions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair before using this product?&lt;br /&gt;Brittle&lt;br /&gt;Like a billion split ends&lt;br /&gt;Frizzy and just ugly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After?&lt;br /&gt;SOFT!&lt;br /&gt;Zero frizz!&lt;br /&gt;Tamed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes it literally feels like my hair is too soft. But don&#x27;t expect results until two weeks! At least that&#x27;s when I started loving my hair. This product is amazing at mending very damaged hair. I dye my hair quite a bit and use a flat iron religiously and while using this product you would never be able to tell. It also helped my hair grow by reducing the dead/split ends dramatically. The only issue someone should have is your hair my become to soft to style in certain ways, but is that really something to complain about?&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Put in the time and some TLC and I dare you to say your hair hasn&#x27;t improved.</li>
            <li> I bought this particular line from Ulta a little over a week ago. My hair was beyond damaged from dying and straightening constantly. I tried the hair mask first and I couldn&#x27;t believe how amazing it felt the next day after the first use. I bought the oil, too. I use it every other day when my hair is damp after washing. It leaves my hair soft and it feels moisturized without being \\&quot;oily\\&quot;. Like I said, it&#x27;s been just over a week and if you felt my hair now, you would notice instantly the softness and added shine! I thoroughly recommend this line. :)</li>
            <li> Bought this not too long ago I noticed a difference in my hair THE FIRST DAY I USED IT. Not even lying. This stuff is worth it. I never have tangles and I have long hair to the middle of my back. Its curly and hard to tame most of the time. I also have highlights so I bleach my hair and my hair has never felt more amazing. I&#x27;ve used probably every hair product you can think of, even the ones at my salon. THIS IS WORTH THE MONEY. I recommend any of OGX products to everyone who asks about my hair!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it, it is very drying for my hair. I like the conditioner but shampoo disappointed me.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad product, but it&#x27;s VERY heavy. I&#x27;ve found that using it once a week as a mask is better than daily use. The smell is wonderful and tropic-like; what I don&#x27;t like about it is the heavy residue it leaves behind. I suggest making absolutely sure that you&#x27;ve rinsed it really well, because if you don&#x27;t by the end of the day (for me at least) my hair looks like it hasn&#x27;t been washed the entire week. It will make your hair REALLY silky and soft, I just can&#x27;t deal with the heaviness of it. For the record, I have incredibly thick hair so I look for something that&#x27;s a LITTLE heavier than other products, but not quite to this extent.</li>
            <li> Love this! It smells really good and it lasted me a long time, plus it was a little cheaper than it would have been in the store!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair very soft. Conditions great. I like this shampoo and conditioner for my color treated hair. This is my fave scent of the organix brand.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both love these shampoos and conditioners. They smell wonderful and we feel like we&#x27;re doing something really good for our hair without spending a fortune. It&#x27;s also nice that we can have them auto shipped with the subscribe and save shipments; that also reduces our cost.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this shampoo, my hair just clumped into one big chunk after rinsing and there was no way I would be able to detangle unless I follow up with conditioner. I have normal, considerably healthy hair that&#x27;s low maintenance. I used this product for about 2 weeks hoping my hair just need to adjust but then my hair started falling out... so I switched back to my previous shampoo. I love the mild scent and really wanted to like this product but it just didn&#x27;t work out well for me.</li>
            <li> Have thin, fine, soft hair that tangles and frizzes easily. Read the reviews and decided to try this. It&#x27;s fabulous! My hair feels thicker, it&#x27;s controlled and looks great. Bought a quantity and have shared with my niece, who has the same genes. My husband, who has great hair, tried it too, and he loves it also.</li>
            <li> Does not smell close to Paul Michells Awapuhi Ginger shampoo or conditioner set, otherwise it is an ok shampoo to use.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, but the smell doesn&#x27;t last all day like my other shampoos.</li>
            <li> Bought it along with the conditioner &amp; instant repair mask. Only used a couple of times, no great results, but it&#x27;s not like it was an awful product.</li>
            <li> Like I said in the review of this shampoos matching conditioner, I have baby fine straight hair and I have never used a single OGX shampoo/conditioner that I didn&#x27;t like. No matter which one I use my hair always looks and feels great. Love this brand.</li>
            <li> I have been using OGX products for roughly a three months now. I have tried several things from shampoo/conditioners to their after care products. I love this line. I have extremely thick/color treated/curly hair and this line keeps my hair looking super soft and shiny. My local Walmart started carrying this line and I buy my products from there now! Cheapest place I have found them yet!</li>
            <li> I like Organix as a company so I usually get their shampoos and conditioners.  This scent was different and does a great job of smoothing my thick almost straight hair.</li>
            <li> I love that Organix never uses sulfates.  I found out I&#x27;m allergic to them some years ago, but never thought about my hair products.  My scalp no longer screams every time I wash my hair.  My bathtub does seem a bit more slippery, but it&#x27;s a bad trade off.  I love the smell, the silky feeling of my hair, and that I can get it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> WORKS! And smells like yummy flowers &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this shampoo twice but it has left my hair incredibly soft/shiny.  I was using the moraccan oil version as well, which worked great, but this one was better.  I have naturally straight fine hair, but it is course, and I have a ton of it.  This gave my hair second day shine on the first day as well.</li>
            <li> Not long after I started using this shampoo (and the accompanying conditioner), my hair started coming out - like twenty strands each time I ran my hand through my hair. Then yesterday my scalp was burning all day. I bought a coal tar shampoo to remove buildup from this shampoo and conditioner and it seems to have helped ... I have used other shampoos by this company (the coconut one and the tea tree oil one) and didn&#x27;t have the same problem ... it was just something about this ginger one, I think. I&#x27;m going to quit using it and see if it helps my hair. Also wary to try any of the other shampoos in this line, now ... pretty freaky.</li>
            <li> Disappointed that this product leads you to believe it&#x27;s organic when it has Red 33 in it and just says &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; which means the fragrant oils are probably synthetically made in a lab. Oh well.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is absolutely amazing. It smells great and works just as wonderfully. Actually all organix products  are phenomenal, no lie.</li>
            <li> I could actually feel my hair getting healthier after one wash. It feels silky &amp; more hydrated, but not greasy.</li>
            <li> My hair is color treated and therefore I need a sulfate free shampoo to protect it.  This line of shampoo works great and I&#x27;ve tried several different formulas and all of them have been excellent.  They smell great and are thick and rich ( the sea moisture formula smells the best IMHO).  Unlike other sulfate free shampoos, it doesn&#x27;t take a ton of shampoo to make a decent lather with the Organix shampoos.  Consequently, there are more uses to the bottle. I don&#x27;t use the companion conditioner however.  I need more \\&quot;slip\\&quot; in order to detangle my hair so I use the Pantene 2 minute mask every time I shampoo (it&#x27;s really good and cheap).  The Organix conditioner is simply too thin to do the job, as are most regular conditioners.  That being said, however, this shampoo is really nice and it&#x27;s not too expensive.  I stock up when it goes on sale in the drugstore/grocery store.  Sometimes, you can even buy a bigger bottle for the same price. I haven&#x27;t noticed whether or not it moisturizes my hair.  I really prefer the formulas that contain oil of some kind because with long hair, dryness is a constant concern.  I got this in a bigger bottle and I&#x27;m now almost at the end of it.  I will continue to use Organix shampoos because it&#x27;s a good brand and is far less expensive than salon products and does the exact same thing.  I&#x27;m not one of those who believes that a shampoo can smooth frizz, add volume or prevent breakage.  It simply isn&#x27;t possible and the role of a shampoo is to cleanse the hair.  The addition of oil (I always make sure oil appears in the ingredients list) will help prevent static and likely adds some lipids but because shampoo is rinsed away, I&#x27;m hard pressed to think that any oil actually makes it through the water barrier and penetrates the hair shaft. But I do know that a sulfate free shampoo is much gentler to color treated hair and many people are sensitive to sulfates.  I use a considerable amount of hairspray and wash my hair 2 to 3 times a week so there&#x27;s considerable buildup.  I&#x27;m pretty sure (but not positive) that this shampoo gets rid of that buildup and I pay particular attention to lathering up the lengths and giving them a gentle scrub, as my stylist is fond of doing.  This particular formula doesn&#x27;t smell as strong as nice as some of the others, but it is a pleasant fragrance nonetheless. I&#x27;m glad I discovered this shampoo and I highly recommend it.considerable buildup.

            <li> This product was delivered on time, and my oh my am I glad it did.  I love the exotic, floral scent of this shampoo as well as its amazing hydrating qualities.  I have pretty sun-damaged, dry hair, but this shampoo makes my hair soft and hydrated, even before I condition.  Organix products are sulfate-free, and it really makes a difference.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND :)</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful. ..works great!</li>
            <li> Love the way this smells and works great with the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I gave Organix Ginger shampoo a high rating because it smells good, I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and its bringing my hair back to life. I really like the shape of the bottle :)&lt;br /&gt;*I would recommend  this product to all my friends and family.*</li>
            <li> This was on sale at my local supermarket it sounded so good. I found it on Amazon and noticed the price was better and the reviews were all very good. When I ordered it, along with the conditioner, I didn&#x27;t notice it was for coarse hair that needed straightening, I was too busy imagining the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived yesterday, I gave it a try. I have very fine hair that is completely straight. It certainly did what it was meant to do, it left my hair looking flatter than usual, but it really smelled good!</li>
            <li> Gentle, smells good, cleans hair. Sulfate-free. Not sure what else to say about this particular product. Good price, good product.</li>
            <li> First I was looking for something that wasn&#x27;t greasy to use in my fried hair (as a result of multiple colorings, coloring back, and straightening to my bangs). I was also looking for something to bring out my natural curls without again, looking greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stood in the aisle at Target comparing multiple things and settled on this product. After the first day of use I am totally impressed. Not only does it smell great, but I can use it at night after getting out of the shower (applying to damp hair) and again in the morning to tame some frizz and as a touch up; no greasy residue from using 2x/day! My hair is so much softer and more manageable and it looks great all day long. You would never know my hair was fried just by using this product. I haven&#x27;t tried other Organix products, but after using this I will be sure to try others in the future. I strongly recommend this product to any girl who needs to soften their hair or bring out their curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus, I have acne prone skin and my face has not suffered as a result of this product.</li>
            <li> The best products!! amazing price and they do work! I have purchased lots of Organix products and they are all incredible! and the smell is just amazing as well!</li>
            <li> I have used these 2 products for almost a month. My hair is in much better condition than prior use. My hair is smoother, not as dry and less frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;The first few times I used the shampoo I did experience the \\&quot;tangled\\&quot; hair, especially where the damage was the worse, but after I used the conditioner that was not a problem. In fact, after each use of the shampoo and conditioner, the tangled hair was less an issue.&lt;br /&gt;I do plan on purchasing Organix next time.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B006I336FO Organix Shampoo, Repairing Awapuhi Ginger 13 fl oz (385 ml)]][[ASIN:B008CYGTEM Organix Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Shampoo-13 oz (Quantity of 3)]]</li>
            <li> For all those people who have ever had a \\&quot;hairdresser\\&quot; fry your hair with chemicals i would recommend this for you. the smell is wonderful and after some \\&quot;hairdresser\\&quot; who claimed she had been doing this for years (she just came out of school i found out) i used this stuff in hope of not having to cut my hair off. i still had to cut it but this stuff made my hair feel so soft and it smelled wonderful. it helped with breakage.</li>
            <li> I actually was recommended to use the Organix Moroccan Oil products to get the frizz out of my wavy Malayasian hair extensions. However, everywhere I went the Moroccan Oil products were either sold out or too expensive. I saw this one and like that it provided protection for dry, damaged hair. I washed my hair and conditioned my hair with this product. My extensions and leave out we&#x27;re unbelievably soft and frizz free. My hair was shiny without putting the Organix Awapuhi dry oil in my hair. My hair was so bouncy and silky when I flat ironed it, and my dry scalp felt really refreshed and my flakes were all gone. Originally, I purchased this product just for my extensions but now I want to use this product for my natural hair. The smell of these products are unique...between a grape and a floral scent. Absolutely love these products.</li>
            <li> Talk about a glass slipper! I&#x27;ve been on a OGX kick because of their amazing scents and fair prices. The other formulas just didn&#x27;t do all that for my hair. Lo and behold came this Awapuhi Ginger in the mail... Reminded me of back in the day when I would steal a bit of my mom&#x27;s Nexxus or Paul Mitchell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is cleaner longer (honestly, it still looks super shiny even 12 hrs after washing), my tangles and frizzies are way more under control, and there is a major reduction in split ends. This also seems to have helped ease my dry scalp.  Great shampoo and conditioner, great price, delivers on promises... This is DEFINITELY a keeper on my s&amp;s list!</li>
            <li> I reserved reporting my negative reactions to this product months ago incase it was something else and just a coincidence... however I had put the product away and over the many months forgot about it.  Then just a week ago I had run out of shampoo and did the desperate search through the cupboard and found it and tried once more.  Within 24 hours I was sadly reminded of the horrible scabing and itching it made all over my scalp.  Truly horrible.  I am not sensitive at all and have been subjected to harsh products probably more than the average person. So whatever is really is suspect...  in the bin it goes.</li>
            <li> I have no idea of this shampoo makes much difference for my hair, but I loooove it. Smells great.</li>
            <li> I have the most unmanageable dry/ frizzy hair and even after the first use I could tell my hair was noticeably softer and less frizzy . Looking forward to trying other organix products.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo for thick dry hair. I love how my hair feels and looks. Doesn&#x27;t break the bank to have nice hair!</li>
            <li> Smells great! Works great!</li>
            <li> I have very long hair with lots of body.  I have never had hair this easy to manage.  Its so soft smooth and doesn&#x27;t tangle anymore.  Even if I go to sleep with it wet no tangles in the morning and did I mention how soft it is.  I love this conditioner and so will you!</li>
