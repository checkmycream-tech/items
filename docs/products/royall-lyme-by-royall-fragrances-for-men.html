    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Great product!  </li>
            <li>Affordable price for the perfect gift- giving the person just what they want and can&#x27;t seem to find (or afford) for themselves!  </li>
            <li>It is still a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>Great stuff!</li>
            <li>They all make me feel great!</li>
            <li>Best cologne I have come accros.</li>
            <li>My father introduced me to this product and it&#x27;s the best</li>
            <li>Very nice fragrance for the husband!</li>
            <li>Great product, great price!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a formal scent - it is eminently pleasant, informal, and delicious.</li>
            <li>I like everything about Royall Lyme from its soothing splash on effect and citrous scent to its great bottle, labeling and packaging.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great fragrance for the collector and enthusiast.</li>
            <li>Great product have used for years.</li>
            <li>This one was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>Best fragrance available</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve loved Royall Lyme for decades.  </li>
            <li>Good ones anyway.</li>
            <li>Nothing this good could be an also-ran.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Excellent lime fragrance but never over powering or sweet.  </li>
            <li>Although my husband likes it and the scent is very appealing</li>
            <li>Have not been able to find for years!</li>
            <li>Love the scent on him!</li>
            <li>Was so pleased with this fragrance!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>We love them!</li>
            <li>(afew drops in warm water will do it)for sponge bathing when I don&#x27;t have time for a shower or just want to &#x27;freshen up&#x27;.</li>
            <li>The lime doesn&#x27;t go away, but it lands in a bed of warm florals and greenery.</li>
            <li>Nice can&#x27;t find this everywhere</li>
            <li>excellent product, decent (comparatively) price,</li>
            <li>I enjoy anything that is well put together, smells pleasant, and has acceptable longevity.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten hooked on this refreshing after-shave lotion and use it summer and winter.</li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>I must tell you, I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>So, if you like lime, a manly fragrance, and a refreshing invigoration, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li>I love aquas, chypres, florals, fougeres, oudhs, attars, orientals.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Royall Lyme is my latest &amp;#34;great find&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Finally, the presentation is excellent, with the paper-wrapped, wax-sealed box, a substantial bottle and cast metal cap.</li>
            <li>He told me he selected the Royall Lyme for me because he knew I would appreciate it more than my brothers would.</li>
            <li>Elegant.  </li>
            <li>I have tried all but two and each one is exquisite, high-quality EDP-strength fragrance, erring on the side of potent, natural, and unique.</li>
            <li>And it has a refreshing, unique fragrance, too!</li>
            <li>(But, if someone finds a stash of the original Bermuda blend, please let me know!)</li>
            <li>Everything came nicely packaged, it arrived quickly and in time for our anniversary.</li>
            <li>Other then that it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>A splash of Royall Lyme brings back so many great memories of Bermuda.</li>
            <li>He likes the refreshing lime fragrance because it is not too sweet.</li>
            <li>Great price as I am a regular user!</li>
            <li>I enjoy the that fragrance can be used as after shave, cologne..</li>
            <li>Light.  </li>
            <li>The product itself is high quality, refreshing, 1st class!</li>
            <li>And it is VERY compelling.</li>
            <li>This has been on my bathroom counter since I was in High School, this is just a great refreshing sent that is like no other.</li>
            <li>All-Purpose Lotion is made in the USA and not in Bermuda, as was the original lotion.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give these a &amp;#34;very good&amp;#34; rating and will happily keep them in my wardrobe indefinitely, as long as they are in production when a bottle runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li>: I&#x27;m a middle-aged professional man, father, who enjoys a nice wardrobe, including fragrances.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I wouldn&#x27;t quite put them in my top-25, they are all solid second-tier fragrances, because they are all GOOD.</li>
            <li>Other than that very pleased!</li>
            <li>Bought this for my husband on our honeymoon in Bermuda...loved the clean fresh scent....</li>
            <li>Fell in love with this product a long time ago...Have been searching for it many years.</li>
            <li>Many thanks for fast delivery of this gift for dear friend out of state.</li>
            <li>Nothing like Royall Lyme to cool you off on a hot day.  </li>
            <li>Fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li>I have used the lyme, mandarine and even some of the more masculine lotions  </li>
            <li>It is not over powering but just right.  </li>
            <li>As I said, it&#x27;s not among my &amp;#34;top 25&amp;#34;, most unique fragrances, but they&#x27;re not far off that mark.</li>
            <li>Mt husband used to use this when we were first dating.</li>
            <li>Scent last a longer time than most fragrances I have purchased.</li>
            <li>It is always delivered as promised, is consistent in packaging and scent.  </li>
            <li>Sillage for that first half-hour to hour is stellar.</li>
            <li>My relationship with Royall Lyme started many years ago in the Bahamas when my Dad gave my brothers and me a different bottle each of a Royall fragrance.</li>
            <li>To this day, 30+ years later, I still use it and love it.</li>
            <li>Family and friends noticed scent and gave me positive comments.</li>
            <li>Everything about this fragrance demands that you take it seriously; and that, I found to be a pleasant surprise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&#x27;cause I do - and my wife does.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, as other reviewers have noted, the latest version of the Royall Lyme</li>
            <li>The fragrance really projects loudly, in a way few even very potent fragrances do.</li>
            <li>Licensed to be made in the US at half the price, and it&#x27;s OK --</li>
            <li>The high end</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a step up from Old Spice but not as much as I hoped for.</li>
            <li>Royall Lyme is refreshing, long lasting and can be renewed at the end of a busy day by gently splashing your face with water.</li>
            <li>Enjoyed fragrance enough that I immediately ordered a second bottle to have one on hand for when first bottle gets empty.</li>
            <li>Stellar reviews from laypersons like myself made it seem solid, but I&#x27;ve tried bottles of &amp;#34;aftershave&amp;#34; fragrances and been stung.</li>
            <li>All the above items were exactly what I ordered.  </li>
            <li>Even when applied to fabric, it really only gives you 2 to 4 hours depending on your level of activity, and towards the tail end of that period, it&#x27;s nowhere near as complex and enjoyable as it is for the first half-hour or hour.</li>
            <li>Masculine fragrence.</li>
            <li>All-Purpose Lotion is different, and I don&#x27;t really care if anyone else likes the way I smell,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrances and they often give me headaches.</li>
            <li>I despise cloying fragrances, especially artificial ones, cheap, synthetic &amp;#34;woods and spices&amp;#34; types (astringent old-man smells), and many &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; fragrances for lack of a better term, based on cinnamon, cardamom, amber.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got a soft spot for Ferrari, Franck Olivier, Succes de Paris, Kenzo and Issey Miyake just like I do for Montale, Maitre Parfumeur et Gantier, Creed and L&#x27;Artisan Parfumeur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You made it all possible and come highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Royall Lyme itself: the open is a top-quality blast of freshly cut green lime, pure citrus.</li>
            <li>I tend to peck around and try some new perfumer from time to time, a handful at a time, and this was no different.</li>
            <li>men&#x27;s clothing stores that sell it are frequently out, especially before any present-giving time!&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li>Deodorants are a must, but not so much with other scents.  </li>
            <li>My collection is considerable, numbering in &#x27;several hundreds&#x27; - approaching 500, though I haven&#x27;t counted in some time.</li>

            <li> it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Within 20-40 minutes of applying it, it hardly leaves much of a fragrance.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want to smell like all the other men wearing gosh knows what try this for a different morning glow</li>
            <li> I say unfortunately, because this scent is not as citrusy and it&#x27;s also not as long-lasting as the original version.&lt;br /&gt;Still</li>
            <li> I have read other reviews that since this is now made in USA, its not as lasting or pungent as the liquid poured in the Islands-I agree-it must be the water.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;west Indian lime&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s a south american / caribbean big ripe green juicy citrus lime.</li>
            <li> My husband order this based on the great reviews, but I think it&#x27;s awful!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually not much for men&#x27;s colognes and women&#x27;s perfumes anyway.  </li>
            <li> Royall fragrances are absolutely not that.</li>
            <li> They are NOT the same fragrances; it&#x27;s only that element of a dirty, fresh, crushed green vegetation accord underlying whatever else they have going on.</li>
            <li> They are clearly to be taken seriously and leave nothing but longevity to be desired.</li>
            <li> It is thankfully not sweet at all, yet avoids being bitter or astringent.</li>
            <li> Now that they have licensed it to other manufacturers in the US, the price has come down to reality.</li>
            <li> The longevity lacks a little bit here, as it does in each of the Royall fragrances I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> When I checked the \\&quot;duty free\\&quot; and department stores, there was no comparison to Amazon, who was half the price!</li>
            <li> Amazon, I can find it, it is less expensive than in the local men&#x27;s stores, and I receive it promptly.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t</li>
            <li> What it dries down to has some floral and a lot of green, &#x27;dirty&#x27; vegetation, with a theme I followed in Maitre Parfumeur et Gantier&#x27;s &amp;#34;Baime&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using Royall Lyme for 30 years, and it is difficult to find.</li>
            <li> The 4oz bottles from Brooks Brothers are over three times as expensive per oz, by the time you pay tax and</li>

            <li> Mt husband used to use this when we were first dating. Have not been able to find for years! Love the scent on him!</li>
            <li> Great product!  One of my husband&#x27;s favorites.</li>
            <li> My husband order this based on the great reviews, but I think it&#x27;s awful! It smells like a cleaning product...not cologne! And now we&#x27;re stuck with it. I&#x27;m thinking we can regift it for his parents&#x27; dog!</li>
            <li> Many thanks for fast delivery of this gift for dear friend out of state. Affordable price for the perfect gift- giving the person just what they want and can&#x27;t seem to find (or afford) for themselves!  You made it all possible and come highly recommended.  The product itself is high quality, refreshing, 1st class!</li>
            <li> Great price as I am a regular user!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband on our honeymoon in Bermuda...loved the clean fresh scent....49 years later I purchased for  our anniversary.  (Of course he purchased it again over the years.  It is still a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Not same as fagrance produced in Bermuda in 60s</li>
            <li> Great product, great price!</li>
            <li> Nothing like Royall Lyme to cool you off on a hot day.  And it has a refreshing, unique fragrance, too!</li>
            <li> Enjoyed fragrance enough that I immediately ordered a second bottle to have one on hand for when first bottle gets empty. Delivery times were satisfactory. I enjoy the that fragrance can be used as after shave, cologne.. Scent last a longer time than most fragrances I have purchased. Family and friends noticed scent and gave me positive comments.</li>
            <li> Not the same as the cologne made in Bermuda.  Licensed to be made in the US at half the price, and it&#x27;s OK -- but it&#x27;s not the same stuff.</li>
            <li> Best fragrance available</li>
            <li> This has been on my bathroom counter since I was in High School, this is just a great refreshing sent that is like no other. It is not over powering but just right.  If you don&#x27;t want to smell like all the other men wearing gosh knows what try this for a different morning glow</li>
            <li> Masculine fragrence. My wife likes it. reat for after a shave, and as a body lotion after a shower. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> Very nice fragrance for the husband!</li>
            <li> My title is not personal, it&#x27;s referring to the cologne.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve loved Royall Lyme for decades.  I&#x27;m actually not much for men&#x27;s colognes and women&#x27;s perfumes anyway.  Deodorants are a must, but not so much with other scents.  This Royall Lyme All-Purpose Lotion is different, and I don&#x27;t really care if anyone else likes the way I smell, &#x27;cause I do - and my wife does.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, as other reviewers have noted, the latest version of the Royall Lyme All-Purpose Lotion is made in the USA and not in Bermuda, as was the original lotion.  I say unfortunately, because this scent is not as citrusy and it&#x27;s also not as long-lasting as the original version.&lt;br /&gt;Still, it&#x27;s close enough to what I like.  (But, if someone finds a stash of the original Bermuda blend, please let me know!)</li>
            <li> I like everything about Royall Lyme from its soothing splash on effect and citrous scent to its great bottle, labeling and packaging.</li>
            <li> Was so pleased with this fragrance! I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrances and they often give me headaches. This one was a pleasant surprise. Love it!</li>
            <li> My husband has been using Royall Lyme for 30 years, and it is difficult to find. The high end men&#x27;s clothing stores that sell it are frequently out, especially before any present-giving time!&lt;br /&gt;On Amazon, I can find it, it is less expensive than in the local men&#x27;s stores, and I receive it promptly.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten hooked on this refreshing after-shave lotion and use it summer and winter. It&#x27;s not overpowering like some I&#x27;ve used but retains a hint of lime all day.</li>
            <li> Fell in love with this product a long time ago...Have been searching for it many years. Glad&lt;br /&gt; I found a source</li>
            <li> A splash of Royall Lyme brings back so many great memories of Bermuda. Now that they have licensed it to other manufacturers in the US, the price has come down to reality.</li>
            <li> I must tell you, I LOVE this product. It is always delivered as promised, is consistent in packaging and scent.  I have ordered over a dozen bottles over 5 years... My personal preference. So, if you like lime, a manly fragrance, and a refreshing invigoration, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> I like fragrances with a citrus quality and this is it. Excellent lime fragrance but never over powering or sweet.  And I have ordered additional bottles.</li>
            <li> I have a friend who wanted this item as a gift and asked me to look for it on a recent Caribbean cruise. When I checked the \\&quot;duty free\\&quot; and department stores, there was no comparison to Amazon, who was half the price!</li>
            <li> Fresh fragrance. A big hit as a gift!</li>
            <li> My husband and I received a basket of these. We love them! I have used the lyme, mandarine and even some of the more masculine lotions  (afew drops in warm water will do it)for sponge bathing when I don&#x27;t have time for a shower or just want to &#x27;freshen up&#x27;. They all make me feel great! It even makes the bathroom smell divine.</li>
            <li> as always...refreshing and soothing...</li>
            <li> A brief blurb to place my fragrance sensibilities: I&#x27;m a middle-aged professional man, father, who enjoys a nice wardrobe, including fragrances. My collection is considerable, numbering in &#x27;several hundreds&#x27; - approaching 500, though I haven&#x27;t counted in some time. I enjoy anything that is well put together, smells pleasant, and has acceptable longevity. I despise cloying fragrances, especially artificial ones, cheap, synthetic &amp;#34;woods and spices&amp;#34; types (astringent old-man smells), and many &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; fragrances for lack of a better term, based on cinnamon, cardamom, amber. Things often called &amp;#34;Desire&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Night&amp;#34;. I love aquas, chypres, florals, fougeres, oudhs, attars, orientals. Good ones anyway. And I&#x27;m not snobby about it; some of my top-25 are designer fragrances in the &amp;#60;$50 range. I&#x27;ve got a soft spot for Ferrari, Franck Olivier, Succes de Paris, Kenzo and Issey Miyake just like I do for Montale, Maitre Parfumeur et Gantier, Creed and L&#x27;Artisan Parfumeur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Royall Lyme is my latest &amp;#34;great find&amp;#34;. I tend to peck around and try some new perfumer from time to time, a handful at a time, and this was no different. Stellar reviews from laypersons like myself made it seem solid, but I&#x27;ve tried bottles of &amp;#34;aftershave&amp;#34; fragrances and been stung. Royall fragrances are absolutely not that. I have tried all but two and each one is exquisite, high-quality EDP-strength fragrance, erring on the side of potent, natural, and unique. They are, as I discovered after I had tried five of them, the Brooks Brothers &amp;#34;signature&amp;#34; perfume house, and it shows. Nothing this good could be an also-ran.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I wouldn&#x27;t quite put them in my top-25, they are all solid second-tier fragrances, because they are all GOOD. I can&#x27;t say enough, high-quality and distinguished. And, the price is unbeatable; value is indisputable when you&#x27;re into these 8oz bottles. The 4oz bottles from Brooks Brothers are over three times as expensive per oz, by the time you pay tax and shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Royall Lyme itself: the open is a top-quality blast of freshly cut green lime, pure citrus. It&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;west Indian lime&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s a south american / caribbean big ripe green juicy citrus lime. And it is VERY compelling. What it dries down to has some floral and a lot of green, &#x27;dirty&#x27; vegetation, with a theme I followed in Maitre Parfumeur et Gantier&#x27;s &amp;#34;Baime&amp;#34;. They are NOT the same fragrances; it&#x27;s only that element of a dirty, fresh, crushed green vegetation accord underlying whatever else they have going on. The lime doesn&#x27;t go away, but it lands in a bed of warm florals and greenery. It&#x27;s not a formal scent - it is eminently pleasant, informal, and delicious. It is thankfully not sweet at all, yet avoids being bitter or astringent. The longevity lacks a little bit here, as it does in each of the Royall fragrances I&#x27;ve tried. Even when applied to fabric, it really only gives you 2 to 4 hours depending on your level of activity, and towards the tail end of that period, it&#x27;s nowhere near as complex and enjoyable as it is for the first half-hour or hour. Sillage for that first half-hour to hour is stellar. The fragrance really projects loudly, in a way few even very potent fragrances do. Finally, the presentation is excellent, with the paper-wrapped, wax-sealed box, a substantial bottle and cast metal cap. Everything about this fragrance demands that you take it seriously; and that, I found to be a pleasant surprise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great fragrance for the collector and enthusiast. As I said, it&#x27;s not among my &amp;#34;top 25&amp;#34;, most unique fragrances, but they&#x27;re not far off that mark. They are clearly to be taken seriously and leave nothing but longevity to be desired. I&#x27;d give these a &amp;#34;very good&amp;#34; rating and will happily keep them in my wardrobe indefinitely, as long as they are in production when a bottle runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> My relationship with Royall Lyme started many years ago in the Bahamas when my Dad gave my brothers and me a different bottle each of a Royall fragrance. He told me he selected the Royall Lyme for me because he knew I would appreciate it more than my brothers would. To this day, 30+ years later, I still use it and love it. Well-balanced.  Elegant.  Light.  Can be worn day or evening, year-round.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a step up from Old Spice but not as much as I hoped for. I have read other reviews that since this is now made in USA, its not as lasting or pungent as the liquid poured in the Islands-I agree-it must be the water.</li>
            <li> Nice can&#x27;t find this everywhere and I like it</li>
            <li> excellent product, decent (comparatively) price, service per this seller acceptable (well wrapped in transport)</li>
            <li> Everything came nicely packaged, it arrived quickly and in time for our anniversary. Although my husband likes it and the scent is very appealing it doesn&#x27;t last very long. Within 20-40 minutes of applying it, it hardly leaves much of a fragrance. Other than that very pleased!</li>
            <li> Royall Lyme is refreshing, long lasting and can be renewed at the end of a busy day by gently splashing your face with water.</li>
            <li> Have used for 50 years! Only dislike is that it is now produced in USA and not Bermuda! Other then that it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> All the above items were exactly what I ordered.  They met all my expectations.</li>
            <li> My husband has worn Royall Lyme for about 30 years ad he doesn&#x27;t want to wear anything else.  He likes the refreshing lime fragrance because it is not too sweet.</li>
            <li> Great product have used for years. Best cologne I have come accros. My father introduced me to this product and it&#x27;s the best</li>
