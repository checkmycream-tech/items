    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for a while now, works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used, I tried so many other product but estee lauder is hard to surpass.</li>
            <li> Just started using it but my skin feels and looks better for short time using.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel like velvet. However, I rated it three stars because of the way my skin feels, but it has not improved the wrinkles. Glad I did not buy the regular size. I don&#x27;t think I will order again!</li>
            <li> Good but I can tell it&#x27;s not new. One of them was thicker than the others. It has been open for a long time.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price.</li>
            <li> A miracle cream if every I used one!!</li>
            <li> I have used Oil of Olay for many years and thought I would try Estee Lauders facial stuff and it is definately not worth the money.</li>
            <li> If you are like me and just cannot find any product for your facial skin care,  look no further.  Estee Lauder is a unique product that I found years ago. I have tried newer products that are now available, I always return to her. So, try a sample ifmonly for one week and you will see that you cannot go wrong.</li>
            <li> OK, so the total amount equals come of the larger containers. but just think about the big picture.... you will have to break the bottle in order to get all of the lotion out. And any lotion you leave in means you just threw away half your purchase price. literally.  Don&#x27;t bother with these little bottles at the price i bought them  $22 for three.</li>
            <li> I like it, but I want they have production year in 2014, you sent me product end of year 2012</li>
            <li> I swear by this product. Definitely notice a more smooth under eye area. A little goes a long way, also.</li>
            <li> With the amount that I paid for these 3 small bottles, I could have gotten 1 big one.  Plus, they plainly state NOT FOR RESALE on the bottles!!  I LOVE this product!!  Just wasn&#x27;t happy with the amount I paid or buying something that I shouldn&#x27;t have had to buy.  All I should have paid for is shipping.</li>
            <li> Its actually really nice and makes your skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> great stuff; mix with other products for full effect though!</li>
            <li> I ve used this product for about 30 years. I&#x27;ve never been disappointed</li>
            <li> LOVE!! Will definitely continue using!!</li>
            <li> I use it in the morning. Makes skin very smooth and helps make-up go on well. It does not cause break outs for me. I tend to have oily skin and this makes my skin soft without feeling greasy. I use it all over my face.</li>
            <li> The texture of the serum was more like a cream and was much thicker than normal. The product seemed old as if it had been sitting around for a while.  I would have returned it but didn&#x27;t have time around the holidays.</li>
            <li> These were actually give away samples (not for sale) and, as usual, did nothing special. Not enough  product for gainful use.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted ~ and the little bottles have a tiny wand that keeps me from using too much. Nothing will go to wast.</li>
            <li> I actually really like it and it makes your face fell soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I think I see good results</li>
            <li> Not buying it again. The bottels are so tiny, you have to use a quitip to get the serum out.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> use daily seeing a positive change in my skin</li>
            <li> This makes your skin really soft!</li>
            <li> I love this skin product. It makes my skin feel very soft. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Package came with 3 bottles as expected, seem to all be full and convenient for travel.  First one dropped out of my hands as I was unwrapping them and hit the hard floor without breaking, so that made me happy.</li>
