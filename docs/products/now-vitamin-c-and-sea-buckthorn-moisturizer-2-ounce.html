            <li>It does have a nice citrus smell, not too overwhelming.</li>

            <li>This smells lovely and works wonders on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Vitamin C rocks! :)</li>
            <li>Nice and light...</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>I LOVE, LOVE the ingredients of this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the smell - smells like grapefruit.</li>
            <li>:) here is a pic for size comparison</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>This is a great all-around lotion for the price</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do much to fade any spots though, good at moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this product, it smells like fresh oranges!  </li>
            <li>They also make my skin sweat and feel kind of hot.  </li>
            <li>This product moisturizes my face so wonderfully, without the heavy or oily residue, and it does not break me out.  </li>
            <li>It is the ONLY moisturizer that I&#x27;ve ever found that does not make me break out AND makes my skin look and feel great.</li>
            <li>Feels lightweight and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and makes my face feel smooth.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and feels really silky.</li>
            <li>The fresh fruity smell is an wonderful benefit, but the lotion is made of high quality ingredients and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy like some natural products</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and smells sweet and citrus-y.</li>
            <li>This absorbs nicely (I use two applications) and it doesn&#x27;t break out my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It leaves a mild matte feeling on the skin.</li>
            <li>Great cream, bought it based on previous reviews.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not full of poisons, just great ingredients to be put on your most sensitive skin each day.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced for a quality product that is paraben free.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it for me.</li>
            <li>But as I&#x27;ve gotten older (and my skin has aged accordingly), I&#x27;ve found that most oil free moisturizers don&#x27;t give my skin adequate hydration.</li>
            <li>This moisturizing lotion is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>And, I love that I only need to use a pea size to do the job.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more once this is all gone.</li>
            <li>I love Now Essential skin care products.</li>
            <li>Thanks NOW and Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>I was sceptical at first but have to say this really works.</li>
            <li>I purchased this moisturizer to reduce some of the dark spots on my face due to me picking at acne bumps, I have oily skin, so I wanted something that was effective but wouldn&amp;#34;t clog my pores and create more acne</li>
            <li>it will be really nice in the summer when my skin is a little oilier.</li>
            <li>whole family used the product for years.</li>
            <li>Really like the product.</li>
            <li>Very creamy but not greasy.</li>
            <li>It does moisturize really well.</li>
            <li>but you really don&#x27;t need a lot.</li>
            <li>but you dont need much at all.</li>
            <li>I have always had very sensitive skin, even being allergic to things labeled as \\&quot;hypo-allergenic.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>have combination skin prone to adult acne</li>
            <li>I like that it is made of natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have purchased it twice so far and will continue...</li>
            <li>It is a little pricey, but worth its weight in gold!</li>
            <li>I loved all the vitimin C creams, but this one is super creamy and less expensive.</li>
            <li>I am a medical professional and constantly washing my hands, which leaves them dry and cracked.</li>

            <li> I am a medical professional and constantly washing my hands, which leaves them dry and cracked.</li>
            <li> I only need a pea sized amount for my whole face so the small bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I gave this one a try on whim because on the back label, it lists &amp;#34;combination, or dry skin with minor color imbalances, dull appearance, or uneven tone, light scarring or imperfections cased by acne or other blemishes&amp;#34; as the conditions for which it works well.</li>
            <li> I like this moisturizer just as well as any of the others: cheap or expensive that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> its a little smaller</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything and this is the only product that works, quenches my face without any heavy creme feeling.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs really well, and leaves no greasy feeling behind.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used dozens of moisturizers and have had problems with them not absorbing.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This product is not good for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit smaller than I realized it would be (and yes I know 2 oz is small).</li>
            <li> Now I have an even, tan skin tone without nasty white/silver patches AND smooth, soft hands!</li>
            <li> I will also look at this brand for a moisturizer that has slight acid</li>
            <li> After about one week of use...one to two times a day..I noticed a change in the discolorations as they were getting lighter and less noticeable.</li>
            <li> A little dab of this cream is all you need.</li>
            <li> I am using NOW Foods Green Tea Pomegranate Night...</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years now.</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer for a few months now.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what has made difference.</li>
            <li> It goes away after a while and isn&#x27;t so unpleasant that I can&#x27;t live with it.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very difficult to deal with: combination dry/oily, sensitive, prone to hormonal and stress breakouts, sun damage, etc.</li>
            <li> My complaint is that it caused me to breakout.</li>
            <li> However, the fragrance smells like artificial tangerine candy mixed with plastic.</li>
            <li> It is a thick moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li> &quot; that is, not burning badly but somewhat of a feeling related to that.  </li>
            <li> Just bad experience with both the product and seller</li>
            <li> I also like knowing that this doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of nasty crap in it.</li>

            <li> This smells lovely and works wonders on my skin.  The fresh fruity smell is an wonderful benefit, but the lotion is made of high quality ingredients and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy like some natural products tend to be.</li>
            <li> Great product! Use it religiously and it works!</li>
            <li> This stuff rocks!! Used a lot of moisturizers no this one definitely takes the cake.</li>
            <li> Nice cream. Not sure what has made difference. I am using NOW Foods Green Tea Pomegranate Night...,Vitamin C &amp; Hyaluronic acid. And my skin does look lot better.&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin prone to adult acne and this does not cause any breakouts.</li>
            <li> This moisturizing lotion is exactly what I was looking for. It moisturizes without greasiness and without causing breakouts</li>
            <li> Great product from a great manufacturer from a great seller.</li>
            <li> Never had I had a facial moisturizer that did what it said it would do. This product moisturizes my face so wonderfully, without the heavy or oily residue, and it does not break me out.  I&#x27;ve tried everything and this is the only product that works, quenches my face without any heavy creme feeling.  And, I love that I only need to use a pea size to do the job.  Definitely worth it for me.</li>
            <li> Just started using this product, it goes on nicely with a mild citrus fragrance and is a good value, I would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I love this! It goes on smoothly and smells sweet and citrus-y. I like to use this along with a vitamin C serum and I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin has gotten softer as a result. Vitamin C rocks! :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this moisturizer to reduce some of the dark spots on my face due to me picking at acne bumps, I have oily skin, so I wanted something that was effective but wouldn&amp;#34;t clog my pores and create more acne, this is awesome, my skin is smoother and the spots are slowly lightning up, it smells awesome and I am thinking of purchasing the cleanser as well, but I will be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> This product is not good for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what the Company is thinking that every person has the same type of skin.They even changed the amount you&#x27;re getting for your money.&lt;br /&gt;We are being deceived once again.&lt;br /&gt;My whole family used the product for years. It&#x27;s amazing what it did for our skin.&lt;br /&gt;I will be looking for another product.</li>
            <li> Really like the product.</li>
            <li> Very creamy but not greasy. Nice and light...it will be really nice in the summer when my skin is a little oilier. A tube is always in my briefcase.</li>
            <li> Just bad experience with both the product and seller</li>

            <li> My skin is very difficult to deal with: combination dry/oily, sensitive, prone to hormonal and stress breakouts, sun damage, etc. For years, I&#x27;ve avoided all moisturizers with oil because they tended to make be break out. But as I&#x27;ve gotten older (and my skin has aged accordingly), I&#x27;ve found that most oil free moisturizers don&#x27;t give my skin adequate hydration. I gave this one a try on whim because on the back label, it lists &amp;#34;combination, or dry skin with minor color imbalances, dull appearance, or uneven tone, light scarring or imperfections cased by acne or other blemishes&amp;#34; as the conditions for which it works well. This product is amazing. It is the ONLY moisturizer that I&#x27;ve ever found that does not make me break out AND makes my skin look and feel great.</li>
            <li> This moisturizes moisturizes okay. It does its job. I don&#x27;t care for the citrus smell.</li>
            <li> It is a thick moisturizing cream. It does have a nice citrus smell, not too overwhelming. It does moisturize really well. I like that it is made of natural ingredients. My complaint is that it caused me to breakout.</li>
            <li> Smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave your face greasy.  Wish they had a bigger size but you really don&#x27;t need a lot.</li>
            <li> Great cream, bought it based on previous reviews.  i was looking for a vitamin c cream, and did not know that NOW brands carry it.  i take NOW supplements and know its quality.  This cream made my skin clearer and younger, without any side effects!  Vitamin C is the way to go, and this products meets my needs.  I will buy again for sure!  Thanks NOW and Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Feels lightweight and smooth.  I have noticed a difference in the feel and tone of my skin and it smell WONDERFUL.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years now. I like the fact that it is not greasy and does not make my face break out either.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as described, smells like citrus and lathers nicely. It didn&#x27;t do much to fade any spots though, good at moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Good product and excellent, fast-aborbing formula. However, the fragrance smells like artificial tangerine candy mixed with plastic. Gross.</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE the ingredients of this moisturizer. It&#x27;s a bit smaller than I realized it would be (and yes I know 2 oz is small). I will definitely be ordering more once this is all gone. I use this in the mornings and at night before bed. I LOVE the smell - smells like grapefruit. This moisturizer is not greasy and it does not clog your pores (something I always have an issue with). You also don&#x27;t need a lot  when applying. It goes on smooth and makes my face feel smooth. It leaves a mild matte feeling on the skin. I love that this is a really healthy moisturizer; my skin just drinks it up!</li>

            <li> I love this lotion.  It absorbs really well, and leaves no greasy feeling behind.  It seems to be doing wonders for my skin.  I will be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> wonderfully nourishing for the skin. I will buy it again. I will also look at this brand for a moisturizer that has slight acid</li>
            <li> I love Now Essential skin care products. They&#x27;re not full of poisons, just great ingredients to be put on your most sensitive skin each day. A little dab of this cream is all you need. It smells great, like an orange Vitamin C Lozenge. Yum.</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer for a few months now.  It has a nice creamy texture, not greasy, absorbs well, smells pleasant, and my skin looks very happy after using it. I also like knowing that this doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of nasty crap in it. A little goes a long way. I only need a pea sized amount for my whole face so the small bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought this at a health food store while looking to buy something to heal my hands and spend a $50 gift certIficate. I am a medical professional and constantly washing my hands, which leaves them dry and cracked. I also have psoriasis and embarrassing discolorations to my hands and arms. I purchased the 2 oz tube of moisturizer and noticed an immediate sense of softness and the soothing scent of citrus. After about one week of use...one to two times a day..I noticed a change in the discolorations as they were getting lighter and less noticeable. Now I have an even, tan skin tone without nasty white/silver patches AND smooth, soft hands! Since then I have started using it on my arms and cleaned out the health food store of their supply! It is a little pricey, but worth its weight in gold! My staff likes to use it too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used dozens of moisturizers and have had problems with them not absorbing. This absorbs nicely (I use two applications) and it doesn&#x27;t break out my sensitive skin. It smells nice and feels really silky.</li>
            <li> I was sceptical at first but have to say this really works. on the days I forget I notice I am a believer now.</li>
            <li> This is a great all-around lotion for the price but I&#x27;ve noticed that products with vitamin C tend to make my skin somewhat \\&quot;burny,\\&quot; that is, not burning badly but somewhat of a feeling related to that.  They also make my skin sweat and feel kind of hot.  It goes away after a while and isn&#x27;t so unpleasant that I can&#x27;t live with it.  Does anyone else experience this?  I have always had very sensitive skin, even being allergic to things labeled as \\&quot;hypo-allergenic.\\&quot;</li>
