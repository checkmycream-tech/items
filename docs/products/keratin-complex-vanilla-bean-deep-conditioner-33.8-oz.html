            <li>I have been using the conditioner for almost 5 years and it does a great job, smells good and creamily mositurizes your hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Either way, it is a great product for overstressed hair and if you can find it on-line for a good price</li>
            <li>I have heard that this conditioner was good but in my experience its great stuff.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product for my very bleached, flat-ironed and torchered hair!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>the shampoo also smelled this fantastic!!</li>
            <li>, so I immediately wash my hair, apply the vanilla bean conditioner (smells great - not too strong), and while I wash, shave etc.</li>
            <li>And the difference it made is amazing.</li>
            <li>I have a salon Keratin infusion, so this keeps it looking nice</li>
            <li>It is definitely more cost effective buying it this way.  </li>
            <li>, I know it is safe to use without stripping the Keratin out (</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Nice light fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I am happy with this product so far.  </li>
            <li>I like this product, it smells great and makes my hair feel soft.  </li>
            <li>The entire line is great to get salon results at home.</li>
            <li>Great regular conditioner as well.  </li>
            <li>It will rinse clean and take all the excess oil and dirt with it.</li>
            <li>And not only that,  it smells really good,  too.  </li>
            <li>Great price for such a large amount.</li>
            <li>I use it every few days and my ends look like I just had a trim and blend in beautifully.  </li>
            <li>but I have noticed some changes in my hair as far making a bit more manageable.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft healthy and moved like a weave.</li>
            <li>Well pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;I will probably purchase again from this vendor for future haircare needs as they seem to provide quality haircare products at very reasonable prices.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li>My granddaughters (16 yrs) looks much healthier and shinier!</li>
            <li>I have purchased this item before and was so glad to see it sold in a larger container.  </li>
            <li>I have used this conditioner for a couple of years, ever since I had my  first Keratin treatment.  </li>
            <li>It makes the treatment last for months, and my hair does so much better when I use keratin products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This leaves your hair soft, tangle free, shiny and smelling great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fantastic conditioner, thick and creamy with a nice vanilla scent.</li>
            <li>Once I did, it works fine, but it had me questioning my intelligence for several days.</li>
            <li>This stuff is very concentrated.  </li>
            <li>The product smelled like the real thing.</li>
            <li>So far no other sulfate free conditioner can do what this one does for my hair.  </li>
            <li>though I believe that applies mostly to shampoos that strip due to sulfates).&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I think I was able to use less.  </li>
            <li>After this experiment, I&#x27;ve decided that going to the store and dishing out the extra $$$ for the real product is worth the guarantee</li>
            <li>We recommend this to anyone with naturally curly hair, that they want to be straight and not frizzy.</li>
            <li>(I think I paid a little under $40 for the large 33oz size), than it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly care for the scent of vanilla in general, so I can&#x27;t take away from the effects of this product on my hair because of the smell.</li>
            <li>Great smelling and calms my crazy hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is clearly stronger after using this conditioner.</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair so soft an silky</li>
            <li>Definitely not the real thing.</li>
            <li>I tried other sulfate free conditioners for my keratin treated hair such as Loreal and Burt Bees</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for those of you with coarse or chemically treated hair.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what we expected.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if it is the legit Coppola brand or a knockoff with some of it&#x27;s product (as I have learned recently that many OTHER vendors do tamper with products), but so far it has really done well with my hair</li>
            <li>This thick product will produce a light lather once water is added, then massage it into your scalp and hair and leave on for the duration of your shower.</li>
            <li>And idk who the other customers got their product from but this specific amazon seller sent me the exact bottle pictured with name brand and all.</li>

            <li> It made her hair soft, but left her hair so heavy and almost greasy that she had to shower again later to try to get rid of it.  </li>
            <li> It contains no silicones so does not leave hair flat or greasy.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t use it for a long period of time yet</li>
            <li> I will continue to purchase this as long as you continue to sell it.  </li>
            <li> Did have problems getting the pump to open - it wouldn&#x27;t loosen and &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; like other bottles do.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product only once with my typical shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> but they left my hair crunchy and stiff.</li>
            <li> The cost of the product is worth it, Amazon prices are less expensive than Ulta.</li>
            <li> I have only seen this in a small tube until now.  </li>
            <li> (&amp;#34;It CAN&#x27;T be this hard to open conditioner...</li>
            <li> not weigh your hair down, or leave greasy.</li>
            <li> I stumbled across this product on-line at Amazon and was shocked by the low price for the large size.  </li>
            <li> I feel my hair is way less frizzy with this conditioner.</li>
            <li> The conditioner felt a little less thick than when I get it in the tube</li>
            <li> I had already been using this product but not as often since I was paying about $20 for a small 8oz tube.  </li>
            <li> hard to use.</li>
            <li> I put on a plastic cap and let it sit for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> So therefore, I was a bit skeptical.</li>
            <li> smells bad</li>

            <li> I am happy with this product so far.  I haven&#x27;t use it for a long period of time yet but I have noticed some changes in my hair as far making a bit more manageable.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is great for my hair.  My hair loves it!  And not only that,  it smells really good,  too.  I&#x27;m very happy I purchased it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is very concentrated.  My daughter used it as she has some damage and breakage.  It made her hair soft, but left her hair so heavy and almost greasy that she had to shower again later to try to get rid of it.  I don&#x27;t think she will use it again.</li>
            <li> My hair loves this conditioner! I don&#x27;t particularly care for the scent of vanilla in general, so I can&#x27;t take away from the effects of this product on my hair because of the smell. I use it every few days and my ends look like I just had a trim and blend in beautifully.  Did have problems getting the pump to open - it wouldn&#x27;t loosen and &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; like other bottles do.  I had to pry it apart.  Once I did, it works fine, but it had me questioning my intelligence for several days. (&amp;#34;It CAN&#x27;T be this hard to open conditioner...&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li> I have been using the conditioner for almost 5 years and it does a great job, smells good and creamily mositurizes your hair.

The cost of the product is worth it, Amazon prices are less expensive than Ulta.</li>
            <li> Not As pictured. Not Coppola. Made by Copoman. Will post follow up on how it works.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what we expected. My granddaughters (16 yrs) looks much healthier and shinier! We recommend this to anyone with naturally curly hair, that they want to be straight and not frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this item before and was so glad to see it sold in a larger container.  It is definitely more cost effective buying it this way.  The conditioner felt a little less thick than when I get it in the tube but it worked just as well and I think I was able to use less.  The smell is vanilla bean and is very pleasant.  So far no other sulfate free conditioner can do what this one does for my hair.  I feel my hair is way less frizzy with this conditioner.</li>
            <li> The bottle that arrived was not the one in the picture provided. It doesn&#x27;t say Coppola...it says Copoman! I have yet to try it...shall come back as a follow up.</li>
            <li> I have used this conditioner for a couple of years, ever since I had my  first Keratin treatment.  It makes the treatment last for months, and my hair does so much better when I use keratin products.</li>
            <li> I stumbled across this product on-line at Amazon and was shocked by the low price for the large size.  I had already been using this product but not as often since I was paying about $20 for a small 8oz tube.  This is an excellent product for my very bleached, flat-ironed and torchered hair! I also have a Keratin treatment on my hair and since this product is made by the same company, I know it is safe to use without stripping the Keratin out (though I believe that applies mostly to shampoos that strip due to sulfates).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, it is a great product for overstressed hair and if you can find it on-line for a good price (I think I paid a little under $40 for the large 33oz size), than it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> My go to conditioner for my Keratin treated hair</li>
            <li> This is the only deep conditioner that I use. The entire line is great to get salon results at home. My hair is clearly stronger after using this conditioner. I put on a plastic cap and let it sit for at least 30 minutes. It smells wonderful as well too.</li>
            <li> Fantastic conditioner, thick and creamy with a nice vanilla scent. This is the only conditioner I will use, have yet to find one that tops it!</li>
            <li> I have used this product only once with my typical shampoo and conditioner. And the difference it made is amazing. My hair is soft healthy and moved like a weave. I love it! And idk who the other customers got their product from but this specific amazon seller sent me the exact bottle pictured with name brand and all. So if they got over on me I don&#x27;t know and not do I care</li>
            <li> hard to use. smells bad</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  Great regular conditioner as well.  Recommended to leave in for 5 minutes, so I immediately wash my hair, apply the vanilla bean conditioner (smells great - not too strong), and while I wash, shave etc., the 5 minutes are up.  Rinse and you are done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This leaves your hair soft, tangle free, shiny and smelling great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not weigh your hair down, or leave greasy.</li>
            <li> I use this in place of shampoo and conditioner. It contains no silicones so does not leave hair flat or greasy. My hair is keratin-treated, and the use of this product prolongs the amount of time I can go between treatments. It smells great, and this container lasts forever. Highly recommended for those of you with coarse or chemically treated hair. Give it a shot as a replacement for your 2-phase shampoo/conditioner routine. This thick product will produce a light lather once water is added, then massage it into your scalp and hair and leave on for the duration of your shower. It will rinse clean and take all the excess oil and dirt with it. I have experienced no loss of body or volume from the exclusive use of this product for cleansing my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - if you buy it and decide you hate it on your hair, it also makes a great shave cream</li>
            <li> The product smelled like the real thing. However, in the picture at the bottom of the bottle it had the Coppola name. The one I received did not have the Coppola name. It just was not on the bottle at all.  So therefore, I was a bit skeptical.</li>
            <li> I have heard that this conditioner was good but in my experience its great stuff. Leaves your hair so soft an silky</li>
            <li> Definitely not the real thing. Dries my hair out every time. After this experiment, I&#x27;ve decided that going to the store and dishing out the extra $$$ for the real product is worth the guarantee you&#x27;ll have the healthier hair you&#x27;re aiming for.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this conditioner.  I have only seen this in a small tube until now.  I will continue to purchase this as long as you continue to sell it.  I rush the shampoo also smelled this fantastic!!</li>
            <li> I like this product, it smells great and makes my hair feel soft.  I am not sure if it is the legit Coppola brand or a knockoff with some of it&#x27;s product (as I have learned recently that many OTHER vendors do tamper with products), but so far it has really done well with my hair and I like it.  Great price for such a large amount. Well pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;I will probably purchase again from this vendor for future haircare needs as they seem to provide quality haircare products at very reasonable prices.</li>
            <li> Awesome.  Nourishes hair without being too weighty.  Nice light fragrance.  I have a salon Keratin infusion, so this keeps it looking nice</li>
            <li> Great smelling and calms my crazy hair.</li>
