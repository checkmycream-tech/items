            <li>The smell really is very strong!</li>
            <li>The spray’s ability to hold the hair in place is good, but there are two problems that make it unusable for me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find these perfect for traveling light.  </li>
            <li>Great product and I love the size.  </li>
            <li>It holds nicely without leaving your hair like a stick.  </li>
            <li>I sprayed my hair more than four hours ago, and I still smell like a baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I were to pack this in a suitcase there would be a chance of something pressing the top and releasing hair spray into my bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although not my favorite spray, this brand is not sticky.  </li>
            <li>We love it.</li>
            <li>Came without a spray top to it.</li>
            <li>My favorite hairspray, now in travel size.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I was pleased.</li>
            <li>It holds your hair, but brushes out easily, so that you can restyle in the evening without that stiffness and sticky hair.</li>
            <li>decent... good travel size</li>
            <li>Although it works, the fragrance is too strong and I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>In terms of functionality it works fine</li>
            <li>I do not recommend if you have fine hair.</li>
            <li>I love this hairspray, comes out with a stroke of a hair brush, but keeps hair exactly where you want it.  </li>
            <li>What a relief to find the exact size of my favorite hairspray that I can take on the plane.</li>
            <li>I have fine, relaxed hair and the hold was really just okay.</li>
            <li>have the full size at home, and carry this travel size in our purses.  </li>
            <li>I absolute favorite hairspray</li>
            <li>It gently holds your hair, but then magically leaves no residue.</li>
            <li>The first few weeks that I used Elnett, I thought that it was great, but gradually the build-up became overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>Professional hair stylists love this product for a reason-</li>
            <li>If you are cuaght in high winds or rain, you can just brush it, restyle and lightly spray.&lt;br</li>
            <li>anyone interested in buying a used-once can of this hair spray?</li>
            <li>The smell of it was very off-putting.  </li>
            <li>I love how it feels on my hair but the smell almost makes it not worth it.</li>
            <li>I usually buy the large size &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; version of Elnett, which actually smells good (even though they label it as unscented), but they don&#x27;t make the unscented in travel size, so I bought this.  </li>
            <li>Price is a bit high though.</li>
            <li>I need it for travel oversees and cannot use it as it is missing the spray top.</li>
            <li>I doubt it&#x27;ll have enough hold to work without the heated bed, or on ABS, but if you need an easy to apply alternative to masking tape, look no further.</li>
            <li>What I find with other brands, even the light weight ones, is that I always feel I need to wash my hair within 12 hours of using the stuff.</li>
            <li>and I thought I would have to go the store in the middle of the night upon arrival at our destination since you cannot travel with aresol cans that are too large.  </li>
            <li>I really like this hair spray because it feels soft the next day.</li>
            <li>Not like some of the gloss sold on the market to make hair shine but a natural shine.</li>
            <li>I stopped getting it because, as others mentioned it does have an old lady smell that lingers for awhile.</li>
            <li>think I will suck up the old lady smell and buy this again.</li>
            <li>I bought this item for travel, because of its small size and strong, humidity-resistant hold.</li>
            <li>My Hair Stylist washed it several times using his products to try to eliminate the build-up, but it took a month, using specified products to completely remove build-up, for my hair to look normal again.</li>
            <li>Other hairsprays I feel I have to wash right away.</li>
            <li>spray has an odd smell when sprayed - but smells fresh when it is on your hair.  </li>
            <li>It no longer has any smell once sprayed on and is dry in a matter of minutes.&lt;br /&gt;It creates a natural hold and shine.</li>

            <li> The spray’s ability to hold the hair in place is good, but there are two problems that make it unusable for me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The baby-oil fragrance. Another comment here said that the fragrance only lasts a few minutes, but that is not true. I sprayed my hair more than four hours ago, and I still smell like a baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) I bought this item for travel, because of its small size and strong, humidity-resistant hold. But there is no protective cap on the can. If I were to pack this in a suitcase there would be a chance of something pressing the top and releasing hair spray into my bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is anyone interested in buying a used-once can of this hair spray?</li>
            <li> I find these perfect for traveling light.  Although not my favorite spray, this brand is not sticky.  It holds nicely without leaving your hair like a stick.  I spray it on when my hair is wet as well as after drying and styling.</li>
            <li> This past Halloween, one of my daughter&#x27;s friends was using this hairspray.  I remembered the brand from my earlier years.  I did not know they still made it.  I was happy to find it on amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have the full size at home, and carry this travel size in our purses.  This hairspray is great.  It holds all day long.  If you are cuaght in high winds or rain, you can just brush it, restyle and lightly spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray has an odd smell when sprayed - but smells fresh when it is on your hair.  We love it.</li>
            <li> I absolute favorite hairspray but I hate having to travel with the large cans so this small can is the right size. It lasts a long time too!</li>
            <li> I have fine, relaxed hair and the hold was really just okay. It held up my curls for maybe an hr or two. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> decent... good travel size</li>
            <li> I usually buy the large size &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; version of Elnett, which actually smells good (even though they label it as unscented), but they don&#x27;t make the unscented in travel size, so I bought this.  I noticed several reviews noting that it smells bad, but I thought &amp;#34;who cares, I just need it for travel,&amp;#34; but the smell is so terrible that nobody would want it on their hair.  It literally smells like dirty diapers.  How L&#x27;Oreal has continued to keep this product on the market is mind blowing to me.</li>
            <li> Smells terrible. Apparently the regular version (not extra strong) is not as bad, so I&#x27;ll try that instead. In terms of functionality it works fine but the smell is unbearable.</li>
            <li> It has enough hold to keep the edges from warping with PLA using a heated bed. I used it without masking tape on an Ultimaker 2 with Ultimaker&#x27;s PLA set the default settings. I doubt it&#x27;ll have enough hold to work without the heated bed, or on ABS, but if you need an easy to apply alternative to masking tape, look no further.</li>
            <li> This is the best hairspray I&#x27;ve ever used.  For once a product lives up to it&#x27;s advertising.  It holds your hair, but brushes out easily, so that you can restyle in the evening without that stiffness and sticky hair.</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray, comes out with a stroke of a hair brush, but keeps hair exactly where you want it.  I have long hair and wear it in a single braid.  We are going to travel by air and I thought I would have to go the store in the middle of the night upon arrival at our destination since you cannot travel with aresol cans that are too large.  What a relief to find the exact size of my favorite hairspray that I can take on the plane.</li>
            <li> Professional hair stylists love this product for a reason- it works! It holds your hair, is brushable and makes your hair shiny. Perfect!</li>
            <li> I have tried expensive and I have tried cheap, I have tried it with lots of perfume and some with none. Some advertised to leave hair shining and some extra hold. This one is nothing like that and that is why it has been around for so very long and used by professionals.&lt;br /&gt;Of course it does not smell like the perfumed ones, that is because it does not have all that extra alcohol the others put in it to make it perfumey which makes it clashes with the perfume I have chosen ti wear instead of smelling the hairspray. The perfume is what makes the hairspray dry out your hair. It no longer has any smell once sprayed on and is dry in a matter of minutes.&lt;br /&gt;It creates a natural hold and shine. Not like some of the gloss sold on the market to make hair shine but a natural shine. It does not build up on your hair and make it sticky at any point in time. Your hair can get blown in the wind and when you comb it, it will back to how it was when you sprayed it. Great stuff</li>
            <li> It is great.  It holds the hair but brushes out like there sis no product on the hair..Great find for me.</li>
            <li> Came without a spray top to it. Of course I cannot return it as it is a hazard material so my recommendation to everyone is never purchase this product! I need it for travel oversees and cannot use it as it is missing the spray top.</li>
            <li> My favorite hairspray, now in travel size.  Perfect!   What smell??</li>
            <li> This is very good hairspray, probably the best.  I stopped getting it because, as others mentioned it does have an old lady smell that lingers for awhile. Since I used it up I&#x27;ve bought two other brands (got2be and herbal essence), and neither is even close to holding up to this one in terms of the flexibility.  What I find with other brands, even the light weight ones, is that I always feel I need to wash my hair within 12 hours of using the stuff. With Elnett that&#x27;s not the case at all. It gently holds your hair, but then magically leaves no residue. I think part of the reason is in addition to the formula the sprayer nozzle is of very good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I will suck up the old lady smell and buy this again.</li>
            <li> The hairspray is not cheap and the holding power is not good.  I do not recommend if you have fine hair.</li>
            <li> I love how it feels on my hair but the smell almost makes it not worth it. I have to apply perfume after spraying this on my hair to balance out the smell. It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> The smell really is very strong! It&#x27;s nothing I couldn&#x27;t stand, but it also wasn&#x27;t preferred. The hairspray itself is great though. My hair didn&#x27;t feel like I had hairspray in it at all but it still held. I was pleased. I will be purchasing another bottle when my current bottle runs out, but I will be trying the unscented version.</li>
            <li> This hairspray built up a sticky substance around each hair.  My Hair Stylist washed it several times using his products to try to eliminate the build-up, but it took a month, using specified products to completely remove build-up, for my hair to look normal again.The first few weeks that I used Elnett, I thought that it was great, but gradually the build-up became overwhelming.  I had never had a hairspray that reacted in this manner.</li>
            <li> Great product and I love the size.  Price is a bit high though.</li>
            <li> Although it works, the fragrance is too strong and I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product at all.  The smell of it was very off-putting.  I could not wait to get it out of my hair.  I will try the non-scented version if it comes in travel size.</li>
            <li> I really like this hair spray because it feels soft the next day. Other hairsprays I feel I have to wash right away.</li>
