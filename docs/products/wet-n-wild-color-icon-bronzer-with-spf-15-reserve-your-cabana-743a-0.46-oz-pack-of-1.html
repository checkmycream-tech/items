            <li>and it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li>I never tan, even in the summer, but this gives a perfect glow that seems like i may have been out in the sun for an hour or so.</li>
            <li>This is actually a beautiful bronzer on me.</li>
            <li>It is not a bronzer but a great highlighter.</li>
            <li>love this a lot, it is an excellent highlighter and a great value.</li>
            <li>I did not find this to be a good hightlighter at all.</li>
            <li>to the wise: Don&#x27;t carry this in your makeup bag.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I am 60 and have  fair skin, with fine lines.</li>
            <li>I am fair and it&#x27;s fine for me</li>
            <li>I would like it better if it was somewhat translucent and &amp;#34;shimmery&amp;#34; rather than the opaque coverage</li>
            <li>love it..</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I get a really very natural glow, which is beautiful.</li>
            <li>Perfect and lasts a long time!</li>
            <li>Cruelty Free only adds to the awesome factor.</li>
            <li>My local CVS always has this in stock and it really is beautiful.</li>
            <li>A lot of powders and makeup gives me a caked look and settles into my fine lines, accentuating them.</li>
            <li>I now have the crumbled bits in a leftover makeup tub (from something else) that works out fine for touch ups during the day.</li>
            <li>but the color is way too light</li>
            <li>But it is light.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a bronzer and have darker skin, this is available in two deeper colors (Ticket To Brazil and Bikini Contest are the names)  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too frosty and the color is warm and not harsh.</li>
            <li>Purchased this at a local big box drugstore, and I read that it was a perfect dupe for Too Faced&#x27;s Original Candlelight.</li>
            <li>but it can look unnatural easily and shows skin flaws even more if they are not properly concealed beforehand.</li>
            <li>I am very pale, NW15, and I love, love, love this compact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word</li>
            <li>plus if you use it as a powder it looks like you have very dry skin ( I am fair and have oily skin )</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d really recommend trying the two darker colored bronzers if you find this too light.</li>
            <li>It is a very large product and you just cannot beat the price.</li>
            <li>I know some people were complaining it was too light, but this is actually a good bronzer if you are very pale.</li>
            <li>caused the first pan to be in crumbles by the end of a week&#x27;s time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d perform about the same.</li>
            <li>The other thing I love is that it&#x27;s reasonably priced, which isn&#x27;t always the case with cruelty free products.</li>
            <li>This is not really a bronzer, but it is a lovely illuminator that gives my skin a dewy, soft glow and helps reduce the look of blemishes and fine lines.</li>
            <li>So--please don&#x27;t knock this as a bronzer, because it is perfect for pale girls like me who cannot wear any other bronzer without looking like an oompa-loompa.</li>
            <li>no matter how much you put on</li>
            <li>A lot of Wet n Wild products are Cruelty Free (no animal testing) which is important to me.</li>
            <li>I was so excited there&#x27;s finally a bronzer light enough for me.</li>
            <li>It does crumble easily, so you do have to be careful not to drop the compact.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It has some mica in it, for a soft glow, but not so much that it makes my faces look shiny.</li>
            <li>This is a recommendation in the direction which seldom shines, but asks for a natural result since it is touch near a mat!</li>
            <li>I decided to try this product as my post foundation powder (my winter skin is fairly pale, but I tan easily in the summer).</li>
            <li>I recommend this product and encourage you to watch for the little bunny noting cruelty free.</li>
            <li>I have a very oily skin, but with following the step of getting a flowless foundation coverage and using this product on my forehead, bridge of the nose and cheakbones</li>
            <li>And it is only a few dollars, which makes it even better.</li>
            <li>Also makes an excellent base for eye shadow and for highlighting the brow bone.</li>
            <li>It looks very natural on the face and you are getting a huge amount of product, for a small price.</li>
            <li>and this isn&#x27;t a bronzer even for my very fair skin :(</li>
            <li>Thanks wet n wild!</li>
            <li>It came off as chalky with barely any shimmer.</li>
            <li>It is far more subtle, but with patience and a little practice, you can layer this product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I wanted it for a Bronzer but the color is way too light no matter how much you put on, so I use it as a foundation powder instead. I guess I need to buy a darker one...</li>
            <li> This bronzer has three kinds of colors! One of them is a color which can be usedfor a highlight! It is this color! This is a recommendation in the direction which seldom shines, but asks for a natural result since it is touch near a mat!</li>
            <li> This is not really a bronzer, but it is a lovely illuminator that gives my skin a dewy, soft glow and helps reduce the look of blemishes and fine lines. I am 60 and have  fair skin, with fine lines. A lot of powders and makeup gives me a caked look and settles into my fine lines, accentuating them. But this illuminator takes 10 years off my face!  It does crumble easily, so you do have to be careful not to drop the compact.  It has some mica in it, for a soft glow, but not so much that it makes my faces look shiny. Also makes an excellent base for eye shadow and for highlighting the brow bone. And it is only a few dollars, which makes it even better.</li>
            <li> I would like it better if it was somewhat translucent and &amp;#34;shimmery&amp;#34; rather than the opaque coverage it gives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a bad shade but it could be smoother.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely not a bronzer, so the name is a bit misleading. I did not however purchase this as a bronzer but intended to use it as as a highlighter. I did not find this to be a good hightlighter at all. It came off as chalky with barely any shimmer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a highlighter, but it&#x27;s not light enough for my NC15 skin.  I guess that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> It was all broken and shattered all over! Not good :(</li>
            <li> love it.. but it can look unnatural easily and shows skin flaws even more if they are not properly concealed beforehand.</li>
            <li> i got this as a highlight but I see no glow or highlight at all on the skin! plus if you use it as a powder it looks like you have very dry skin ( I am fair and have oily skin ) and this isn&#x27;t a bronzer even for my very fair skin :(</li>
            <li> Works wonders as a highlighter.</li>
            <li> I know some people were complaining it was too light, but this is actually a good bronzer if you are very pale. I love this.</li>
            <li> Naming of product is a bit misleading. It is not a bronzer but a great highlighter. It looks very natural on the face and you are getting a huge amount of product, for a small price.</li>
            <li> I read about this product on a youtube review as a dupe for a similar hourglass product. It is a very large product and you just cannot beat the price. I use it over my foundation. So far so good. But it is light. I am fair and it&#x27;s fine for me but I would never consider it as a &amp;#34;bronzer&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Purchased this at a local big box drugstore, and I read that it was a perfect dupe for Too Faced&#x27;s Original Candlelight. (Not the Glow--yuck!)  Although it is close, it is not a perfect dupe. It is far more subtle, but with patience and a little practice, you can layer this product. I find this to be a highlighter and not a bronzer. I am very pale, NW15, and I love, love, love this compact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word to the wise: Don&#x27;t carry this in your makeup bag. I did and the constant jarring from being in my purse caused the first pan to be in crumbles by the end of a week&#x27;s time. I now have the crumbled bits in a leftover makeup tub (from something else) that works out fine for touch ups during the day. If you try this and like it, you might want to grab an extra as sometimes, this can be hard to locate in stores.&lt;br /&gt;I love this a lot, it is an excellent highlighter and a great value. Cruelty Free only adds to the awesome factor. I will be purchasing this again and again!</li>
            <li> This IS a bronzer, it&#x27;s for pale girls. I was so excited there&#x27;s finally a bronzer light enough for me. It&#x27;s really hard to find! Perfect and lasts a long time! Thanks wet n wild!</li>
            <li> I have a very oily skin, but with following the step of getting a flowless foundation coverage and using this product on my forehead, bridge of the nose and cheakbones I get a really very natural glow, which is beautiful. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I use this as a highlighter and it&#x27;s wonderful! It&#x27;s not too frosty and the color is warm and not harsh. It can be as subtle or as noticeable as you would like and I think it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> A lot of Wet n Wild products are Cruelty Free (no animal testing) which is important to me. I decided to try this product as my post foundation powder (my winter skin is fairly pale, but I tan easily in the summer). I love it! The other thing I love is that it&#x27;s reasonably priced, which isn&#x27;t always the case with cruelty free products. I recommend this product and encourage you to watch for the little bunny noting cruelty free.</li>
            <li> This is actually a beautiful bronzer on me. I have black hair and dark eyes, but my skin is the lightest (or second lightest) color in every foundation, regardless of brand. So--please don&#x27;t knock this as a bronzer, because it is perfect for pale girls like me who cannot wear any other bronzer without looking like an oompa-loompa. I never tan, even in the summer, but this gives a perfect glow that seems like i may have been out in the sun for an hour or so. If you are looking for a bronzer and have darker skin, this is available in two deeper colors (Ticket To Brazil and Bikini Contest are the names)  so check them out! My local CVS always has this in stock and it really is beautiful. I&#x27;d really recommend trying the two darker colored bronzers if you find this too light. I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d perform about the same.</li>
