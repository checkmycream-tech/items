            <li>Interesting Man in The World&amp;#34</li>
            <li>She ended up buying me this cologne here on amazon.com, the price was way better than in store as well.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>and i fell in love with it.</li>

            <li>Cannot get a better deal on this cologne.  </li>
            <li>Much more than I thought I paid for.  </li>
            <li>The day i received it, wore it right before I go out with friends who noticed it, and described it as a Fresh Clean attractive smell!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very clean, outdoor smell.  </li>
            <li>Yes, fine and &#x60;stylish&#x27; fragrance and worthier for the price.</li>
            <li>Please enjoy the sexy party.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is hands down the best scent a man could hope for.</li>
            <li>and that is a fine cologne with&lt;br /&gt;similar characteristics, which you may also wish to try.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more when it settles that it gives off a clean diaper smell or clean baby.</li>
            <li>love it, it worth the price, and I&#x27;m buying another one</li>
            <li>Came in a sturdy box, came with a card for a free \\&quot;u-fill\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I commend Swiss for creating such a great cologne.</li>
            <li>I sent away for a free sample of this cologne from the Swiss website.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an incredibly fresh scent that lasts!</li>
            <li>Unique cap.</li>
            <li>Are you familiar with Joop?</li>
            <li>The container is very nice and the screw cap is an interesting innovation, at least for me :).</li>
            <li>It has a clean smell which i do not think smells like baby</li>
            <li>True story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t want to pay what Swiss army wanted , so when I saw it on Amazon for such a good price I bought</li>
            <li>None of that sweet smelling S</li>
            <li>Whether it&#x27;s because of memories of the first time I purchased this fragrance, or because of the fantastic &#x27;mini&#x27; EDT that comes with the full pack -</li>
            <li>It is a mild an not over powering scent.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>Its worth the money.</li>
            <li>He liked the cologne and I purchased it on line as a Christmas present to surprise him.</li>
            <li>well worth it.sealed package and smells great.good price and</li>
            <li>well worth it.im glade</li>
            <li>So ... you know those Axe commercials where a bunch of hot ladies basically swarm the guy?</li>
            <li>I bought the perfume the next day and love it, everybody loves it.</li>
            <li>I first smelled this fragrance in a magazine and decided to order it for my boyfriend.  </li>
            <li>I first tried this when looking around the mall.</li>
            <li>It does kind of smell like a baby like the other reviewer</li>
            <li>it is certainly flattering.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not overpowering at all and doesn&#x27;t have any kind of weird chemical smell like most colognes do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>an added side effect I have also been gotten compliments and advances from more than a couple of gents who happen to like other gents.</li>
            <li>I,m sure in part since there was a Swiss store a little way up the block from our hotel.  </li>
            <li>In short, you feel fresh wearing this cologne.</li>
            <li>I new</li>

            <li>Same exact fragrance.</li>
            <li>One or two sprays lasts the entire day and is very crisp even later!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 25 year old.</li>
            <li>Please do not waste money for this cologne.</li>
            <li>This bottle actually fits in a protective soft plastic cover.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but it&#x27;s been done before.</li>

            <li> It was less expensive and my husband&#x27;s favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li> they have a very sharp note reminiscent of a laboratory /chemical smell.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> but not so much that it would be confused with&lt;br /&gt;a lady&#x27;s perfume.  </li>
            <li> After a few times of wearing it, I finally told him it smelled a little like baby powder (which is not at all what it smelled like in the magazine).  </li>
            <li> Your girl/boy friend wife or husband and complete total random strangers will all appreciate the way you smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Received unexpected compliments from friends and unknown strangers.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> My wife absolutely loves this cologne on me, but I feel like the smell went stale after just a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> so I am a little biased.  </li>
            <li> and i keep some in a little portable mister than i got here on amazon as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> musky (they smell like a dead animal&#x27;s hide ... which is what musk is derived from),&lt;br /&gt;or</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a gentleman who usually wears Curve or Versace.</li>
            <li> it is a secret ...&amp;#34; she explained she would break up with him and date me to find out what it was.</li>
            <li> Horrible really...</li>
            <li> I waited nearly 2 weeks to get this cologne from this seller and smell was AWFUL !</li>
            <li> bother dropping insane money at the local Macy&#x27;s on something that smells like a coconut pine tree and yak spit!</li>
            <li> Disappointed to say the least.</li>
            <li> It is very difficult for me to find a cologne that I like.  </li>
            <li> Terrible ,&lt;br /&gt;me</li>
            <li> and all people who smell it said its terrible .&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The day i received it, wore it right before I go out with friends who noticed it, and described it as a Fresh Clean attractive smell! They&#x27;re like: It smells like some fancy European perfume!&lt;br /&gt;I love it, it worth the price, and I&#x27;m buying another one</li>
            <li> So ... you know those Axe commercials where a bunch of hot ladies basically swarm the guy? Well if you want to make that a reality this is the way to do it. Please enjoy the sexy party. Remember to be respectful and no means no m&#x27;kay?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow. The best part about Swiss Unlimited is that unlike axe you will not smell like a rotting donkey carcass combined with some cheap car air freshener! Your girl/boy friend wife or husband and complete total random strangers will all appreciate the way you smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is hands down the best scent a man could hope for. Literally everyone I have run into has noticed and complimented how wonderful it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not overpowering at all and doesn&#x27;t have any kind of weird chemical smell like most colognes do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle has a great twist up protector which keeps it safe from accidental squirts. Perfect if you need to put it in a bag and go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had girls ask me what cologne I am wearing because they want to buy it for their husband/boyfriend - when I teased one of them with &amp;#34;Sorry it is a secret ...&amp;#34; she explained she would break up with him and date me to find out what it was. True story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an added side effect I have also been gotten compliments and advances from more than a couple of gents who happen to like other gents. While not my style it is certainly flattering. Moral of the story: This scent seems to be pleasing to literally everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t bother dropping insane money at the local Macy&#x27;s on something that smells like a coconut pine tree and yak spit! Get this and start smelling like victory!</li>
            <li> An excellent fragrance for men.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve received the product in time and it was well packed.. i&#x27;m totally satisfied with his product and this seller&#x27;s service.. thank you guys for the good job...</li>
            <li> Very light, powdery smell. In short, you feel fresh wearing this cologne. Its like Baby smell. Received unexpected compliments from friends and unknown strangers.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t go wrong. Its worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have had this product before so I am a little biased.  I can rate the expierence of purchasing it through Amazon and I will say that price, ease of ordering and speedy delivery were excellent.  I will be ordering refills from Amazon in the future.</li>
            <li> It does kind of smell like a baby like the other reviewer said, i&#x27;d never buy it again.  It&#x27;s more when it settles that it gives off a clean diaper smell or clean baby.</li>
            <li> It is very difficult for me to find a cologne that I like.  Most men&#x27;s colognes are either&lt;br /&gt;very musky (they smell like a dead animal&#x27;s hide ... which is what musk is derived from),&lt;br /&gt;or they have a very sharp note reminiscent of a laboratory /chemical smell.&lt;br /&gt;This one is different.  It is sweeter... but not so much that it would be confused with&lt;br /&gt;a lady&#x27;s perfume.  It is pleasant, not pungent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to only wear &amp;#34;Quasar&amp;#34; by Jesus del Pozo... and that is a fine cologne with&lt;br /&gt;similar characteristics, which you may also wish to try.  However, when I discovered&lt;br /&gt;this Victorinox scent, &amp;#34;Swiss Unlimited&amp;#34;... I new I had found my new cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To paraphrase the Dos Equis &amp;#34;Most Interesting Man in The World&amp;#34;, I will say:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I don&#x27;t always wear cologne, but when I do, I wear Swiss Unlimited&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I received some samples from a friend but never bothered to wear them. Then one day i ran outta cologne so i had to use the samples. I bought the perfume the next day and love it, everybody loves it. It has a clean smell which i do not think smells like baby cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it, you wont be dissapointed</li>
            <li> I first smelled this fragrance in a magazine and decided to order it for my boyfriend.  After a few times of wearing it, I finally told him it smelled a little like baby powder (which is not at all what it smelled like in the magazine).  I don&#x27;t recommend this cologne, unless you like the baby powder scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 25 year old. I first tried this when looking around the mall. The lady told me there was a deal on it and handed me a sample to take home. I tried it, thought it was good. Everytime i&#x27;d go out i use a bit of the sample. My girlfriend asked what it was and that she liked it. I couldn&#x27;t believe that it was swiss myself and not bvlgari, polo, gucci or something like that. She ended up buying me this cologne here on amazon.com, the price was way better than in store as well.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is nice. It&#x27;s refreshing and stays on a good while, but it&#x27;s not over powering. This is my daily cologne and i keep some in a little portable mister than i got here on amazon as well.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy.</li>
            <li> My husband and I were staying in Paris and were left samples of the cologne I,m sure in part since there was a Swiss store a little way up the block from our hotel.  He liked the cologne and I purchased it on line as a Christmas present to surprise him.</li>
            <li> Came in a sturdy box, came with a card for a free \\&quot;u-fill\\&quot;. Great scent, price, and nice glass bottle.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this fragrance! I&#x27;m a gentleman who usually wears Curve or Versace. My lady got me this one time for my birthday a while ago and i fell in love with it. It&#x27;s an incredibly fresh scent that lasts! You WILL be noticed for the gentleman that you are! So treat yourself to this, you deserve it!</li>
            <li> For one of my boys (teenager).  Wears it a lot.</li>
            <li> I am very much in love with this scent. I commend Swiss for creating such a great cologne. I also appreciate this company for delivering this cologne on time. This is a wonderful cologne to have in your collection. I highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Yes, fine and &#x60;stylish&#x27; fragrance and worthier for the price. It has a woody fragrance and is very refreshing.</li>
            <li> 5-star fragrance; superb!!</li>
            <li> Fragrance remains strong throughout the day!  One or two sprays lasts the entire day and is very crisp even later!</li>
            <li> well worth it.sealed package and smells great.good price and well worth it.im glade I have this to wear.a good cologne to have.</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised good experience</li>
            <li> I had a free sample a couple of years ago and loved it!&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want to pay what Swiss army wanted , so when I saw it on Amazon for such a good price I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;Very manly smell! None of that sweet smelling S***!  My wife likes it on me too. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of this cologne and I love it. Unique cap. This bottle actually fits in a protective soft plastic cover.</li>
            <li> I waited nearly 2 weeks to get this cologne from this seller and smell was AWFUL !&lt;br /&gt;It was like chamomile alcohol. Please do not waste money for this cologne. I wasn&#x27;t expect this low-quality scent from Victorinox. Horrible really...</li>
            <li> Wow, that&#x27;s all I can say!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, it came in fast and in perfect conditions.  The container is very nice and the screw cap is an interesting innovation, at least for me :).</li>
            <li> This is my fav fragrance. Ladies get this for you men! Men, get this for yourself!!!!</li>
            <li> Cannot get a better deal on this cologne.  It smells awesome and doesn&#x27;t cost and arm and a leg at a fancy department store! This is about my 4th bottle for my husband!</li>
            <li> Was expecting just the 2.5 oz cologne.  Instead got that plus 2.5 oz , and a great travel case!  Much more than I thought I paid for.  My wife loves this scent.  It&#x27;s a very clean, outdoor smell.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My wife absolutely loves this cologne on me, but I feel like the smell went stale after just a few weeks.  It&#x27;s certainly not awful now, but not as nice.</li>
            <li> Whether it&#x27;s because of memories of the first time I purchased this fragrance, or because of the fantastic &#x27;mini&#x27; EDT that comes with the full pack - but I just keep coming back to this fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s just because it smells so good!</li>
            <li> I sent away for a free sample of this cologne from the Swiss website. It arrived on a card that you basically opened and smelled. I loved it. I kept the card until the smell wore off. I ordered the cologne and just received it today. It smells totally different. Are you familiar with Joop? Same exact fragrance. Disappointed to say the least. It&#x27;s nice, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but it&#x27;s been done before.</li>
            <li> It is a mild an not over powering scent.  Citrus and woodsy.  I suggestion every one try a sample to test for yourself</li>
            <li> Stays with you all day. Smells good to me and my wife. You can tell it is a quality fragrance. I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Terrible ,&lt;br /&gt;me and all people who smell it said its terrible .&lt;br /&gt;first and last.</li>
            <li> Good quarlity. Reseasonable price.</li>
            <li> This was the easiest purchase.  I went to Bloomies, Nordstroms to purchase they didn&#x27;t carry.  I found on Amazon.  It was less expensive and my husband&#x27;s favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cologne scent ever! Both my brother and my boyfriend got it for Christmas, so between the two of them I get to smell it all the time!</li>
            <li> Very good manly scent!</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT 100% RECOMMENDED</li>
