    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Best hair tie I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Great hair-ties!</li>
            <li>Best ponytail holder that I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t managed to snap one apart yet, despite my best attempts to abuse them, on occasion.</li>
            <li>(That&#x27;s a good thing! ...</li>
            <li>Made my head hurt despite the great hold.  </li>
            <li>Great ponytail holder.</li>
            <li>Great</li>
            <li>They do loosen up if you use them a lot, but when you rotate between the eight in this pack, you&#x27;ll do great.</li>
            <li>The thinner ones are my favorite and I stocked up on 4 packages!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>these are the best on the market and they last!!!</li>
            <li>The two on the top are brand-new, never used and the two on the bottom are ones that have been used one time.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still as good as new!</li>
            <li>Still trying them out so far so good  - probably better for your hair and look nicer.</li>
            <li>I also love that these fit my wrist right away--no stretching needed!</li>
            <li>And the power stretch is firm and secure throughout the day making a perfect ponytail or bun.</li>
            <li>These are great pony holders that soft, pretty, and durable.</li>
            <li>Hold my hair, can take it out without ripping my hair, so nice and classy.</li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t very good for a high ponytail with my thick hair, but they&#x27;re OK to just get it out of the way.</li>
            <li>Ok, maybe these are expensive but I love love love them.</li>
            <li>Soft and strong.</li>
            <li>They are exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m glad I finally bit the bullet and bought them.</li>
            <li>When I first saw the L. Erickson ponytail holders I was really hesitant to buy them despite the rave reviews, because of the price.</li>
            <li>I have long thick hair, but these do the job marvelously!</li>
            <li>These are sturdy, well made, and hold my hair very well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like it, it&#x27;s very strong and not comfortable.</li>
            <li>Love these and hope they continue to sell the black versions!</li>
            <li>Normally I stretch out a new hair tie in days</li>
            <li>Very soft.</li>
            <li>I am huge fan of ponytails since childhood due to my wild uncontrollable hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend these to anyone who wants to put their hair up or pull it back.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been struggling for years to find ponytail holders that keep my hair up as high as I like it, especially at the gym.</li>
            <li>Also, I can&#x27;t imagine how long it will take me to use 8 of these, since I&#x27;ve been using the first one daily for a week now</li>
            <li>Because of the angle and the fact that it&#x27;s closer to the camera, the one on the bottom left may look like it was stretched out a bit, but it really hasn&#x27;t, and still hasn&#x27;t after multiple uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off one star because of the prohibitive price.</li>
            <li>Great for thick or thin hair.</li>
            <li>I decided years ago to wear my hair long so these ponytail holders hold my hair up when I want an upswept style and they keep it out of my way when I am busy doing close work.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not stretched out at all.</li>

            <li> What I love about them is they are thick and sturdy, not like the usual skinny, skimpy ones.  </li>
            <li> Work as expected...</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy hair that just can&#x27;t be contained by a standard ponytail holder.</li>

            <li> My hair is dark so the fact that they are black is an added bonus.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of this bands, but these were difficult to tell they were so much larger.  </li>
            <li> so ponytail holders are typically a one-time-use for me.</li>
            <li> Thanks to all the other reviewers who led me to this product when I was frustrated with the failures of other hair ties.</li>
            <li> I wish they would sell these in a 2 or 3 pack so if someone was unsure about them and wanted to try them they could buy just a few.</li>
            <li> With long, very thick hair, all the other ponytail holders I&#x27;d used were too thin and too small.  </li>
            <li> They either snap or get stretched out to the point where they are useless</li>
            <li> At least they don&#x27;t  stretch out.</li>
            <li> Have had it for a couple months now and none have broken yet, which has happened a lot in the past.</li>
            <li> Which means buying 8 of these is really unnecessary!)</li>

            <li> I am a big fan of this bands, but these were difficult to tell they were so much larger.  Made my head hurt despite the great hold.  The thinner ones are my favorite and I stocked up on 4 packages!</li>

            <li> Great for thick or thin hair. Stays put. Very soft. Best hair tie I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Ok, maybe these are expensive but I love love love them. Hold my hair, can take it out without ripping my hair, so nice and classy. Im heartbroken when I have to use a regular elastic now.</li>
            <li> Great hair-ties! Soft and strong. I have long thick hair, but these do the job marvelously! The texture prevents the tie to glide off. And the power stretch is firm and secure throughout the day making a perfect ponytail or bun.</li>
            <li> Great ponytail holder. Holds well, doesn&#x27;t crease, and I have thick/full hair. Have had it for a couple months now and none have broken yet, which has happened a lot in the past.</li>
            <li> Work as expected...Great</li>
            <li> These are great pony holders that soft, pretty, and durable. They are also flexible and do not snag my hair.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my fault. When I like something I tell my friends and give them one to try. I also love that these fit my wrist right away--no stretching needed!</li>
            <li> Best ponytail holder that I&#x27;ve ever tried. Durable and doesn&#x27;t rip out my hair. Should have bought years ago...</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! I am huge fan of ponytails since childhood due to my wild uncontrollable hair. These ponytail holders brought me to 21 Century!</li>
            <li> These never rip your hair out. I haven&#x27;t managed to snap one apart yet, despite my best attempts to abuse them, on occasion. They do loosen up if you use them a lot, but when you rotate between the eight in this pack, you&#x27;ll do great. Thanks to all the other reviewers who led me to this product when I was frustrated with the failures of other hair ties.</li>
            <li> I decided years ago to wear my hair long so these ponytail holders hold my hair up when I want an upswept style and they keep it out of my way when I am busy doing close work.  What I love about them is they are thick and sturdy, not like the usual skinny, skimpy ones.  My hair is dark so the fact that they are black is an added bonus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling for years to find ponytail holders that keep my hair up as high as I like it, especially at the gym. Normally I stretch out a new hair tie in days and I have to redo my ponytail every 5-10 minutes, but not with these. I&#x27;ve been using the same hair tie for at least a month now and it&#x27;s not stretched out at all. I&#x27;d recommend these to anyone who wants to put their hair up or pull it back.</li>
            <li> These ponytail holders were just what I needed!  With long, very thick hair, all the other ponytail holders I&#x27;d used were too thin and too small.  These are sturdy, well made, and hold my hair very well. They are exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> I am in the military and I need something that will hold tight all day without slipping or stretching out of shape.  these are the best on the market and they last!!!</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy hair that just can&#x27;t be contained by a standard ponytail holder. They either snap or get stretched out to the point where they are useless so ponytail holders are typically a one-time-use for me. When I first saw the L. Erickson ponytail holders I was really hesitant to buy them despite the rave reviews, because of the price. However, I&#x27;m glad I finally bit the bullet and bought them. They are beefed up versions of the standard Goody ponytail holder and actually hold my hair in a ponytail without having to re-tie my hair constantly throughout the day. In the picture I have an L. Erickson compared with a Goody ponytail holder. The two on the top are brand-new, never used and the two on the bottom are ones that have been used one time. Because of the angle and the fact that it&#x27;s closer to the camera, the one on the bottom left may look like it was stretched out a bit, but it really hasn&#x27;t, and still hasn&#x27;t after multiple uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off one star because of the prohibitive price. I wish they would sell these in a 2 or 3 pack so if someone was unsure about them and wanted to try them they could buy just a few. Also, I can&#x27;t imagine how long it will take me to use 8 of these, since I&#x27;ve been using the first one daily for a week now and it&#x27;s still as good as new! (That&#x27;s a good thing! ...Which means buying 8 of these is really unnecessary!)</li>
            <li> Still trying them out so far so good  - probably better for your hair and look nicer.</li>
