            <li>The fragrance doesn&#x27;t seem very strong.</li>
            <li>Very strong smell..</li>
            <li>I LOVE TO MAKE MY OWN LIP GLOSS, AND</li>
            <li>Very nice quality essential oils for a great pricepoint.</li>
            <li>Good quality oils, fast delivery, very pleased with this company, will order again from Edens Garden :</li>
            <li>so many medicinal purposes, antibacterial ,antifungal,expectorant, the list goes on, also can be used in your garden ..</li>
            <li>Edens Garden make the best quality (for me) essential oils.</li>
            <li>lovely.</li>
            <li>Great item, fast shipping</li>
            <li>This is such a wonderful price point for this Thyme oil.  </li>
            <li>Great prices and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>and so this combined with a couple more oils</li>
            <li>I must say that Thyme is an interesting fragrance.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this oil.  </li>
            <li>I have nothing to say except that I love this company and their oils, I buy most of my skincare oils from EdensGarden</li>
            <li>I use it in the kitchen the most.</li>
            <li>love this oil.</li>
            <li>The infected nail must grow out (patience training for sure).  </li>
            <li>I must say that Thyme is an interesting fragrance.</li>
            <li>Love these oils.  </li>
            <li>I love this oil.</li>
            <li>So glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li>Will buy some more soon.</li>
            <li>mostly the influenza virus.  </li>
            <li>They seem good to me, but I&#x27;m a beginner so take that for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>Edens Garden products are great I highly recommend them.  </li>
            <li>Awesome,  thanks for fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been happy with Eden&#x27;s Garden so far, which seems to offer this value &amp; quality combination with their products.</li>
            <li>Edens Garden&#x27;s oils are reasonably priced and quite exceptional.</li>
            <li>I would STRONGLY suggest you follow the directions on the bottle, otherwise you will burn yourself.</li>
            <li>/&gt;(you also get a free complimentary leaflet with some combinations of oils and how to make your own blends)</li>
            <li>They smell strong and do not look watery.</li>
            <li>We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>you for making this available and so easy to find.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly!  </li>
            <li>Very natural product that is good to use for the skin.</li>
            <li>I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM.</li>
            <li>Customer service is nice and replies very timely.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this to put in my Witch Hazel to help with my acne problems.  </li>
            <li>Just what I expected quality is great.</li>
            <li>So much cheaper than buying cleaner and better for everyone involved too.</li>
            <li>This product arrived quickly and smelled really good (smells totally different than the stuff you cook with).</li>
            <li>I put this on my mosquito bites and although I smelled strongly of thyme all night, it really took out the itch!</li>
            <li>There is a tremendous selection of oils and associated supplies.</li>
            <li>That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for!</li>
            <li>Been wanting to try essential oils and these are packaged nicely and are priced well.  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much</li>
            <li>I have several of Edens Gardens oils and am satisfied with all.  </li>
            <li>I bought this thyme essential oil for a potpouuri receipe and was pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>and I am back to being able to use it.</li>
            <li>Anyone interested in aromatherapy will find these helpful.</li>
            <li>For toe nail fungus, first clip off excess nail which isn&#x27;t attached to the nail bed.  </li>
            <li>The product arrived in a timely manner, and is exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>It works well and combines nicely with other oils.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, a great product overall!</li>
            <li>In combination with the other essential oils I purchased, the medium, and a simple diffuser, my patio is mosquito and biting fly free</li>
            <li>I will certainly continue to use these oils.</li>
            <li>It is an unusual scent.</li>
            <li>and it really does work.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>Extremely fast delivery.</li>
            <li>The oil does come out a little fast if you&#x27;re not careful, but otherwise it is a good product.</li>
            <li>The oil does come out a little fast if you&#x27;re not careful, but otherwise it is a good product.  </li>
            <li>Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers.</li>
            <li>High quality.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this company to anyone.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this company to anyone.  </li>
            <li>In particular I find it helpful when I get a sinus infection, which unfortunately is frequent.</li>
            <li>Product didn&#x27;t work my nail fungus, but could be because I want consistent enough.</li>
            <li>ESSENTIAL OILS AND THIS LITTLE BOTTLES OK</li>
            <li>It has reduced my hair-shedding significantly and increased my hair growth slightly</li>
            <li>It is strong, and I blended it with the other essential oils and my medium and placed it in a diffuser.</li>
            <li>I make a lot of natural remedies and this is one I didn&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li>Hi, It&#x27;s a really natural oil</li>
            <li>Thanks for helping give back my peace of mind.</li>
            <li>I only used a few drops because this essential oil is VERY strong in smell.  </li>
            <li>The little glass bottles came quickly and wrapped well to prevent breakage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to oils and bought several of this brand to start with.</li>
            <li>but I have only used the oils 4 or 5 times so far.</li>
            <li>This product came with a couple of very helpful booklets about how to use thyme and other essential oils&lt;br</li>
            <li>I put a little more than I usually do.</li>
            <li>, it is of good quality and is so much less expensive than those sold by the big MLM brands.</li>

            <li> I put a little more than I usually do.</li>
            <li> , it is of good quality and is so much less expensive than those sold by the big MLM brands.</li>
            <li> The scent was long lasting but not overbearing.</li>
            <li> I combine two drops of Cedar Wood essential oil, two drops of Thyme essential oil, three drops of Lavender essential oil and three drops Rosemary essential oil to 1/2 ounce of a carrier oil( Grapeseed oil, olive oil, coconut oil,jojoba oil, black jamaican castor oil ).</li>
            <li> From my experience, and countless other essential oil enthusiasts who have also used doTerra, YL, and Melaleuca, there is no difference in quality, purity or smell with Eden’s Garden.</li>
            <li> I personally alternate between Castor and Jojoba oil with the other 4 essential oils.</li>
            <li> My only advice is to tip the bottle slowly -- the drops come out much faster than other types of bottles.</li>
            <li> I have replaced almost ALL of my more expensive oils to this brand and brag them up to all my clients!</li>
            <li> I had read that using this and other essential oil supplements might my snoring problem</li>
            <li> I mixed a little vinegar with the thyme oil and added water</li>
            <li> These oils by Eden&#x27;s Garden are not the least bit inferior to doTerra, Melaleuca, or Young Living.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long the scent will last in my handmade soap.</li>
            <li> I am not certain how well this product works because I did not use it as directed.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Extremely valuable antiseptic oil as well.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m not sure to use it for inhalator because Instruction say &amp;#34;for external use only&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> And the cost compared to my previous purchases is a blessing.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very difficult to get the right amount out and not get it all over the place.</li>
            <li> I use a small amount of it with some other oils for sore muscles.</li>
            <li> and I see a little difference.</li>
            <li> Be careful on delicate skin, but diluted it is truly helpful for skin conditions.</li>
            <li> We had a rather bad bed bug outbreak at the school in which I teach and after much research, I found odors that bed</li>
            <li> I learned the hard way.</li>
            <li> I use thyme essential oils in steams when I am feeling sick.</li>
            <li> File the tops of the nail to make it thin, then paint the nail.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Because my skin issue was horrible, I decided to forgo the dilution and pour the product directly on my skin.</li>
            <li> Have about 20 different oils and have yet to be disappointed!</li>
            <li> The herbal scent is weird with this one.</li>
            <li> My spaghetti tasted horrible, but I could taste the quality none the less.</li>
            <li> My skin started to burn terribly--like a sunburn--I had to stand under a cold shower until the pain subsided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> BAD MOVE!</li>
            <li> I had this terrible rash and purchase this product upon recommendation from a friend who also had some funky skin problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have terrible sinuses</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have several of Edens Gardens oils and am satisfied with all.  Thyme smells kind of mossy to me.  It is an unusual scent.</li>
            <li> great for the price !!</li>
            <li> I make a lot of natural remedies and this is one I didn&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li> I am not certain how well this product works because I did not use it as directed. I would STRONGLY suggest you follow the directions on the bottle, otherwise you will burn yourself. I learned the hard way. I had this terrible rash and purchase this product upon recommendation from a friend who also had some funky skin problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because my skin issue was horrible, I decided to forgo the dilution and pour the product directly on my skin. BAD MOVE! My skin started to burn terribly--like a sunburn--I had to stand under a cold shower until the pain subsided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So heed my advice: follow the instructions!</li>
            <li> I like the product I just wished it had an eye dropper instead of the European style dropper.  I use it on my toe nails and it&#x27;s very difficult to get the right amount out and not get it all over the place.</li>
            <li> Brings back an air of nostalgia.</li>
            <li> Great price and quality.</li>
            <li> so many medicinal purposes, antibacterial ,antifungal,expectorant, the list goes on, also can be used in your garden ..this is something that should always be in ur medicine cabinet ..</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for use at home for health purposes.  It is an excellent oil.  The service from Eden&#x27;s was prompt and efficient.  I will definitely be ordering from them again.</li>
            <li> Edens Garden make the best quality (for me) essential oils. i use them in my soaps and body bars. i do believe i have now tried every one of their oils and this one once again does not disappoint. lovely.</li>
            <li> Works great with Frankincense to relieve sore muscles. I dilute with carrier oil to apply to  calves ans shoulders.</li>
            <li> These oils by Eden&#x27;s Garden are not the least bit inferior to doTerra, Melaleuca, or Young Living. I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM. Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers. We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price. The reason it is a fraction of the price is because it does not have about 3 to 5 levels of compensations for its representatives built into the margins, which drastically reduces the overhead. That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden. From my experience, and countless other essential oil enthusiasts who have also used doTerra, YL, and Melaleuca, there is no difference in quality, purity or smell with Eden’s Garden. If you are one of the 1 - 5% making great money with an MLM, more power to you! But for everyone else, this oil matches up well with the best of them.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way! My only advice is to tip the bottle slowly -- the drops come out much faster than other types of bottles. Other than that, a great product overall!</li>
            <li> great oils for a great price.. I have replaced almost ALL of my more expensive oils to this brand and brag them up to all my clients!</li>
            <li> Great item, fast shipping</li>
            <li> This is such a wonderful price point for this Thyme oil.  I use a small amount of it with some other oils for sore muscles. It can&#x27;t be beat.  Extremely valuable antiseptic oil as well.  High quality.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the products! Have about 20 different oils and have yet to be disappointed! Great prices and fast shipping. Customer service is nice and replies very timely. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> just started will update</li>
            <li> This oil is perfect for what I use it for. I have terrible sinuses and so this combined with a couple more oils is so potent and awesome for my steam inhalations. And the cost compared to my previous purchases is a blessing. Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE TO MAKE MY OWN LIP GLOSS, AND ESSENTIAL OILS AND THIS LITTLE BOTTLES OK FOR WHAT I DO.</li>
            <li> I use thyme essential oils in steams when I am feeling sick. In particular I find it helpful when I get a sinus infection, which unfortunately is frequent. Helps reduce the amount of antibiotics I have to take every year.</li>
            <li> I have purchased from Edens Garden previously; love the services and what they provide! I used thyme for making home made soap.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to mix with some essential oils for hair loss and the combination of the essential oils with this thyme oil seem to be working. I will order it again.</li>
            <li> I must say that Thyme is an interesting fragrance. I think the Edens Garden company sells good quality products. The oil does come out a little fast if you&#x27;re not careful, but otherwise it is a good product. I would highly recommend this company to anyone. I have even mentioned them to the Health Food store in town hoping to get the items there.</li>
            <li> This works great mixes with Clove oil for snoring.  Edens Garden products are great I highly recommend them.  I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Hi, It&#x27;s a really natural oil and I like it. But I&#x27;m not sure to use it for inhalator because Instruction say &amp;#34;for external use only&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> These are great oils. Love them.</li>
            <li> Awesome,  thanks for fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Very natural product that is good to use for the skin. It works for what it is intended to work for.Thank you very much</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the combination of value and quality in this product. Very nice scent. I&#x27;ve been happy with Eden&#x27;s Garden so far, which seems to offer this value &amp; quality combination with their products.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for my mother because she heard on dr. oz that it was one of the ingredients necessary to make an at home remedy for feet fungus. From what she&#x27;s told me the remedy somewhat works so I guess the thyme is doing it&#x27;s job. I can say that the package arrived item, well sealed, and that it was in the condition described by the seller.</li>
            <li> I bought this thyme essential oil for a potpouuri receipe and was pleased with it.  The scent was long lasting but not overbearing.</li>
            <li> I put this on my mosquito bites and although I smelled strongly of thyme all night, it really took out the itch! I like this brand, it is of good quality and is so much less expensive than those sold by the big MLM brands.</li>
            <li> applied to feet of myself and spouse. reduced snoring greatly</li>
            <li> I was looking to find out which oils would help me with my COPD.  I found out that Thyme and Balsam Fur actually help open the airways to my lungs.  I have been using the Thyme/Balsam Fur for a week now, and it actually is helping me cope.</li>
            <li> The herbal scent is weird with this one.</li>
            <li> Great oil at a good price.  I love the smell of this oil.  It works well and combines nicely with other oils.  I would definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I purchase this for a mix to regrow my edges.  I have been using this mix for two weeks and I see a little difference.</li>
            <li> I have nothing to say except that I love this company and their oils, I buy most of my skincare oils from EdensGarden and I trust them...Thank you!</li>
            <li> i like Edens Gardens oils a lot, this one is just as good.</li>
            <li> I use this to make an anti-fungal lotion and it works great.  Very nice quality essential oils for a great pricepoint.</li>
            <li> I purchased this essential oil along with Lavender Essential Oil.  We had a rather bad bed bug outbreak at the school in which I teach and after much research, I found odors that bed bugs do not like.  I used these aromas in a diffuser in my classroom to keep the bugs away.  Thankfully it worked and there were no sightings in my classroom.  Besides the bug prevention, the aromas are pleasing and calming to me as well as my students. I will certainly continue to use these oils. They are most therapeutic! Edens Garden was great to purchase from.  The little glass bottles came quickly and wrapped well to prevent breakage. Thanks for helping give back my peace of mind.</li>
            <li> I bought this thyme oil to imitate a cleaner made by the company Melaleuca, and thyme oil is the ticket! I mixed a little vinegar with the thyme oil and added water and I use it as an all-purpose antibacterial, anti-fungal cleaning spray. I use it in the kitchen the most. So much cheaper than buying cleaner and better for everyone involved too. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as an ingredient in my concoction for combating my mosquito and biting fly problem. YES! In combination with the other essential oils I purchased, the medium, and a simple diffuser, my patio is mosquito and biting fly free and I am back to being able to use it. This product arrived quickly and smelled really good (smells totally different than the stuff you cook with). It is strong, and I blended it with the other essential oils and my medium and placed it in a diffuser. This company combines shipping.</li>
            <li> Good quality oils, fast delivery, very pleased with this company, will order again from Edens Garden :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(you also get a free complimentary leaflet with some combinations of oils and how to make your own blends)</li>
            <li> My spaghetti tasted horrible, but I could taste the quality none the less.</li>
            <li> love this oil. It is the best</li>
            <li> This product came with a couple of very helpful booklets about how to use thyme and other essential oils&lt;br /&gt; Anyone interested in aromatherapy will find these helpful. There is a tremendous selection of oils and associated supplies.</li>
            <li> For toe nail fungus, first clip off excess nail which isn&#x27;t attached to the nail bed.  File the tops of the nail to make it thin, then paint the nail.  I use it once in the morning and once in the evening.  The infected nail must grow out (patience training for sure).  The thyme oil keeps the fungus from spreading.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this to put in my Witch Hazel to help with my acne problems.  I only used a few drops because this essential oil is VERY strong in smell.  It works great with my Witch Hazel as an astringent.</li>
            <li> I must say that Thyme is an interesting fragrance. I think the Edens Garden company sells good quality products.  The oil does come out a little fast if you&#x27;re not careful, but otherwise it is a good product.  I would highly recommend this company to anyone.  I have even mentioned them to the Health Food store in town hoping to get the items there.</li>
            <li> After reading online, I purchased this for use in my bee hives to combat mite infestation.  It didn&#x27;t do the job, but then everyone&#x27;s hives died last winter in our area.  Smells good, though.</li>
            <li> The fragrance doesn&#x27;t seem very strong. I&#x27;m not sure how long the scent will last in my handmade soap. I put a little more than I usually do. Otherwise I loved blending it with rosemary.</li>
            <li> Good Line! All lines must be researched on regular basis.</li>
            <li> This oil is the best.  Edens Garden&#x27;s oils are reasonably priced and quite exceptional.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright.  Need to use for a while to see results.</li>
            <li> I had read that using this and other essential oil supplements might my snoring problem but it did not</li>
            <li> I used it to stop my son&#x27;s snoring by mixing with grapeseed oil and rubbing on his feet.  It works!!</li>
            <li> Love these oils.  Will purchase more!</li>
            <li> I love this oil. I use it on my feet every morning to help relieve sciatica pain and it really does work.  The quality is fabulous, especially at a great price.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  Product didn&#x27;t work my nail fungus, but could be because I want consistent enough.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected quality is great.</li>
            <li> Product as promised.  Extremely fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I chose thyme to dissipate the bump on my wrist.  Praise God, it is dissolving!!!  So glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for! QUALITY!</li>
            <li> I combine two drops of Cedar Wood essential oil, two drops of Thyme essential oil, three drops of Lavender essential oil and three drops Rosemary essential oil to 1/2 ounce of a carrier oil( Grapeseed oil, olive oil, coconut oil,jojoba oil, black jamaican castor oil ). I personally alternate between Castor and Jojoba oil with the other 4 essential oils. It has reduced my hair-shedding significantly and increased my hair growth slightly but I have only used the oils 4 or 5 times so far. I am going to give it a month and then check hair thickness.</li>
            <li> Been wanting to try essential oils and these are packaged nicely and are priced well.  Will buy some more soon.</li>
            <li> I had a reaction so it didn&#x27;t work for me.  For the price I didn&#x27;t bother returning.</li>
            <li> Excellent price! Good quality!</li>
            <li> Shipped very nicely in a gift box. The oils are wonderful. I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Very strong smell..but works..</li>
            <li> Great Transaction, product of great quality, delivery was quick and experience was wonderful!</li>
            <li> I heard how well tea tree works on wounds so gave it a try.  It&#x27;s a miracle in a bottle.</li>
            <li> Be careful on delicate skin, but diluted it is truly helpful for skin conditions. I&#x27;ve diluted mine in shampoo to help with itching and rash on scalp. A big help.</li>
            <li> Thyme eliminates the bacteria in the air. mostly the influenza virus.  I use it all the time especially going out. would put a drop in the diffuser and it will last a&lt;br /&gt;long while...</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly!  This oils are amazing!!!  Great product!!</li>
            <li> great product. I mix this with my toner for my skin. It keeps me oil freeeeeeeee all day long&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for making this available and so easy to find.</li>
            <li> Use this for my own hair oil mixture</li>
            <li> The product arrived in a timely manner, and is exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to oils and bought several of this brand to start with. They seem good to me, but I&#x27;m a beginner so take that for what it&#x27;s worth. They smell strong and do not look watery.</li>
