            <li>It feels soft and holds an exquisite shine.  </li>
            <li>It is very light on the hair and makes hair shine like stars.  </li>
            <li>The Exquisite Oil line has turned my extremely dry and damaged hair into smooth SILK beyond belief!!</li>

            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ll be shorted even more because there are 4 bottles instead of 2.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>but this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>This is a much better value with the price and product size.</li>
            <li>This worked okay</li>
            <li>, it is better than nothing.</li>
            <li>Fragrance is just okay; nothing fancy.</li>
            <li>It provides a healthy shine, it strengthens my hair, and it keeps it nourished and moisturized throughout the wintry seasons.</li>
            <li>I give it a million!  :)</li>
            <li>Love it......</li>
            <li>The oil was okay.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>THIS :)</li>
            <li>Love all these products.</li>
            <li>This product is like magic, tames frizzy hair and brings out the highlights of my hair.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product, and just bought the shampoo and conditioner too.</li>
            <li>but this one absorbs better and never leaves my hair looking greasy.  </li>
            <li>Love this addition to my hair care products.  </li>
            <li>otherwise OK.  </li>
            <li>But they could have done a better packaging job.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>After air drying my hair feels silkier and healthier than ever (even after just the first use!)!!  </li>
            <li>Absolutely worth the cost!!</li>
            <li>This stuff works miracles on my semi wavy dry hair and it smells wonderful!</li>
            <li>so you might have to wash your hair more than its needed starting the drying process all over but the good news is it works great after the first time.</li>
            <li>This will make sure your hair transforms course to silky smooth, A matter of seconds</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true: my hair improves with every use, and I have people tell me how healthy it looks.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair, and a somewhat oily scalp, so I was hesitant to use anything oil-based.  </li>
            <li>While I am still trying to grow out the dyed color, this oil works really well to keep my hair nice and soft and it smells nice too!</li>
            <li>it really gave my hair a beautiful shine without feeling greasy and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Light weight, not greasy.</li>
            <li>For most of my life I had &#x27;virgin&#x27; hair - never dyed, rarely used heat products on it, etc.</li>
            <li>Service was prompt and secure.</li>
            <li>I received this oil free with my purchase of Biolage shampoo and never thought I would use it, but am so thankful I brought it with me.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair smooth, snarl free and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I found what I thought to be a great sale on some products which actually turned my hair into straw!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make hair greasy and works great with a flat iron.</li>
            <li>I keeps it nourished and is great for applying to my hair after flat ironing it.</li>
            <li>So I was excited to use this product.  </li>
            <li>This product is the best for thick and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>and it is the only product I can find that works this good.</li>
            <li>Got full size product and it is now part of my product graveyard</li>
            <li>It is nice and thick, has good volume, dries straight, and has a lovely golden light brown color (some people call me blond).  </li>
            <li>The oil based product is exactly what my hair needed!</li>
            <li>Matrix hair oils are worth the money</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it was worth the cost.</li>
            <li>I love the product and it makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>The oil smells nice and really makes your hair shine and feel soft.  </li>
            <li>Love might be strong word for a hair product but this has transformed my dry brittle hair into lustrous locks thak you</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try Loreal&#x27;s new sulfate free line, including deep conditioning mask to see if happy with results for about a third of the price of this product.</li>
            <li>They both cost a few dollars more and work much better.</li>
            <li>Naturally, I had high hopes with some skepticism that they could do anything more than what I was already using</li>
            <li>They should be more specific in their description of what they are going to send you.</li>
            <li>Especially if shipping is free!</li>
            <li>I love this oil, will definitely purchase again when I run out.</li>
            <li>I was a skeptic, and not an avid user of a lot of hair product.  </li>
            <li>I will probably have an issue with the cost associated with getting a bigger bottle. :)</li>
            <li>The 3 oz size should last me more than 6 months.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>Great product for thick unmanageable hair and does not make my hair feel greasy.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>To make sure it wasn&#x27;t a fluke, I tried it again yesterday and got the same results.</li>
            <li>And THAT was just the first time I used these products.</li>
            <li>It is great for my hair type and works well when my hair is wet or dry, my hair stylist recommended it to me a few months ago and it is awesome, it is little pricey, but it is worth it!!</li>
            <li>This is good to put in hair before color, but weighs down and costs much more than other water soluable products.</li>
            <li>I have previously used Exquisite Oil but had trouble finding a replacement when I ran out.</li>
            <li>Makes hair nice and shiny- and little greasy if you apply too much.</li>
            <li>great product you only need a little</li>
            <li>keep this product in my cabinet, but won’t be using it much.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light oil, but it penetrates deeply into the strands of hair.</li>
            <li>my hair is very shinny.</li>
            <li>fast delivery, reasonable pricing</li>
            <li>highly recommend trying this product!</li>
            <li>Fast service as well</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite hair care product.&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair, and it can become very damaged with excessive blow drying, straightening/curling.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, and this oil does not weight it down or make it appear greasy.  </li>
            <li>I love this product for my extremely curly hair.</li>
            <li>saw the amazing reviews of this product, and have been a Biolage shampoo/conditioner user for the past 2 years.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Background on my hair – my hair is super low maintenance.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve removed the long rant I originally posted and revised my review.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for ANYONE!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>With all the fake hair products flying around on Amazon, I was so happy that this wasn&#x27;t one of them.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, so I was concerned about this weighing my hair down- not an issue!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products to tame frizz</li>
            <li>My oil from fructis seems to work better on my hair to tame frizz</li>
            <li>and I rarely use any heated styling tools (flat iron maybe 3-4 times a year type girl).  </li>
            <li>We live in the desert so dryness has always been an issue for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used so many products on my hair to mimic the same look I get from a professional blow dry</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and silky using this product!</li>
            <li>disappointed that the company didn&#x27;t even call to ask if this switch was okay!!!!</li>
            <li>the vendor did not send me the \\&quot;advertised\\&quot; bottle, the oil itself is stellar, especially as a pre-poo treatment.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I usually purchase these at the salon but the price here was so much better.</li>
            <li>this product is great for my hair, In have been using Moroccan oil for the past couple of years and my hair was too heavy</li>
            <li>My hair is fairly thick, but it breaks easily every fall/winter season due to our air becoming drier.</li>
            <li>Just a little dab of this helps to bring back the shine and make it more manageable.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t see different</li>
            <li>This oil really helped bring it back to life.</li>
            <li>This product leaves your hair feeling amazingly soft.</li>
            <li>I know nearly everyone starts thier reviews with, \\&quot;I never write reviews...</li>
            <li>Would recommend this to all that want soft hair.</li>
            <li>Literally, my hair was so damaged by those products the ends were all completely split</li>
            <li>wow</li>
            <li>Never in my life have I had such soft, shiny, frizz-free, beautifully-smelling hair!!</li>
            <li>Not only is my hair really touchably soft, I simply could not believe the SHINE!!</li>
            <li>Recommended to several friends who completely agree!</li>
            <li>So, after cutting out all the split ends, I decided to go with the Biolage products because they were good and really weren&#x27;t &#x27;over the top&#x27; expensive.</li>
            <li>I went back to the other treatment that I had been using previously, and I got better results with that</li>
            <li>If you are sulfate free due to dry hair as I, consider other new water soluable moisture treatments.</li>

            <li> The oil was okay.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> THIS :)</li>
            <li> Love all these products.</li>
            <li> This product is like magic, tames frizzy hair and brings out the highlights of my hair.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, and just bought the shampoo and conditioner too.</li>
            <li> but this one absorbs better and never leaves my hair looking greasy.  </li>
            <li> Love this addition to my hair care products.  </li>
            <li> otherwise OK.  </li>
            <li> But they could have done a better packaging job.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> After air drying my hair feels silkier and healthier than ever (even after just the first use!)!!  </li>
            <li> Absolutely worth the cost!!</li>
            <li> This stuff works miracles on my semi wavy dry hair and it smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> so you might have to wash your hair more than its needed starting the drying process all over but the good news is it works great after the first time.</li>
            <li> This will make sure your hair transforms course to silky smooth, A matter of seconds</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true: my hair improves with every use, and I have people tell me how healthy it looks.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair, and a somewhat oily scalp, so I was hesitant to use anything oil-based.  </li>
            <li> While I am still trying to grow out the dyed color, this oil works really well to keep my hair nice and soft and it smells nice too!</li>
            <li> it really gave my hair a beautiful shine without feeling greasy and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Light weight, not greasy.</li>
            <li> For most of my life I had &#x27;virgin&#x27; hair - never dyed, rarely used heat products on it, etc.</li>
            <li> Service was prompt and secure.</li>
            <li> I received this oil free with my purchase of Biolage shampoo and never thought I would use it, but am so thankful I brought it with me.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair smooth, snarl free and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I found what I thought to be a great sale on some products which actually turned my hair into straw!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make hair greasy and works great with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I keeps it nourished and is great for applying to my hair after flat ironing it.</li>
            <li> So I was excited to use this product.  </li>
            <li> This product is the best for thick and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> and it is the only product I can find that works this good.</li>
            <li> Got full size product and it is now part of my product graveyard</li>
            <li> It is nice and thick, has good volume, dries straight, and has a lovely golden light brown color (some people call me blond).  </li>
            <li> The oil based product is exactly what my hair needed!</li>
            <li> Matrix hair oils are worth the money</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it was worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I love the product and it makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> The oil smells nice and really makes your hair shine and feel soft.  </li>
            <li> Love might be strong word for a hair product but this has transformed my dry brittle hair into lustrous locks thak you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try Loreal&#x27;s new sulfate free line, including deep conditioning mask to see if happy with results for about a third of the price of this product.</li>
            <li> They both cost a few dollars more and work much better.</li>
            <li> Naturally, I had high hopes with some skepticism that they could do anything more than what I was already using</li>
            <li> They should be more specific in their description of what they are going to send you.</li>
            <li> Especially if shipping is free!</li>
            <li> I love this oil, will definitely purchase again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I was a skeptic, and not an avid user of a lot of hair product.  </li>
            <li> I will probably have an issue with the cost associated with getting a bigger bottle. :)</li>
            <li> The 3 oz size should last me more than 6 months.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> Great product for thick unmanageable hair and does not make my hair feel greasy.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> To make sure it wasn&#x27;t a fluke, I tried it again yesterday and got the same results.</li>
            <li> And THAT was just the first time I used these products.</li>
            <li> It is great for my hair type and works well when my hair is wet or dry, my hair stylist recommended it to me a few months ago and it is awesome, it is little pricey, but it is worth it!!</li>
            <li> This is good to put in hair before color, but weighs down and costs much more than other water soluable products.</li>
            <li> I have previously used Exquisite Oil but had trouble finding a replacement when I ran out.</li>
            <li> Makes hair nice and shiny- and little greasy if you apply too much.</li>
            <li> great product you only need a little</li>
            <li> keep this product in my cabinet, but won’t be using it much.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light oil, but it penetrates deeply into the strands of hair.</li>
            <li> my hair is very shinny.</li>
            <li> fast delivery, reasonable pricing</li>
            <li> highly recommend trying this product!</li>
            <li> Fast service as well</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite hair care product.&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair, and it can become very damaged with excessive blow drying, straightening/curling.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, and this oil does not weight it down or make it appear greasy.  </li>
            <li> I love this product for my extremely curly hair.</li>
            <li> saw the amazing reviews of this product, and have been a Biolage shampoo/conditioner user for the past 2 years.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Background on my hair – my hair is super low maintenance.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve removed the long rant I originally posted and revised my review.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for ANYONE!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> With all the fake hair products flying around on Amazon, I was so happy that this wasn&#x27;t one of them.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, so I was concerned about this weighing my hair down- not an issue!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products to tame frizz</li>
            <li> My oil from fructis seems to work better on my hair to tame frizz</li>
            <li> and I rarely use any heated styling tools (flat iron maybe 3-4 times a year type girl).  </li>
            <li> We live in the desert so dryness has always been an issue for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many products on my hair to mimic the same look I get from a professional blow dry</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft and silky using this product!</li>
            <li> disappointed that the company didn&#x27;t even call to ask if this switch was okay!!!!</li>
            <li> the vendor did not send me the \\&quot;advertised\\&quot; bottle, the oil itself is stellar, especially as a pre-poo treatment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually purchase these at the salon but the price here was so much better.</li>
            <li> this product is great for my hair, In have been using Moroccan oil for the past couple of years and my hair was too heavy</li>
            <li> My hair is fairly thick, but it breaks easily every fall/winter season due to our air becoming drier.</li>
            <li> Just a little dab of this helps to bring back the shine and make it more manageable.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see different</li>
            <li> This oil really helped bring it back to life.</li>
            <li> This product leaves your hair feeling amazingly soft.</li>
            <li> I know nearly everyone starts thier reviews with, \\&quot;I never write reviews...</li>
            <li> Would recommend this to all that want soft hair.</li>
            <li> Literally, my hair was so damaged by those products the ends were all completely split</li>
            <li> wow</li>
            <li> Never in my life have I had such soft, shiny, frizz-free, beautifully-smelling hair!!</li>
            <li> Not only is my hair really touchably soft, I simply could not believe the SHINE!!</li>
            <li> Recommended to several friends who completely agree!</li>
            <li> So, after cutting out all the split ends, I decided to go with the Biolage products because they were good and really weren&#x27;t &#x27;over the top&#x27; expensive.</li>
            <li> I went back to the other treatment that I had been using previously, and I got better results with that</li>
            <li> If you are sulfate free due to dry hair as I, consider other new water soluable moisture treatments.</li>
            <li> My partner, with long blonde hair, uses this as her regular goto treatment.</li>
            <li> This product not only took away the dry, straw-like texture, but it left my hair shiny and not at all greasy.  </li>
            <li> I have been on the lookout for something to really maintain my hair for the past 3+ years.  </li>
            <li> I do play with it a bit throughout the day, so that is the only reason I can think might cause my hair to become dry at the tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bought this and tried it as my hair is extremely dry, especially after blow drying it.</li>
            <li> I could not be happier with this product, and (although I&#x27;m not a professional by any means)</li>
            <li> I have a thyroid condition and my hair is turning grey.  </li>
            <li> It eaves my curls soft, shiny, defined and less frizzy!</li>
            <li> Will use it as long as I have long hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other products for this purpose.</li>
            <li> I never blow dry it or straighten it, dye/highlight it, and never style it.  </li>
            <li> I have really dry curly hair &amp; this oil</li>
            <li> I ordered this at the urging of my hairdresser when my hair was dry and straw-like.  </li>
            <li> I do, however, prefer the Aveda dry oil and Lanza&#x27;s damage remedy.</li>
            <li> As a result the hair was dry.</li>
            <li> I no longer have to deal with dry, brittle hair...</li>
            <li> and I was amazed how it turned my dry hair into a shinier and manageable style.  </li>
            <li> With my hair I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair but after I shower</li>
            <li> using this oil my hair is healthier than ever, and I am not experiencing dry brittle ends.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I put one or two pumps in my hand and ran it through my dry hair before styling it with the flat-iron.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m a single mom on a budget.)</li>
            <li> A little goes a long ways and this bottle will last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> my only con is that it should come in a larger bottle, but then knowing how we are never satisfied</li>
            <li> I am deployed in Afghanistan and the dry climate/hard water were destroying my hair: it was simply breaking off in my fingers.  </li>
            <li> I only wish the scent lasted a little longer.</li>
            <li> This product actually helped tame it.</li>
            <li> Takes less time to dry.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I shampoo every other day, and condition every other shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It only takes a small amount to make improvements.  </li>
            <li> Down My Hair.</li>
            <li> It does not weigh my hair down at all</li>
            <li> She is 11 with hair past the middle of her back, so needless to say this little bottle didn&#x27;t last long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair became so fried over the 2 and a half years of using box hair color on it.</li>
            <li> I previously bought this product suggested by a hairdresser at a salon.  </li>
            <li> I have medium long, dry, thin strand/high strand-count hair...</li>
            <li> It brings shine to my hair and it won&#x27;t leave it greasy or feeling heavy AT ALL.</li>
            <li> Two pumps for thick hair and applied to damp or wet hair</li>
            <li> I Have Heavy Thick Hair, So</li>
            <li> My hair is just past my shoulder</li>
            <li> I put it in my hair, leave it in for about an hour and wash and condition as usual.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past 6 months</li>
            <li> - Not real happy about that.  </li>
            <li> I started using a different shampoo (Biolage brand) 2 years ago, which made somewhat of a difference, but my hair still feels like straw after 1-2 months of cutting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been flat-ironing my hair quite a bit lately and decided to try this.</li>
            <li> I was desperate to find something that would put the life and softness back in.</li>
            <li> &quot; but I&#x27;m serious when I say it; I NEVER write reviews.  </li>
            <li> However the packaging was horrible and the bottle was damaged when I got it - the lower part was crushed.  </li>
            <li> but since it is impossible to get ever drop out of the bottle</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mainly annoying, just list the product as you have it</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this product is great for my hair, In have been using Moroccan oil for the past couple of years and my hair was too heavy, I think it got use to the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this one makes my hair silky and gives shine and volume to it.</li>
            <li> It is great for my hair type and works well when my hair is wet or dry, my hair stylist recommended it to me a few months ago and it is awesome, it is little pricey, but it is worth it!! great buy</li>
            <li> Love might be strong word for a hair product but this has transformed my dry brittle hair into lustrous locks thak you</li>
            <li> Love it. I like the way it makes my hair feel after I shampoo and than use the conditioner with this product.</li>
            <li> Matrix hair oils are worth the money</li>
            <li> Makes hair nice and shiny- and little greasy if you apply too much. Smells out of this world!!!</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft and silky using this product!</li>
            <li> Once tried, I can&#x27;t see my hair&#x27;s life without it.  Fantastic!  Doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy and gives a good protection from drying and split ends.  Will use it as long as I have long hair!</li>
            <li> I have been on the lookout for something to really maintain my hair for the past 3+ years.  I started using a different shampoo (Biolage brand) 2 years ago, which made somewhat of a difference, but my hair still feels like straw after 1-2 months of cutting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Background on my hair – my hair is super low maintenance.  It is nice and thick, has good volume, dries straight, and has a lovely golden light brown color (some people call me blond).  I never blow dry it or straighten it, dye/highlight it, and never style it.  I do play with it a bit throughout the day, so that is the only reason I can think might cause my hair to become dry at the tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw the amazing reviews of this product, and have been a Biolage shampoo/conditioner user for the past 2 years.  So I was excited to use this product.  However, this product had no impact on my hair, I couldn&#x27;t see a difference.  The tips of my hair still feel like straw, even after I had been using this product for several months.  I went back to the other treatment that I had been using previously, and I got better results with that product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ll keep this product in my cabinet, but won’t be using it much.</li>
            <li> I have really dry curly hair &amp; this oil helps contain frizz &amp; soften my curls. It&#x27;s lightweight, it smells good, and it works.</li>
            <li> There are three different types of this product:  Protective, Softening and Strenthening.  I did not know that when I ordered this.  I was expecting to receive the one that is in the picture (it appears to be the protective one) that I had purchased from somewhere else before.  What I received was a &amp;#34;monoi oil blend&amp;#34;.  I am not a fan of the smell of this one.  It does make your hair feel amazing, but I would have preferred the protective one.  They should be more specific in their description of what they are going to send you.</li>
            <li> instead of getting 2, 3.1 oz bottles I got 4 travel sized bottles.  not only was a shorted in ounces but since it is impossible to get ever drop out of the bottle i&#x27;ll be shorted even more because there are 4 bottles instead of 2.  disappointed that the company didn&#x27;t even call to ask if this switch was okay!!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff works miracles on my semi wavy dry hair and it smells wonderful! I only wish the scent lasted a little longer.</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended it and I&#x27;m glad I bought it. It brings shine to my hair and it won&#x27;t leave it greasy or feeling heavy AT ALL.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products to tame frizz but this is my favorite.  Doesn&#x27;t make hair greasy and works great with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> It does work well but you also get build up so you might have to wash your hair more than its needed starting the drying process all over but the good news is it works great after the first time.</li>
            <li> Light weight, not greasy. I use  it with the shampoo and conditioner. I love the smell! would buy it again. Especially if shipping is free!</li>
            <li> I tried the Moroccan oil from salons but this is just as good. This is a much better value with the price and product size.</li>
            <li> I ordered this at the urging of my hairdresser when my hair was dry and straw-like.  I have fine hair, and a somewhat oily scalp, so I was hesitant to use anything oil-based.  This product not only took away the dry, straw-like texture, but it left my hair shiny and not at all greasy.  Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> This product is the best for thick and frizzy hair. Will buy this again and from the same place. thanks</li>
            <li> A co-worker recommended this oil to me and I had to try it out. It eaves my curls soft, shiny, defined and less frizzy! I have received various compliments on my hair after using this product.I love this oil, will definitely purchase again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I received two 1.5 oz bottles, not one 3.1 oz. bottle as advertised.  - Not real happy about that.  So, buyer beware!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;3-24-14&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve removed the long rant I originally posted and revised my review.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m upgrading my rating from 2 stars to 5 BECAUSE altho&#x27; the vendor did not send me the \\&quot;advertised\\&quot; bottle, the oil itself is stellar, especially as a pre-poo treatment.&lt;br /&gt;This is really a remarkable oil.  Does amazing things for my hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this and tried it as my hair is extremely dry, especially after blow drying it. I&#x27;ve tried several other products for this purpose. This worked okay, it is better than nothing. I do, however, prefer the Aveda dry oil and Lanza&#x27;s damage remedy. They both cost a few dollars more and work much better.</li>
            <li> A great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> Ive been using this product every day since last November and oh my gosh it works wonders. My hair became so fried over the 2 and a half years of using box hair color on it. While I am still trying to grow out the dyed color, this oil works really well to keep my hair nice and soft and it smells nice too! I will forever use this product and I recommend it to everyone and anyone! Two pumps for thick hair and applied to damp or wet hair and that&#x27;s it!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t do wonders, if that&#x27;s what you are expecting. Fragrance is just okay; nothing fancy.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see different</li>
            <li> This oil is my holy grail of hair products. It&#x27;s a light oil, but it penetrates deeply into the strands of hair. Plus, as a bonus it smells delicious. My hair is fairly thick, but it breaks easily every fall/winter season due to our air becoming drier. I began using this product as a solution for the breakage. For most of my life I had &#x27;virgin&#x27; hair - never dyed, rarely used heat products on it, etc. I take great care of it. I started using this oil before dying my hair. I dyed it about three months ago, and part of the process was bleaching the lower strands of my hair. As a result the hair was dry. This oil really helped bring it back to life. I apply it after every shower, and I work it thoroughly through my hair, then let it air-dry. It never makes my scalp oily or sticky, and it doesn&#x27;t interfere with styling my hair, either. It&#x27;s also a lifesaver for taming post-hairdo flyaways. It provides a healthy shine, it strengthens my hair, and it keeps it nourished and moisturized throughout the wintry seasons. Definitely a product I&#x27;d recommend adding to your hair care repertoire.</li>
            <li> Best treatment I&#x27;ve ever used, takes away frizz and makes hair soft but manageable!  Recommended to several friends who completely agree!</li>
            <li> The packaging of the product was excellent and the product itself was light and gave my hair maximum shine !</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, so I was concerned about this weighing my hair down- not an issue!! I use this in the shower (I put a couple drops in my conditioner), plus I put a couple of drops in it when I&#x27;ve combed my hair out. I no longer have to deal with dry, brittle hair... Or frizz! We live in the desert so dryness has always been an issue for me. Absolutely worth the cost!!</li>
            <li> This is good to put in hair before color, but weighs down and costs much more than other water soluable products. If you are sulfate free due to dry hair as I, consider other new water soluable moisture treatments. I&#x27;m going to try Loreal&#x27;s new sulfate free line, including deep conditioning mask to see if happy with results for about a third of the price of this product. This seller was prompt.</li>
            <li> If you want shinny hair, this is the product to use.  It is very light on the hair and makes hair shine like stars.  I will buy it again. It&#x27;s also good for hands and feet.  Yes, hands and feet.  Try it.</li>
            <li> This product leaves your hair feeling amazingly soft. I have superbly curly hair and it is the only product I can find that works this good.</li>
            <li> I know nearly everyone starts thier reviews with, \\&quot;I never write reviews...blah blah blah,\\&quot; but I&#x27;m serious when I say it; I NEVER write reviews.  So, let&#x27;s hop to it shall we?  This Exquisite Oil is so great!!  My stylist recommended it to me, since I color treat my hair.  I was a skeptic, and not an avid user of a lot of hair product.  I don&#x27;t blowdry EVER and I rarely use any heated styling tools (flat iron maybe 3-4 times a year type girl).  I shampoo every other day, and condition every other shampoo.  I use Bed Head EVERYTHING, until now!  I have medium long, dry, thin strand/high strand-count hair...I use 2 drops of this oil after showering as a detangler.  After air drying my hair feels silkier and healthier than ever (even after just the first use!)!!  It feels soft and holds an exquisite shine.  I could not be happier with this product, and (although I&#x27;m not a professional by any means) I highly recommend it for ANYONE!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short:  Great shine, great smell, great product!!  On a scale of 1-100 I give it a million!  :)</li>
            <li> Love it......my hair is very shinny.</li>
            <li> This is one of the better oils for calming the fly away hair without being over oily on your hair.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!!!  I use it every time I do my hair.  The oil based product is exactly what my hair needed!</li>
            <li> I use this on my daughter and it works beautifully! She is 11 with hair past the middle of her back, so needless to say this little bottle didn&#x27;t last long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my only con is that it should come in a larger bottle, but then knowing how we are never satisfied I will probably have an issue with the cost associated with getting a bigger bottle. :)</li>
            <li> I Cant Say Enough About This Oil, It Is Awesome On My Hair. I Have Heavy Thick Hair, So It Does Not&lt;br /&gt;Weigh Down My Hair. I Will Be Purchasing The Shampoo&#x27;s And Conditioner&#x27;s From Matrix Exquisite Next.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You From Florida.....</li>
            <li> My hairdresser  gave me a sample size and I was amazed how it turned my dry hair into a shinier and manageable style.  It only takes a small amount to make improvements.  It&#x27;s especially good for hair that has undergone coloring treatment.  The 3 oz size should last me more than 6 months.</li>
            <li> yep, great stuff for your hair, fast delivery, reasonable pricing</li>
            <li> The oil was okay.  It did not penetrate in my hair very good.  I don&#x27;t think it was worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Instead of sending me one 3.1oz container, I was sent two 1.5oz containers. In something as concentrated as oil, that .1oz does matter. It&#x27;s mainly annoying, just list the product as you have it so there&#x27;s no surprise on delivery.</li>
            <li> I have a permanent case of frizzy hair. This product actually helped tame it.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> Makes your hair so shine and fill so good. Love the smell</li>
            <li> I like the matrix biolage exquisite oil. With my hair I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair but after I shower I put the oil on my hair this is a good treatment that don&#x27;t leave hair oily. This oil has a fine smell nice</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite hair care product.&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair, and it can become very damaged with excessive blow drying, straightening/curling. I have found myself keeping my hair fairly short (chin length) because my ends become so heat damaged. This product has allowed me to grow my hair longer without the heat damage issues.&lt;br /&gt;I tried a free sample of Exquisite Oil, and it is now a must have product. I use a dime size amount on damp hair, just before blow drying. I try to avoid applying the product to my roots.&lt;br /&gt;By using this oil my hair is healthier than ever, and I am not experiencing dry brittle ends.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend trying this product!</li>
            <li> This will make sure your hair transforms course to silky smooth, A matter of seconds</li>
            <li> I have a thyroid condition and my hair is turning grey.  Between the two, my hair is getting course and is losing it&#x27;s shine.  Just a little dab of this helps to bring back the shine and make it more manageable.  I bought some at the beauty shop for almost twice the price so this was definitely a deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many products on my hair to mimic the same look I get from a professional blow dry I&#x27;ve lost count. This one is exceptional..it really gave my hair a beautiful shine without feeling greasy and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works well with my frizzy hair which resists styling and it helps get it straightened out.  My hair dresser turned me onto this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product for my extremely curly hair. I keeps it nourished and is great for applying to my hair after flat ironing it. It does not weigh my hair down at all and it does not leave a greasy feeling. I love it!</li>
            <li> This is a very good self-treatment hair product. My partner, with long blonde hair, uses this as her regular goto treatment. It does a great job on caring for the hair and for giving it a special sheen. The bottles are nice sized also if you are traveling. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I ordered one 3.1oz bottle of Matrix Biolage Exquisite Oil. What I received was two 1.5oz bottles. Close but not quite. Sell what you advertise, it&#x27;s as simple as that.</li>
            <li> I previously bought this product suggested by a hairdresser at a salon.  Great product for thick unmanageable hair and does not make my hair feel greasy.</li>
            <li> With all the fake hair products flying around on Amazon, I was so happy that this wasn&#x27;t one of them. I&#x27;ve been using this Biolage Oil for a while since my hair stylist used it on me and it works great and smells great. Leaves my hair so soft and smooth. Even when I tease it, I don&#x27;t have the frizzy fly aways! LOVE THIS :) Fast service as well</li>
            <li> I bought thi along with the shampoo and conditioner. Love all these products. I use the oil after I&#x27;m done drying and finishing my hair just to keep the frizzies away. My hair is just past my shoulder and I only use 1 drop. A little goes a long ways and this bottle will last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> a very good deal, was sealed and not tampered with . would buy again&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s easier to get here than risk my salon being out AGAIN!</li>
            <li> Wonderful buy I usually purchase these at the salon but the price here was so much better. I love the product and it makes my hair so soft. Would recommend this to all that want soft hair.</li>
            <li> I have ordered two bottles of this hair oil. It works very well, and can be used a few different ways. Before styling, as a over night deep oil treatment, and use to add to your hair conditioner. A little goes a long way. Highly recommend this product. Awesome for chemically treated hair. Hope my review helps. Oh, it smells really good too:D</li>
            <li> This product is like magic, tames frizzy hair and brings out the highlights of my hair. I have previously used Exquisite Oil but had trouble finding a replacement when I ran out. Service was prompt and secure.</li>
            <li> great product you only need a little</li>
            <li> I am deployed in Afghanistan and the dry climate/hard water were destroying my hair: it was simply breaking off in my fingers.  I received this oil free with my purchase of Biolage shampoo and never thought I would use it, but am so thankful I brought it with me.  It&#x27;s true: my hair improves with every use, and I have people tell me how healthy it looks.  I have very fine hair, and this oil does not weight it down or make it appear greasy.  I absolutely love this product, and just bought the shampoo and conditioner too.</li>
            <li> My oil from fructis seems to work better on my hair to tame frizz but this one absorbs better and never leaves my hair looking greasy.  Still searching for the perfect product.</li>
            <li> Love this addition to my hair care products.  Makes my hair smooth, snarl free and shiny.  Takes less time to dry.</li>
            <li> The oil smells nice and really makes your hair shine and feel soft.  However the packaging was horrible and the bottle was damaged when I got it - the lower part was crushed.  I did not return it because it was not leaking and otherwise OK.  But they could have done a better packaging job.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine works at a salon and comes to my home to do my hair for me. (I&#x27;m a single mom on a budget.) About a year ago she left me a tiny bottle of this stuff, which I didn&#x27;t touch until a week ago. I&#x27;ve been flat-ironing my hair quite a bit lately and decided to try this. I put one or two pumps in my hand and ran it through my dry hair before styling it with the flat-iron. Never in my life have I had such soft, shiny, frizz-free, beautifully-smelling hair!! To make sure it wasn&#x27;t a fluke, I tried it again yesterday and got the same results. I will be buying a larger bottle of this as my go-to product from now on!!</li>
            <li> I use this oil about once a week. I put it in my hair, leave it in for about an hour and wash and condition as usual. It has been great for my hair after a weekend in the ocean water and sun!</li>
            <li> my wife was very satisfied with the  quality of the product and quantity of the product for the price delivered</li>
            <li> awesome product great delivery and great price.</li>
            <li> I was on a budget and couldn&#x27;t afford to spend a lot of money on shampoo and conditioner for my hair. I found what I thought to be a great sale on some products which actually turned my hair into straw! Literally, my hair was so damaged by those products the ends were all completely split and it &#x27;crunched&#x27; when I scrunched it in my hands. I was desperate to find something that would put the life and softness back in. I needed to buy something good! So, after cutting out all the split ends, I decided to go with the Biolage products because they were good and really weren&#x27;t &#x27;over the top&#x27; expensive. I decided to purchase their line of Ultra-hydrating shampoo and conditioner. I was happy and they were doing a really good job UNTIL Biolage came out with the Exquisite Oil line!! I purchased them and brought them home. Naturally, I had high hopes with some skepticism that they could do anything more than what I was already using BUT, let me tell you, not only do they smell amazing but OMG, the Exquisite Oil line did ABSOLUTE WONDERS for my hair!!! Not only is my hair really touchably soft, I simply could not believe the SHINE!! And THAT was just the first time I used these products. The second time around it was even softer!! This stuff has got to be the BEST line of products I have EVER had the PLEASURE of using!!! The Exquisite Oil line has turned my extremely dry and damaged hair into smooth SILK beyond belief!! I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this stuff!!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I am from Canada and spend my winters in Florida.  With the humidity my hair felt like straw until I tried this oil!</li>
            <li> i love it!!! I have been using this product for the past 6 months and I just love it! wow</li>
            <li> had a sample of this and thought it was great. Got full size product and it is now part of my product graveyard</li>
            <li> This product takes the freeze out from my hair and also my hair looks very healthy since I use this product.</li>
