            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>Was pleased with the superb service from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, glides on smooth and blends perfectly.</li>
            <li>it is a really good item to buy.</li>
            <li>Have loved this blush for years, yet cannot seem to find it in stores any more.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very light.</li>
            <li>I was contacted again to check and see if I was satisfied with everything.</li>
            <li>hope this helps :)</li>
            <li>even when layered on top of its self,</li>
            <li>Love this blush.  </li>
            <li>This is such a wonderful blush!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still satisfied with my product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>was not too excited when I found out that Almay is discontinuing this product!</li>
            <li>Feel free to put more product on...</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s easy on my skin and this fits the bill.</li>
            <li>This item is not often in the stores and isn&#x27;t cheap.  </li>
            <li>cheap offorable and no problems.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t accentuate my maturing skin flaws.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The label claims that you can \\&quot;build\\&quot; the color, but that simply isn&#x27;t true.</li>
            <li>so I was truly glad to get it here at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>when i got mine it came quick and excatly when it was supossed to.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to find a nice sheer blush</li>
            <li>It was the most natural looking blush I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it goes on and looks natural.</li>
            <li>right amount of coverage.</li>
            <li>BUT... I found the answer to the problem and now I like it very much as I am in my 50&#x27;s and a creme blush looks better on me than a dry blush which can look cakey over older skin.</li>
            <li>in real packeging                                                   </li>
            <li>I would recommend this blush to anyone that wants a hint of color and not a made up look.</li>
            <li>I like this product and was very glad to find it...worth the money even though postage sure could have been less on such a tiny package.</li>
            <li>It is just as expected, wonderful, as usual!</li>
            <li>I have dry and sensitive skin, this blush is very light and looks so</li>
            <li>I gave them a 5 star rating because of their professionalism and because they were able to deliver on a hard to find product.</li>
            <li>you now simply have more product on - but not more color.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years, I like it&#x27;s applicability and it stays on all day.</li>
            <li> The incorrect product initially arrived but once I contacted their customer service , I received my desired product within a couple of days and they provided me with a shipping label to return the item I didn&#x27;t want. I was contacted again to check and see if I was satisfied with everything. I gave them a 5 star rating because of their professionalism and because they were able to deliver on a hard to find product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Blends well &amp; I use it with my bronzer gel to get a perfect color for my skin. Was pleased with the superb service from Amazon. Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;Jude</li>
            <li> Seems like I can never go wrong with Almay and this blush is another example. I&#x27;ve been trying to find a nice sheer blush that&#x27;s easy on my skin and this fits the bill. Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, glides on smooth and blends perfectly.</li>
            <li> This item is not often in the stores and isn&#x27;t cheap.  It is one of few blushes that work for me. It goes on well and lasts long.</li>
            <li> it is a really good item to buy. cheap offorable and no problems. when i got mine it came quick and excatly when it was supossed to. it was also a perfect shade for me. if you would haveto pick between buying it here on amazon or at a store perhaps walgreens or other drugstores i would pick amazon WAY CHEAPER! and good quality! if your scared if its used defently not!! in real packeging                                                   hope this helps :)</li>
            <li> For quite a while I have looked for this blush at the local stores in town and couldn&#x27;t find it.  I have used this blush for a few years and it works so well with my skin tone.  You apply what you need and it just blends in.  I would recommend this blush to anyone that wants a hint of color and not a made up look.</li>
            <li> Very happy  with product as well as time it took to receive it...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years, now. It is just as expected, wonderful, as usual! Don&#x27;t change the formula!</li>
            <li> Love this product and was so sorry to see that it was discontinued.  It was the most natural looking blush I have ever used.  Wish they would start selling it again.</li>
            <li> Have loved this blush for years, yet cannot seem to find it in stores any more. Mix it with a tiny drop of moisturizer and you&#x27;re all set.</li>
            <li> I am light complected and it did not show up much on my bare cheek :( even when layered on top of its self,</li>
            <li> Love this blush.  It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t accentuate my maturing skin flaws.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This blush is hard to find in the stores now.  I love the way it goes on and looks natural.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last as long and it&#x27;s very light.</li>
            <li> I am an extremely pale white girl, and I have tried both the Berry and the Pink shades of this product, and neither show up on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;The label claims that you can \\&quot;build\\&quot; the color, but that simply isn&#x27;t true. Feel free to put more product on...you now simply have more product on - but not more color.</li>
            <li> This is such a wonderful blush! I have dry and sensitive skin, this blush is very light and looks so natural!&lt;br /&gt;I was not too excited when I found out that Almay is discontinuing this product!</li>
            <li> I saw alot of the reviews about the color/liquid separating in the tube, which indeed it does do. I tried kneading it, but that didn&#x27;t work. If you pressed on it, liquid color would spew out and you could possibly ruin whatever it spews on. BUT... I found the answer to the problem and now I like it very much as I am in my 50&#x27;s and a creme blush looks better on me than a dry blush which can look cakey over older skin. Shake it! No problem now...the shake lasts a while too.</li>
            <li> Finding the Almay blush in these tubes at the store seems impossible anymore. I like this product and was very glad to find it...worth the money even though postage sure could have been less on such a tiny package. I&#x27;m still satisfied with my product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having a hard time finding this product in stores so I was truly glad to get it here at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I love makeup in tubes, this goes on beautifully, not too heavy, just&lt;br /&gt;the right amount of coverage.</li>
