            <li>and I don&#x27;t not like it, but it doesn&#x27;t deserve a 3star but because its &#x27;okay&#x27; its going to get it.</li>
            <li>It would be great if the picture showed the wig on a real person so that you could get a better idea of the coverage.</li>
            <li>Held up well and was able to re-use and brush the wig.</li>

            <li>I get many complaints on it.</li>
            <li>Fantastic wig!</li>
            <li>I loved the wig when I first took it out of the package but as started to look at and wear it, It didn&#x27;t look like the picture.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it also came with a wig cap so thats good for first time</li>
            <li>It compares well to my wigs that easily cost 3 times more.</li>
            <li>and she couldn&#x27;t be more excited with the product.</li>
            <li>Easy to style asthe bangs</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have a cheap feel to it</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really fit well</li>
            <li>/&gt;The shipping on this item was fantastic, it got here</li>
            <li>/&gt;It feels incredibly cheap, which it is but still, it feels like barbie hair</li>
            <li>Free wig cap included.</li>
            <li>Was just perfect for my Pinkie Pie costume and several people asked if it was my real hair.</li>
            <li>I was really excited for this wig....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably end up wearing this one just for funsies because it does look so nice and maybe order some more in different colors.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is NOT as full as the photos show it to be, not even close.</li>
            <li>It worked out ok, but is definitely much thinner than it looks in the pictures.</li>
            <li>It included a cap as well as a net to keep the wig in good shape.</li>
            <li>Super value for the price, and got here before the earliest estimated date, so plenty of time for when I needed it.</li>
            <li>and is super curly.</li>
            <li>The color is just super cute and bright,even if is this kind of pink fushia color,is just lovelly.</li>
            <li>Arrived a day before it was even supposed to be here by, is the same as the picture and would work great for a Pinkie Pie cosplay :) Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>An for fun the girls put it on the horsey before they go for a ride.</li>
            <li>It was the right color and the right price for the cosplay I was throwing together..</li>
            <li>You can see the wig cap in multiple areas other than that its a fine wig that will be great in my collection.</li>
            <li>Its very, very thin!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Was exactly all we thought it would be.</li>
            <li>It really funny too.</li>
            <li>I love this wig I wear it daily if its on my head snuggly</li>
            <li>It looks exactly as the picture,</li>
            <li>But the wig is still pretty.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am extremely pleased and recommend this wig.</li>
            <li>A little less full than I imagined, but still perfect.</li>
            <li>The wig is a pretty color and very vibrant.</li>
            <li>I am glad I went ahead and bought it even though there were so many negative reviews.</li>
            <li>It was long, beautiful color pink and</li>
            <li>is exactly like the photo:  long hot pink wig.&lt;br /&gt;Tangles easily, but the quality is quite nice.</li>
            <li>Fun wig and was better quality than expected!  </li>
            <li>I needed a wig that would get here fast</li>
            <li>Mine came put to be more purple than pink.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much at the under $10 price range, and I feel I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li>I got what I expected a very cheap basic wig just for fun</li>
            <li>Loooove this soooo much, so soft and pretty.</li>
            <li>Overall not bad at all for the price</li>
            <li>This one was thick, long, and beautiful.</li>
            <li>It is super long and does tangle.</li>
            <li>Also, the color is the EXACT SHADE of hot Pink</li>
            <li>Also, it is rather voluminous which I appreciate because many wigs I&#x27;ve purchased in the past tend to be kind of thin and sparse.</li>
            <li>The wig is soft, and when I tried it on its not itchy in the slightest.</li>
            <li>But it is much thinner than the picture, which isn&#x27;t too big of an issue.</li>
            <li>only issue is that its not as long or full as it is in the picture&lt;</li>
            <li>I had seen this exact same wig on Ebay for $17-$26, and I would have gotten it MUCH later.</li>
            <li>anyone who wants to buy this product I definitely would I would definitely order from you again</li>
            <li>It is definitely not as thick or long as it appears in the picture.</li>
            <li>It BARELY fits on my 23 inch head</li>
            <li>I was a little apprehensive, I have never ordered a wig before and was concerned it might not come in on time, or be the right color, or not be curly enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It will work for what I&#x27;m cosplaying as, but after this up coming con I wont be using it for this specific cosplay, it&#x27;ll probably just be one of those random wigs I own and never use.&lt;br</li>

            <li> The cap of the wig showed through if it was not combed just right, the top is especially thin.</li>
            <li> head is quite small, doesn&#x27;t stretch very much to go over the average head, its like kid sized.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered pink purple and blue all at once.</li>
            <li> are long</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not even as long as the photo shows either.. and the mannequin head here has a long neck, showing that it would be very long on a person</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was shocked, surprised, and above all pleased by what i got in the mail a few days after ordering.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it was difficult to part to keep it from falling in my face like Cousin Itt, but I remedied that problem with some cute clips.</li>
            <li> The curls start to fall out almost immediately, and like most wigs of this length it&#x27;s impossible to keep it from getting tangled.</li>
            <li> I am wearing this wig for an upcoming Con and I wish I would have spent the extra to get a more expensive one, I am now searching local stores to find wefts to add because it is so thin.</li>
            <li> careful when buying this wig, it may not be what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> It was fake, but felt remotely like real hair!</li>
            <li> but I made it work buy braiding my hair and sticking it down my shirt and not putting it in the wig.</li>
            <li> It took a little longer to ship</li>
            <li> It was a frizzy mess!</li>
            <li> This wig was a big fail.</li>
            <li> but it comes just a couple inches past my</li>
            <li> well mine at least</li>
            <li> it matts up tho, so if you are going to buy it, buy at least two for a spare!</li>
            <li> i spent the money for bad quality.</li>
            <li> The wig was thin, I was expecting it to be thicker.</li>
            <li> I only gave this a 3star rating because I don&#x27;t hate it</li>
            <li> Not at all what it looks like in the picture and way too thin, you can see your wig cap and your hair.....</li>
            <li> /&gt;First we&#x27;ve got false advertising..</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t want anything really expensive anyways.</li>
            <li> Upset and very unhappy</li>

            <li> Super value for the price, and got here before the earliest estimated date, so plenty of time for when I needed it. Doesn&#x27;t have a cheap feel to it and I haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding. My only complaint is that it was difficult to part to keep it from falling in my face like Cousin Itt, but I remedied that problem with some cute clips. Was just perfect for my Pinkie Pie costume and several people asked if it was my real hair. I&#x27;ll probably end up wearing this one just for funsies because it does look so nice and maybe order some more in different colors.</li>
            <li> This wig was a big fail. Will not be buying from MapOfBeauty ever again. See pictures. Ripping of the cap and the cap showing not enough hair.</li>
            <li> Great and good quality.</li>
            <li> Was exactly all we thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really fit well..prob use for smaller children.</li>
            <li> I loved the wig when I first took it out of the package but as started to look at and wear it, It didn&#x27;t look like the picture. The wig was thin, I was expecting it to be thicker. But I still love to wear it. The colour is beautiful! I just wished that the hair was thicker.</li>
            <li> My girls love it for play . An for fun the girls put it on the horsey before they go for a ride. It really funny too.</li>
            <li> I love this wig I wear it daily if its on my head snuggly I don&#x27;t have to worry about it falling off it doesn&#x27;t itch my head anyone who wants to buy this product I definitely would I would definitely order from you again</li>
            <li> I only gave this a 3star rating because I don&#x27;t hate it and I don&#x27;t not like it, but it doesn&#x27;t deserve a 3star but because its &#x27;okay&#x27; its going to get it. Anyway..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipping on this item was fantastic, it got here two days after I had placed the order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wig itself.. well that&#x27;s another story..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First we&#x27;ve got false advertising..&lt;br /&gt;Its darker than the photos show it to be.&lt;br /&gt;It is NOT as full as the photos show it to be, not even close. Its very, very thin!&lt;br /&gt;It is not even as long as the photo shows either.. and the mannequin head here has a long neck, showing that it would be very long on a person but it comes just a couple inches past my shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then we have the quality and size..&lt;br /&gt;It feels incredibly cheap, which it is but still, it feels like barbie hair only cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;The head is quite small, doesn&#x27;t stretch very much to go over the average head, its like kid sized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh well, I suppose you get what you pay for. I needed a wig that would get here fast and it did. It will work for what I&#x27;m cosplaying as, but after this up coming con I wont be using it for this specific cosplay, it&#x27;ll probably just be one of those random wigs I own and never use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yeah..&lt;br /&gt;Be careful when buying this wig, it may not be what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> Before I purchased, I read the reviews and there were a lot of mixed ones. I was hesitant to purchase but I figured because of the inexpensive price that I would go ahead and buy it and see it for myself. I only intend on wearing it to a concert and halloween parties so I didn&#x27;t want anything really expensive anyways. It looks exactly as the picture, well mine at least :) I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with this purchase. I am glad I went ahead and bought it even though there were so many negative reviews. It was long, beautiful color pink and the hair quality felt good to me and the wig was delivered 4 days after I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I am wearing this wig for an upcoming Con and I wish I would have spent the extra to get a more expensive one, I am now searching local stores to find wefts to add because it is so thin. You can see the wig cap in multiple areas other than that its a fine wig that will be great in my collection.</li>
            <li> Shipping took almost a month but its perfect and good for the price.</li>
            <li> This one was thick, long, and beautiful. Color was spot on. I ordered pink purple and blue all at once. This was the only one that met expectations. The others fell very short.</li>
            <li> The wig is a pretty color and very vibrant. It is definitely not as thick or long as it appears in the picture. It would be great if the picture showed the wig on a real person so that you could get a better idea of the coverage. Overall not bad at all for the price and I would purchase again. Keep it in the package until you wear it to your event!</li>
            <li> the color is just about the same&lt;br /&gt;it also came with a wig cap so thats good for first time wig buyers like myself&lt;br /&gt;i ordered it 11 days ago and it was estimated to arrive between the 11th and 28th of next month so dont worry about that estimate,itll most lkely arrive on time if you order a good week or two ahead of when you need it&lt;br /&gt;my only issue is that its not as long or full as it is in the picture&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its perfect for a pinkie pie cosplay and its one of the best priced ones i have found</li>
            <li> The wig does not look like the picture. Mine came put to be more purple than pink. I dont mind it, but it would not be a good color choice...</li>
            <li> Fun wig and was better quality than expected!  Held up well and was able to re-use and brush the wig.</li>
            <li> It was the right color and the right price for the cosplay I was throwing together.. It worked out ok, but is definitely much thinner than it looks in the pictures. The cap of the wig showed through if it was not combed just right, the top is especially thin. I didn&#x27;t expect much at the under $10 price range, and I feel I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> I had got this wig for my friend for Christmas. But the wig is not as curly at in the picture. But the wig is still pretty.</li>
            <li> I ordered this wig for a Pinkie Pie cosplay I am doing for an upcoming con. I was a little apprehensive, I have never ordered a wig before and was concerned it might not come in on time, or be the right color, or not be curly enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was shocked, surprised, and above all pleased by what i got in the mail a few days after ordering. The wig is soft, and when I tried it on its not itchy in the slightest. Also, the color is the EXACT SHADE of hot Pink I needed for Pinkie Pie. and is super curly. Its an extremely good quality wig, and fairly in-expensive... I had seen this exact same wig on Ebay for $17-$26, and I would have gotten it MUCH later. Overall, I am extremely pleased and recommend this wig.</li>
            <li> Perfect! A little less full than I imagined, but still perfect. I can use it for Pinkie Pie and Princess Bubblegum!</li>
            <li> Nice curls! Really perfect color, comfortable to wear and it hasn&#x27;t gotten too tangled yet. It photographs great and doesn&#x27;t show up too shiny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft and the length is perfect. The curls aren&#x27;t a problem! I love it!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my best friend for her birthday and she couldn&#x27;t be more excited with the product. The material is great ad it looks fabulous; just like the pictures!!</li>
            <li> I had to use a wig for a photo shoot and I loved this one! It was fake, but felt remotely like real hair! I was amazed.</li>
            <li> This is excellent quality, especially for the price! It included a cap as well as a net to keep the wig in good shape. It kept in great condition through a full day of wear!</li>
            <li> great wig!!! it matts up tho, so if you are going to buy it, buy at least two for a spare! (ignore my fave tho, its a make up test for feferi)</li>
            <li> I got what I expected a very cheap basic wig just for fun</li>
            <li> I was really excited for this wig.... but when it came in the mail. I took it out the package, and it was all knotted and tangled and it was not fixable. It was a frizzy mess! Upset and very unhappy i spent the money for bad quality.</li>
            <li> I received the wig in two weeks. Free wig cap included. ^__^&lt;br /&gt;Item is exactly like the photo:  long hot pink wig.&lt;br /&gt;Tangles easily, but the quality is quite nice.</li>
            <li> Arrived a day before it was even supposed to be here by, is the same as the picture and would work great for a Pinkie Pie cosplay :) Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Its great for my halloween costume its not the best wig I ever bought but the price is alot better</li>
            <li> The wig came on time, and the color is identical to the picture. But it is much thinner than the picture, which isn&#x27;t too big of an issue. Easy to style asthe bangs are long and it&#x27;s a very good quality wig. Works perfect for my trickster!Aradia.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful wig. It took a little longer to ship then I had hoped.&lt;br /&gt;It was perfect for my Halloween costume, MLP Pinkie Pie.&lt;br /&gt;Get wig conditioner, a wig comb, and a mannequin head! You will need it if you want or need to brush it out. It is super long and does tangle.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t try it on. Don&#x27;t take it out of the bag. The curls start to fall out almost immediately, and like most wigs of this length it&#x27;s impossible to keep it from getting tangled.</li>
            <li> Awsome,great communications.A++++++</li>
            <li> I cut this wig for a stawberry shortcake cosply. It BARELY fits on my 23 inch head but I made it work buy braiding my hair and sticking it down my shirt and not putting it in the wig.</li>
            <li> The color is just super cute and bright,even if is this kind of pink fushia color,is just lovelly. i will love to buy it more.</li>
            <li> Not at all what it looks like in the picture and way too thin, you can see your wig cap and your hair.....</li>
            <li> Loooove this soooo much, so soft and pretty. I&#x27;ll wear it any chance I can. I get many complaints on it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic wig! The curls are beautiful and not frizzy. Also, it is rather voluminous which I appreciate because many wigs I&#x27;ve purchased in the past tend to be kind of thin and sparse.</li>
            <li> Great quality! It compares well to my wigs that easily cost 3 times more. Amazing deal, super happy with it.</li>
