            <li> Love the product and the value. So sad they are discontinuing.!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t purchase  tube are dry....</li>
            <li> Product was unusable.It was caked solid</li>
            <li> The envoy is different from the order</li>
            <li> this product is very good</li>
            <li> This is the first mascara I have found that doesn&#x27;t have me groping at my eyeballs in discomfort midway through my day. It offers luxuriant coverage, and doesn&#x27;t flake off onto my corneas. It stays on my lashes! Now, hopefully Maybelline won&#x27;t discontinue or reformulate this cosmetic treasure...</li>
            <li> I just opened this today and I&#x27;m not sure if it was empty and repackaged or just old and dried out, but it is awful!</li>
            <li> It curls the eyelashes and goes on thick and doesn&#x27;t flake off.  I&#x27;ve had people think I was wearing false eyelashes - nope, it&#x27;s all the mascara!</li>
            <li> I received a more out-dated version of this mascara. Don&#x27;t let this fool you. It&#x27;s dried out, and not the right product.</li>
            <li> Not the best mascara ever but not the worst either</li>
            <li> I used 1 coat and had flakes and smudges. I was disappointed after reading other reviews as to how great it was.</li>
            <li> very dry and crumbly..</li>
            <li> been using this for years</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find this mascara anywhere and it&#x27;s the only brush I like.  I have so many mascaras I&#x27;ve bought through the years and never like them.  Also washable is great since I like it to come off easily.</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara and its the only one I buy. This particular one that I recieved was old.</li>
            <li> Excellent Transaction--Great Product--Fast Shipping--A+A+A+</li>
            <li> For $10, this mascara is a rip-off. It weighs my eyelashes down and becomes very clumpy. Would not buy again.</li>

            <li> I have years using this mascara I. Love the combination of the curved brush and the actual fluid. Love love.</li>
            <li> Great mascara and doesn&#x27;t wear off or smudge.</li>
            <li> Great product and in perfect quality. Wish Maybelline still carried it! Best mascara that although it&#x27;s not water proof, it won&#x27;t smear and holds eyelashes beautifully...</li>
            <li> I have tried almost every mascara out there and fell in love with this one.  Other brands make my eyelashes fall out and land in my eyes.  I don&#x27;t have naturally curved eyelashes but this mascara makes them appear long and curled.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Best mascara...only place I can find it now so I&#x27;ll be reordering soon.</li>
