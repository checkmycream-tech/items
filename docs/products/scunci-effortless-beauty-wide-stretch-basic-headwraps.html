            <li>Great price, great product, holds just as I need them too.</li>
            <li>Great deal.</li>

            <li>Good quality &amp; well stitched.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>They are good looking headbands.</li>
            <li>Good product&lt;br /&gt;Exactly as described&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>Amazon customer service was great in making sure</li>
            <li>This easily slides on and looks great on all head shapes.</li>
            <li>Still kept them because this is a great price, but it would be nice if the listing was accurate.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered if I had been able to see the packaging in the picture, but</li>
            <li>/&gt;Likely I will cut these and stitch 1/2&amp;#34; elastic into them to make them better fitting...</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took one star away because I can&#x27;t decide whether I want them to be more constrictive or wider in order to better hold the hair at bay.  </li>
            <li>The colors could have been a LOT better</li>
            <li>But overall they are a great product!</li>
            <li>and I love the width</li>
            <li>I love wearing headbands and find it a challenge to find quality ones that hold their elasticity and wash well.</li>
            <li>But they are okay colors.</li>
            <li>the colors are fine, the material is just ok.  </li>
            <li>I love the way the head bands are stretchy and light.</li>
            <li>I love them, they fit well</li>
            <li>I find them to be comfortable, nicely made, easy to wear and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>slide off my hair/head too easily</li>
            <li>Great soft and comfortable head bands.</li>
            <li>and I can easily throw them in the wash without fear that the fabric will loosen.</li>
            <li>For the price they are fine,</li>
            <li>I kept it because I&#x27;ll use them, but the description is not at all accurate.</li>
            <li>Great basic hair accessory.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>These are great, they get the job done and they are pretty inexpensive:) I have kind of a small head</li>
            <li>Work fine to help keep hair back, and are a good value.</li>
            <li>I really wish I had been able to chose the colors myself.</li>
            <li>Soft, nice colors, just what I hoped for.</li>
            <li>Gave these as a gift, however asked for one back, and it is a good band, using it for face washing.</li>
            <li>True to what they describe.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t stay in place very well and gives my hair static.</li>
            <li>Save your money and buy a no name brand first to see if you like the look!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t read thoroughly, and was only expecting 3, got 5, so that was a nice surprise.  </li>
            <li>I would return them if it was worth my time.</li>
            <li>Love the colors of the headband and how soft they are.  </li>
            <li>They were $2 cheaper at Wal-mart for the same thing, but it&#x27;s nice having it shipped right to my door.</li>
            <li>I have seen other people use these bands and thought they looked good.</li>
            <li>Does the elastic wear out right away?  </li>
            <li>I can wear them all day without getting a headache and they stay in place pretty well.</li>
            <li>Now that I know, I will order more in different colors.</li>
            <li>They hold pretty well</li>
            <li>Comfortable and soft headbands.</li>
            <li>Good for the money, does the job of holding my hair back off my face and in the back underneath a ponytail or bun.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They&#x27;re super soft and stretchy, and keep up under repeated washings.</li>
            <li>The neutral colors are very flexible, and go with just about anything...</li>
            <li>Simple, comfortable, keeps your hair in place, looks minimal and cleanly utilitarian in a variety of colors.</li>
            <li>These head wraps are perfect for holding back thick, long hair.</li>
            <li>I wanted this so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to continually touch my hair while cleaning my face and no matter how completely I get it all originally covered, some of it comes creeping back out.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not too right but enough to keep hair steady</li>
            <li>but they are too small and cheap to be cute enough to wear in public.</li>
            <li>I like hairbands for washing my face, housecleaning, and when my hair needs to be professionally cut (like now!)</li>
            <li>Lies smooth, not too tight &amp; doesn&#x27;t pill.</li>
            <li>I got neutral colors because I don&#x27;t like screaming wild colors...</li>
            <li>These are wide enough, soft enough, and stretchy enough not to hurt my head, as many others do.</li>
            <li>Definitely not as wide as pictured...</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re nothing flashy, but they are effective at holding my growing-out hair out of my face while I&#x27;m doing something where I don&#x27;t want it to bother me.</li>
            <li>These are exactly the same as the ones in target - for less.</li>

            <li> These are exactly the same as the ones in target - for less.</li>
            <li> had no beige/brown items, only black, white and grey -- other users reported this too --- fyi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I see the description \\&quot;wide</li>
            <li> These are not quite as wide as the picture seems.</li>
            <li> I need a wide band keep the  hair off my face and out of my eyes</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t wide by any stretchl about 2&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re about two inches wide, so keep that in mind.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise, I like the degree of stretch, I like the black and grey</li>
            <li> I gave a couple away because they came in colors I would never wear but other than that they work well.</li>
            <li> These are tight so they hold my hair, yet loose</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say the are about half as wide as the photo.</li>
            <li> Ugly and cheap.</li>
            <li> Just cheap, kinda ugly look.</li>
            <li> They are not &amp;#34;wide&amp;#34; they are the average width you can buy at the store.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed.</li>
            <li> it was thick enough</li>
            <li> Not too tight.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t be caught dead wearing it.</li>
            <li> but i now ended up with 2 whites and 3 blacks which is unnecessary.</li>
            <li> It was rather expensive compared to others.</li>
            <li> Sent the wrong color, ordered the neutral set but ended up receiving the black/gray/white set.</li>
            <li> I see people wearing these all the time, i must just have a weird shaped head.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m doing it wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m prone to headaches and the plastic bands drive me crazy.</li>
            <li> I have horribly frizzy hair</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This item did not work for me.  I have seen other people use these bands and thought they looked good. Perhaps I just didn&#x27;t understand how to position it. It was rather expensive compared to others. Save your money and buy a no name brand first to see if you like the look!</li>
            <li> These are perfect for working out and washing your face. These are exactly the same as the ones in target - for less.</li>
            <li> This definetly did the trick at keeping my bangs out of my face. They were $2 cheaper at Wal-mart for the same thing, but it&#x27;s nice having it shipped right to my door.</li>
            <li> Sent the wrong color, ordered the neutral set but ended up receiving the black/gray/white set. Still kept them because this is a great price, but it would be nice if the listing was accurate.</li>
            <li> These head wraps are perfect for holding back thick, long hair. They are lightweight and don&#x27;t add bulk or make your scalp sweat. They have good stretch but don&#x27;t lose their shape even after prolonged use.</li>
            <li> Work fine to help keep hair back, and are a good value.</li>
            <li> i was looking for something that holds my hair up during exercise, and this did the trick.  it was thick enough so it hold all my hair back, and also the elastic seems sturdy for it to last.  Somehow I just wish it was cheaper.  After all, it&#x27;s just cloth.</li>
            <li> I really wish I had been able to chose the colors myself. I gave a couple away because they came in colors I would never wear but other than that they work well. I have horribly frizzy hair and it tames the front enough for me to not worry about it.</li>
            <li> I could have bought this anywhere in a local retail chain store, but saved be a trip.. wear for working  out</li>
            <li> When I see the description \\&quot;wide headband\\&quot; I expect that the headbands would actually be wider than a couple of inches, to me that isn&#x27;t a \\&quot;wide\\&quot; headband and I was expecting something a bit different.  the colors are fine, the material is just ok.  For the price they are fine, just not what I was after for a yoga headband.</li>
            <li> These are great, they get the job done and they are pretty inexpensive:) I have kind of a small head and they stay on during yoga so that&#x27;s two thumbs up for me!</li>
            <li> Slides up my head never stays put. I see people wearing these all the time, i must just have a weird shaped head.</li>
            <li> slide off my hair/head too easily</li>
            <li> These are not quite as wide as the picture seems. I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered if I had been able to see the packaging in the picture, but oh well..</li>
            <li> Needed a bunch of these because styling hair takes forever and this is something I can put on and go. I also like the thickness of it, it hides my receding hairline</li>
            <li> I have an average-sized head, but these are just a bit too tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I like the degree of stretch, I like the black and grey colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine had no beige/brown items, only black, white and grey -- other users reported this too --- fyi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likely I will cut these and stitch 1/2&amp;#34; elastic into them to make them better fitting...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good for the price.</li>
            <li> Never used anything like these before.  Bought them to keep my hair out of my face while I wash it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took one star away because I can&#x27;t decide whether I want them to be more constrictive or wider in order to better hold the hair at bay.  I am Caucasian with Asian/Hispanic hair and it&#x27;s not really all that wild but once it gets caught in my face-cleaning machine it ALL comes out.  I wanted this so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to continually touch my hair while cleaning my face and no matter how completely I get it all originally covered, some of it comes creeping back out.  Does the elastic wear out right away?  Maybe I&#x27;m doing it wrong.</li>
            <li> This easily slides on and looks great on all head shapes. Package has multiple neutral colors. A simple hair style.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t be caught dead wearing it. Ugly and cheap.</li>
            <li> Definitely not as wide as pictured...I&#x27;d say the are about half as wide as the photo. I&#x27;ll keep them to use around the house but they are too small and cheap to be cute enough to wear in public.</li>
            <li> They do what I need them to do which is keep the hair out of my eyes at the gym. I wouldn&#x27;t wear them for fashion but for working around the house and working out they are great. I need a wide band keep the  hair off my face and out of my eyes and they do the trick at a great price.</li>
            <li> This product is described as being a &amp;#34;Wide Stretch Basic Headwrap&amp;#34;. It is in fact a regular width headband. I kept it because I&#x27;ll use them, but the description is not at all accurate.</li>
            <li> Great price, great product, holds just as I need them too.</li>
            <li> Simple, comfortable, keeps your hair in place, looks minimal and cleanly utilitarian in a variety of colors. Stretchy material fits all.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read thoroughly, and was only expecting 3, got 5, so that was a nice surprise.  The colors are all neutral, and the headbands are comfy and keep my hair out of my face for washing.</li>
            <li> Great soft and comfortable head bands.</li>
            <li> Great basic hair accessory. Lies smooth, not too tight &amp; doesn&#x27;t pill. Good quality &amp; well stitched. I use these all the time. Good product.</li>
            <li> comfy and holds hair out of face</li>
            <li> They are not &amp;#34;wide&amp;#34; they are the average width you can buy at the store.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed. I would return them if it was worth my time.</li>
            <li> These are tight so they hold my hair, yet loose so the don&#x27;t hurt my head</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t wide by any stretchl about 2&amp;#34;</li>

            <li> These are great, perfect for keeping bangs off face while doing yardwork, washing face, or going out to run errands. Soft, nice colors, just what I hoped for. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Just cheap, kinda ugly look. I regret my purchase.</li>
            <li> I like hairbands for washing my face, housecleaning, and when my hair needs to be professionally cut (like now!) These are wide enough, soft enough, and stretchy enough not to hurt my head, as many others do. Now that I know, I will order more in different colors. Good buy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m prone to headaches and the plastic bands drive me crazy. These are so so comfy, you&#x27;ll forget they&#x27;re on your head. A must buy.</li>
            <li> I love the way the head bands are stretchy and light. The problem i have is the colors. It comes with two blacks which i don&#x27;t get and the it doesn&#x27;t come with a neutral cream color which is what i thought the picture was. I bout this and the neon ones for the deal they had but i now ended up with 2 whites and 3 blacks which is unnecessary. The colors could have been a LOT better</li>
            <li> This was the material I was looking for.  I would order these again.</li>
            <li> These head bands are perfect for throwing up your hair on those days when you just want it out of your face.  I like the width, but some people don&#x27;t.  They&#x27;re about two inches wide, so keep that in mind.  But overall they are a great product!</li>
            <li> Use these for the gym . They hold pretty well and I can easily throw them in the wash without fear that the fabric will loosen. I have curly hair so maybe that helps with the grip. They&#x27;re not too right but enough to keep hair steady</li>
            <li> Gave these as a gift, however asked for one back, and it is a good band, using it for face washing.</li>
            <li> I got these to wear when I workout to absorb the sweat.  I love them, they fit well and I love the width</li>
            <li> I love wearing headbands and find it a challenge to find quality ones that hold their elasticity and wash well. These has done both.</li>
            <li> True to what they describe. Like them for what I bought them for, which is hiding a surgery shave which these will cover</li>
            <li> The picture(s) online do not do these headwraps justice.  They are good looking headbands. They are solid not sheer like pantyhose which is how the picture looked to me.  So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I use these while cleaning the house &amp; doing yoga. They&#x27;re nothing flashy, but they are effective at holding my growing-out hair out of my face while I&#x27;m doing something where I don&#x27;t want it to bother me. They also do great at wicking sweat and keeping it out of my eyes! The neutral colors are very flexible, and go with just about anything...if I even care while doing chores!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re super soft and stretchy, and keep up under repeated washings.</li>
            <li> Good product&lt;br /&gt;Exactly as described&lt;br /&gt;I just wanted them to be a bit tighter</li>
            <li> Good for the money, does the job of holding my hair back off my face and in the back underneath a ponytail or bun.</li>
            <li> Comfortable and soft headbands. I use these when i wash my face at night to keep the hair away from my face. Work perfectly. Not too tight. And you get a bunch for a very low price. Great deal.</li>
            <li> I find them to be comfortable, nicely made, easy to wear and easy to clean.  Amazon customer service was great in making sure I got what I needed as well.</li>
            <li> I got neutral colors because I don&#x27;t like screaming wild colors... I just wish the gray that came with it didn&#x27;t look like a &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; version of the white. But they are okay colors.</li>
            <li> Good for around the house but that&#x27;s it.  Doesn&#x27;t stay in place very well and gives my hair static.</li>
