            <li>best deodorant ever.....</li>
            <li>We are very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Great stuff without the chemicals and aluminum!</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product!  </li>
            <li>One of the best and healthiest products on the market.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>LOL, &#x27;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years and it works great on neutralizing odor.</li>
            <li>Works great.  </li>
            <li>The price is a great  value</li>
            <li>Very effective and does not cause skin rashes.</li>
            <li>I use PRIMAL PIT PASTE - all good.</li>
            <li>I spritzed just a bit of my favorite perfume on the ball, and rolled it, then did that again, and it&#x27;s just great.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice and does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s effective, though not as effective as the product being reviewed here.</li>
            <li>The unscented is my favorite but got a herbal by mistake once</li>
            <li>I have many problems with deodorants with itching.  </li>
            <li>I have no idea what is in most deodorants for me to have this problem.</li>
            <li>Love that it is unscented too.</li>
            <li>Regardless, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll be using from now on, unless I can find something that works better and doesn&#x27;t have aluminum.</li>
            <li>Have used it for 20 years and love it.</li>
            <li>but, more importantly, the product works!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got healthy ingredients that naturally support good health.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>My wife has been using this for years and it is super!  </li>
            <li>so a light deodorant is all I need.  </li>
            <li>It seemed to say it was aluminium free</li>
            <li>Aluminum Free Deodorant, Fragrance Free, 3.1-Oz Sticks (Pack of</li>
            <li>Be sure to apply right after you shower.  </li>
            <li>This is a great deoderant, have used it for years, have tried many other health food store deoderants after ditching the antiperspirants years ago.</li>
            <li>Having to live scent free can be a challenge but thankfully there are great products like this that are really scent free and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, glad my daughter told me about it, using it everyday, hope to switch my family over soon.</li>
            <li>Bacteria starts to grow right away!      </li>
            <li>This product was recommended to me by a sales person at Whole Foods many years ago.  </li>
            <li>Very watery, I would love to return it</li>
            <li>and the smell was not bad.</li>
            <li>Glides on, dries quickly and lasts even in the Arizona heat.  </li>
            <li>OK, it did work similar to my good old stand by...</li>
            <li>I found an aloe based roll-on in The Canary Islands that was aluminum free which turned out to be the first compound that worked well and didn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s completely fragrance free, which is great if you have allergies, or if you just don&#x27;t want to wear multiple fragrances.&lt;br</li>
            <li>BTW, this main ingredient has it&#x27;s own MSDS listing and is considered very toxic...</li>
            <li>I have a strenuous job and it keeps up with me and keeps me smelling fresh.</li>
            <li>the meantime, I&#x27;ll post what I had written about the product below, since the stuff does work, and besides the sly naming of the aluminum, it appears to have healthy, natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>gentle, natural, effective.</li>
            <li>My granddaughter uses your products and likes it very much, so told me about it.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best, in fact the only, natural deodorant of the many that I have tried that works dependently for 24 hours of average activities.</li>
            <li>Most commercial products contain an aluminum compound.</li>
            <li>One could also use a favorite essential oil, too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>In my first pass, I had said that this product doesn&#x27;t have aluminum.</li>
            <li>I read some of the other reviews under this product and found one that said that they had the same experience and have since switched successfully to &amp;#34;Kiss</li>
            <li>Goes on clear and fresh smell.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t perspire much or have a problem with body odor</li>
            <li>but it is not - and again, I reacted very severely to this product.  </li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>This deodorant works really well and</li>
            <li>stuff really works.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is never irritating or sticky.</li>
            <li>I much prefer the unscented on any deodorant because there&#x27;s no &amp;#34;after-scent.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>better than regular deodorant-all natural</li>
            <li>I have tried quite a few &#x27;organic&#x27;, &#x27;natural&#x27;, and &#x27;good for you&#x27; deodorants.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the new source thru Amazon!</li>
            <li>It keeps me dry and free of odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product cleverly hides the fact that it contains aluminum hydroxide by cloaking it under the tradename of \\&quot;Alcloxa,\\&quot; which is a combination of allantion and aluminum hydroxide.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to deodorant containing aluminum - after one application, within 24 hours my underarms become very sore and stay that way for a week.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This one was recommended by a friend at a health food store here where I live and I tried it.  </li>
            <li>There is NOTHING NATURAL about this product!</li>
            <li>There is an ingredient in this product that has a cloaked name, that if you dig deep enough you will discover that it is the same main ingredient of most all commercial products.</li>
            <li>The 2 stars on this review is for the company using an &#x27;all natural&#x27; description on a product containing an aluminum salt...</li>
            <li>and it is very hard to find a more natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>I bought this product to replace my Arm&#x27;n Hammer deodorant for a natural product since hearing about the presumed effects of aluminum to the human body.</li>
            <li>Heavy exercising or being outside in very hot weather may need an additional application post workout</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have had trouble finding a natural deodorant that works!!  </li>
            <li> Its unscented and only takes a short time to dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found this deodorant after quite a few ones I&#x27;ve tried gave me bad reactions.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years now and am very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long lasting for the BO though.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe in this day and age of internet companies still get away with crap like this... astounding!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other natural deodorants but they either don&#x27;t keep me dry or the fragrance grates on me as the day goes on.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t keep me dry necessarily</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s not ridding me of the little memory I have left!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really frustrated that we&#x27;ve chosen this product and used it for years, thinking it was a healthy alternative without aluminum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the name of the ingredient since it&#x27;s Trademarked and after writing a negative review of the same product on VITACOST, they pulled my review and let me know that the Trademark owner wanted it removed.</li>
            <li> All Natural&#x27;, seriously!</li>
            <li> But instead of admitting that, the label reads that Alcloxa \\&quot;contains allantoin.\\&quot; Shady tactics at best; unhealthy product at worst.</li>
            <li> and lasts forever, because you need so little</li>
            <li> Just a little scent, not overpowering, and didn&#x27;t have to think about returning.  </li>
            <li> I bought the green tea cucumber version.  </li>
            <li> Works for everyday use not if you are going to the gym or doing an event that would make you sweat a lot</li>
            <li> Not sure how it would work for someone else.</li>
            <li> So far this product works just like I need it to, but without the dangerous aluminum base.</li>
            <li> I accidentally ordered the unscented, which is a little boring, BUT . .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sorry to say that after using it for two weeks I am itching again, so will have to stop using it - and use it intermittently instead of every day as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sorry.  </li>
            <li> Just a bunch of crooks from texas saying that this nasty compound is \\&quot;natural\\&quot;</li>

            <li> This product was recommended to me by a sales person at Whole Foods many years ago.  However, they no longer carry it.  Thank you Amazon.  Its unscented and only takes a short time to dry.  I&#x27;ve never had it come off on my clothing and it does keep away odor.  I don&#x27;t perspire much or have a problem with body odor so a light deodorant is all I need.  Not sure how it would work for someone else.</li>

            <li> I bought this product to replace my Arm&#x27;n Hammer deodorant for a natural product since hearing about the presumed effects of aluminum to the human body. Most commercial products contain an aluminum compound. There is an ingredient in this product that has a cloaked name, that if you dig deep enough you will discover that it is the same main ingredient of most all commercial products. There is NOTHING NATURAL about this product! I don&#x27;t use the name of the ingredient since it&#x27;s Trademarked and after writing a negative review of the same product on VITACOST, they pulled my review and let me know that the Trademark owner wanted it removed. Look up the ingredients and see for yourself. BTW, this main ingredient has it&#x27;s own MSDS listing and is considered very toxic... LOL, &#x27;All Natural&#x27;, seriously! OK, it did work similar to my good old stand by... but that&#x27;s not why I bought it. I can&#x27;t believe in this day and age of internet companies still get away with crap like this... astounding!</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to deodorant containing aluminum - after one application, within 24 hours my underarms become very sore and stay that way for a week.  I found an aloe based roll-on in The Canary Islands that was aluminum free which turned out to be the first compound that worked well and didn&#x27;t hurt.  But I can&#x27;t get that product in the US, even through the internet.  I searched the web for a domestic aloe based product without aluminum and found this item on Amazon.  It seemed to say it was aluminium free but it is not - and again, I reacted very severely to this product.  I read some of the other reviews under this product and found one that said that they had the same experience and have since switched successfully to &amp;#34;Kiss My Face Aluminum Free&amp;#34; deodorant.  I bought the green tea cucumber version.  I&#x27;ve used it now for a week with no problems.  Works really well.</li>
            <li> This deodorant contains aluminum and slyly lists the ingredient as alcoxa.  Just a bunch of crooks from texas saying that this nasty compound is \\&quot;natural\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Having to live scent free can be a challenge but thankfully there are great products like this that are really scent free and gets the job done. We are very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great stuff without the chemicals and aluminum! I&#x27;ve been using this for years and it works great on neutralizing odor.</li>
            <li> This deodorant works really well and because it&#x27;s unscented there is no odor mixing with my fragrance. I&#x27;ve tried other natural deodorants but they either don&#x27;t keep me dry or the fragrance grates on me as the day goes on. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Been using  it for years!</li>
            <li> Very effective and does not cause skin rashes.</li>
            <li> This product cleverly hides the fact that it contains aluminum hydroxide by cloaking it under the tradename of \\&quot;Alcloxa,\\&quot; which is a combination of allantion and aluminum hydroxide. But instead of admitting that, the label reads that Alcloxa \\&quot;contains allantoin.\\&quot; Shady tactics at best; unhealthy product at worst.</li>
            <li> I wanted a product that did not have aluminum in it and it is very hard to find a more natural deodorant. This is a wonderful product!  It smells nice and does it&#x27;s job.I have a strenuous job and it keeps up with me and keeps me smelling fresh. Just remember, it is not an antiperspirant! I will continue to use the aloe deodorant.</li>
            <li> This is a staple for me.</li>
            <li> Have  been using for years and years.  No aluminum in it to possibly give you Alzheimers.  The unscented is my favorite but got a herbal by mistake once and the smell was not bad.</li>
            <li> Very watery, I would love to return it</li>
            <li> Works for everyday use not if you are going to the gym or doing an event that would make you sweat a lot</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this for years and it is super!  Thanks for the new source thru Amazon!</li>
            <li> This is a great deoderant, have used it for years, have tried many other health food store deoderants after ditching the antiperspirants years ago. I accidentally ordered the unscented, which is a little boring, BUT . . I spritzed just a bit of my favorite perfume on the ball, and rolled it, then did that again, and it&#x27;s just great.  Just a little scent, not overpowering, and didn&#x27;t have to think about returning.  One could also use a favorite essential oil, too.&lt;br /&gt;I think next time I order I will order the unscented.</li>
            <li> Does the job well - with no perfume!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only problem I&#x27;ve had is difficulty finding it, which amazon.com has solved.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, glad my daughter told me about it, using it everyday, hope to switch my family over soon.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter uses your products and likes it very much, so told me about it.  I have many problems with deodorants with itching.  I&#x27;m very sorry to say that after using it for two weeks I am itching again, so will have to stop using it - and use it intermittently instead of every day as I had hoped.  I&#x27;m very sorry.  I have no idea what is in most deodorants for me to have this problem.</li>
            <li> I have tried quite a few &#x27;organic&#x27;, &#x27;natural&#x27;, and &#x27;good for you&#x27; deodorants.  The is the ONLY deodorant in this category that has worked for me!  Glides on, dries quickly and lasts even in the Arizona heat.  Love that it is unscented too.</li>
            <li> From my wife Sarah: I&#x27;m revising my review. In my first pass, I had said that this product doesn&#x27;t have aluminum. Another poster wrote me to say that there is aluminum in this product, listed under an alternative name. I&#x27;m really frustrated that we&#x27;ve chosen this product and used it for years, thinking it was a healthy alternative without aluminum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, I&#x27;ll post what I had written about the product below, since the stuff does work, and besides the sly naming of the aluminum, it appears to have healthy, natural ingredients. So here goes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff really works. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. I like the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s completely fragrance free, which is great if you have allergies, or if you just don&#x27;t want to wear multiple fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s got healthy ingredients that naturally support good health.&lt;br /&gt;- It keeps me dry and free of odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several other natural brands, and I found this to work best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, I&#x27;ve switched brands, because despite the fact that it works well, I don&#x27;t want the aluminum. I&#x27;m now using [[ASIN:B001FB5H5Q Kiss My Face Natural Active Life Aluminum Free Deodorant, Fragrance Free, 3.1-Oz Sticks (Pack of 6)]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s effective, though not as effective as the product being reviewed here. Regardless, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll be using from now on, unless I can find something that works better and doesn&#x27;t have aluminum.</li>
            <li> It has aluminum....Ingredient one is aloe, ingredient number 2 is water (with all the herbs in the water in parentheses) Ingredient #3 is Alcloxa which is 50% aluminum by weight and one of the final ingredients is Tri Ethanol Amine..... which is denoted by TEA on the label&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW I use PRIMAL PIT PASTE - all good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found this deodorant after quite a few ones I&#x27;ve tried gave me bad reactions.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years now and am very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;I also like the fact it has a non scent variation.</li>
            <li> So far this product works just like I need it to, but without the dangerous aluminum base. I will be using this from here on out.</li>
            <li> gentle, natural, effective. even during strenuous exercise.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years since it was &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; and would have given it 5 starts. However, looking at the list of ingredients, I find Alcloxa is an aluminum salt - so buyer beware... The 2 stars on this review is for the company using an &#x27;all natural&#x27; description on a product containing an aluminum salt... An aluminum salt is not &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34;. Shame shame...</li>
            <li> One of the best and healthiest products on the market. Have used it for 20 years and love it.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best, in fact the only, natural deodorant of the many that I have tried that works dependently for 24 hours of average activities. Heavy exercising or being outside in very hot weather may need an additional application post workout shower.&lt;br /&gt;It is never irritating or sticky. The price is a great  value but, more importantly, the product works! I much prefer the unscented on any deodorant because there&#x27;s no &amp;#34;after-scent.&amp;#34;</li>
