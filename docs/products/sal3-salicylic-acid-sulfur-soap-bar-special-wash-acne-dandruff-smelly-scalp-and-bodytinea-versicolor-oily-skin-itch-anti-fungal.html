            <li>lol...</li>
            <li>The combo has worked great.</li>
            <li>Will be buying more soon!!</li>
            <li>Great deal and the best part is it works and makes the skin feel much better.  </li>
            <li>I get dandruff on my nose and eye brows along with acne and this stuff works like a champ keeping my skin healthy and nearly flawless.</li>
            <li>I real enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this soap because I&#x27;d heard good things.</li>
            <li>SO GOOD.</li>
            <li>and i thought that salicylic acid and sulfur were good for blackheads.</li>
            <li>cannot believe how good my skin looks and feels, and people that know me have taken notice.  </li>
            <li>This soap has worked as a good replacement.</li>
            <li>Pharmacists also have had some good recommendations.  </li>
            <li>Its a good sized bar.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Excellent soap for this and at a good price.  </li>
            <li>Works really good.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go.  </li>
            <li>This is good stuff.  </li>
            <li>Because it is advertised as a dermatologist-recommended soap, I made a good handful of calls to dermatologists out of my provider directory, and asked them if they would recommend it.</li>
            <li>This is a good choice for acne.</li>
            <li>Good product at a competitive price.</li>
            <li>It is good at cleaning off the oil.</li>
            <li>Heard that sulfur was good for the purpose.  </li>
            <li>Definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li>Works good for acne prevention and healing.</li>
            <li>not as good as fostex soap.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good product just not for me.</li>
            <li>The sulfur smell of the soap is fairly negligible and fades within an hour, though it does seem to hang around in my jacket to an extent.</li>
            <li>Thank You and keep the good work up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a very happy momma, her KP has been a source of discomfort and embarrassment, finally having something that helps her is wonderful.</li>
            <li>Very glad I have this soap</li>
            <li>But with all the wonderful options out there in both liquid and bar form, this one isn&#x27;t worth the time or money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>am sure it would be great for someone who can handle fragrances.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this soap.</li>
            <li>The size is fair and I have used it once and after using it my skin felt nice, no tightness</li>
            <li>It saves me money, prevents boils and acne, has a pleasant scent, and is easy to use!</li>
            <li>Totally satisfied with product and service!</li>
            <li>, I still do break out on occasion, but SAL3 for the most part has got this under control!</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>This product was the first product I used and works perfectly</li>
            <li>Highly satisfied!</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t even need deodorant any more!  </li>
            <li>Be sure to moisturize afterwards!</li>
            <li>Love this soap!</li>
            <li>I hope they never discontinue this soap, LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I am in love with it!</li>
            <li>it arrived quick and is a very good product.</li>
            <li>It worked up a great, smooth lather</li>
            <li>This soap is a amazing on acne prone</li>
            <li>I can say it smells nice.</li>
            <li>No lather, no residue of any kind to spread on my skin.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best product for anyone suffering from razor burn or acne.</li>
            <li>the price is nice here.</li>
            <li>The soap has a nice aroma which is a bonus.</li>
            <li>Lather&#x27;s nicely</li>
            <li>You must lather it in warm water and you must let it sit on your skin for about a minute for it to activate.</li>
            <li>Well worth the MONEY!!!</li>
            <li>Washes my makeup away wonderfully and has kept my skin clear.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too drying, smells good and has a rich lather.  </li>
            <li>Very Good product, Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I have tried many face creams for acne treatment and this is buy far one of the best products!</li>
            <li>You can feel how clean your skin is after using this soap and it smells good.</li>
            <li>Good product at a fair price with fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Good for mild acne.</li>
            <li>My order arrived quickly and in good condition .I</li>
            <li>I hope my KP continues to improve, it would be fantastic to be able to wear shorts again without being embarrassed about polka-dotted legs!</li>
            <li>My skin feels lovely with it and very cheap ivory soap.  </li>
            <li>I have seen a huge difference in my face just after 5 days of use!</li>
            <li>It really is a wonderful product, and who knew minerals such as sulphur</li>
            <li>To combat this, I have to layer moisturizer on top.</li>
            <li>This soap cleared up my acne when nothing else would, including more pricey vaunted products.</li>
            <li>going to try the sulfur soap without the salicylic acid and see if i have better results.</li>
            <li>wanted so much to love it since the review were outstanding...</li>
            <li>That alone made me love the soap.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a week and it makes my KP looke so much better.</li>
            <li>It works better than the stuff I get from my spa-facialist.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update with more info as I use it longer.</li>
            <li>I love the soap..</li>
            <li>Glad I found more on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Not as pleased as I would like.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried many soaps over the years.</li>
            <li>I hope to be as satisfied as I was this time with the product.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably be buying more</li>
            <li>This is a novelty soap, nothing more.</li>
            <li>(need I say more?).</li>
            <li>Glad I tried this product.</li>
            <li>There are bars like aveeno&#x27;s and neutrogena&#x27;s salicylic acid bars that work well and smell much better, so I threw this out after one use.</li>
            <li>Hair loss has slowed to a crawl, so hair follicles must be in much better shape.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I feel that it works as well as, perhaps even better than, my prescription lactate lotion, and at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>and I can still smell it on some of my clothing even after many washings.  </li>
            <li>My skin already looks better after a couple of uses.</li>
            <li>It is outstanding when you order a product and it is everything that was advertised.</li>
            <li>Make sure you lather and use lots of HOT water to rinse!!!</li>
            <li>It has a nice clean smell, leaves no greasy residue at all.</li>
            <li>Super strong smell of rose and maybe peony...</li>
            <li>Very good ......you will see improvements on a short period of time</li>
            <li>She is so happy to see her arms start to clear up.  </li>
            <li>I gave this an honest try over about a month&#x27;s worth of time</li>
            <li>The soap is very effective,so I suggest use it sparingly,suds up,let it stay on a minute or so,then rinse good.</li>
            <li>nice soap but leaves a distinct scent which some may not like</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it on one arm and one leg (using the other arm and leg as controls) two to three days a week for about two weeks now, and I am impressed!</li>
            <li>IT HAS A STRONG SMELL</li>
            <li>The benefits outweigh the smell (not that strong).</li>
            <li>Strong smell</li>
            <li>I would NOT use this soap on my face(too strong) for my skin type(fair)</li>
            <li>I believe under the oily and acne covered dermis is a beautiful female.  </li>
            <li>Product works perfectly, cant beat if for the price, cheaper than any other spot looked at!</li>
            <li>The soap itself even has a mild scent that I&#x27;ve come to love.  </li>
            <li>i like that it isnt super drying!</li>
            <li>I have to use a good conditioner with this soap so it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out, but it works amazingly.  </li>
            <li>must add that this  soap is very effective at cleaning and at the same time very mild.</li>
            <li>In the morning, I wash with this soap, apply a light moisturizer and go ( or apply make up depending on the day).  </li>
            <li>It is also a cheap smell.</li>
            <li>Dermatologists say there is no cure for this itch, and offer me free samples of over-the-counter salves to reduce the itch.  </li>
            <li>Overall I find it a great product.</li>
            <li>Makes the skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li>and my skin was actually smooth feeling.</li>
            <li>Have you a plastic soap holder available.</li>
            <li>Ive ordered many similar products and this combo of sulfur/salicylic acid is by far the best!!</li>
            <li>Not as good as the old Fostex I was used to.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>this is very good to exfoliate but your skin will be pretty dam dry after so make sure you lotion up..</li>
            <li>used other sulfur soap before , but this one works very good for me , with the salicylic acid.</li>
            <li>Very powerful stuff.  </li>
            <li>or so I will make another review and tell you if it helped my acne at all and if the change was mild or super noticeable. :)</li>
            <li>that.&lt;br /&gt;You end up feeling clean no residue.</li>
            <li>It rinses clean with no film or stickiness.</li>
            <li>#34;a clean smell.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It washes off clean and leaves no build up on your skin.</li>
            <li>so far this is better than many acne products that ive used, its used for cleansing and works well with my overningth acne medication.</li>
            <li>It may work well, but part of showering is smelling clean.</li>
            <li>Keeps my face clean all day</li>
            <li>but it actually has a pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad odor, but a unique smell.  </li>
            <li>my acne have disappear , , certainly , i will order more of these soaps , and tell my friends to order them , for acne or blemish..</li>
            <li>first several times that I purchased that SAL3 bars, they worked great and had no perfume smell at all.</li>
            <li>BUT MY BACK IS SO GOOD.</li>
            <li>I liked this soap, it leaves you feeling clear and helped with some acne on my back and definitely a good face</li>
            <li>It lathers nicely for this type of soap and leaves the skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>So much for this one i love it</li>
            <li>After about a full week of use, my ingrown hairs</li>
            <li>It kept my skin clean while it had a chance to heal, and the drying aspects of the sulfur brought the allergens up out of my skin quickly and neatly.</li>
            <li>I will stick with it and hopefully get full results.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I only use deodorant in the summer--this soap is that good.  </li>
            <li>I love it so much I cried.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really not bad.</li>
            <li>One, even though it has a fairly pleasant floral odor, you can still smell the sulfur after you&#x27;re clean and dry sometimes.</li>
            <li>I use to use another brand that is about $10.00 per bar, this is just as good or better at half the price.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it seems to work great and other times</li>
            <li>My skin tone is even and clean, worth every dollar.</li>
            <li>super grandma level smell.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>My order came quick.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>So having another mild case of acne, I decided to try it again ...</li>
            <li>The exfoliating material is nicely distributed and not rough on the skin.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s better than the Clean and Clear we used.</li>
            <li>Really quite strong smelling.  </li>
            <li>Items purchased were exactly as described!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li>I normally had 4-5 ingrown hair on my face at any given time during a normal week, This soap is amazing.</li>
            <li>Calm.</li>
            <li>it has helped to calm my Roscea.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the soap for smelling like fresh linen, it&#x27;s the soap for cleansing your skin and fighting pimples.</li>
            <li>It seems as if the perfume batches have different ingredients and therefore the product is no longer as effective for my seborrhea dermatitis.</li>
            <li>Lasted a long time, had a good smell and did exactly what it was supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>Although it smells of sulfur and lavender, it&#x27;s an excellent soap for taking care of skin that has a broken, allergic rash.</li>
            <li>it worth</li>
            <li>I found this soap when I started noticing an odor in my hair that was there even when I was fresh out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Sal 3 Soap for two weeks, so far I&#x27;m quite pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried more products than I can remember to help with my Keratosis Pilaris, which I&#x27;ve had since a young child.  </li>
            <li>Now for those people who have not had success with this, perhaps they didn&#x27;t use it correctly.  </li>
            <li>This has a pretty obnoxious smell but took care of the problem after about a week of use, very much worth it.</li>
            <li>No regrets on this, it takes time to see results, but for most people it will help with acne.</li>
            <li>It hasn’t stopped my breakouts completely but it’s better than most over the counter facial products.</li>
            <li>The scent is clean and pleasant at first, but harshly perfumed further into the soap (perhaps it contains a more affordably produced core).</li>
            <li>Now I use this every other day with pretty good results.</li>
            <li>and you can feel the change right after the first use.</li>
            <li>The seller I purchased from engages in bait and switch practices, altering its own listing between transactions to draw in customers with multipack listings, then editing the product&#x27;s page to reflect an offer of a single item as soon as an order is placed.</li>
            <li>The seller I purchased from engages in bait and switch practices, altering its own listing between transactions to draw in customers with multipack listings, then editing the product&#x27;s page to reflect an offer of a single item as soon as an order is placed.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t use the soap alone and expect your condition to go away for the long term - you do need to eat healthy, drink plenty of water, exercise, keep hands away from your face, and as it was suggested to me, you need to change your pillow case everying night, especially if you go to sleep with any kind of product in your hair.</li>
            <li>Very gentle on the skin and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to remember that lather is not actually necessary for cleaning, and this soap does a much better job for acne than any other I&#x27;ve tried, all of which lathered better.</li>
            <li>This is the first summer I have dared to go sleeveless and without makeup!&lt;br</li>
            <li>and i will have to place more order later on up the road.</li>
            <li>I soak in warm water for 20 sec and then rub suds on my face.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how much better my skin looked the next morning after using this.</li>
            <li>Not the same soap that I have used for many years.</li>
            <li>It cleared up my acne within a week and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>If memory serves me well, it took about a week to notice a big difference.and a couple weeks more to be almost acne</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this exclusively since first trying it.  </li>
            <li>It is cheaper to by in higher quantities from their website.  </li>
            <li>No soaps at the store did much of anything!  </li>
            <li>I used the wart stuff on my foot first and waited before using it on my hands while using the soap on both.</li>
            <li>The Grisi soap smells better, somewhat similar to many American supermarket soaps, what Americans think of as &amp;</li>
            <li>Will probably be a better test when the summer heat comes back.</li>
            <li>product sounded exactly like what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>which is the first area to break out.</li>
            <li>I have order this sulfur soap for the first time , .</li>
            <li>I was using this product consistently for about 2 months</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t have written with just that info except that it also has given me relief with a mild case of athletes foot, a mild case of psoriasis, and a mild fungus on two private parts of my body.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe how fast I saw results!</li>
            <li>however i did not order any more thinking i may have to go through the same thing.</li>
            <li>Much better then regular bar soap.</li>
            <li>i noticed a change for the better on both the back of her ams</li>
            <li>The packaging was simple but done properly so that was good too.</li>
            <li>That said, if you&#x27;re really sensitive to sulfur, then move on but considering the awwwwwfulll smells some other products have, this stuff smells pretty good  </li>
            <li>it has a pleasant scent and the bar will last a long time.</li>
            <li>Not in a really aggressive way, but I smell it and it freaked me out at first.</li>
            <li>Not many superior cleansers can make that claim.</li>
            <li>finally something that work, its so drying my oily skin, with no redness or any irritations, very good shining control, i gave it 4 stars cause its too small in comparing with the benzyl soap</li>
            <li>I also have had positive results with S-acid, so I was pleased to find the two combined into a single soap.</li>
            <li>As far as the smell, it is a bit medicinal, but not unpleasant to me.</li>
            <li>I would expect a more pronounced brimstone quality in a product with sulfur claims -- not such a focus on perfume (specially for a &#x27;medicated&#x27; bar), so was puzzled and put off by the absence of any detectable sulfur</li>
            <li>Very high quality soap.</li>
            <li>Just a tip from a long time user, try buying from their website, you get free shipping ;)</li>
            <li>After seeing a HUGE improvement in my acne while using De La Cruz Sulfur Ointment Cream I thought why not switch my entire routine to a sulfur-based wash?</li>
            <li>/&gt;Soooo i am back to say that I see a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I really like this soap.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t have to use as much and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li>It felt very soothing and did not burn my seb derm at all.  </li>
            <li>It really helps get rid of acne and keeps me from the break outs.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and the seller</li>
            <li>advice for you, then, is the same as that of the dermatologists who hand me a bag of free salve samples: Try it.  </li>
            <li>Expected way more</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t see that much difference.</li>
            <li>I really like this soap.</li>
            <li>Lathers very well.</li>
            <li>I like sulfur soap but found this to be a gentle soap on your skin.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>Shipped fast, highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Very drying, leaves face needing lotion.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it did much for my acne.</li>
            <li>I now use this soap to wash my body with as I tend to have a bit of odor on really hot,sweaty days in the summer.  </li>
            <li>However, this soap does a great job cleansing my skin without drying it out or irritating the area around my nose...</li>
            <li>Really working for my problem acne caused by allergies.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this soap for several months, and my skin is OH SO SMOOTH.  </li>
            <li>not as outstanding as expected.....</li>
            <li>She says that her skin has stopped itching so much</li>
            <li>I waited until I used the whole bar to write this review to see if it really made a difference.</li>
            <li>I really like it as a shampoo.</li>
            <li>This soap really does work.  </li>
            <li>was using a product that worked really well, but when the formula changed, I wanted to try and find another solution.&lt;br /&gt;Buying</li>
            <li>it was really money</li>
            <li>It worked then really well.  </li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it much to see the effect though.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t do much for it</li>
            <li>and I noticed that its gradually getting better, I am using a tea tree shampoo after I rinse off the soap because I felt like it left some residue and that tea three shampoo makes feel much cleaner , so far it&#x27;s working the smell of the sulfur</li>
            <li>(specially as sulfur has such an obvious, naturally strong smell).</li>
            <li>Have tried many other OTC and Dr scripts</li>
            <li>I will say, my skin responds very well to sulfur particularly.</li>
            <li>When I saw my skin clearing up overnight, I checked the ingredients of a skin mask that always worked really well for me, and sulfur was the main component.</li>
            <li>I keep a moisturizing bar next to it to clean my hands after using it and then use grapeseed oil on my arms when I get out to moisturizer them.</li>
            <li>It may even be used for a mask, but since everyone&#x27;s skin is different you have to figure out to on your own how long to leave it on your skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this soap if you have any skin issues or problems stemming from too much oil.  </li>
            <li>I would not credit this soap with actually treating problem skin nor recommend it for any curative use, specially for folks with already blemished, problem skin (for whom this soap is marketed).</li>
            <li>Even a real pumice stone would have been more helpful than this was, though; it would at least have been useful for my feet, but I couldn&#x27;t even get THAT from this soap.</li>
            <li>I got the sulfur soap in the mail yesterday and before I could even open the package I could smell its sweet scent</li>
            <li>This product worsened my facial acne considerably, but seems to be a reasonably effective treatment for my back acne.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: it has been 1 month and my skin looks so much better, damage that has been done to my neck and сhin area is almost gone and skin looks more tight , whiter for some reason and scars almost gone, but it is due to the oils that i use after the soap.</li>
            <li>it’s cheaper at the actual site and most likely fresher.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and I will continue using it for seb derm management.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 8-28-15&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>my acne were dried up and now I have very smooth skin</li>
            <li>This one is the best one by far, it&#x27;s a little bit drying if you use it everyday, but it significantly reduces skin bumps after several weeks of using it, they won&#x27;t go away, but it definitely helps.</li>
            <li>It then fulfills the orders it gained with the original listing as orders for single bars of soap.</li>
            <li>It then fulfills the orders it gained with the original listing as orders for single bars of soap.</li>
            <li>My blackheads clear up very well with continued use.    </li>
            <li>The soap seemed to fare well with blemishes at first, but after several uses I attribute that to how very drying it is.</li>
            <li>And cleans face poor&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this soap for a week, but I have SUPER sensitive oily acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>It seems to soften the skin and loosen clogged pores to some extent, but the problem comes right back.  </li>
            <li>Allow to dry and rinse with cool water.</li>
            <li>One thing, the smell is a little too much, kind of perfumey, but not enough to keep me from using it.</li>
            <li>this soap added to my benzoyl peroxide regimen and I haven&#x27;t seen any new pimples anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I now have to find a new sulphur soap bar that does not have the perfume scent.</li>
            <li>The few offices that were kind enough to return my call had never heard of the brand and after finding the soap&#x27;s website advised me to beware of scams.</li>
            <li>My arms are as smooth as they have ever been, in the middle of winter, even after using the product for several months.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>Clear my face of acne highly recomendes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s long lasting and very mild.</li>
            <li>My skin itched a bit, and later when I sweated in the hot sun, itched.&lt;br /&gt;You should know...</li>
            <li>; is the key word, here ;)</li>
            <li>The condition on my legs is more severe than my arms and more difficult to treat it seems, but I notice the redness is finally fading on the leg I&#x27;ve been using the soap on.</li>
            <li>I noticed that salicylic acid was the active ingredient in many plantar/topical wart removers (I had also bought one such remover).</li>
            <li>so I can look at the back of my head in the large wall-mirror.  </li>
            <li>Had I made these calls earlier or read through the handful of negative reviews (and their rebuttals) or looked more closely at the positive reviews, I might have spared myself the consequences of my purchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can get this soap for $5.99/bar at the Sal3 website, or if you order in bulk like I do you can pay as little as $3.33 per bar with free shipping.  </li>
            <li>This one a winner winner a great chicken dinner</li>
            <li>I was using this soap to try and help clear up a rash type irritation on my arms.</li>
            <li>Brought it to help clear my acne.</li>
            <li>but since I started using this on the effected area it has stopped completely.</li>
            <li>When used routinely, I had eliminated nearly all break-outs I was experiencing.</li>
            <li>Because it does not work like the old Fostex soap.</li>
            <li>I am a 42 year old that has battled acne and has been scarred from it over my lifetime.  </li>
            <li>My 19 year old college student daughter started using it for her acne and her complexion is clearer</li>
            <li>This said no heavy perfumes...</li>
            <li>I was looking for a replacement for my old sulphur soap called Sastid</li>
            <li>This SAL3 is nothing in comparison to the old soap</li>
            <li>I purchased this soap for my nine year old daughter who has severe KP.</li>
            <li>completely disappeared!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What it DOES do is allow you to measure how much of the product you&#x27;re actually getting from it in each use; imperative in a bar cleanser.</li>
            <li>so I was pleasantly surprised about that.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not harsh.  </li>
            <li>Yes, I was surprised.</li>
            <li>This soap doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as loud as i thought it would based on the description.</li>
            <li>I am 62 yrs old and when in my teens I had a severe case of acne and my dermatologist recommended sulphur soap.  </li>
            <li>I have used this soap before and it lasts a long time and does exactly what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li>I also use this for my face and am buying another bar for my 17 year old for his breakouts.  </li>
            <li>I found out that many minerals will help with seb derm (by using dead sea salt for a short while) and decided to try sulphur soap instead.  </li>
            <li>After the first couple of uses, the soap began to smell very strongly of perfume, whereas new and dry it seemed cleaner and not as harsh (but, again, I would not have expected it to be a fragranced bar at all).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear out skin problems that no other product has yet so far.</li>
            <li>I had mild acne breakouts upon receving this soap and my face has cleared and I have less blackheads, it also helps control the oil on my face.</li>
            <li>You aren&#x27;t allowed to say you don&#x27;t like it or that it didn&#x27;t work for you; they will stop barely short of accusing you of libel and will waste much of their time (that could clearly be better spent running their company and improving their product) trying to discredit you and your word.</li>
            <li>It has made a huge difference in my scalp problems, which are namely, excessive oil production which causes seb derm and build up.</li>
            <li>The smell is tolerable but if I were you I would enclose it in  something like maybe a travel soap dish or small storage container because it will light your bathroom up...</li>
            <li>I typically breakout within the first two days of using a new product and that&#x27;s how I know to toss it.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t produce much leather when new but later it has been acting like regular soap.</li>
            <li>Just beware, it will dry up your whole face.</li>
            <li>This soap has no integrity and becomes very soft, like putty, after a couple of uses, and the entire bar can be squeezed through the fingers like butter at this point.</li>
            <li>First time I used my Face  actually got burn marks not for everyone try on small areas first</li>
            <li>it is okay as it gets rid of acne (small redness and tiny white heads).</li>
            <li>Now I know good and well that the presence or absence of lather is meaningless when it comes to the efficacy of a cleansing product.</li>
            <li>hot, tired  and with itchy scalp, I wash my face and scalp with hot water and SAL3, rinse with cold water, and rub on some kind of salve such as the aforementioned original formula Sarna.  </li>
            <li>The Sal 3 soap must be judged primarily on its merits as a keratolitic &amp; antifungal agent and secondary as a bath soap.</li>
            <li>Sevice was great, but unfortunately this soap was not enough which I expected.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to really comment.</li>
            <li>With regular use, the soap keeps my face clear, but I have found that I do need to keep up with moisturizing, because it can be drying.</li>
            <li>So far, I see this soap helping relieve my daughter&#x27;s problem acne, but not rid her of it entirely.</li>
            <li>It cleans deeply and the sulphur content offers bacteriological control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using the soap for several weeks but unfortunately not everyday.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a Asian women in my early 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>The bar is denser than normal soap so it lasts longer and doesn&#x27;t get soft when wet.  </li>
            <li>acne calm down on my face and on my back.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much difference with the acne than with other acne soaps, but did like how my face felt after washing with it.</li>
            <li>Does not dry the skin, to the point that it is peeling or blotchy.</li>
            <li>My skin always gets worse in the winter, and while many products may work for a short time, it seems my skin eventually becomes immune to the treatment.  </li>
            <li>I have awful skin and after lots of research realized these 2 ingredients are by far the best for acne/oily skin issues!</li>
            <li>As important as it is to preserve the life and quality of any soap by keeping it dry and away from any standing water (I kept mine in an open, raised-bottom, wooden soap dish), there is little to be done with or for this soap.</li>
            <li>Apparently the last lot of Pernox had to be recalled.</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t noticed an improvement in my skin as I haven&#x27;t had it that long.</li>
            <li>In fairness, I have one positive thing to say about it: it had little or no scent that I could detect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I got the right product.</li>
            <li>Yes my skin gets dry after but not tight which I like.</li>
            <li>The only thing about this soap is that skin somewhat sensitive like if you decide to pop the pimple you will have red spot on your face for the whole day after that, but i guess it is a small price to pay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I get dandruff on my nose and eye brows along with acne and this stuff works like a champ keeping my skin healthy and nearly flawless.</li>
            <li> I real enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this soap because I&#x27;d heard good things.</li>
            <li> SO GOOD.</li>
            <li> and i thought that salicylic acid and sulfur were good for blackheads.</li>
            <li> cannot believe how good my skin looks and feels, and people that know me have taken notice.  </li>
            <li> This soap has worked as a good replacement.</li>
            <li> Pharmacists also have had some good recommendations.  </li>
            <li> Its a good sized bar.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Excellent soap for this and at a good price.  </li>
            <li> Works really good.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good to go.  </li>
            <li> This is good stuff.  </li>
            <li> Because it is advertised as a dermatologist-recommended soap, I made a good handful of calls to dermatologists out of my provider directory, and asked them if they would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a good choice for acne.</li>
            <li> Good product at a competitive price.</li>
            <li> It is good at cleaning off the oil.</li>
            <li> Heard that sulfur was good for the purpose.  </li>
            <li> Definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li> Works good for acne prevention and healing.</li>
            <li> not as good as fostex soap.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good product just not for me.</li>
            <li> The sulfur smell of the soap is fairly negligible and fades within an hour, though it does seem to hang around in my jacket to an extent.</li>
            <li> Thank You and keep the good work up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very happy momma, her KP has been a source of discomfort and embarrassment, finally having something that helps her is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Very glad I have this soap</li>
            <li> But with all the wonderful options out there in both liquid and bar form, this one isn&#x27;t worth the time or money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> am sure it would be great for someone who can handle fragrances.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this soap.</li>
            <li> The size is fair and I have used it once and after using it my skin felt nice, no tightness</li>
            <li> It saves me money, prevents boils and acne, has a pleasant scent, and is easy to use!</li>
            <li> Totally satisfied with product and service!</li>
            <li> , I still do break out on occasion, but SAL3 for the most part has got this under control!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This product was the first product I used and works perfectly</li>
            <li> Highly satisfied!</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t even need deodorant any more!  </li>
            <li> Be sure to moisturize afterwards!</li>
            <li> Love this soap!</li>
            <li> I hope they never discontinue this soap, LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I am in love with it!</li>
            <li> it arrived quick and is a very good product.</li>
            <li> It worked up a great, smooth lather</li>
            <li> This soap is a amazing on acne prone</li>
            <li> I can say it smells nice.</li>
            <li> No lather, no residue of any kind to spread on my skin.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best product for anyone suffering from razor burn or acne.</li>
            <li> the price is nice here.</li>
            <li> The soap has a nice aroma which is a bonus.</li>
            <li> Lather&#x27;s nicely</li>
            <li> You must lather it in warm water and you must let it sit on your skin for about a minute for it to activate.</li>
            <li> Well worth the MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> Washes my makeup away wonderfully and has kept my skin clear.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too drying, smells good and has a rich lather.  </li>
            <li> Very Good product, Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have tried many face creams for acne treatment and this is buy far one of the best products!</li>
            <li> You can feel how clean your skin is after using this soap and it smells good.</li>
            <li> Good product at a fair price with fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Good for mild acne.</li>
            <li> My order arrived quickly and in good condition .I</li>
            <li> I hope my KP continues to improve, it would be fantastic to be able to wear shorts again without being embarrassed about polka-dotted legs!</li>
            <li> My skin feels lovely with it and very cheap ivory soap.  </li>
            <li> I have seen a huge difference in my face just after 5 days of use!</li>
            <li> It really is a wonderful product, and who knew minerals such as sulphur</li>
            <li> To combat this, I have to layer moisturizer on top.</li>
            <li> This soap cleared up my acne when nothing else would, including more pricey vaunted products.</li>
            <li> going to try the sulfur soap without the salicylic acid and see if i have better results.</li>
            <li> wanted so much to love it since the review were outstanding...</li>
            <li> That alone made me love the soap.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a week and it makes my KP looke so much better.</li>
            <li> It works better than the stuff I get from my spa-facialist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update with more info as I use it longer.</li>
            <li> I love the soap..</li>
            <li> Glad I found more on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Not as pleased as I would like.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried many soaps over the years.</li>
            <li> I hope to be as satisfied as I was this time with the product.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably be buying more</li>
            <li> This is a novelty soap, nothing more.</li>
            <li> (need I say more?).</li>
            <li> Glad I tried this product.</li>
            <li> There are bars like aveeno&#x27;s and neutrogena&#x27;s salicylic acid bars that work well and smell much better, so I threw this out after one use.</li>
            <li> Hair loss has slowed to a crawl, so hair follicles must be in much better shape.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I feel that it works as well as, perhaps even better than, my prescription lactate lotion, and at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> and I can still smell it on some of my clothing even after many washings.  </li>
            <li> My skin already looks better after a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> It is outstanding when you order a product and it is everything that was advertised.</li>
            <li> Make sure you lather and use lots of HOT water to rinse!!!</li>
            <li> It has a nice clean smell, leaves no greasy residue at all.</li>
            <li> Super strong smell of rose and maybe peony...</li>
            <li> Very good ......you will see improvements on a short period of time</li>
            <li> She is so happy to see her arms start to clear up.  </li>
            <li> I gave this an honest try over about a month&#x27;s worth of time</li>
            <li> The soap is very effective,so I suggest use it sparingly,suds up,let it stay on a minute or so,then rinse good.</li>
            <li> nice soap but leaves a distinct scent which some may not like</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it on one arm and one leg (using the other arm and leg as controls) two to three days a week for about two weeks now, and I am impressed!</li>
            <li> IT HAS A STRONG SMELL</li>
            <li> The benefits outweigh the smell (not that strong).</li>
            <li> Strong smell</li>
            <li> I would NOT use this soap on my face(too strong) for my skin type(fair)</li>
            <li> I believe under the oily and acne covered dermis is a beautiful female.  </li>
            <li> Product works perfectly, cant beat if for the price, cheaper than any other spot looked at!</li>
            <li> The soap itself even has a mild scent that I&#x27;ve come to love.  </li>
            <li> i like that it isnt super drying!</li>
            <li> I have to use a good conditioner with this soap so it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out, but it works amazingly.  </li>
            <li> must add that this  soap is very effective at cleaning and at the same time very mild.</li>
            <li> In the morning, I wash with this soap, apply a light moisturizer and go ( or apply make up depending on the day).  </li>
            <li> It is also a cheap smell.</li>
            <li> Dermatologists say there is no cure for this itch, and offer me free samples of over-the-counter salves to reduce the itch.  </li>
            <li> Overall I find it a great product.</li>
            <li> Makes the skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li> and my skin was actually smooth feeling.</li>
            <li> Have you a plastic soap holder available.</li>
            <li> Ive ordered many similar products and this combo of sulfur/salicylic acid is by far the best!!</li>
            <li> Not as good as the old Fostex I was used to.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> this is very good to exfoliate but your skin will be pretty dam dry after so make sure you lotion up..</li>
            <li> used other sulfur soap before , but this one works very good for me , with the salicylic acid.</li>
            <li> Very powerful stuff.  </li>
            <li> or so I will make another review and tell you if it helped my acne at all and if the change was mild or super noticeable. :)</li>
            <li> that.&lt;br /&gt;You end up feeling clean no residue.</li>
            <li> It rinses clean with no film or stickiness.</li>
            <li> #34;a clean smell.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It washes off clean and leaves no build up on your skin.</li>
            <li> so far this is better than many acne products that ive used, its used for cleansing and works well with my overningth acne medication.</li>
            <li> It may work well, but part of showering is smelling clean.</li>
            <li> Keeps my face clean all day</li>
            <li> but it actually has a pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad odor, but a unique smell.  </li>
            <li> my acne have disappear , , certainly , i will order more of these soaps , and tell my friends to order them , for acne or blemish..</li>
            <li> first several times that I purchased that SAL3 bars, they worked great and had no perfume smell at all.</li>
            <li> BUT MY BACK IS SO GOOD.</li>
            <li> I liked this soap, it leaves you feeling clear and helped with some acne on my back and definitely a good face</li>
            <li> It lathers nicely for this type of soap and leaves the skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> So much for this one i love it</li>
            <li> After about a full week of use, my ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> It kept my skin clean while it had a chance to heal, and the drying aspects of the sulfur brought the allergens up out of my skin quickly and neatly.</li>
            <li> I will stick with it and hopefully get full results.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I only use deodorant in the summer--this soap is that good.  </li>
            <li> I love it so much I cried.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not bad.</li>
            <li> One, even though it has a fairly pleasant floral odor, you can still smell the sulfur after you&#x27;re clean and dry sometimes.</li>
            <li> I use to use another brand that is about $10.00 per bar, this is just as good or better at half the price.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it seems to work great and other times</li>
            <li> My skin tone is even and clean, worth every dollar.</li>
            <li> super grandma level smell.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> My order came quick.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> So having another mild case of acne, I decided to try it again ...</li>
            <li> The exfoliating material is nicely distributed and not rough on the skin.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s better than the Clean and Clear we used.</li>
            <li> Really quite strong smelling.  </li>
            <li> Items purchased were exactly as described!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> I normally had 4-5 ingrown hair on my face at any given time during a normal week, This soap is amazing.</li>
            <li> Calm.</li>
            <li> it has helped to calm my Roscea.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the soap for smelling like fresh linen, it&#x27;s the soap for cleansing your skin and fighting pimples.</li>
            <li> It seems as if the perfume batches have different ingredients and therefore the product is no longer as effective for my seborrhea dermatitis.</li>
            <li> Lasted a long time, had a good smell and did exactly what it was supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> Although it smells of sulfur and lavender, it&#x27;s an excellent soap for taking care of skin that has a broken, allergic rash.</li>
            <li> it worth</li>
            <li> I found this soap when I started noticing an odor in my hair that was there even when I was fresh out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sal 3 Soap for two weeks, so far I&#x27;m quite pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried more products than I can remember to help with my Keratosis Pilaris, which I&#x27;ve had since a young child.  </li>
            <li> Now for those people who have not had success with this, perhaps they didn&#x27;t use it correctly.  </li>
            <li> This has a pretty obnoxious smell but took care of the problem after about a week of use, very much worth it.</li>
            <li> No regrets on this, it takes time to see results, but for most people it will help with acne.</li>
            <li> It hasn’t stopped my breakouts completely but it’s better than most over the counter facial products.</li>
            <li> The scent is clean and pleasant at first, but harshly perfumed further into the soap (perhaps it contains a more affordably produced core).</li>
            <li> Now I use this every other day with pretty good results.</li>
            <li> and you can feel the change right after the first use.</li>
            <li> The seller I purchased from engages in bait and switch practices, altering its own listing between transactions to draw in customers with multipack listings, then editing the product&#x27;s page to reflect an offer of a single item as soon as an order is placed.</li>
            <li> The seller I purchased from engages in bait and switch practices, altering its own listing between transactions to draw in customers with multipack listings, then editing the product&#x27;s page to reflect an offer of a single item as soon as an order is placed.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t use the soap alone and expect your condition to go away for the long term - you do need to eat healthy, drink plenty of water, exercise, keep hands away from your face, and as it was suggested to me, you need to change your pillow case everying night, especially if you go to sleep with any kind of product in your hair.</li>
            <li> Very gentle on the skin and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to remember that lather is not actually necessary for cleaning, and this soap does a much better job for acne than any other I&#x27;ve tried, all of which lathered better.</li>
            <li> This is the first summer I have dared to go sleeveless and without makeup!&lt;br</li>
            <li> and i will have to place more order later on up the road.</li>
            <li> I soak in warm water for 20 sec and then rub suds on my face.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how much better my skin looked the next morning after using this.</li>
            <li> Not the same soap that I have used for many years.</li>
            <li> It cleared up my acne within a week and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> If memory serves me well, it took about a week to notice a big difference.and a couple weeks more to be almost acne</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this exclusively since first trying it.  </li>
            <li> It is cheaper to by in higher quantities from their website.  </li>
            <li> No soaps at the store did much of anything!  </li>
            <li> I used the wart stuff on my foot first and waited before using it on my hands while using the soap on both.</li>
            <li> The Grisi soap smells better, somewhat similar to many American supermarket soaps, what Americans think of as &amp;</li>
            <li> Will probably be a better test when the summer heat comes back.</li>
            <li> product sounded exactly like what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> which is the first area to break out.</li>
            <li> I have order this sulfur soap for the first time , .</li>
            <li> I was using this product consistently for about 2 months</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have written with just that info except that it also has given me relief with a mild case of athletes foot, a mild case of psoriasis, and a mild fungus on two private parts of my body.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe how fast I saw results!</li>
            <li> however i did not order any more thinking i may have to go through the same thing.</li>
            <li> Much better then regular bar soap.</li>
            <li> i noticed a change for the better on both the back of her ams</li>
            <li> The packaging was simple but done properly so that was good too.</li>
            <li> That said, if you&#x27;re really sensitive to sulfur, then move on but considering the awwwwwfulll smells some other products have, this stuff smells pretty good  </li>
            <li> it has a pleasant scent and the bar will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Not in a really aggressive way, but I smell it and it freaked me out at first.</li>
            <li> Not many superior cleansers can make that claim.</li>
            <li> finally something that work, its so drying my oily skin, with no redness or any irritations, very good shining control, i gave it 4 stars cause its too small in comparing with the benzyl soap</li>
            <li> I also have had positive results with S-acid, so I was pleased to find the two combined into a single soap.</li>
            <li> As far as the smell, it is a bit medicinal, but not unpleasant to me.</li>
            <li> I would expect a more pronounced brimstone quality in a product with sulfur claims -- not such a focus on perfume (specially for a &#x27;medicated&#x27; bar), so was puzzled and put off by the absence of any detectable sulfur</li>
            <li> Very high quality soap.</li>
            <li> Just a tip from a long time user, try buying from their website, you get free shipping ;)</li>
            <li> After seeing a HUGE improvement in my acne while using De La Cruz Sulfur Ointment Cream I thought why not switch my entire routine to a sulfur-based wash?</li>
            <li> /&gt;Soooo i am back to say that I see a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t have to use as much and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> It felt very soothing and did not burn my seb derm at all.  </li>
            <li> It really helps get rid of acne and keeps me from the break outs.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and the seller</li>
            <li> advice for you, then, is the same as that of the dermatologists who hand me a bag of free salve samples: Try it.  </li>
            <li> Expected way more</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see that much difference.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap.</li>
            <li> Lathers very well.</li>
            <li> I like sulfur soap but found this to be a gentle soap on your skin.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> Shipped fast, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Very drying, leaves face needing lotion.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it did much for my acne.</li>
            <li> I now use this soap to wash my body with as I tend to have a bit of odor on really hot,sweaty days in the summer.  </li>
            <li> However, this soap does a great job cleansing my skin without drying it out or irritating the area around my nose...</li>
            <li> Really working for my problem acne caused by allergies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for several months, and my skin is OH SO SMOOTH.  </li>
            <li> not as outstanding as expected.....</li>
            <li> She says that her skin has stopped itching so much</li>
            <li> I waited until I used the whole bar to write this review to see if it really made a difference.</li>
            <li> I really like it as a shampoo.</li>
            <li> This soap really does work.  </li>
            <li> was using a product that worked really well, but when the formula changed, I wanted to try and find another solution.&lt;br /&gt;Buying</li>
            <li> it was really money</li>
            <li> It worked then really well.  </li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it much to see the effect though.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t do much for it</li>
            <li> and I noticed that its gradually getting better, I am using a tea tree shampoo after I rinse off the soap because I felt like it left some residue and that tea three shampoo makes feel much cleaner , so far it&#x27;s working the smell of the sulfur</li>
            <li> (specially as sulfur has such an obvious, naturally strong smell).</li>
            <li> Have tried many other OTC and Dr scripts</li>
            <li> I will say, my skin responds very well to sulfur particularly.</li>
            <li> When I saw my skin clearing up overnight, I checked the ingredients of a skin mask that always worked really well for me, and sulfur was the main component.</li>
            <li> I keep a moisturizing bar next to it to clean my hands after using it and then use grapeseed oil on my arms when I get out to moisturizer them.</li>
            <li> It may even be used for a mask, but since everyone&#x27;s skin is different you have to figure out to on your own how long to leave it on your skin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this soap if you have any skin issues or problems stemming from too much oil.  </li>
            <li> I would not credit this soap with actually treating problem skin nor recommend it for any curative use, specially for folks with already blemished, problem skin (for whom this soap is marketed).</li>
            <li> Even a real pumice stone would have been more helpful than this was, though; it would at least have been useful for my feet, but I couldn&#x27;t even get THAT from this soap.</li>
            <li> I got the sulfur soap in the mail yesterday and before I could even open the package I could smell its sweet scent</li>
            <li> This product worsened my facial acne considerably, but seems to be a reasonably effective treatment for my back acne.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: it has been 1 month and my skin looks so much better, damage that has been done to my neck and сhin area is almost gone and skin looks more tight , whiter for some reason and scars almost gone, but it is due to the oils that i use after the soap.</li>
            <li> it’s cheaper at the actual site and most likely fresher.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and I will continue using it for seb derm management.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 8-28-15&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> my acne were dried up and now I have very smooth skin</li>
            <li> This one is the best one by far, it&#x27;s a little bit drying if you use it everyday, but it significantly reduces skin bumps after several weeks of using it, they won&#x27;t go away, but it definitely helps.</li>
            <li> It then fulfills the orders it gained with the original listing as orders for single bars of soap.</li>
            <li> It then fulfills the orders it gained with the original listing as orders for single bars of soap.</li>
            <li> My blackheads clear up very well with continued use.    </li>
            <li> The soap seemed to fare well with blemishes at first, but after several uses I attribute that to how very drying it is.</li>
            <li> And cleans face poor&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this soap for a week, but I have SUPER sensitive oily acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> It seems to soften the skin and loosen clogged pores to some extent, but the problem comes right back.  </li>
            <li> Allow to dry and rinse with cool water.</li>
            <li> One thing, the smell is a little too much, kind of perfumey, but not enough to keep me from using it.</li>
            <li> this soap added to my benzoyl peroxide regimen and I haven&#x27;t seen any new pimples anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I now have to find a new sulphur soap bar that does not have the perfume scent.</li>
            <li> The few offices that were kind enough to return my call had never heard of the brand and after finding the soap&#x27;s website advised me to beware of scams.</li>
            <li> My arms are as smooth as they have ever been, in the middle of winter, even after using the product for several months.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> Clear my face of acne highly recomendes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long lasting and very mild.</li>
            <li> My skin itched a bit, and later when I sweated in the hot sun, itched.&lt;br /&gt;You should know...</li>
            <li> ; is the key word, here ;)</li>
            <li> The condition on my legs is more severe than my arms and more difficult to treat it seems, but I notice the redness is finally fading on the leg I&#x27;ve been using the soap on.</li>
            <li> I noticed that salicylic acid was the active ingredient in many plantar/topical wart removers (I had also bought one such remover).</li>
            <li> so I can look at the back of my head in the large wall-mirror.  </li>
            <li> Had I made these calls earlier or read through the handful of negative reviews (and their rebuttals) or looked more closely at the positive reviews, I might have spared myself the consequences of my purchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can get this soap for $5.99/bar at the Sal3 website, or if you order in bulk like I do you can pay as little as $3.33 per bar with free shipping.  </li>
            <li> This one a winner winner a great chicken dinner</li>
            <li> I was using this soap to try and help clear up a rash type irritation on my arms.</li>
            <li> Brought it to help clear my acne.</li>
            <li> but since I started using this on the effected area it has stopped completely.</li>
            <li> When used routinely, I had eliminated nearly all break-outs I was experiencing.</li>
            <li> Because it does not work like the old Fostex soap.</li>
            <li> I am a 42 year old that has battled acne and has been scarred from it over my lifetime.  </li>
            <li> My 19 year old college student daughter started using it for her acne and her complexion is clearer</li>
            <li> This said no heavy perfumes...</li>
            <li> I was looking for a replacement for my old sulphur soap called Sastid</li>
            <li> This SAL3 is nothing in comparison to the old soap</li>
            <li> I purchased this soap for my nine year old daughter who has severe KP.</li>
            <li> completely disappeared!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What it DOES do is allow you to measure how much of the product you&#x27;re actually getting from it in each use; imperative in a bar cleanser.</li>
            <li> so I was pleasantly surprised about that.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not harsh.  </li>
            <li> Yes, I was surprised.</li>
            <li> This soap doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as loud as i thought it would based on the description.</li>
            <li> I am 62 yrs old and when in my teens I had a severe case of acne and my dermatologist recommended sulphur soap.  </li>
            <li> I have used this soap before and it lasts a long time and does exactly what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li> I also use this for my face and am buying another bar for my 17 year old for his breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I found out that many minerals will help with seb derm (by using dead sea salt for a short while) and decided to try sulphur soap instead.  </li>
            <li> After the first couple of uses, the soap began to smell very strongly of perfume, whereas new and dry it seemed cleaner and not as harsh (but, again, I would not have expected it to be a fragranced bar at all).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear out skin problems that no other product has yet so far.</li>
            <li> I had mild acne breakouts upon receving this soap and my face has cleared and I have less blackheads, it also helps control the oil on my face.</li>
            <li> You aren&#x27;t allowed to say you don&#x27;t like it or that it didn&#x27;t work for you; they will stop barely short of accusing you of libel and will waste much of their time (that could clearly be better spent running their company and improving their product) trying to discredit you and your word.</li>
            <li> It has made a huge difference in my scalp problems, which are namely, excessive oil production which causes seb derm and build up.</li>
            <li> The smell is tolerable but if I were you I would enclose it in  something like maybe a travel soap dish or small storage container because it will light your bathroom up...</li>
            <li> I typically breakout within the first two days of using a new product and that&#x27;s how I know to toss it.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t produce much leather when new but later it has been acting like regular soap.</li>
            <li> Just beware, it will dry up your whole face.</li>
            <li> This soap has no integrity and becomes very soft, like putty, after a couple of uses, and the entire bar can be squeezed through the fingers like butter at this point.</li>
            <li> First time I used my Face  actually got burn marks not for everyone try on small areas first</li>
            <li> it is okay as it gets rid of acne (small redness and tiny white heads).</li>
            <li> Now I know good and well that the presence or absence of lather is meaningless when it comes to the efficacy of a cleansing product.</li>
            <li> hot, tired  and with itchy scalp, I wash my face and scalp with hot water and SAL3, rinse with cold water, and rub on some kind of salve such as the aforementioned original formula Sarna.  </li>
            <li> The Sal 3 soap must be judged primarily on its merits as a keratolitic &amp; antifungal agent and secondary as a bath soap.</li>
            <li> Sevice was great, but unfortunately this soap was not enough which I expected.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to really comment.</li>
            <li> With regular use, the soap keeps my face clear, but I have found that I do need to keep up with moisturizing, because it can be drying.</li>
            <li> So far, I see this soap helping relieve my daughter&#x27;s problem acne, but not rid her of it entirely.</li>
            <li> It cleans deeply and the sulphur content offers bacteriological control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using the soap for several weeks but unfortunately not everyday.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Asian women in my early 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The bar is denser than normal soap so it lasts longer and doesn&#x27;t get soft when wet.  </li>
            <li> acne calm down on my face and on my back.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much difference with the acne than with other acne soaps, but did like how my face felt after washing with it.</li>
            <li> Does not dry the skin, to the point that it is peeling or blotchy.</li>
            <li> My skin always gets worse in the winter, and while many products may work for a short time, it seems my skin eventually becomes immune to the treatment.  </li>
            <li> I have awful skin and after lots of research realized these 2 ingredients are by far the best for acne/oily skin issues!</li>
            <li> As important as it is to preserve the life and quality of any soap by keeping it dry and away from any standing water (I kept mine in an open, raised-bottom, wooden soap dish), there is little to be done with or for this soap.</li>
            <li> Apparently the last lot of Pernox had to be recalled.</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t noticed an improvement in my skin as I haven&#x27;t had it that long.</li>
            <li> In fairness, I have one positive thing to say about it: it had little or no scent that I could detect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I got the right product.</li>
            <li> Yes my skin gets dry after but not tight which I like.</li>
            <li> The only thing about this soap is that skin somewhat sensitive like if you decide to pop the pimple you will have red spot on your face for the whole day after that, but i guess it is a small price to pay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is not a strong medicine for curing acne fast, and such.  </li>
            <li> (Though I should caution that a vast number of the glowing, 5-star reviews are NOT from authentic customers; in fact, some are simply duplicated with different, fake names, and are all posted as a way of off-setting the TINY minority of honest, bad reviews.)</li>

            <li> The soap is shipped in a bubble-lined manilla envelope, which I thought was a little strange, but that&#x27;s really nothing to complain about.</li>
            <li> Upon arrival I read the instructions which state that before each use it is necessary to &amp;#34;activate&amp;#34; the soap bar first, by soaking it in a bowl of water for at least 20 seconds.  </li>
            <li> It was so funny I almost died from hard laughing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long lasting, too.  </li>
            <li> Last long.</li>
            <li> tried allot of different things.ie wiping down and changing before next practice (back to back)</li>
            <li> I preferred using a baking soda as a exfoliate- far less drying.</li>
            <li> The regular sulfur soap cleared my acne90%, but I haven&#x27;t had a single spot since I started using this.</li>
            <li> My other regular use of SAL3 is if I rubbed the calamine/Sarna slurry on my scalp the night before, I rinse it off in the shower the next morning.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather like normal soap, though it does help to get it wet for a little bit before using it.</li>

            <li> Other sulfur soaps I have tried had left a residue on the skin, this one does not.</li>
            <li> Was worried about the smell because of other reviews, but I actually like the smell!!</li>
            <li> So far not very effective, but it does help with redness from acne.</li>

            <li> but my husband has dry face</li>
            <li> I have naturally dry skin, and never broke or anywhere before</li>
            <li> so dissapoint,my sking is so dry</li>
            <li> Not too dry or too oily.</li>
            <li> It may helps others but my skin is normally dry</li>
            <li> This soap will definitely dry up any acne or bacteria.</li>
            <li> After that don&#x27;t wipe your skin dry, dab it dry.  </li>
            <li> I have seen a descent reduction in redness and breakouts but it will dry your skin out some, including yours hands holding it.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne and from past experience, I learned that sulfur works well on my face.</li>
            <li> I give it a 4 stars because I thought I would have a bigger change like other users but not much.</li>
            <li> I finally broke down and went to a dermatologist to fix my problem.</li>
            <li> My armd are smoother and less red!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s as rough and dry as a pumice stone.</li>
            <li> Use on my back and legs and have definitely seen an improvement over the past month.</li>
            <li> Pores look smaller, less pimples, and my face feels smoother.</li>
            <li> Also sometimes it gives me a slight red rash.</li>
            <li> I have only tried one other sulfur soap that was non-persciption, and one other prescription sulfur soap, and I have to say this one blows both out of the water!</li>
            <li> You can no longer see the little red bumps!  </li>
            <li> what I will say is that if you have any zit/blemish/redness going on your face...this little bar of wonder will take care of that after only 1 or 2 uses.</li>
            <li> They were painful at times and left large red and white bumps all over my neck line and face.</li>
            <li> and there was absolutely no &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have only used this for a few days and afterwards there is a noticeable improvement in my seb derm&#x27;s redness, flakiness, and itching.  </li>
            <li> The warts on the bottom of my foot are disappearing faster than expected as well.</li>
            <li> just hasn&#x27;t cleared my acne as quickly as I expected.</li>
            <li> After two tries, I like the product a lot.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for only a few days.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, I use several soaps in my bathing (I&#x27;m a girlie girl, sue me), so as long as I&#x27;m not JUST using the SAL3, it&#x27;s not an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For people who have trouble getting it to lather, the instructions tell you to let it soak in water for a little while.</li>
            <li> Once it got wet is when I smelled what other commenters were talking about.</li>
            <li> conscious- hiding behind long sleeves in summertime and never leaving the house without make up.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> There is other stuff for that.  </li>
            <li> Seems to sometimes take small acne bumps off my face as they appear but at the same time it is a bit oilier than what i would have wanted in a face soap, and one would have thought that since it was a sulphur soap it would not be so scented and oily.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t over powering, and she says the soap doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate like other products have.</li>
            <li> This soap was suggest by my dermatologist and it is working extremely well in controlling&lt;br /&gt;acne rosacea.  </li>
            <li> I use other products the rest of the week because if I use this every day it dries out my skin and makes it flakey.  </li>
            <li> If you see a seller rebutting with defensive comments in the areas designed for customers to rate them for the benefit of other customers, and even rating themselves there--take heed.</li>
            <li> There are always other sellers to choose from who would appreciate your business, and who can function without the insanity.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that it works well on my extremely oily skin which I appreciate.  </li>
            <li> the other hand, I began to see results by combining a microdermabrasion powder I bought on Amazon with the Oil of Olay Illumination face wash.</li>
            <li> The reason I got this soap is because my scalp is EXTREMELY  oily.</li>
            <li> It can be a little harsh on the skin and cause some drying, especially on the face which is wear my daughter sufferers from KP at.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a harsh bad smell and definitely feel clean after using.....</li>
            <li> helped to alleviate swelling and removal of dry and dead skin on severely infected leg (post-trauma).</li>
            <li> I developed an issue with scabies in my late twenties, and this soap truly eliminated it!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Sadly it&#x27;s just too expensive when compared to other &#x27;gentle&#x27; soaps.</li>
            <li> It was super expensive and I had to have a subscription to even order one item!</li>
            <li> do allot of jiu jitsu and had a pretty bad acne  break out all over my back.</li>
            <li> (first) then her back stopped breaking out as badly.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money or time waiting for it either.</li>
            <li> Her skin had turned really dark from the eczema.</li>
            <li> You would pay about 100 bucks at the least for a face-wash at the dermatologist for the same product!!</li>
            <li> The one minus is the heavy perfumed smell.</li>
            <li> Down.</li>
            <li> I cut down on its use to maybe twice a week.</li>
            <li> I found that like 15 seconds is plenty and that &amp;#34;soak&amp;#34; is a relative term that I choose to mean &amp;#34;hold under the shower spray&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is bar soap, which tends to make my skin a little tighter than other liquid soaps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought single bars of sulphur type soaps at natural booths/businesses and they are always quite expensive.</li>
            <li> For example, on evenings my scalp itches badly and I&#x27;m in for the night and not expecting company, I smear my forehead with a slurry of calamine and Sarna (original formula).  </li>
            <li> Within a week or less, your fungus will be gone.</li>
            <li> The bumps on my arm have smoothed out a lot, and seem less prolific.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I have to add that this simple, little bar of soap comes with some of the most vicious and hateful customer service I&#x27;ve ever come across.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s just not cool.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s not too drying, my skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight and if I forget the moisturizer, I&#x27;m ok.&lt;br</li>
            <li> : I had a little wart on my baby toe that I didn&#x27;t know what to do about.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit drying but not for oily skin.</li>
            <li> I use it at night and in the morning apply a little oil on my face.</li>
            <li> i did a little reading, and came across this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I guess I smell a little like sulfur</li>
            <li> This soap with a little powder</li>
            <li> They will go so far as to question your very salvation, as if by simply sharing your less-than-stellar experience with this one, forgettable little piece of crap soap</li>
            <li> The Sal3 smelled so bad to me that I had to take it directly to the outside garbage</li>
            <li> Oily, 20-something, acne-prone, semi-sensitive, semi-pigmented, few lines</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> No smooth face, still have acne bumps and blackheads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used drugstore acne treatments that smell far worse!</li>
            <li> I tried to use this product, but i just could not stand the it left behind.</li>
            <li> the combination of the salicylic acid and sulfur made my sensitive skin worse!</li>
            <li> Every few years I develop spots on my skin from a fungal infection.  </li>
            <li> I have used this on my face a few times and didn&#x27;t find it to be overly drying.</li>
            <li> It dried out my face and</li>
            <li> I put this under my bathroom counter for a few months not preparing to use it again.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have been using this soap for a few years and it scores five stars on all 3 counts.</li>
            <li> but I am not comfortable writing my review as of this moment.  </li>
            <li> still crying now.</li>
            <li> By the way I washed it everyday sometimes  twice( morning and at night)</li>
            <li> The sulphur smell was not strong at all</li>
            <li> and I saw very little changes with my acne.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend that has eczema really bad and this has really helped her skin a lot.  </li>
            <li> I was not pleased and will not purchase it again.  </li>
            <li> I have tried everything over the counter and have been seen by numerous dermatologists, feeling like a science experiment gone wrong and</li>
            <li> They have changed the formula and it doesn&#x27;t work as well as it did in the past.</li>
            <li> Not sure why others are complaining about the smell?</li>
            <li> This stuff stinks, I haven&#x27;t even taken it out of the package and it reeks of old lady.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is overdrying my skin though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not sure about this soap.</li>
            <li> My wife was not pleased because it was so invasive and causing the offensive odor in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> Sulfur smells like rotten eggs and this soap leaves behind that slight lingering odor.</li>
            <li> My skin looked so dull and stunk like a skunk after every use.</li>
            <li> then you&#x27;re in for a rude awakening.  </li>
            <li> I have slowly been seeing an improvement on my skin.</li>
            <li> And I do mean \\&quot;nothing\\&quot;:</li>
            <li> It lathers well, has very little odor, and helps skin without irritating dryness.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping this would help me get rid of the acne on my arms, but it was useless and had a bad smell.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to everyone who suffers from acne, I believe even people with dry skin could use this.    </li>
            <li> But, seriously.</li>
            <li> But, seriously.</li>
            <li> I can say tho since using this soap I haven&#x27;t had any bad breakouts or big acne.</li>
            <li> Two or three negative reviews and they all run amok in crisis mode, not bothering to think of HELPING those VERY FEW customers for whom the soap didn&#x27;t work, but instead desperately trying to discredit those reviews.</li>
            <li> Two or three negative reviews and they all run amok in crisis mode, not bothering to think of HELPING those VERY FEW customers for whom the soap didn&#x27;t work, but instead desperately trying to discredit those reviews.</li>
            <li> This product is working very slow.</li>
            <li> No improvement in fact maybe worse.</li>
            <li> I initially bought this soap to use on my arm to get rid of an annoying wart that I have.</li>
            <li> The process has been slow and mildly uncomfortable, but this product has performed a miracle.</li>
            <li> also smells worse than the metaderm</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any burning or peeling as some soaps tend to give.  </li>
            <li> her legs are the worse case and we are still working on them.</li>
            <li> This is very disappointing but unfortunately I missed the return date for the recent products I have bought.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed and let down.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t seem to work for me unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> you are afraid it will smell just in the bathroom, keep it in a travel soap case.</li>
            <li> stinks I put it in the garbage</li>
            <li> I was afraid it would smell like medicine.</li>
            <li> this soap STINKS.</li>
            <li> stinks like a rotten egg fart</li>
            <li> It is so unpleasant, and I am a person who likes scented anything.</li>
            <li> It has a bit of an unpleasant smell because of the sulfur, but I no longer notice it.</li>
            <li> The smell is mildly unpleasant, but not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> It is bad, people can feel it.</li>
            <li> It stunk so bad I could smell it in the bathroom from my bedroom.</li>
            <li> Sulfur smells, but SAL3 doesn&#x27;t smell too badly.  </li>
            <li> Upon opening I didn&#x27;t detect a bad odor or it didn&#x27;t seem bad.</li>
            <li> smells  really bad</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to have bad skin problems to use this either.</li>
            <li> She says that the odor is not so bad but do tend to linger in the wash cloth.</li>
            <li> smells sooooo bad and leaves a film over your skin after you use it.</li>
            <li> My family and friends were complaining about the bad smell</li>
            <li> Stinks but has cleared up my skin!</li>
            <li> but at this point I was desperate for a solution for my nasty, smelly hair.</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t smell like that it&#x27;s nasty. :(</li>
            <li> My body has very bad smell after useing this soup.</li>
            <li> Although it reduced redness, and swelling dramatically, it dries your skin out terribly.</li>
            <li> I had the worst case of acne..</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I suffer from folliculitis and this has been the only product to help with it.  I would always get bleeding and pus from my folliculitis but since I started using this on the effected area it has stopped completely.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap.  It&#x27;s not too drying, smells good and has a rich lather.  I bought it for my face but I wash all over with it and it&#x27;s helped with all of my acne (back, neck &amp;  chest).  Now I won&#x27;t exaggerate and claim that this soap is my acne cure but it&#x27;s an integral part of my acne battle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Edit 6/25/13* I&#x27;d like to add if you&#x27;re expecting your acne soap to smell like regular soap then you&#x27;re in for a rude awakening.  It&#x27;s not the soap for smelling like fresh linen, it&#x27;s the soap for cleansing your skin and fighting pimples. If you&#x27;ve battled acne as long as I have (over 20 years) you&#x27;d rub whatever you had to on your face to get rid of the problem.  That said, if you&#x27;re really sensitive to sulfur, then move on but considering the awwwwwfulll smells some other products have, this stuff smells pretty good  *end of edit*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use another product at night along with a benzoyl peroxide cream.  In the morning, I wash with this soap, apply a light moisturizer and go ( or apply make up depending on the day).  Because it&#x27;s not too drying, my skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight and if I forget the moisturizer, I&#x27;m ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before this soap, I was using only benzoyl peroxide products and I was still breaking out. I had pimples on my neck! Ouch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this soap added to my benzoyl peroxide regimen and I haven&#x27;t seen any new pimples anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ADDED BENEFITS&lt;br /&gt;Washing under my arms with this soap seems to decrease my need for deodorant.  It&#x27;s summer,of course, so I still use deodorant but I don&#x27;t have to use as much and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I get dandruff on my nose and eye brows along with acne and this stuff works like a champ keeping my skin healthy and nearly flawless. Do yourself a favor and buy it by the gallon.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping this would help me get rid of the acne on my arms, but it was useless and had a bad smell.</li>
            <li> Best sulfur bar on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have problem with my body skin long time. This product is working very slow. And!! My body has very bad smell after useing this soup. It is bad, people can feel it.</li>
            <li> Had blotchy skin from Tinea Versicolor. Had been battling for a year and using dandruff shampoo and foot spray on my back, shoulders and arms to no avail.  This bar of soap had it under control and disappearing within the week!</li>
            <li> I decided to try this soap because I&#x27;d heard good things. One, even though it has a fairly pleasant floral odor, you can still smell the sulfur after you&#x27;re clean and dry sometimes. Not in a really aggressive way, but I smell it and it freaked me out at first. On the other hand, I use several soaps in my bathing (I&#x27;m a girlie girl, sue me), so as long as I&#x27;m not JUST using the SAL3, it&#x27;s not an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For people who have trouble getting it to lather, the instructions tell you to let it soak in water for a little while. I found that like 15 seconds is plenty and that &amp;#34;soak&amp;#34; is a relative term that I choose to mean &amp;#34;hold under the shower spray&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are afraid it will smell just in the bathroom, keep it in a travel soap case. I do that anyway, just because I have to share my bathroom with another girlie girl and we have to keep our stuff separate or we accidentally steal from each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BONUS: I had a little wart on my baby toe that I didn&#x27;t know what to do about. After a week of using this soap, it was gone.</li>
            <li> I am very happy I came across this product when searching for remedies for my seborrhea dermatitis.  I found out that many minerals will help with seb derm (by using dead sea salt for a short while) and decided to try sulphur soap instead.  Upon arrival I read the instructions which state that before each use it is necessary to &amp;#34;activate&amp;#34; the soap bar first, by soaking it in a bowl of water for at least 20 seconds.  This is necessary for activating the sulphur in it. It worked up a great, smooth lather and then I massaged it into my problem areas while in the shower. The sulphur smell was not strong at all and there was absolutely no &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; smell.  It smelled like sulphur and the smell does not linger.  I left it on for a few minutes, just to let it soak in really well. It felt very soothing and did not burn my seb derm at all.  I have only used this for a few days and afterwards there is a noticeable improvement in my seb derm&#x27;s redness, flakiness, and itching.  It really is a wonderful product, and who knew minerals such as sulphur were the answer to my problems? I highly recommend this product and I will continue using it for seb derm management.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 8-28-15&lt;br /&gt;The first several times that I purchased that SAL3 bars, they worked great and had no perfume smell at all. They just smelled like sulphur and that was it.  Suddenly I keep getting batches that actually do smell like perfume.  It seems as if the perfume batches have different ingredients and therefore the product is no longer as effective for my seborrhea dermatitis. This is very disappointing but unfortunately I missed the return date for the recent products I have bought.  I now have to find a new sulphur soap bar that does not have the perfume scent.</li>
            <li> Totally satisfied with product and service!</li>
            <li> I have only tried one other sulfur soap that was non-persciption, and one other prescription sulfur soap, and I have to say this one blows both out of the water! When used routinely, I had eliminated nearly all break-outs I was experiencing. Other sulfur soaps I have tried had left a residue on the skin, this one does not. However, there is the lingering sulfur smell and it is not over-powering. My blackheads clear up very well with continued use.    This is bar soap, which tends to make my skin a little tighter than other liquid soaps. To combat this, I have to layer moisturizer on top. I found oil-based moistures to work best with this soap.    I recommend this to everyone who suffers from acne, I believe even people with dry skin could use this.    Skin Type: Oily, 20-something, acne-prone, semi-sensitive, semi-pigmented, few lines</li>
            <li> No bueno. It melts after a while and gets all slimy and gross. I eneded up chucking it after about 10 uses. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I was not pleased and will not purchase it again.  Because it does not work like the old Fostex soap.</li>
            <li> This soap cleared up my acne when nothing else would, including more pricey vaunted products. I will say, my skin responds very well to sulfur particularly. When I saw my skin clearing up overnight, I checked the ingredients of a skin mask that always worked really well for me, and sulfur was the main component. I would give it a go and see. One thing, the smell is a little too much, kind of perfumey, but not enough to keep me from using it.</li>
            <li> Omg it work for my KP SO GOOD. IT HAS A STRONG SMELL BUT MY BACK IS SO GOOD.</li>
            <li> I liked this soap, it leaves you feeling clear and helped with some acne on my back and definitely a good face cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly it&#x27;s just too expensive when compared to other &#x27;gentle&#x27; soaps.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap because I have acne breakouts alot and I have two really deep blackheads on on my face and i thought that salicylic acid and sulfur were good for blackheads. Anyway, I have been using this soap for about a month and  I do not see an improvement at all!!!!!! No smooth face, still have acne bumps and blackheads. I don&#x27;t like the smell and it stays on you for awhile but I could have dealth with the smell if the product worked.</li>
            <li> I am a 42 year old that has battled acne and has been scarred from it over my lifetime.  I have tried everything over the counter and have been seen by numerous dermatologists, feeling like a science experiment gone wrong and always self conscious- hiding behind long sleeves in summertime and never leaving the house without make up.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot believe how good my skin looks and feels, and people that know me have taken notice.  Not intending to embarrass anyone, I have pulled people aside when I&#x27;m out in public to tell them what a difference SAL3 has made for me!  This is the first summer I have dared to go sleeveless and without makeup!&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I still do break out on occasion, but SAL3 for the most part has got this under control!</li>
            <li> This is an anti-fungal soap.  If you have a stubborn fungus, this soap will do the trick.  You will be very impressed.  Don&#x27;t be sparing in using it.  Let it dry. Keep it on. Use it each day.  Within a week or less, your fungus will be gone.</li>
            <li> It really helps get rid of acne and keeps me from the break outs.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a life saver!</li>
            <li> A wonderful product!  It resolved my problematic area within two weeks after I had been fighting this problem almost all winter.  It is not a soap that lathers, and is wisely suggested one follows the recommended instructions for usage or best results!</li>
            <li> My husband had a smelly scalp problem we couldn&#x27;t seem to tackle with all manner of dandruff shampoos. This has a pretty obnoxious smell but took care of the problem after about a week of use, very much worth it.</li>
            <li> First time I used my Face  actually got burn marks not for everyone try on small areas first</li>
            <li> When my husband was diagnosed with skin cancer the dr advised him to use sulfur soap. I started using it as convince since it was in the shower......I LOVE IT! My skin tone is even and clean, worth every dollar. My 19 year old college student daughter started using it for her acne and her complexion is clearer then it ever was. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This product was the first product I used and works perfectly</li>
            <li> Items purchased were exactly as described! Great Seller!!</li>
            <li> Soap is superb for washing face and clearing up some of the redness and breakouts.  Does not dry the skin, to the point that it is peeling or blotchy.</li>
            <li> Apparently the last lot of Pernox had to be recalled. That $17 tube shot up to $99 on some sites. This soap has worked as a good replacement. The one minus is the heavy perfumed smell.</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t noticed an improvement in my skin as I haven&#x27;t had it that long. I can say it smells nice. The exfoliating material is nicely distributed and not rough on the skin. It lathers nicely for this type of soap and leaves the skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> So much for this one i love it and i will have to place more order later on up the road. This one a winner winner a great chicken dinner thank you . You where on time thank you.</li>
            <li> Stinks but has cleared up my skin! I wish I would have found this product in my teenage years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  great . It just as if you have used  the acid  peel.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and the seller is great will be ordering again soon</li>
            <li> This said no heavy perfumes... It is THE STONGEST perfume I have ever smelled in a soap. It is also a cheap smell. I&#x27;m not sure I got the right product. It stunk so bad I could smell it in the bathroom from my bedroom. It is so unpleasant, and I am a person who likes scented anything. I sent it back, but may try the same soap from a different seller since the descriptions all say &amp;#34;zero perfume&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I am 86, and the only time I see my hair is when my barber hands me a hand-mirror so I can look at the back of my head in the large wall-mirror.  For decades I have been plagued by an itchy scalp, sometimes unmercifully.  Dermatologists say there is no cure for this itch, and offer me free samples of over-the-counter salves to reduce the itch.  Pharmacists also have had some good recommendations.  I have a battery of such OTC stuff which serve various purposes.  For example, on evenings my scalp itches badly and I&#x27;m in for the night and not expecting company, I smear my forehead with a slurry of calamine and Sarna (original formula).  I find this cooling and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SAL3 is a sulfur soap.  Sulfur smells, but SAL3 doesn&#x27;t smell too badly.  It is not a strong medicine for curing acne fast, and such.  There is other stuff for that.  Ask your pharmacist.  I have two uses for SAL3.  If I come home for the evening hot, tired  and with itchy scalp, I wash my face and scalp with hot water and SAL3, rinse with cold water, and rub on some kind of salve such as the aforementioned original formula Sarna.  Aaah!!! One of the great joys in life is making an itch stop.  My other regular use of SAL3 is if I rubbed the calamine/Sarna slurry on my scalp the night before, I rinse it off in the shower the next morning. Of course I rinse the SAL3 off my scalp thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice for you, then, is the same as that of the dermatologists who hand me a bag of free salve samples: Try it.  If it cures whatever itches you, great. If not, try something else.&lt;br /&gt; .</li>
            <li> It definitely dries out skin in affected areas.  I still miss Pernox though.</li>
            <li> They have changed the formula and it doesn&#x27;t work as well as it did in the past.</li>
            <li> Seems to sometimes take small acne bumps off my face as they appear but at the same time it is a bit oilier than what i would have wanted in a face soap, and one would have thought that since it was a sulphur soap it would not be so scented and oily. All in all it is okay as it gets rid of acne (small redness and tiny white heads). I was looking for a replacement for my old sulphur soap called Sastid but it was discontinued. This SAL3 is nothing in comparison to the old soap but it is what i have for now.</li>
            <li> Tried this soap for my moderate acne. I used for about two weeks. No improvement in fact maybe worse.</li>
            <li> It helped by condition.</li>
            <li> Very nice excellent soap.</li>
            <li> So far, I see this soap helping relieve my daughter&#x27;s problem acne, but not rid her of it entirely. She has had no adverse reactions to the soap. I think it&#x27;s better than the Clean and Clear we used.</li>
            <li> Bought this after reading about how sulfur soap can help sufferers of KP like my daughter. We used it twice and could see a noticeable difference in her outbreaks. It can be a little harsh on the skin and cause some drying, especially on the face which is wear my daughter sufferers from KP at. We just moisturize the area after washing and have has excellent results.</li>
            <li> I purchased this soap for my nine year old daughter who has severe KP. We&#x27;ve used it twice now and i already see a difference. She is so happy to see her arms start to clear up.  The smell isn&#x27;t over powering, and she says the soap doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate like other products have. I&#x27;m a very happy momma, her KP has been a source of discomfort and embarrassment, finally having something that helps her is wonderful.</li>
            <li> i bought this after buying regular sulfur soap. The regular sulfur soap cleared my acne90%, but I haven&#x27;t had a single spot since I started using this. I soak in warm water for 20 sec and then rub suds on my face. Allow to dry and rinse with cool water.</li>
            <li> I suffer from oily skin and acne and this soap control both conditions in my face and my back which are the zones where I use it and you can feel the change right after the first use.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this soap for 3 days and can already tell the difference with my Keratosis Pilaris on the backs of my arms. You can no longer see the little red bumps!  Very glad I have this soap</li>
            <li> Been using for only 2 days and literally gets the gunk out! Seems to exfoliate without actually scrubbing. I couldn&#x27;t believe how much better my skin looked the next morning after using this. Not sure why others are complaining about the smell? I&#x27;ve used drugstore acne treatments that smell far worse! It&#x27;s really not bad. If you truly suffer from acne this works! It&#x27;s a little bit drying but not for oily skin. Will continue to buy if it keeps working!</li>
            <li> I tried to use this product, but i just could not stand the it left behind. Sulfur smells like rotten eggs and this soap leaves behind that slight lingering odor.</li>
            <li> I like service. It does not take too long to arraive the products. Sevice was great, but unfortunately this soap was not enough which I expected.</li>
            <li> No regrets on this, it takes time to see results, but for most people it will help with acne. The benefits outweigh the smell (not that strong). It may even be used for a mask, but since everyone&#x27;s skin is different you have to figure out to on your own how long to leave it on your skin.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as I thought it would work. I used it daily as instructed but no results at the end.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money or time waiting for it either. No results from.my end. Disappointed and let down. Expected way more</li>
            <li> Not the same soap that I have used for many years. That soap has been discontinued 2 or 3 years ago.</li>
            <li> I have slowly been seeing an improvement on my skin. I am surprise this has worked so well</li>
            <li> the combination of the salicylic acid and sulfur made my sensitive skin worse! going to try the sulfur soap without the salicylic acid and see if i have better results. wanted so much to love it since the review were outstanding...</li>
            <li> This soap is terrific!  It cleared up my acne within a week and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.  The bar is denser than normal soap so it lasts longer and doesn&#x27;t get soft when wet.  I highly recommend this soap if you have any skin issues or problems stemming from too much oil.  I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;ll have an effect on my fungal \\&quot;forklift foot\\&quot; as well but that verdict will take some time!</li>
            <li> Not as good as the old Fostex I was used to. Don&#x27;t see that much difference.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to really comment.</li>
            <li> I bought it to see if it can help fix my 2 months acne problem. And it has been 3 weeks now and im a one happy customer.&lt;br /&gt;My acne calm down on my face and on my back. I use with my husband and i still have a lot left to the soap. It didn&#x27;t produce much leather when new but later it has been acting like regular soap. I use it at night and in the morning apply a little oil on my face. The only thing about this soap is that skin somewhat sensitive like if you decide to pop the pimple you will have red spot on your face for the whole day after that, but i guess it is a small price to pay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: it has been 1 month and my skin looks so much better, damage that has been done to my neck and сhin area is almost gone and skin looks more tight , whiter for some reason and scars almost gone, but it is due to the oils that i use after the soap.I do have an oily face but my husband has dry face and it still works on healing it.Why stores dont sell this product???</li>
            <li> My back broke out allot.&lt;br /&gt;I do allot of jiu jitsu and had a pretty bad acne  break out all over my back. I have naturally dry skin, and never broke or anywhere before so i had a problem going on.&lt;br /&gt;I tried allot of different things.ie wiping down and changing before next practice (back to back) also different soaps,&lt;br /&gt;So i did a little reading, and came across this.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this sulfur soap.&lt;br /&gt;Im writing this a year after, so If memory serves me well, it took about a week to notice a big difference.and a couple weeks more to be almost acne free.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t burn, Scratch,irritate or anything like that.&lt;br /&gt;You end up feeling clean no residue. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap. Lathers very well. Its a good sized bar. Upon opening I didn&#x27;t detect a bad odor or it didn&#x27;t seem bad. Once it got wet is when I smelled what other commenters were talking about. The smell is tolerable but if I were you I would enclose it in  something like maybe a travel soap dish or small storage container because it will light your bathroom up...LOL!!! Overall I find it a great product. It leaves my skin very soft. Yes my skin gets dry after but not tight which I like.</li>
            <li> This soap was suggest by my dermatologist and it is working extremely well in controlling&lt;br /&gt;acne rosacea.  It cleans deeply and the sulphur content offers bacteriological control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent soap for this and at a good price.  I bought the six pack after trying it.</li>
            <li> stinks I put it in the garbage smells  really bad</li>
            <li> I use this sulfur soap about once a week to give my skin a real good cleaning.  I use other products the rest of the week because if I use this every day it dries out my skin and makes it flakey.  However, I do like this product because it helps reduce breakouts.</li>
            <li> Lasted a long time, had a good smell and did exactly what it was supposed to do.  I like sulfur soap but found this to be a gentle soap on your skin.</li>
            <li> I use to use another brand that is about $10.00 per bar, this is just as good or better at half the price. I have very oily skin and it is acne prone, so I use this every am and every pm. Washes my makeup away wonderfully and has kept my skin clear. I even bought this for my daughter who is acne prone and she loves it too!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth buying and a great price!!!</li>
            <li> For years I have struggled with facial ingrown hairs. They were painful at times and left large red and white bumps all over my neck line and face. I initially bought this soap to use on my arm to get rid of an annoying wart that I have. I didn&#x27;t end up using it for the wart, so I started washing my face with it in the shower. After 2-3 days of use, I noticed the hairs on my face started growing softer and fuzzier. After about a full week of use, my ingrown hairs completely disappeared!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been 4 weeks now since I&#x27;ve had my last ingrown hair. I normally had 4-5 ingrown hair on my face at any given time during a normal week, This soap is amazing. I didn&#x27;t even intend on getting this for ingrown hairs but it&#x27;s doing the job!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this exclusively since first trying it.  It is cheaper to by in higher quantities from their website.  I buy 12 bars at a time.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne and from past experience, I learned that sulfur works well on my face. I also have had positive results with S-acid, so I was pleased to find the two combined into a single soap. With regular use, the soap keeps my face clear, but I have found that I do need to keep up with moisturizing, because it can be drying. You can&#x27;t use the soap alone and expect your condition to go away for the long term - you do need to eat healthy, drink plenty of water, exercise, keep hands away from your face, and as it was suggested to me, you need to change your pillow case everying night, especially if you go to sleep with any kind of product in your hair.</li>
            <li> great product. helped to alleviate swelling and removal of dry and dead skin on severely infected leg (post-trauma). Buy it!</li>
            <li> finally something that work, its so drying my oily skin, with no redness or any irritations, very good shining control, i gave it 4 stars cause its too small in comparing with the benzyl soap</li>
            <li> To start, disregard the people who are saying it \\&quot;smells bad.\\&quot;  It&#x27;s sulfur soap, people, not perfume! I have been using it for years now, and it has worked wonders for me.  I developed an issue with scabies in my late twenties, and this soap truly eliminated it!  No soaps at the store did much of anything!  That alone made me love the soap.  Just a tip from a long time user, try buying from their website, you get free shipping ;)</li>
            <li> This stuff stinks, I haven&#x27;t even taken it out of the package and it reeks of old lady. Super strong smell of rose and maybe peony... super grandma level smell. I don&#x27;t care how well this works, I can&#x27;t smell like that it&#x27;s nasty. :(</li>
            <li> I have tried many face creams for acne treatment and this is buy far one of the best products! Great price too</li>
            <li> Very high quality soap.</li>
            <li> Works well, no complaints. Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this bar for about two weeks now and my face looks to be the clearest its been in a long time. I&#x27;ve had no breakouts. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a week and it makes my KP looke so much better. My armd are smoother and less red! I give it a 4 stars because I thought I would have a bigger change like other users but not much.</li>
            <li> Every few years I develop spots on my skin from a fungal infection.  I took the pills from the dermatologist years ago but why chance damaging my liver when this soap works.  I guess I smell a little like sulfur but I don&#x27;t have to use it every day.  The spots are gone and I saved a lot of money by staying out of the doctor&#x27;s office.  It works for me.</li>
            <li> We used to Salicylic soap with sulfur for some medical conditions and had to order it through a pharmacy.  Haven&#x27;t purchased it for several years.  It was needed again, but the pharmacies could not find it to order it for us.</li>
            <li> Great deal and the best part is it works and makes the skin feel much better.  My sister needs the salicylic acid to help her acne.</li>
            <li> for the price it is great. It works better than the stuff I get from my spa-facialist. Not sure if it is overdrying my skin though. I&#x27;ll update with more info as I use it longer.</li>
            <li> amazing product!! Cleared up my body blemishes within days! very affordable, too!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent Product! I have seen a huge difference in my face just after 5 days of use! You can feel how clean your skin is after using this soap and it smells good. I had mild acne breakouts upon receving this soap and my face has cleared and I have less blackheads, it also helps control the oil on my face. I cant wait to see the diffreence in a month or so. Shipped fast, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Strong smell and I saw very little changes with my acne. It did seem to make my skin softer though</li>
            <li> Good for mild acne. Makes the skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li> I got nothing from this. And I do mean \\&quot;nothing\\&quot;: no matter how long I rubbed the soap in my hands and dipped it under running water, I got not one bubble of lather from it. I couldn&#x27;t get any to rub onto a washcloth or loofah or facial brush. Now I know good and well that the presence or absence of lather is meaningless when it comes to the efficacy of a cleansing product. What it DOES do is allow you to measure how much of the product you&#x27;re actually getting from it in each use; imperative in a bar cleanser. And I got literally nothing from this soap. No lather, no residue of any kind to spread on my skin. I gave this an honest try over about a month&#x27;s worth of time but it&#x27;s as rough and dry as a pumice stone. Even a real pumice stone would have been more helpful than this was, though; it would at least have been useful for my feet, but I couldn&#x27;t even get THAT from this soap. In fairness, I have one positive thing to say about it: it had little or no scent that I could detect. Not many superior cleansers can make that claim. But with all the wonderful options out there in both liquid and bar form, this one isn&#x27;t worth the time or money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I have to add that this simple, little bar of soap comes with some of the most vicious and hateful customer service I&#x27;ve ever come across. You aren&#x27;t allowed to say you don&#x27;t like it or that it didn&#x27;t work for you; they will stop barely short of accusing you of libel and will waste much of their time (that could clearly be better spent running their company and improving their product) trying to discredit you and your word. They will go so far as to question your very salvation, as if by simply sharing your less-than-stellar experience with this one, forgettable little piece of crap soap you are ruining the entire Sal-3 company and dooming yourself to eternal damnation. I mean, really people. Calm. Down. That&#x27;s just not cool. It&#x27;s just soap. At this writing there are 26 positive reviews and only 3 poor reviews. (Though I should caution that a vast number of the glowing, 5-star reviews are NOT from authentic customers; in fact, some are simply duplicated with different, fake names, and are all posted as a way of off-setting the TINY minority of honest, bad reviews.) But, seriously. Two or three negative reviews and they all run amok in crisis mode, not bothering to think of HELPING those VERY FEW customers for whom the soap didn&#x27;t work, but instead desperately trying to discredit those reviews. They must be teetering mighty close to the edge of the out-of-business abyss if they are that scared of my one measly, personal opinion.(Though I should caution that a vast number of the glowing, 5-star reviews are NOT from authentic customers; in fact, some are simply duplicated with different, fake names, and are all posted as a way of off-setting the TINY minority of honest, bad reviews.)

            <li> Although it smells of sulfur and lavender, it&#x27;s an excellent soap for taking care of skin that has a broken, allergic rash. It kept my skin clean while it had a chance to heal, and the drying aspects of the sulfur brought the allergens up out of my skin quickly and neatly. It rinses clean with no film or stickiness.</li>
            <li> I noticed that salicylic acid was the active ingredient in many plantar/topical wart removers (I had also bought one such remover). I got this soap in hopes that it would augment that. I used the wart stuff on my foot first and waited before using it on my hands while using the soap on both. The warts on my hands - on which I used the soap only - are actually FALLING OFF. The warts on the bottom of my foot are disappearing faster than expected as well. The process has been slow and mildly uncomfortable, but this product has performed a miracle. In a few months, I will be wart-free thanks to this soap. I cannot recommend it highly enough.</li>
            <li> I love the soap..it has helped to calm my Roscea. it has a pleasant scent and the bar will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Helps a bit...not a cure though..... with my acne from Hormone Replacement Therapy</li>
            <li> I bought the Sal3 and the Grisi sulfur soap at the same time.  The Sal3 smelled so bad to me that I had to take it directly to the outside garbage, I did not want this smell in my house.  The Grisi soap smells better, somewhat similar to many American supermarket soaps, what Americans think of as &amp;#34;a clean smell.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My boys have eczema and this soap helps with the itching and helps heal the skin. It washes off clean and leaves no build up on your skin. Great for acne and oily skin</li>
            <li> Excellent product and service</li>
            <li> Really quite strong smelling.  &amp;#34;Scent&amp;#34; does not go away for 24 hours after use.</li>
            <li> I have used this off and on over the years and it always works. Glad I found more on Amazon.</li>
            <li> im so dissapoint,my sking is so dry</li>
            <li> Not as pleased as I would like. It doesn&#x27;t have a harsh bad smell and definitely feel clean after using.....just hasn&#x27;t cleared my acne as quickly as I expected. I can say tho since using this soap I haven&#x27;t had any bad breakouts or big acne. I will stick with it and hopefully get full results.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best product for anyone suffering from razor burn or acne.</li>
            <li> This soap is a amazing on acne prone skin.i did use almost everything for my acne nothing worked until I came across to this soap only in two weeks time my acne were dried up and now I have very smooth skin no acne no bumps under the skin it worth it.if you have tried everything for your acne just go for it and you will be amazed</li>
            <li> I have KP and I&#x27;ve tried many soaps over the years. This one is the best one by far, it&#x27;s a little bit drying if you use it everyday, but it significantly reduces skin bumps after several weeks of using it, they won&#x27;t go away, but it definitely helps. I combine it with [[ASIN:B000FJU4HK Dermadoctor KP Duty Body Scrub 16 oz]] once a week.</li>
            <li> Very drying, leaves face needing lotion. I don&#x27;t think it did much for my acne.</li>
            <li> Used only once.  Had no problems and it lathered quite well.  Hoping for results, with only once a week use or as needed based upon any breakout issues.</li>
            <li> Helps keep my teenager&#x27;s  acne and psoriasis in control.. Which is saying a lot. the price is nice here. I&#x27;ve bought single bars of sulphur type soaps at natural booths/businesses and they are always quite expensive.</li>
            <li> Good product at a fair price with fast delivery.</li>
            <li> this is very good to exfoliate but your skin will be pretty dam dry after so make sure you lotion up..</li>
            <li> Product works perfectly, cant beat if for the price, cheaper than any other spot looked at! Highly satisfied! Great Service!</li>
            <li> Works really good. Use on my back and legs and have definitely seen an improvement over the past month. Happy</li>
            <li> It works, has a great price, I recommend this. The soap has a nice aroma which is a bonus. I was afraid it would smell like medicine.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed! I real enjoyed this product. I hope to be as satisfied as I was this time with the product.</li>
            <li> Best product ever. Clear my face of acne highly recomendes.</li>
            <li> I found this soap when I started noticing an odor in my hair that was there even when I was fresh out of the shower.  I was mortified.  Eventually I read that this soap would help with \\&quot;smelly scalp\\&quot; and I ordered some.  I have to use a good conditioner with this soap so it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out, but it works amazingly.  My hair smells great.  The soap itself even has a mild scent that I&#x27;ve come to love.  I now use this soap to wash my body with as I tend to have a bit of odor on really hot,sweaty days in the summer.  This soap with a little powder and I&#x27;m good to go.  I use this soap in the cooler months and I don&#x27;t even need deodorant any more!  Honestly, I only use deodorant in the summer--this soap is that good.  I have about 15 bars of this just in case it&#x27;s ever discontinued.  You can get this soap for $5.99/bar at the Sal3 website, or if you order in bulk like I do you can pay as little as $3.33 per bar with free shipping.  I have used this soap for over a year now and it is a Godsend.</li>
            <li> This soap seems to be doing a great job of tightening up my oily skin.  The jury is still out as to whether there is overall long-term improvement though.  Will probably be a better test when the summer heat comes back.</li>
            <li> After seeing a HUGE improvement in my acne while using De La Cruz Sulfur Ointment Cream I thought why not switch my entire routine to a sulfur-based wash? Although it reduced redness, and swelling dramatically, it dries your skin out terribly. Be sure to moisturize afterwards! The soap is shipped in a bubble-lined manilla envelope, which I thought was a little strange, but that&#x27;s really nothing to complain about.</li>
            <li> Love this soap! Was worried about the smell because of other reviews, but I actually like the smell!! Will be buying more soon!!</li>
            <li> This is good stuff.  Give it a try.  It&#x27;s long lasting, too.  You don&#x27;t have to have bad skin problems to use this either.</li>
            <li> I was using this soap to try and help clear up a rash type irritation on my arms.The soap is very effective,so I suggest use it sparingly,suds up,let it stay on a minute or so,then rinse good. I would NOT use this soap on my face(too strong) for my skin type(fair) anyway.</li>
            <li> I have acne on my back, and I&#x27;ve tried numerous acne washes to get rid of them. None of them have worked as well as this one does. It doesn&#x27;t lather like normal soap, though it does help to get it wet for a little bit before using it. It&#x27;s important to remember that lather is not actually necessary for cleaning, and this soap does a much better job for acne than any other I&#x27;ve tried, all of which lathered better. Of note, when I was on a recent tropical vacation, I got numerous mosquito bites, and showering with this worked relatively well to help stop the itching. That is one side benefit of the sulfur in the soap. I have used this on my face a few times and didn&#x27;t find it to be overly drying. I generally only do that if I&#x27;m having a breakout, though.</li>
            <li> I have used salicylic soap for years and the product I used is no longer available.&lt;br /&gt;This product sounded exactly like what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;Well, it is so fragranced, and I am allergic to fragrances so it is in a baggie in the garage and the area by it is also fragranced.&lt;br /&gt;I am sure it would be great for someone who can handle fragrances.</li>
            <li> I got the sulfur soap in the mail yesterday and before I could even open the package I could smell its sweet scent so I was pleasantly surprised about that. The packaging was simple but done properly so that was good too. The size is fair and I have used it once and after using it my skin felt nice, no tightness and my skin was actually smooth feeling. In a week or so I will make another review and tell you if it helped my acne at all and if the change was mild or super noticeable. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soooo i am back to say that I see a huge difference in my skin. Pores look smaller, less pimples, and my face feels smoother. I will continue to use this soap and maybe pair it with the sulfur ointment and see how the combination works for my acne prone skin. LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this soap for a week, but I have SUPER sensitive oily acne prone skin. I typically breakout within the first two days of using a new product and that&#x27;s how I know to toss it. However, this soap does a great job cleansing my skin without drying it out or irritating the area around my nose...which is the first area to break out. I plan to continue using the soap daily and I will give you guys an update in 3 months. See ya then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product still works great! It&#x27;s long lasting and very mild.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sal 3 Soap for two weeks, so far I&#x27;m quite pleased with it. I&#x27;ve got to use it for another three weeks to see what the result will be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Great soap to use but moisturize afterwards.  My order came quick.</li>
            <li> Great for KP!!! Dont forget to later and exfoliate! !</li>
            <li> Really working for my problem acne caused by allergies.</li>
            <li> I have order this sulfur soap for the first time , . My order arrived quickly and in good condition .I used other sulfur soap before , but this one works very good for me , with the salicylic acid.,now my acne have disappear , , certainly , i will order more of these soaps , and tell my friends to order them , for acne or blemish..</li>
            <li> OMG. so far this is better than many acne products that ive used, its used for cleansing and works well with my overningth acne medication. I&#x27;ll probably be buying more</li>
            <li> I was using this product consistently for about 2 months and I saw nothing! It dried out my face and my breakouts continued. I put this under my bathroom counter for a few months not preparing to use it again. I decided to give this another chance one day and began to use it again; this time I tried something different. Instead of rinsing it off with warm water, I decided to rinse off with cold water. It made a world of difference. Now I use this every other day with pretty good results. It hasn’t stopped my breakouts completely but it’s better than most over the counter facial products. FYI: it’s cheaper at the actual site and most likely fresher.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t seem to work for me unfortunately.</li>
            <li> also smells worse than the metaderm</li>
            <li> Very good ......you will see improvements on a short period of time</li>
            <li> This is a novelty soap, nothing more. The scent is clean and pleasant at first, but harshly perfumed further into the soap (perhaps it contains a more affordably produced core). I would expect a more pronounced brimstone quality in a product with sulfur claims -- not such a focus on perfume (specially for a &#x27;medicated&#x27; bar), so was puzzled and put off by the absence of any detectable sulfur (specially as sulfur has such an obvious, naturally strong smell). The soap seemed to fare well with blemishes at first, but after several uses I attribute that to how very drying it is. After the first couple of uses, the soap began to smell very strongly of perfume, whereas new and dry it seemed cleaner and not as harsh (but, again, I would not have expected it to be a fragranced bar at all). I would not credit this soap with actually treating problem skin nor recommend it for any curative use, specially for folks with already blemished, problem skin (for whom this soap is marketed). This soap has no integrity and becomes very soft, like putty, after a couple of uses, and the entire bar can be squeezed through the fingers like butter at this point. As important as it is to preserve the life and quality of any soap by keeping it dry and away from any standing water (I kept mine in an open, raised-bottom, wooden soap dish), there is little to be done with or for this soap. Because it is advertised as a dermatologist-recommended soap, I made a good handful of calls to dermatologists out of my provider directory, and asked them if they would recommend it. The few offices that were kind enough to return my call had never heard of the brand and after finding the soap&#x27;s website advised me to beware of scams. Had I made these calls earlier or read through the handful of negative reviews (and their rebuttals) or looked more closely at the positive reviews, I might have spared myself the consequences of my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I have given this sal-3 soap review one star is due equally to its quality, which I have reviewed separately (above) and to my personal experience ordering this soap, which I am sharing for the benefit of other shoppers. The seller I purchased from engages in bait and switch practices, altering its own listing between transactions to draw in customers with multipack listings, then editing the product&#x27;s page to reflect an offer of a single item as soon as an order is placed.

If you see a seller rebutting with defensive comments in the areas designed for customers to rate them for the benefit of other customers, and even rating themselves there--take heed. And if you see them leaving prayers there... (need I say more?). There are always other sellers to choose from who would appreciate your business, and who can function without the insanity. http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B00685KUGA/ref&#x3D;cm_ciu_pdp_images_0?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;index&#x3D;0</li>
            <li> I had to get use to the smell.  It&#x27;s not a bad odor, but a unique smell.  I guess it&#x27;s because of the Sulfur.  Lather&#x27;s nicely and it&#x27;s not harsh.  After two tries, I like the product a lot.  Very gentle on the skin and my KP bumps went away.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this soap. It has a bit of an unpleasant smell because of the sulfur, but I no longer notice it. Bumpy skin on my arms has disappeared. This is a good choice for acne.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use mineral oil on my skin, it causes a type of fungus on my skin when I&#x27;m in the sun (white spots that won&#x27;t tan). I couldn&#x27;t find a drug store that carried it so that&#x27;s why I went online. I don&#x27;t know anyone else that has this problem, but if I did I could tell them where I got it</li>
            <li> The Sal 3 soap must be judged primarily on its merits as a keratolitic &amp; antifungal agent and secondary as a bath soap. My wife and I have been using this soap for a few years and it scores five stars on all 3 counts. This is not a floral soap bar but a sulphur and  salysilic acid one and it smells like well, like sulphur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must add that this  soap is very effective at cleaning and at the same time very mild. Overall an excelent soap for both medicinal and bathing purposes..</li>
            <li> I have been asked to review this soap but I am not comfortable writing my review as of this moment.  I have been using the soap for several weeks but unfortunately not everyday.  It is a great smelling soap.  I thought it would&#x27;ve smelt like stinky sulfur but it actually has a pleasant smell.  My adult acne hasn&#x27;t disappeared but like I said I haven&#x27;t been using it everyday as I should.  I have noticed that it works well on my extremely oily skin which I appreciate.  My co-workers have started seeing a difference in my appearance and have complimented me on it.  I have only noticed the reduction in my oily appearance where they have noticed a different change.  Some soaps work faster I must admit but this soap is working.  I have not experienced any burning or peeling as some soaps tend to give.  I think I will continue to use the soap and try to use it everyday to see what it can really do for my skin.  I believe under the oily and acne covered dermis is a beautiful female.  I like this soap.</li>
            <li> great easy to use and works !!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried more products than I can remember to help with my Keratosis Pilaris, which I&#x27;ve had since a young child.  This product WORKS!!!!!!  My skin always gets worse in the winter, and while many products may work for a short time, it seems my skin eventually becomes immune to the treatment.  I&#x27;ve been using this soap for several months, and my skin is OH SO SMOOTH.  My arms are as smooth as they have ever been, in the middle of winter, even after using the product for several months.</li>
            <li> not as outstanding as expected.....it doesn&#x27;t do a a thing for my complexion; my fault for ordering ovef the internet</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it was going to help with my kp and acne, of course everything claims it&#x27;s a miracle worker, but I will say i don&#x27;t think this helps kp, but I do use this as a face wash along with baking soda and i think it works well for that.</li>
            <li> I bought this to treat oily skin and I have had no issues. Good product at a competitive price.</li>
            <li> It lathers well, has very little odor, and helps skin without irritating dryness. Yes, I was surprised.</li>
            <li> It is good at cleaning off the oil. Makes your face feel smoother.  I didn&#x27;t notice much difference with the acne than with other acne soaps, but did like how my face felt after washing with it. Not too dry or too oily.</li>
            <li> This soap doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as loud as i thought it would based on the description. i like that it isnt super drying!</li>
            <li> This dried out my skin too much. It may helps others but my skin is normally dry so this did not help me. I preferred using a baking soda as a exfoliate- far less drying.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend that has eczema really bad and this has really helped her skin a lot.  She says that her skin has stopped itching so much and it appears that the color is coming back.  Her skin had turned really dark from the eczema. She says that the odor is not so bad but do tend to linger in the wash cloth.</li>
            <li> I love it so much I cried. still crying now. It was so funny I almost died from hard laughing</li>
            <li> This product worked miracles on my face.. I had the worst case of acne..(hormonal/stress) I used it once, and it cleared up my face immediate.. Without irriting or over drying my skin.. I wish they sold this product in the local stores, I would stock up on them without a dout... Well worth the MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> Very Good product, Highly recommended. Its very good for the skin, it helps Dermatitis, eczema etc. Smells delicious!!! I will buy it always!!!</li>
            <li> The product realy works.I use it for my pimples,rashes and/or any breack outon the skin. It will drys your skitn depend on how often you use it. When dryness occur just use a moisturizer soap after and cream too.Recommended.</li>
            <li> .Have skin fungus and was looking for something with anti fungal properties.  Heard that sulfur was good for the purpose.  Does not cure but helps to control the outbreaks.</li>
            <li> This product worsened my facial acne considerably, but seems to be a reasonably effective treatment for my back acne. The smell is mildly unpleasant, but not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> Smells like it is medicated, but after 6 weeks I have seen no results.</li>
            <li> For a background check- I&#x27;m a Asian women in my early 20&#x27;s. I waited until I used the whole bar to write this review to see if it really made a difference. I used the sulfur cream, a sulfur mask, and a scrub weekly while washing my face with this twice a day. When I ran out of this bar, I realized a week later, there wasn&#x27;t a difference between this and others. It may work for others, but not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, I began to see results by combining a microdermabrasion powder I bought on Amazon with the Oil of Olay Illumination face wash.</li>
            <li> The smell of this soap is not nearly as harsh as I expected.</li>
            <li> I have keratosis pilaris on my lower back and legs, so was hoping this soap would help.  It seems to soften the skin and loosen clogged pores to some extent, but the problem comes right back.  As far as the smell, it is a bit medicinal, but not unpleasant to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not sure about this soap. Sometimes it seems to work great and other times it does nothing. Also sometimes it gives me a slight red rash. I really like it as a shampoo. It seems to control any scalp itching of flaking. I did reorder it and hence the 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I placed one order but for some reason they charged me twice ,ii emailed them but never got a reply. I realized I would eventually run out anyway so I just kept it. It arrived quickly. The reason I got this soap is because my scalp is EXTREMELY  oily. And I started using it a week ago and I noticed that its gradually getting better, I am using a tea tree shampoo after I rinse off the soap because I felt like it left some residue and that tea three shampoo makes feel much cleaner , so far it&#x27;s working the smell of the sulfur takes some getting used to, I don&#x27;t like it at all but at this point I was desperate for a solution for my nasty, smelly hair. By the way I washed it everyday sometimes  twice( morning and at night) and it was oily withing two hours.</li>
            <li> This soap really does work.  Have tried many other OTC and Dr scripts this has been the one that had best results. Will purchase again.  Glad I tried this product.</li>
            <li> This soap will definitely dry up any acne or bacteria. Just beware, it will dry up your whole face. I cut down on its use to maybe twice a week. I still have to figure out how to incorporate this into my facial wash process without totally drying my skin out. I have oily skin but the oil slicks are gone now. Definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li> I gave this 5 Stars even though I will probably never use it again, through no fault of the soap.&lt;br /&gt;I have a scalp condition requiring the use of 2 or 3 % Salicylic Acid.&lt;br /&gt;I was using a product that worked really well, but when the formula changed, I wanted to try and find another solution.&lt;br /&gt;Buying this bar was just that.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER...my body chemistry does not jive well with the sulfur. (who knew?) My skin itched a bit, and later when I sweated in the hot sun, itched.&lt;br /&gt;You should know...this soap STINKS. lol...&amp;#34;sulfur&amp;#34; is the key word, here ;) Have you a plastic soap holder available.</li>
            <li> I used it,  it works in just 1 1/2 week,  it was really money well spend. I will be  purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Works good for acne prevention and healing. And cleans face poor&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> bought this soap for me and my son and we do not see any difference in our skin at all.  well what can I say, I gave this product a shot.  Neva again !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give this 5 stars except the sulfur stinks like a rotten egg fart and it seems like you smell it on yourself all day. There are bars like aveeno&#x27;s and neutrogena&#x27;s salicylic acid bars that work well and smell much better, so I threw this out after one use. It may work well, but part of showering is smelling clean. And smelling like sulfur is like dropping a stink bomb. Sorry.</li>
            <li> smells sooooo bad and leaves a film over your skin after you use it. My scalp got even itchier after I used it. My skin looked so dull and stunk like a skunk after every use. My family and friends were complaining about the bad smell so I had to return it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for only a few days.  I am 62 yrs old and when in my teens I had a severe case of acne and my dermatologist recommended sulphur soap.  It worked then really well.  So having another mild case of acne, I decided to try it again ... Oh yes, it worked, beautifully.  I wouldn&#x27;t have written with just that info except that it also has given me relief with a mild case of athletes foot, a mild case of psoriasis, and a mild fungus on two private parts of my body. Now for those people who have not had success with this, perhaps they didn&#x27;t use it correctly.  You must lather it in warm water and you must let it sit on your skin for about a minute for it to activate. You don&#x27;t wash it off immediately.  After that don&#x27;t wipe your skin dry, dab it dry.  If you do this I can&#x27;t imagine it will not give you relief.  I will use this forever unless I develop an allergy to it (which you can).  My skin feels lovely with it and very cheap ivory soap.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 2nd 6 pack of this soap. It has made a huge difference in my scalp problems, which are namely, excessive oil production which causes seb derm and build up. Unclogs and degunks. It has a nice clean smell, leaves no greasy residue at all. Hair loss has slowed to a crawl, so hair follicles must be in much better shape. I hope they never discontinue this soap, LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I have used this soap before and it lasts a long time and does exactly what it says it will do.  I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> not as good as fostex soap.</li>
            <li> So far not very effective, but it does help with redness from acne. Recommend using with another acne treatment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. I haven&#x27;t used it much to see the effect though.</li>
            <li> Did not do anything to help my acne.</li>
            <li> nice soap but leaves a distinct scent which some may not like</li>
            <li> Last long. Brought it to help clear my acne. I didn&#x27;t do much for it but I still have the feeling it&#x27;s a good product just not for me.</li>
            <li> I have Keratosis pilaris, and have used multiple lotions prescribed by my dermatologist. I saw this product and thought I&#x27;d try it out. I&#x27;ve been using it on one arm and one leg (using the other arm and leg as controls) two to three days a week for about two weeks now, and I am impressed! I feel that it works as well as, perhaps even better than, my prescription lactate lotion, and at a fraction of the price. I&#x27;ve been using it with a regular over-the-counter lotion I was using before, so this improvement that I am seeing is definitely the soap. The bumps on my arm have smoothed out a lot, and seem less prolific. The condition on my legs is more severe than my arms and more difficult to treat it seems, but I notice the redness is finally fading on the leg I&#x27;ve been using the soap on. I hope my KP continues to improve, it would be fantastic to be able to wear shorts again without being embarrassed about polka-dotted legs! The sulfur smell of the soap is fairly negligible and fades within an hour, though it does seem to hang around in my jacket to an extent.</li>
            <li> I don’t know if this was the correct product for me.  I tried it and it didn’t do what I thought it would do based on the reviews I read before I bought it.  So on that basis; I stopped using it after two weeks.  The big problem was the odor.  The odor got into my clothing, towels, and my person.  My wife was not pleased because it was so invasive and causing the offensive odor in the bathroom.  After I stopped using it for several weeks and I can still smell it on some of my clothing even after many washings.  Very powerful stuff.  I finally broke down and went to a dermatologist to fix my problem.</li>
            <li> My skin already looks better after a couple of uses. Can&#x27;t believe how fast I saw results! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> OMG! This soap is awesome, I&#x27;m going to stick with it!!! It&#x27;s clear out skin problems that no other product has yet so far. I&#x27;m going to recommend this to friends.</li>
            <li> From what I&#x27;ve read it takes time for the bumps and/or redness I have on the back of my legs to deminish which is why i&#x27;m only giving it 3 stars, but what I will say is that if you have any zit/blemish/redness going on your face...this little bar of wonder will take care of that after only 1 or 2 uses. It&#x27;s not the best smelling, but it&#x27;s not unbearable.</li>
            <li> I once used another well known acne medicine. It was super expensive and I had to have a subscription to even order one item! I only stuck with it because it worked so well. All that is over now that I found this in-expensive bar! I am in love with it! It repels my acne and the boils I am prone to during the sweaty summer months. I wish I had found this sooner! It saves me money, prevents boils and acne, has a pleasant scent, and is easy to use! Do yourself a favor and try this medicated bar for just a week. You won&#x27;t go back to the overpriced, subscription meds!</li>
            <li> the soap seemed to be working. the only problem was with the order. i did not get both bars ordered. i did get a refund for the bar not received. however i did not order any more thinking i may have to go through the same thing.</li>
            <li> Much better then regular bar soap.</li>
            <li> my daughter has KP on the back of her arms, her back and the bottoms of her legs. i noticed a change for the better on both the back of her ams (first) then her back stopped breaking out as badly. her legs are the worse case and we are still working on them. I also use this for my face and am buying another bar for my 17 year old for his breakouts.  I am very happy with the performance and price. it does not stink, lathers well and personally have no issues with it. it&#x27;s a medicated soap.</li>
            <li> Best soap . Keeps my face clean all day.. saw results in 1week..</li>
            <li> I have had problems with my arms breaking out for the last three years. I purchased this to use in the shower on them. I have seen a descent reduction in redness and breakouts but it will dry your skin out some, including yours hands holding it. I keep a moisturizing bar next to it to clean my hands after using it and then use grapeseed oil on my arms when I get out to moisturizer them. The combo has worked great.</li>
            <li> I have awful skin and after lots of research realized these 2 ingredients are by far the best for acne/oily skin issues! You would pay about 100 bucks at the least for a face-wash at the dermatologist for the same product!! Ive ordered many similar products and this combo of sulfur/salicylic acid is by far the best!! Make sure you lather and use lots of HOT water to rinse!!! Twice a day and breakouts have almost stopped!</li>
            <li> Before I bought i read all the reviews! not one of them mentioned HEAVY PERFUME in the soap, or a very oily greasy film on skin after use. thats what I got. So I am wondering did I get the same soap that everybody else did?I returned it promptly and waited for a refund, a week later nothing and I am still waiting for refund. $22 for 2 bars of soap you could by anywhere for a fraction of the price I an totally dissatisfied!the company received my return but refused to give me a refund unless I removed my review!</li>
            <li> Thank You! It is outstanding when you order a product and it is everything that was advertised. My order was perfect in everyway it arrived quick and is a very good product. Thank You and keep the good work up.</li>
