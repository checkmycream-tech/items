            <li>People are envious of this cute envelope bag.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>&amp; I love it.</li>

            <li>For what is worth, it is  good investment.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this bag.</li>
            <li>The purse is very cute &amp; arrived quickly considering it came from China.</li>
            <li>This purse was cheap in more ways than 1.</li>
            <li>it rips easily.</li>
            <li>And probably easy to fix if I had the time.</li>
            <li>I originally got this as a gift for a friend</li>
            <li>I had to clean the bag and disinfect it.</li>
            <li>Its better as a makeup up in your purse than being used as a clutch because it&#x27;s very flimsy.  </li>
            <li>Although the measurements were listed, I&#x27;ve never been good at metric conversion and it  was bigger</li>
            <li>but my very gracious friend seemed to love it</li>
            <li>The strap is nice and long so I was able to wear it across my body.</li>
            <li>Its a super cute bag and is the size shown but the inside is not only made of a very cheap material but</li>
            <li>Love it especially for the price I love clutch purses.</li>
            <li>The strap broke on me the first night I used the purse.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li>I aired it out for a couple days and left some dryer sheets inside, so the smell went away for the most part.</li>
            <li>The only good thing about this bag was I actually received it 2 weeks early.</li>
            <li>Looks SO high quality and badass.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clean and flat; totally new.</li>
            <li>I went by the reviews as far as not using the strap, and disposed of it then.</li>
            <li>You can fit a few things in it and carry it under your arm.</li>
            <li>Its looks are classy and chic.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>The only issues I had were that it smells a little funny and a stud came off after a little while, but I was able to reattach it.</li>
            <li>This made it more difficult to hide the fact it wasn&#x27;t real leather.  </li>
            <li>Needless to say it is a cute clutch but definitely not an everyday bag.</li>
            <li>So happy with purse but extremely unhappy with packaging!</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s cute, however, not what I was expecting. I got it to use as portfolio of such. It does do the trick for that. I went by the reviews as far as not using the strap, and disposed of it then. Would I buy it again? Absolutely not. For the money, go for it. It&#x27;s clean and flat; totally new. You can fit a few things in it and carry it under your arm. All in all, it&#x27;s about a 90 out of 100.</li>
            <li> This purse was cheap in more ways than 1. I had to remove the strap because it was pulling the tabs off on the 1st day! Needless to say it is a cute clutch but definitely not an everyday bag. Studs are beautiful!</li>
            <li> its not worth buying if you&#x27;re gonna use the straps... it rips easily. i used it for a day and i haven&#x27;t used it since cuz it ripped a big hole in it...</li>
            <li> This purse is great. It arrived on time and looks just like the picture. It came with a removable strap and has 3 pockets. The only issues I had were that it smells a little funny and a stud came off after a little while, but I was able to reattach it. I aired it out for a couple days and left some dryer sheets inside, so the smell went away for the most part.</li>
            <li> The only good thing about this bag was I actually received it 2 weeks early. The bad news is of course it smells which is fine I know it will dissipate. Its very thin. Very thin like I won&#x27;t use the strap because I feel like that will break off. Its a super cute bag and is the size shown but the inside is not only made of a very cheap material but it looks used. I had to clean the bag and disinfect it. There were dust balls and what looked like make up smears in it. The zipper on the back was broken already I had to take it off and have a friend that sews reattach it. Besides it being cute that&#x27;s all it has to offer. Its better as a makeup up in your purse than being used as a clutch because it&#x27;s very flimsy.  I&#x27;m so sad. I wanted this to be awesome.</li>
            <li> just perfect, glad I bought this. Better without strap. People are envious of this cute envelope bag. Good quality, hope it lasts a while</li>
            <li> Coodles to the makers! Its looks are classy and chic. The purse looks expensive but is not. I love it. I often get a lot of complements.</li>
            <li> Used twice and straps began to tear from purse.</li>
            <li> Totally weak bag wore it twice an the strap tore ...seriously</li>
            <li> Love it especially for the price I love clutch purses.</li>
            <li> Wow. That&#x27;s what I said when I received this. Got it in 2 days with my prime account &amp; I love it. Looks SO high quality and badass. I originally got this as a gift for a friend but now I&#x27;m having another for myself!</li>
            <li> happy with bag however seller folded four times and put in a small envelope. so now it has fold lines in it and doesnt lay flat. Took a while to receive also. So happy with purse but extremely unhappy with packaging!</li>
            <li> Cute bag . The fabric was a lot cheaper than I thought. The strap is nice and long so I was able to wear it across my body. The zippers work great. For $8 you can complain.</li>
            <li> The purse is very cute &amp; arrived quickly considering it came from China. The reason it got 2 stars is the quality. The strap broke on me the first night I used the purse. Thankfully I noticed or I could&#x27;ve lost all my belongings. I paid less than $10 so you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Its realy nice i loved it but i would give a five star but it riped very easily. From both corners were the straps goes. Now i cant use it like that. I only used it twice :(</li>
            <li> Came a few days earlier than estimated day. For what is worth, it is  good investment. You can wear it as a clutch, or you can put the strap on and wear it as a purse. Great buy, loving the studs and the skulls on them. Cannot complain.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this bag. BUT the handle broke after about 6 months. Still use it as a clutch though! And probably easy to fix if I had the time.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift.  Although the measurements were listed, I&#x27;ve never been good at metric conversion and it  was bigger then I expected.  This made it more difficult to hide the fact it wasn&#x27;t real leather.  I ordered it as a gift and was a little embarassed to give it but my very gracious friend seemed to love it so I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li> Love love love this clutch! Great price too!</li>
