            <li>Also the seller was wonderful and it arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>Read about this and was glad to find it on Amazon- great price, great seller.</li>
            <li>good product</li>
            <li>The price for this finish spray is a good deal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as good as anything I&#x27;ve tried.....</li>
            <li>My makeup looked as good at the end of the reception (indoors) as it did in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>Good for oily skin.</li>
            <li>I still sweated off a good bit through the reception and had to have touch ups.  </li>
            <li>However, this is really good if you went &amp;</li>
            <li>Gives good effect.</li>
            <li>I face remained looking flawless and fresh all day and into night.</li>
            <li>The seller could have very easily dumped out the good contents and sent me something else.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>I love this spray!</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>Model in A Bottle is much better!</li>
            <li>Will repurchase many times!  </li>
            <li>make sure you cover your eyes before spraying...definitely a keeper!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty impressed with the product.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite purchases!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It is amazing.  </li>
            <li>looks amazing at the end of night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>I saw all the amazing reviews about this product and was thrilled.  </li>
            <li>this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, and awesome product!</li>
            <li>The shine that it produces isn&#x27;t that nice dewy, glowing look some people go for.</li>
            <li>It is effective in removing the overly made up</li>
            <li>I did not see difference but feels nice on the skin, also I thought it was suppose to keep the skin matte  </li>
            <li>even gives a nice glow to my complexion , though might ve been a figment of my imagination.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I would recommend it for anyone who wants to keep their make-up looking great!</li>
            <li>but it did the job nicely.</li>
            <li>This product comes out in a very nice fine mist.  </li>
            <li>so very cost effective, i have noticed that if i put more than 3 sprays this product will give a cake look but recommended 2 sprays the finish is excellent.</li>
            <li>Pretty good product  though!</li>
            <li>This is by far, one of the best sprays on the market!</li>
            <li>This honestly keeps your make up so beautifully in place and it really is tear resistant.</li>
            <li>I liked this product better than Model in a Bottle, but still haven&#x27;t found a setting spray that I love.</li>
            <li>It stops my skin from getting really oily during the day, it&#x27;s gives my makeup longevity and gives me a beautiful finish.</li>
            <li>It makes a huge difference!</li>
            <li>If you have oily/ combination skin, the finish may look more oily than dewy.</li>
            <li>Shipment was fast and the product is great</li>
            <li>Makeup stays in place for 8 hours, even more.</li>
            <li>&quot; This spray makes sure it stays put throughout the day.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s THAT precious to me).</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>This formula is wayyy better, idk why, don&#x27;t care why, just glad I found it.  </li>
            <li>and when I awoke in the morning, it was still in place (for the most part) and not on my pillow or sheets.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about about the Bridal Makeup Finish, and with the description listed, I was getting really excited because I thought it would be even better than DANCE!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like...</li>
            <li>More Shine\\&quot; version of this.</li>
            <li>Wish I would have known that before I purchased it, as most of the 5 star reviews say it didn&#x27;t make the users shiny.</li>
            <li>No need to apply more powder and run the risk of looking like</li>
            <li>When I sweat, most of my make up stays put even with dabbing the sweat.</li>
            <li>More Shine is WAY better.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wedding day, and I am so glad</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this finishing spray.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to do a skin test to be sure, but I&#x27;m under the impression that this stuff is making my top layer of skin peel off.</li>
            <li>AND I had both sides of my face all over that thing trying to get comfortable!</li>
            <li>I love it and so does my daughter who tried it and promptly &amp;#34;borrowed&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>and it worked much better than the e.l.f. brand I tried from Target.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure for the price there are easier ways to set makeup, but I prefer to spray and</li>
            <li>I love the item-</li>
            <li>Great seller, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>For 29 bucks I was expecting something a lot better.  </li>
            <li>My favorite makeup holding spray.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I will try ONE more thing.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>This made my face look wrinkly and I felt it showed off my pores more</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s gotta be something better out there</li>
            <li>16 seconds is more like it:</li>
            <li>and I have begun using Skindinivia much more than it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>The bridal spray is my favorite of the two.</li>
            <li>Love this idea and will purchase again.  </li>
            <li>Make up looks lovely on pictures.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it</li>
            <li>&quot; at the top.  </li>
            <li>This finishing spray is exactly what I needed!!!  </li>
            <li>held my makeup consistently for about a good 4-5 hours, and after about 6-7 hours</li>
            <li>It gives me a flawless look after I apply my makeup and lasts all day long.</li>
            <li>Love the easy spray - no scent that I&#x27;ve noticed..</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m glad Amazon makes it so easy to return something.</li>
            <li>Decided, to give \\&quot;skindnavia\\&quot; the company one more try &amp; was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Your makeup stays put and looks amazing and it REALLY helps with oily skin too :)</li>
            <li>I break out easily and have oily skin</li>
            <li>I tend to break out easily from products and I have oily skin.</li>
            <li>Helps set makeup reliably, easy on skin.</li>
            <li>Not so easy when your my age.  </li>
            <li>Not so easy when you&#x27;re my age.  </li>
            <li>This spray smells strong</li>
            <li>Hands down the BEST makeup setter out there is MODEL IN A BOTTLE.  </li>
            <li>Five stars isn&#x27;t enough stars to express how wonderful this product is!!!!,,,, this really sets ur makeup all day!</li>
            <li>This is a great product, extremely happy, does exactly what it is suppose to do, only reason I gave it 4 star was the price of delivery to Australia  cost as much as the product .</li>
            <li>and after it dries, I finish with a light dust of powder.  </li>
            <li>and it was fabulous.</li>
            <li>I might as well just have sprayed my face with a light misting of hairspray like we did in the matte-infested 90&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but most of the day a fresh look.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been cheap about makeup</li>
            <li>I really can recommend this product enough, just beautiful!</li>
            <li>AFTER I FINISH MY MAKE UP, AND IT SEEN TO MAKE MY FACE MORE SHINY RIGHT WAY.  </li>
            <li>If you do not want a sheen to your finish, go with the original formula.</li>
            <li>so I have nothing to compare it to, but I&#x27;m pretty confident it beats the competition.</li>
            <li>Makeup stays fresh all day!</li>
            <li>It keeps my makeup on, even on the most hot and humid of days.</li>
            <li>It performs great in dry and humid climates.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even count how many setting sprays I&#x27;ve tried and this is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Been using this product for several weeks now and so far I am not overly impressed.  </li>
            <li>My makeup artist saw it on the day of the wedding and was super excited because she loves this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I use 3-4 sprays per day, and have been using it for over month, with the bottle still 4/5 full.</li>
            <li>or Cool (</li>
            <li>which I haven&#x27;t tried Cool</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t rub off :) I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>I wear make up forever face and body foundation and their full coverage concealer.</li>
            <li>Your make up will hold for at least 8 hours and will still look practically flawless.</li>
            <li>My skin type is more on the oily side, so getting my makeup to stay put has always been an ongoing process until I discovered Skindinavia Bridal Makeup Finish, thanks to Goss Makeup Artist on YouTube.  </li>
            <li>I love it so much, I give it as gifts.</li>
            <li>As much as I wanted to love this product, it did nothing for me at all.  </li>
            <li>if there&#x27;s a product out there that helps keep my makeup on and still looking good 6 hours later</li>
            <li>if there&#x27;s a product out there that helps keep my makeup on and still looking good 6 hours later</li>
            <li>I liked it so far.</li>
            <li>I have used similar high end makeup finish products, but this is absolutely THE BEST!  </li>
            <li>But, most definitely, it lasts more than 5 hours on my skin.</li>
            <li>pleased and would recommend to anyone who wants to stay looking fresh all day.</li>
            <li>Spray a quick X and ....</li>
            <li>Spray a quick X and ....</li>
            <li>Love this spray...definitely coming back for more...</li>
            <li>I get a very nice finish with my makeup and it really does help my foundation last all day.  </li>
            <li>For everyday use with a primer and a light dusting of rice powder on my t-zone to control shine, it works wells to keep my makeup from melting off in warm weather, noticeably better than with just primer and rice powder alone.</li>
            <li>and I was still able to sweat it off just by normal behavior.</li>
            <li>With this I still look good at the end of a long day of work.  </li>
            <li>This is easy to use and dries really fast.  </li>
            <li>and this one for some reason just has that extra staying power for me even over Urban Decay&#x27;s long-lasting one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would rate myself as having fairly oily (but not the oiliest) skin, and I can easily go 8 hours without touching up and look pretty close to how I was the moment I walked out the door in the morning.</li>
            <li>Overall, it was OK, I guess!</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve over-powdered your face, or want your makeup to look more natural, this will do it!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin, so there might be a chance that this would look ok on women with dry skin, but I kind of doubt it.</li>
            <li>Whereas it is completely moisturized in the islands, I now have combo oily skin, more on the oily side.  </li>
            <li>This finishing spray keeps my makeup looking fresh from morning</li>
            <li>I rarely leave the house without eyeliner, so I&#x27;m always worried about \\&quot;raccoon eyes.\\</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it two days so far, and I&#x27;m quite pleased with it.</li>
            <li>You get a much better price buying it direct from Skindinavia.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but TOTALLY worth it.</li>
            <li>My makeup looks fresh and survives humidity, my oily skin  and sweat thus my 5 star rating.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 100% worth it, I use it instead of setting powder (though women who have even oilier skin than I do may benefit from using both if they wish).</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s nice, I don&#x27;t believe this setting spray has the lasting power as UD&#x27;s All-Nighter.</li>
            <li>I feel like it sets my makeup nicely, helps it last throughout the day-</li>
            <li>It seems that my makeup stays in place better, but my face still gets a frequent shine.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time last week and it turned out pretty good.</li>
            <li>The finish is very clean and natural looking instead of shiny.</li>
            <li>it right out to her car.</li>
            <li>RIGHT</li>
            <li>And now I am getting other people asking ME how I keep MY makeup so perfect all day long!</li>
            <li>just pure excellence!</li>
            <li>flawless people always ask what i use i hate to say ,to be honest</li>
            <li>The nozzle on the bottle sprays a fine clear mist that dries within a minute or so.</li>
            <li>Great makeup setting spray for someone not looking for a too hard of a hold.</li>
            <li>Simply amazing , your makeup will last longer and feel fresh and natural.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe this spray really works!</li>
            <li>and you get more for the same price.</li>
            <li>it was pretty close...</li>
            <li>With all that said, I am going to give it one more try when I go back to using my Makeup Forever Mattifying Foundation as it MAY be the foundation I was using this with (Classified Era R9)</li>
            <li>I suppose after 8 hours of wear, it did control \\&quot;excess\\&quot; shine, in that my face didn&#x27;t look any shinier than it did when I first applied it.</li>
            <li>Just check, maybe blend your makeup back out a bit, but you&#x27;ll still be mostly intact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells pretty and works wonders</li>
            <li>i like it better than urban decay&#x27;s makeup finisher spray.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works very well!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Sets your makeup with a silky touch, but no fake skin look.</li>
            <li>Some left me feeling like I&#x27;d mistakenly used my hairspray, some were OK, but nothing ever helped with mascara smudges.........</li>
            <li>I think it works pretty well</li>
            <li>I love urban decay setting spray, which is made by skindinavia.</li>
            <li>First time getting the bridal spray.</li>
            <li>and it gets hot</li>
            <li>I ordered this item to help waterproof my makeup on hot and sweaty days.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s obvious that lots of people love this product, but BEWARE</li>
            <li>Really does make my &amp;#34;face&amp;#34; still look fresh at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>I think Urban Decay&#x27;s version has better staying power.</li>
            <li>It was my first time buying it</li>
            <li>and i instantly fell in love with this product.</li>
            <li>, the makeup has stayed on even in humid hot weather</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t express enough how much I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Bought this Skindinavia Bridal Makeup Finish for the first time.</li>
            <li>and when I was ready to drop ... my feet were killing me, but my make-up hadn&#x27;t faded or budged an inch!</li>
            <li>Wish I had ordered a larger size, but love it</li>
            <li>so glad I got this and cheaper than the urban decay one</li>
            <li>So...basically, go with whichever you can get the better deal on because it&#x27;s the EXACT same thing.</li>
            <li>I live on the east coast and it gets super humid here.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Had all day meetings yesterday and at the end of the day, my foundation was still Dewey fresh, eyeshadow and blusher colors were still vibrant as if just</li>
            <li>I simply cannot say enough good things about this</li>
            <li>My skin is oily in the T-zone but not real bad.</li>
            <li>and I live in a very hot and humid climate.</li>
            <li>I would definitely consider using this for all special occasions!</li>
            <li>I have used all of Urban Decay&#x27;s highly rated makeup setting sprays (De-slick, the refresh/hydration one, Stay all day), and this Skindavia &amp;#34;Bridal Finish&amp;#34; one is imo noticeably better.</li>
            <li>For the price that I paid for this, Skindinavia could easily afford to package this item differently</li>
            <li>and I have super sensitive and oily skin.</li>
            <li>Not bad, but not awesome, just ok...maybe great?  </li>
            <li>This product is something I will certainly use with clients.</li>
            <li>The only time I can see this spray coming in handy is if you are going to be outside on a hot day, and you don&#x27;t want your face to resemble a clown in a grease pit by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>It sprays a fine mist and helps your makeup last longer.  </li>
            <li>I must say, that I am a HUGE product (especially makeup) junkie</li>
            <li>But I didn&#x27;t really check.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how it could have been done incorrectly, but it didn&#x27;t seem to make much of a difference.</li>
            <li>I am an islander girl and have very problematic skin living here in the U.S.  </li>
            <li>This did absolutely nothing for me.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>This spray works very well.</li>
            <li>and it works so very well.  </li>
            <li>No irritating scents, no burning of the eyes....</li>
            <li>(and thats a whole &#x27;nother review...</li>
            <li>I have really oily skin and this product kept the shine away through out the day.</li>
            <li>Yeah, the bridal spray seals, but it did absolutely</li>
            <li>it keeps make up in place very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for years and really like the way it works.  </li>
            <li>It was 95 degrees and very humid.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t feel it sets my makeup as much as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li>This really helps my makeup stay put.  </li>
            <li>Fast service.</li>
            <li>However I have to admit it really works.  </li>
            <li>It does help my very oily skin.</li>
            <li>I have VERY oily skin</li>
            <li>I  wore this spray for 7 hours straight</li>
            <li>dont have much proof that is does though</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really keep my makeup</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference to my makeup.  </li>
            <li>It smells better than I expected, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li>I use it on days when it is absolutely IMPERATIVE that my makeup stay in place.</li>
            <li>this product really delivers, I tried it on already twice</li>
            <li>I have always had a real problem with makeup staying put.  </li>
            <li>At the end of the day when I take off my makeup I am amazed at how much comes off on my towelette.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff...does what it says, makes your face wet for a minute or 2</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s makes my make  last longer look more natural.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you don&amp;#34;t spray too close to your face, it tends to leave little clumps and let it fully dry before adding more make up or spray</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m absolutely kicking myself for being such a tightwad, and not going for my tried and true</li>
            <li>I chose the bridal one because i figured it would be that extra strength that i have been looking for, and I was right!</li>
            <li>A long, fabulous day ...</li>
            <li>Would love to buy again but delivery making it not worth it.</li>
            <li>and I was looking to make a better impression than having half my face gone by lunch.</li>
            <li>Bought this as a replacement for my Urban Decay spray (I needed something quick I could get through Prime) and it does the job.  </li>
            <li>Some left me feeling like I&#x27;d mistakenly used my hairspray, some were OK, but nothing ever helped with mascara smudges (absolutely essential for me).........until I tried this.  </li>
            <li>but I do have super oily skin, it definitely adds life to my makeup longevity.</li>
            <li>but this one really is much better, in my opinion, than even its more expensive competitors.</li>
            <li>, bottle is super tiny aswell.</li>
            <li>I want to add that I was worried I might break out from using it, since my skin is very sensitive to anything that clogs the pores, but I&#x27;ve been using it for about two months, now, and I have yet to break out, even despite going to bed a couple of times without washing it off!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>and i am around moisture, high heat, freezing temperatures and lots of movement and</li>
            <li>AND MY FACE CHANGED TO MORE SHINY, LITTLE BIT OILY LOOKING.</li>
            <li>First, i clean, use facial toning, and moistiruzing cream to my face, waited 15 minutes, and i put my foundation and eye concealer and sprayed it, and waited to dry, and then did my eye makeup and blush and my makeup last all day in this hot sweaty weather, i didnt retouch, and everybody is right</li>
            <li>It makes your make up look matte and it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell like some other products.  </li>
            <li>I would go to work looking great and come home looking pail and ill.  </li>
            <li>but no where near as much as if I didn&#x27;t have any setting spray on at all.</li>
            <li>Would be really useful for a wedding that runs the length of the day (especially in the summer)</li>
            <li>I wish there is more product because I used this product everyday.</li>
            <li>I normally have very oily shiny skin and have to blot/powder frequently but with this stuff my makeup stays put</li>
            <li>I have normal skin and use a variety of foundations.</li>
            <li>(  The first call I got on, I looked down at phone face after and sure enough there was makeup residue!!!  </li>
            <li>I noticed the young lady behind the counter at our local pharmacy always looked so beautiful, with makeup almost doll-like and &amp;#34;cat eye&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>For reference, I have oily skin, live in a moderate-high humid environment.  </li>
            <li>Live and learn I guess.</li>
            <li>I live in the Caribbean and have oily skin.</li>
            <li>I live in Arizona and it stays on all day</li>
            <li>where I go to school and live (La Jolla/San Diego).</li>
            <li>Now I can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li>with me having very, very, very oily (i can actually push oil out of the pores of my nose and face..</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, this does not irritate it.</li>
            <li>Wanted to try something new, first attempt was with Urban Decay \\&quot;All-Nighter.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>This is the first and only makeup finishing spray I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even remember I had used it until I came home from an outing to find that my makeup was still exactly as I had applied it earlier that day.&lt;br /&gt;10/10!</li>
            <li>I hav ebeen using Urban Decay&#x27;s All-Nighter setting spray for some time and was willing to try this product.</li>
            <li>eyeliner finishing at the far outer corners with sharp, clean points--even at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>It also seemed to make my already large pores look even larger.</li>
            <li>I spray it when I&#x27;m completely done with my makeup routine, eyes included.</li>
            <li>seriously...do not waste your money with this one....</li>
            <li>, Doesn&#x27;t keep me completely matte</li>
            <li>Also leaves a natural finish and no residue.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin look dewy and natural.</li>
            <li>It is an absolutely must in my daily routine!</li>
            <li>I WAS SO EXITED TO GET THIS PRODUCT, AND NOW I DONT REALLY KNOW HOW TO FEEL.&lt;br /&gt;IT DOES MAKE MY MAKE UP LAST</li>
            <li>Never used this kind of product  before, but I was tired of having to re-apply eyeshadow and blush, so I tried this</li>
            <li>And my daughter commented the other day how fresh my skin looked</li>
            <li>The main ingredient in this setting spray is water not alcohol, so it will not be as sticky as a setting spray such as Ben Nye or Model in a Bottle.</li>
            <li>But just an FYI--this is the exact same thing as those Urban Decay setting sprays.  </li>
            <li>My make up actually came off sooner than normal when I used this.</li>
            <li>Has little to no smell and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>If you have really oily skin consider misting over those really oily spots a few times.</li>
            <li>This is a must not just for brides but for anyone that wants long lasting makeup.</li>
            <li>As far as lasting all day, I don&#x27;t think so.</li>
            <li>Apparently I was sorely mistaken, and that cost me $29.</li>
            <li>Was skeptical when I ordered it, but was pleasantly surprised it really works true to their claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a young person, medium to oily skin, African American descent.</li>
            <li>But as far as I can tell, I think Skindavia actually also formulates the Urban Decay sprays as well -</li>
            <li>Each time I used this though, I would get these raised bumps on my face (the first time I blamed it on an allergic reaction to something else) and the last time I peeled large flakes of very dry skin off my forehead the next few days.  </li>
            <li>It was really hot in GA, after Church I went a few places</li>
            <li>I wore this for a wedding, mid to high 80s and very humid, there was a late afternoon thunderstorm, and</li>
            <li>but with this there was literally no shine as if I had just applied my makeup for 6 hours straight, after that a little shine started to appear</li>
    </ol>

            <li> good product</li>
            <li> The price for this finish spray is a good deal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as good as anything I&#x27;ve tried.....</li>

            <li> However, this is really good if you went &amp;</li>
            <li> Gives good effect.</li>

            <li> I love this spray!</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Model in A Bottle is much better!</li>
            <li> Will repurchase many times!  </li>
            <li> make sure you cover your eyes before spraying...definitely a keeper!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty impressed with the product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite purchases!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> It is amazing.  </li>
            <li> looks amazing at the end of night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Amazing product.</li>
            <li> I saw all the amazing reviews about this product and was thrilled.  </li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, and awesome product!</li>
            <li> The shine that it produces isn&#x27;t that nice dewy, glowing look some people go for.</li>
            <li> It is effective in removing the overly made up</li>
            <li> I did not see difference but feels nice on the skin, also I thought it was suppose to keep the skin matte  </li>
            <li> even gives a nice glow to my complexion , though might ve been a figment of my imagination.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I would recommend it for anyone who wants to keep their make-up looking great!</li>
            <li> but it did the job nicely.</li>
            <li> This product comes out in a very nice fine mist.  </li>
            <li> so very cost effective, i have noticed that if i put more than 3 sprays this product will give a cake look but recommended 2 sprays the finish is excellent.</li>
            <li> Pretty good product  though!</li>
            <li> This is by far, one of the best sprays on the market!</li>
            <li> This honestly keeps your make up so beautifully in place and it really is tear resistant.</li>
            <li> I liked this product better than Model in a Bottle, but still haven&#x27;t found a setting spray that I love.</li>
            <li> It stops my skin from getting really oily during the day, it&#x27;s gives my makeup longevity and gives me a beautiful finish.</li>
            <li> It makes a huge difference!</li>
            <li> If you have oily/ combination skin, the finish may look more oily than dewy.</li>
            <li> Shipment was fast and the product is great</li>
            <li> Makeup stays in place for 8 hours, even more.</li>
            <li> &quot; This spray makes sure it stays put throughout the day.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s THAT precious to me).</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> This formula is wayyy better, idk why, don&#x27;t care why, just glad I found it.  </li>
            <li> and when I awoke in the morning, it was still in place (for the most part) and not on my pillow or sheets.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about about the Bridal Makeup Finish, and with the description listed, I was getting really excited because I thought it would be even better than DANCE!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like...</li>
            <li> More Shine\\&quot; version of this.</li>
            <li> Wish I would have known that before I purchased it, as most of the 5 star reviews say it didn&#x27;t make the users shiny.</li>
            <li> No need to apply more powder and run the risk of looking like</li>
            <li> When I sweat, most of my make up stays put even with dabbing the sweat.</li>
            <li> More Shine is WAY better.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wedding day, and I am so glad</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this finishing spray.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to do a skin test to be sure, but I&#x27;m under the impression that this stuff is making my top layer of skin peel off.</li>
            <li> AND I had both sides of my face all over that thing trying to get comfortable!</li>
            <li> I love it and so does my daughter who tried it and promptly &amp;#34;borrowed&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> and it worked much better than the e.l.f. brand I tried from Target.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure for the price there are easier ways to set makeup, but I prefer to spray and</li>
            <li> I love the item-</li>
            <li> Great seller, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> For 29 bucks I was expecting something a lot better.  </li>
            <li> My favorite makeup holding spray.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> I will try ONE more thing.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> This made my face look wrinkly and I felt it showed off my pores more</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s gotta be something better out there</li>
            <li> 16 seconds is more like it:</li>
            <li> and I have begun using Skindinivia much more than it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> The bridal spray is my favorite of the two.</li>
            <li> Love this idea and will purchase again.  </li>
            <li> Make up looks lovely on pictures.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE it</li>
            <li> &quot; at the top.  </li>
            <li> This finishing spray is exactly what I needed!!!  </li>
            <li> held my makeup consistently for about a good 4-5 hours, and after about 6-7 hours</li>
            <li> It gives me a flawless look after I apply my makeup and lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> Love the easy spray - no scent that I&#x27;ve noticed..</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m glad Amazon makes it so easy to return something.</li>
            <li> Decided, to give \\&quot;skindnavia\\&quot; the company one more try &amp; was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Your makeup stays put and looks amazing and it REALLY helps with oily skin too :)</li>
            <li> I break out easily and have oily skin</li>
            <li> I tend to break out easily from products and I have oily skin.</li>
            <li> Helps set makeup reliably, easy on skin.</li>
            <li> Not so easy when your my age.  </li>
            <li> Not so easy when you&#x27;re my age.  </li>
            <li> This spray smells strong</li>
            <li> Hands down the BEST makeup setter out there is MODEL IN A BOTTLE.  </li>
            <li> Five stars isn&#x27;t enough stars to express how wonderful this product is!!!!,,,, this really sets ur makeup all day!</li>
            <li> This is a great product, extremely happy, does exactly what it is suppose to do, only reason I gave it 4 star was the price of delivery to Australia  cost as much as the product .</li>
            <li> and after it dries, I finish with a light dust of powder.  </li>
            <li> and it was fabulous.</li>
            <li> I might as well just have sprayed my face with a light misting of hairspray like we did in the matte-infested 90&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but most of the day a fresh look.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been cheap about makeup</li>
            <li> I really can recommend this product enough, just beautiful!</li>
            <li> AFTER I FINISH MY MAKE UP, AND IT SEEN TO MAKE MY FACE MORE SHINY RIGHT WAY.  </li>
            <li> If you do not want a sheen to your finish, go with the original formula.</li>
            <li> so I have nothing to compare it to, but I&#x27;m pretty confident it beats the competition.</li>
            <li> Makeup stays fresh all day!</li>
            <li> It keeps my makeup on, even on the most hot and humid of days.</li>
            <li> It performs great in dry and humid climates.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even count how many setting sprays I&#x27;ve tried and this is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Been using this product for several weeks now and so far I am not overly impressed.  </li>
            <li> My makeup artist saw it on the day of the wedding and was super excited because she loves this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I use 3-4 sprays per day, and have been using it for over month, with the bottle still 4/5 full.</li>
            <li> or Cool (</li>
            <li> which I haven&#x27;t tried Cool</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t rub off :) I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I wear make up forever face and body foundation and their full coverage concealer.</li>
            <li> Your make up will hold for at least 8 hours and will still look practically flawless.</li>
            <li> My skin type is more on the oily side, so getting my makeup to stay put has always been an ongoing process until I discovered Skindinavia Bridal Makeup Finish, thanks to Goss Makeup Artist on YouTube.  </li>
            <li> I love it so much, I give it as gifts.</li>
            <li> As much as I wanted to love this product, it did nothing for me at all.  </li>
            <li> if there&#x27;s a product out there that helps keep my makeup on and still looking good 6 hours later</li>
            <li> if there&#x27;s a product out there that helps keep my makeup on and still looking good 6 hours later</li>
            <li> I liked it so far.</li>
            <li> I have used similar high end makeup finish products, but this is absolutely THE BEST!  </li>
            <li> But, most definitely, it lasts more than 5 hours on my skin.</li>
            <li> pleased and would recommend to anyone who wants to stay looking fresh all day.</li>
            <li> Spray a quick X and ....</li>
            <li> Spray a quick X and ....</li>
            <li> Love this spray...definitely coming back for more...</li>
            <li> I get a very nice finish with my makeup and it really does help my foundation last all day.  </li>
            <li> For everyday use with a primer and a light dusting of rice powder on my t-zone to control shine, it works wells to keep my makeup from melting off in warm weather, noticeably better than with just primer and rice powder alone.</li>
            <li> and I was still able to sweat it off just by normal behavior.</li>
            <li> With this I still look good at the end of a long day of work.  </li>
            <li> This is easy to use and dries really fast.  </li>
            <li> and this one for some reason just has that extra staying power for me even over Urban Decay&#x27;s long-lasting one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would rate myself as having fairly oily (but not the oiliest) skin, and I can easily go 8 hours without touching up and look pretty close to how I was the moment I walked out the door in the morning.</li>
            <li> Overall, it was OK, I guess!</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve over-powdered your face, or want your makeup to look more natural, this will do it!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, so there might be a chance that this would look ok on women with dry skin, but I kind of doubt it.</li>
            <li> Whereas it is completely moisturized in the islands, I now have combo oily skin, more on the oily side.  </li>
            <li> This finishing spray keeps my makeup looking fresh from morning</li>
            <li> I rarely leave the house without eyeliner, so I&#x27;m always worried about \\&quot;raccoon eyes.\\</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it two days so far, and I&#x27;m quite pleased with it.</li>
            <li> You get a much better price buying it direct from Skindinavia.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but TOTALLY worth it.</li>
            <li> My makeup looks fresh and survives humidity, my oily skin  and sweat thus my 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 100% worth it, I use it instead of setting powder (though women who have even oilier skin than I do may benefit from using both if they wish).</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s nice, I don&#x27;t believe this setting spray has the lasting power as UD&#x27;s All-Nighter.</li>
            <li> I feel like it sets my makeup nicely, helps it last throughout the day-</li>
            <li> It seems that my makeup stays in place better, but my face still gets a frequent shine.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time last week and it turned out pretty good.</li>
            <li> The finish is very clean and natural looking instead of shiny.</li>
            <li> it right out to her car.</li>
            <li> RIGHT</li>
            <li> And now I am getting other people asking ME how I keep MY makeup so perfect all day long!</li>
            <li> just pure excellence!</li>
            <li> flawless people always ask what i use i hate to say ,to be honest</li>
            <li> The nozzle on the bottle sprays a fine clear mist that dries within a minute or so.</li>
            <li> Great makeup setting spray for someone not looking for a too hard of a hold.</li>
            <li> Simply amazing , your makeup will last longer and feel fresh and natural.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this spray really works!</li>
            <li> and you get more for the same price.</li>
            <li> it was pretty close...</li>
            <li> With all that said, I am going to give it one more try when I go back to using my Makeup Forever Mattifying Foundation as it MAY be the foundation I was using this with (Classified Era R9)</li>
            <li> I suppose after 8 hours of wear, it did control \\&quot;excess\\&quot; shine, in that my face didn&#x27;t look any shinier than it did when I first applied it.</li>
            <li> Just check, maybe blend your makeup back out a bit, but you&#x27;ll still be mostly intact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells pretty and works wonders</li>
            <li> i like it better than urban decay&#x27;s makeup finisher spray.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works very well!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Sets your makeup with a silky touch, but no fake skin look.</li>
            <li> Some left me feeling like I&#x27;d mistakenly used my hairspray, some were OK, but nothing ever helped with mascara smudges.........</li>
            <li> I think it works pretty well</li>
            <li> I love urban decay setting spray, which is made by skindinavia.</li>
            <li> First time getting the bridal spray.</li>
            <li> and it gets hot</li>
            <li> I ordered this item to help waterproof my makeup on hot and sweaty days.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s obvious that lots of people love this product, but BEWARE</li>
            <li> Really does make my &amp;#34;face&amp;#34; still look fresh at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I think Urban Decay&#x27;s version has better staying power.</li>
            <li> It was my first time buying it</li>
            <li> and i instantly fell in love with this product.</li>
            <li> , the makeup has stayed on even in humid hot weather</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t express enough how much I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Bought this Skindinavia Bridal Makeup Finish for the first time.</li>
            <li> and when I was ready to drop ... my feet were killing me, but my make-up hadn&#x27;t faded or budged an inch!</li>
            <li> Wish I had ordered a larger size, but love it</li>
            <li> so glad I got this and cheaper than the urban decay one</li>
            <li> So...basically, go with whichever you can get the better deal on because it&#x27;s the EXACT same thing.</li>
            <li> I live on the east coast and it gets super humid here.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Had all day meetings yesterday and at the end of the day, my foundation was still Dewey fresh, eyeshadow and blusher colors were still vibrant as if just</li>
            <li> I simply cannot say enough good things about this</li>
            <li> My skin is oily in the T-zone but not real bad.</li>
            <li> and I live in a very hot and humid climate.</li>
            <li> I would definitely consider using this for all special occasions!</li>
            <li> I have used all of Urban Decay&#x27;s highly rated makeup setting sprays (De-slick, the refresh/hydration one, Stay all day), and this Skindavia &amp;#34;Bridal Finish&amp;#34; one is imo noticeably better.</li>
            <li> For the price that I paid for this, Skindinavia could easily afford to package this item differently</li>
            <li> and I have super sensitive and oily skin.</li>
            <li> Not bad, but not awesome, just ok...maybe great?  </li>
            <li> This product is something I will certainly use with clients.</li>
            <li> The only time I can see this spray coming in handy is if you are going to be outside on a hot day, and you don&#x27;t want your face to resemble a clown in a grease pit by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> It sprays a fine mist and helps your makeup last longer.  </li>
            <li> I must say, that I am a HUGE product (especially makeup) junkie</li>
            <li> But I didn&#x27;t really check.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it could have been done incorrectly, but it didn&#x27;t seem to make much of a difference.</li>
            <li> I am an islander girl and have very problematic skin living here in the U.S.  </li>
            <li> This did absolutely nothing for me.  </li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> This spray works very well.</li>
            <li> and it works so very well.  </li>
            <li> No irritating scents, no burning of the eyes....</li>
            <li> (and thats a whole &#x27;nother review...</li>
            <li> I have really oily skin and this product kept the shine away through out the day.</li>
            <li> Yeah, the bridal spray seals, but it did absolutely</li>
            <li> it keeps make up in place very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and really like the way it works.  </li>
            <li> It was 95 degrees and very humid.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t feel it sets my makeup as much as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> This really helps my makeup stay put.  </li>
            <li> Fast service.</li>
            <li> However I have to admit it really works.  </li>
            <li> It does help my very oily skin.</li>
            <li> I have VERY oily skin</li>
            <li> I  wore this spray for 7 hours straight</li>
            <li> dont have much proof that is does though</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really keep my makeup</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference to my makeup.  </li>
            <li> It smells better than I expected, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> I use it on days when it is absolutely IMPERATIVE that my makeup stay in place.</li>
            <li> this product really delivers, I tried it on already twice</li>
            <li> I have always had a real problem with makeup staying put.  </li>
            <li> At the end of the day when I take off my makeup I am amazed at how much comes off on my towelette.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff...does what it says, makes your face wet for a minute or 2</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s makes my make  last longer look more natural.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you don&amp;#34;t spray too close to your face, it tends to leave little clumps and let it fully dry before adding more make up or spray</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m absolutely kicking myself for being such a tightwad, and not going for my tried and true</li>
            <li> I chose the bridal one because i figured it would be that extra strength that i have been looking for, and I was right!</li>
            <li> A long, fabulous day ...</li>
            <li> Would love to buy again but delivery making it not worth it.</li>
            <li> and I was looking to make a better impression than having half my face gone by lunch.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a replacement for my Urban Decay spray (I needed something quick I could get through Prime) and it does the job.  </li>
            <li> Some left me feeling like I&#x27;d mistakenly used my hairspray, some were OK, but nothing ever helped with mascara smudges (absolutely essential for me).........until I tried this.  </li>
            <li> but I do have super oily skin, it definitely adds life to my makeup longevity.</li>
            <li> but this one really is much better, in my opinion, than even its more expensive competitors.</li>
            <li> , bottle is super tiny aswell.</li>
            <li> I want to add that I was worried I might break out from using it, since my skin is very sensitive to anything that clogs the pores, but I&#x27;ve been using it for about two months, now, and I have yet to break out, even despite going to bed a couple of times without washing it off!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> and i am around moisture, high heat, freezing temperatures and lots of movement and</li>
            <li> AND MY FACE CHANGED TO MORE SHINY, LITTLE BIT OILY LOOKING.</li>
            <li> First, i clean, use facial toning, and moistiruzing cream to my face, waited 15 minutes, and i put my foundation and eye concealer and sprayed it, and waited to dry, and then did my eye makeup and blush and my makeup last all day in this hot sweaty weather, i didnt retouch, and everybody is right</li>
            <li> It makes your make up look matte and it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell like some other products.  </li>
            <li> I would go to work looking great and come home looking pail and ill.  </li>
            <li> but no where near as much as if I didn&#x27;t have any setting spray on at all.</li>
            <li> Would be really useful for a wedding that runs the length of the day (especially in the summer)</li>
            <li> I wish there is more product because I used this product everyday.</li>
            <li> I normally have very oily shiny skin and have to blot/powder frequently but with this stuff my makeup stays put</li>
            <li> I have normal skin and use a variety of foundations.</li>
            <li> (  The first call I got on, I looked down at phone face after and sure enough there was makeup residue!!!  </li>
            <li> I noticed the young lady behind the counter at our local pharmacy always looked so beautiful, with makeup almost doll-like and &amp;#34;cat eye&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> For reference, I have oily skin, live in a moderate-high humid environment.  </li>
            <li> Live and learn I guess.</li>
            <li> I live in the Caribbean and have oily skin.</li>
            <li> I live in Arizona and it stays on all day</li>
            <li> where I go to school and live (La Jolla/San Diego).</li>
            <li> Now I can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li> with me having very, very, very oily (i can actually push oil out of the pores of my nose and face..</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, this does not irritate it.</li>
            <li> Wanted to try something new, first attempt was with Urban Decay \\&quot;All-Nighter.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> This is the first and only makeup finishing spray I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even remember I had used it until I came home from an outing to find that my makeup was still exactly as I had applied it earlier that day.&lt;br /&gt;10/10!</li>
            <li> I hav ebeen using Urban Decay&#x27;s All-Nighter setting spray for some time and was willing to try this product.</li>
            <li> eyeliner finishing at the far outer corners with sharp, clean points--even at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> It also seemed to make my already large pores look even larger.</li>
            <li> I spray it when I&#x27;m completely done with my makeup routine, eyes included.</li>
            <li> seriously...do not waste your money with this one....</li>
            <li> , Doesn&#x27;t keep me completely matte</li>
            <li> Also leaves a natural finish and no residue.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin look dewy and natural.</li>
            <li> It is an absolutely must in my daily routine!</li>
            <li> I WAS SO EXITED TO GET THIS PRODUCT, AND NOW I DONT REALLY KNOW HOW TO FEEL.&lt;br /&gt;IT DOES MAKE MY MAKE UP LAST</li>
            <li> Never used this kind of product  before, but I was tired of having to re-apply eyeshadow and blush, so I tried this</li>
            <li> And my daughter commented the other day how fresh my skin looked</li>
            <li> The main ingredient in this setting spray is water not alcohol, so it will not be as sticky as a setting spray such as Ben Nye or Model in a Bottle.</li>
            <li> But just an FYI--this is the exact same thing as those Urban Decay setting sprays.  </li>
            <li> My make up actually came off sooner than normal when I used this.</li>
            <li> Has little to no smell and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> If you have really oily skin consider misting over those really oily spots a few times.</li>
            <li> This is a must not just for brides but for anyone that wants long lasting makeup.</li>
            <li> As far as lasting all day, I don&#x27;t think so.</li>
            <li> Apparently I was sorely mistaken, and that cost me $29.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical when I ordered it, but was pleasantly surprised it really works true to their claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a young person, medium to oily skin, African American descent.</li>
            <li> But as far as I can tell, I think Skindavia actually also formulates the Urban Decay sprays as well -</li>
            <li> Each time I used this though, I would get these raised bumps on my face (the first time I blamed it on an allergic reaction to something else) and the last time I peeled large flakes of very dry skin off my forehead the next few days.  </li>
            <li> It was really hot in GA, after Church I went a few places</li>
            <li> I wore this for a wedding, mid to high 80s and very humid, there was a late afternoon thunderstorm, and</li>
            <li> but with this there was literally no shine as if I had just applied my makeup for 6 hours straight, after that a little shine started to appear</li>
            <li> It also hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts or other irritations on my sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it does keep it better than without the spray, but it doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as the eye makeup!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used Skindinavia&#x27;s No More Shine spray, but that only controlled my oils very minimally.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I usually have a really oily t-zone,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is the real product that is being sold here because it did nothing to prevent my oily skin.  </li>
            <li> There was just as much make up on the phone as usual (and I don&#x27;t wear a ton of makeup).  </li>
            <li> Long lasting product!</li>
            <li> I decided to put on powder and sprayed my face before and a little after ( keeping the spray as far as possible after powder application).</li>
            <li> Have used Urban Decay All Nighter spray and expected this to be similar.</li>
            <li> It just had 0 impact, positive or negative.</li>
            <li> It definitely tops all other makeup sprays especially the ones in Sephora!</li>
            <li> Have yet to find anything that truly lasts as long as  the product claims.</li>
            <li> Gives a polished finish to my makeup and holds everything in place all day long.  </li>
            <li> i had a 4ounce bottle for that long</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I was running all day long from morning until 2 AM.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that it doesn&#x27;t keep the make up on any longer than other sprays.</li>
            <li> so i don&#x27;t like to use any powder at all as it makes my skin look cakey and shows any patchy dry spots i may have.  </li>
            <li> My skin is dry</li>
            <li> My face is oily, and sometimes rushing for work, I forget to put my loose powder on, and even without retouching with a pressed powder, my face is not too shiny.</li>
            <li> It makes my makeup last from sun up to sun down.</li>
            <li> I tend to get shiny throughout the day and this product definitely makes me less so.  </li>
            <li> i have very dry skin</li>
            <li> - just give yourself a spritz to matte things back up if you notice yourself getting a little</li>
            <li> you only need a little my makeup stays</li>
            <li> However, for my wedding, I needed a little extra staying power I thought, so I got this.  </li>
            <li> I just flushed $25 down the toilet on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I sometimes get if i&#x27;m heavy handed with my foundation, but it does nothing to help my makeup last longer or keep the oil at bay even if I stay indoors with the air condition on all day.</li>
            <li> I wanted my makeup to last longer in to the day, now that it&#x27;s almost 100 degrees everyday</li>
            <li> It actually made my make up look blotchy and the finish uneven after applying it.</li>
            <li> My face didn&#x27;t look wet</li>
            <li> That is one reason why I switched to Bare Minerals (if you haven&#x27;t used that brand, you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re missing!).  </li>
            <li> I do notice that my foundation stays in place longer using this, but I&#x27;m not sure it would last an entire wedding evening of crying, dancing, sweating, etc.</li>
            <li> I usually have to blot the oil on my face 3x a day but with this product, I only have to do that once.  </li>
            <li> After reading some other reviews, it seems as though I need to try the \\&quot;No</li>
            <li> I use powder foundations and setting powder due to oily skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like any other spray in that respect because as my skin gets oily throughout the day, the make up starts to come off at the end of the day just like with other brands.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, I read the other reviews, and I&#x27;m wondering if the people who said it didn&#x27;t work remembered to spray it on BEFORE and after putting on their makeup?</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m not sure it would last 16 hours, as I have oily skin</li>
            <li> I use my sunscreen, then spritz this on my face and apply foundation a little loose powder.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s incredibly hard to make my makeup last all day.</li>
            <li> it works as advertised and is better than any base primer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I have tried other sprays that did nothing and made my skin feel tight.</li>
            <li> When I go a little overboard with powder (summer time equals extra powder) or when I want to look fresh even though I have put enough makeup on to look like a idiot</li>
            <li> I have combination skin that typically gets oily by night time.</li>
            <li> I spend half of my day attached to a phone</li>
            <li> I add half of this bottle to a 3oz travel bottle for on the go use.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is once its on there is no fixing any errors afterwards because everything is so stiff.</li>
            <li> With this brand, my face doesn&#x27;t feel tight after it dries-</li>
            <li> , when I get home from work and just need a little shine reducing touch-up, this stuff works wonders.  </li>
            <li> I stay mat a little longer.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday..</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t wear heavy makeup (even for my wedding), so maybe it just wasn&#x27;t noticeable what the spray was doing.  </li>
            <li> and then I won&#x27;t use it just because I don&#x27;t want to waste it</li>
            <li> and my make up always runs after a few hours no matter what I used.</li>
            <li> Waste of money in all honesty.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and haven&#x27;t had any problems.</li>
            <li> heavy lifting a lot.</li>
            <li> ,I keep checking in the mirror at work thinking I will getting the usual greasy mess and shining around my nose and forehead, and nothing but a little on my nose.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this product, even when all the reviews I read had positive remark.  </li>
            <li> is in contrast with my previous experience when makeup became dull &amp; worn out by the end of a hectic day.</li>
            <li> That means that very little has worn off during the day.  </li>
            <li> but this site is so convenient for me as i shop for other goodies!!!</li>
            <li> and I live in the deep south where the summers are brutal and the chance of ruining your makeup is 100%.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually apply before and after I finish my makeup and also too when I go out</li>
            <li> No More Shine oil control Spray for years, but</li>
            <li> I can usually go about 4 hours before my nose gets shiny, so I think its working well.</li>
            <li> Its unbelievable.</li>
            <li> Now don&#x27;t get me wrong, I do notice a difference using the Urban Decay ones vs. not using them.</li>
            <li> and the result has been unbelievable</li>
            <li> Does not seem to really lengthen my makeup wearing time :(</li>
            <li> I try hard to have my makeup look finished, but not overdone.  </li>
            <li> I try hard to have my makeup look finished, but not overdone.  </li>
            <li> No More Shine version!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m probably gonna try something else only because it&#x27;s very expensive.</li>
            <li> Its a little expensive</li>
            <li> finish also seems to hold up reasonably well to blowing your nose occasionally, as I recently had a terrible summer cold.  </li>
            <li> Not good for oil control though</li>
            <li> I am actually slightly addicted to it.  </li>
            <li> Very subtle scent.</li>
            <li> But alas, this review is not about Dance!</li>
            <li> but sadly it didn&#x27;t do that for me.</li>
            <li> I feel sorry for all those shiny brides.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but this stuff works.</li>
            <li> I was unable to make it in to ULTA to get another one</li>
            <li> Not perfect, but nothing ever is.</li>
            <li> , what was my secret!  </li>
            <li> And if you have an oily acne prone skin you know how bad that can get!</li>
            <li> By it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use this everyday.. Love the easy spray - no scent that I&#x27;ve noticed.. My makeup stays put! ❤️❤️❤️</li>
            <li> But I didn&#x27;t really check.  I used this for my wedding and the days leading up to it, as trial sessions, but maybe I used it incorrectly.  I don&#x27;t know how it could have been done incorrectly, but it didn&#x27;t seem to make much of a difference. I also don&#x27;t wear heavy makeup (even for my wedding), so maybe it just wasn&#x27;t noticeable what the spray was doing.  Overall, it was OK, I guess!</li>
            <li> I had to buy this when I realized that it is the same product that companies like urban decay uses.  BUT it is a lot cheaper!  I am an islander girl and have very problematic skin living here in the U.S.  Whereas it is completely moisturized in the islands, I now have combo oily skin, more on the oily side.  I spray this on each quadrant of my face after I apply my eye make up and foundation (but before masacara) and after it dries, I finish with a light dust of powder.  I usually have to blot the oil on my face 3x a day but with this product, I only have to do that once.  Best of all, my make-up stays on for about 10 hours.</li>
            <li> I wore this for a wedding, mid to high 80s and very humid, there was a late afternoon thunderstorm, and my makeup held through it all!! It did not cause any breakouts, like model in a bottle. If you have oily/ combination skin, the finish may look more oily than dewy. You can touch up the troublesome spots with powder. If you do not want a sheen to your finish, go with the original formula. Your make-up will last all day, without any shine.</li>
            <li> Shipment was fast and the product is great makes my makeup stay on for longer than if i would set it with the spray</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this spray really works! I sprayed it maybe 5-6 times and I usually have a really oily t-zone, but with this there was literally no shine as if I had just applied my makeup for 6 hours straight, after that a little shine started to appear but my makeup had not budged at all and I live in a very hot and humid climate. I would recommend this to everyone! Your makeup stays put and looks amazing and it REALLY helps with oily skin too :)</li>
            <li> Perfect for oily and combination skins</li>
            <li> This did absolutely nothing for me.  I have very oily skin and this did nothing to keep my makeup in place or keep me from getting shiny quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, the condition that I received this product in was sub par.  It arrived in a ziplock baggy!  The seller could have very easily dumped out the good contents and sent me something else.  ALL liquid products should have a seal.  For the price that I paid for this, Skindinavia could easily afford to package this item differently so potential buyers would not be ripped off. This is only a suspicion of mine.</li>
            <li> This spray works very well. It definitely tops all other makeup sprays especially the ones in Sephora! This is by far, one of the best sprays on the market! I would definitely consider using this for all special occasions!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  It is amazing.  I tried it out before the wedding and used it the night of my rehearsal dinner and it was fabulous. I break out easily and have oily skin but I had no problems!  My makeup artist saw it on the day of the wedding and was super excited because she loves this stuff.  She used it on me on the day of.  So yes I recommend this and it works so very well.  I am actually slightly addicted to it.  By it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!  Also the seller was wonderful and it arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is once its on there is no fixing any errors afterwards because everything is so stiff.</li>
            <li> Leave my face shiney but overall it does the job</li>
            <li> I used to use de-slick from Urban Decay, and this works just as well and you get more for the same price. I love this spray! My face is oily, and sometimes rushing for work, I forget to put my loose powder on, and even without retouching with a pressed powder, my face is not too shiny. Makeup stays in place for 8 hours, even more.</li>
            <li> ive been using this bottle from dec 2014 twice a day 3x a week and i am astonished that feb is almost over and it has alot of product in the bottle so very cost effective, i have noticed that if i put more than 3 sprays this product will give a cake look but recommended 2 sprays the finish is excellent. good product</li>
            <li> Best makeup setting spray on the market!! I am a makeup artist and this stuff is absolutely amazing! No irritating scents, no burning of the eyes.... just pure excellence! Love this stuff!!!! I have tried urban decay... model in a bottle... nyx... etc. This is my number 1</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I have combination skin that typically gets oily by night time. This finishing spray keeps my makeup looking fresh from morning all the way into the wee hours of the night! I rarely leave the house without eyeliner, so I&#x27;m always worried about \\&quot;raccoon eyes.\\&quot; This spray makes sure it stays put throughout the day. I&#x27;ve been using the Bridal Makeup Finish for over a month now, and every now and then I won&#x27;t use it just because I don&#x27;t want to waste it (it&#x27;s THAT precious to me). The days I don&#x27;t use the Bridal Makeup Finish, the oils in my face shine through my foundation and make me look almost sweaty. It makes a huge difference! I&#x27;ve also used Skindinavia&#x27;s No More Shine spray, but that only controlled my oils very minimally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions on the bottle say to spray it after you put on your foundation, but before your eye makeup. I spray it when I&#x27;m completely done with my makeup routine, eyes included. The nozzle on the bottle sprays a fine clear mist that dries within a minute or so. It&#x27;s become a staple to my makeup routine! I use 3-4 sprays per day, and have been using it for over month, with the bottle still 4/5 full.</li>
            <li> I liked this product better than Model in a Bottle, but still haven&#x27;t found a setting spray that I love.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently using this spray for about a month now, and it does keep the oil at bay. But it&#x27;s not HG status for me. When I finish this bottle I&#x27;m probably gonna try something else only because it&#x27;s very expensive. Pretty good product  though!</li>
            <li> Love this. I had been using the Urban decay all nighter and I was happy with the results UNTIL I tried this it&#x27;s makes my make  last longer look more natural. Definitely purchasing again</li>
            <li> Wanted to try something new, first attempt was with Urban Decay \\&quot;All-Nighter.\\&quot;  Not bad, but not awesome, just ok...maybe great?  Goggled setting sprays &amp;  skindinavia products popped up, along with products that they made (UD setting spray).  Watched reviews by nguerrio19 &amp; gossmakeupartist, the reviews were informative.  Decided, to give \\&quot;skindnavia\\&quot; the company one more try &amp; was not disappointed. This formula is wayyy better, idk why, don&#x27;t care why, just glad I found it.  For reference, I have oily skin, live in a moderate-high humid environment.  Not saying this stuff is going to make your make-up all day/night.  But it will help it last for 8-9 hrs; which is all I need.  There is a matte version, but I don&#x27;t like being matte.  I like for my skin to have a semi matte/satin finish.</li>
            <li> When I go a little overboard with powder (summer time equals extra powder) or when I want to look fresh even though I have put enough makeup on to look like a idiot - I use this and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I wanted this one but received the 10 years younger the sku sticker said bridal but the bottle said 10 years younger</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, and awesome product!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wedding and decided to give it a test run before. I&#x27;ve used it two days so far, and I&#x27;m quite pleased with it. My eye make up stays perfect from the time I put it on in the morning until the time I go to bed. Eyeliner, mascara, and eyeshadow stay perfect! I don&#x27;t think this works as well on foundation as I thought it would, though. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it does keep it better than without the spray, but it doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as the eye makeup! I&#x27;ll probably continue using this product on a daily basis!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a while now, I tend to use this when I am going out to a function or going somewhere all day. I can count that this finish spray makes my makeup stay flawless. As far as lasting all day, I don&#x27;t think so. But, most definitely, it lasts more than 5 hours on my skin. I tend to break out easily from products and I have oily skin. But, this doesn&#x27;t break me out or cause irritations. The price for this finish spray is a good deal. I used to purchase the Urban Decay All nighter spray at Ulta but it was starting to get too pricey. I will continue to repurchase this item on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I must say, that I am a HUGE product (especially makeup) junkie and I could not WAIT to get this!!!! I previoiusly used Skindinavia Dance!!!! and I loved it!!!! While it wasn&#x27;t a HG of makeup finishes...it was pretty close...with me having very, very, very oily (i can actually push oil out of the pores of my nose and face..yuck!) acne prone skin, Dance! held my makeup consistently for about a good 4-5 hours, and after about 6-7 hours some \\&quot;sliding\\&quot; would occur, but there were times where I would fall asleep in my makeup and when I awoke in the morning, it was still in place (for the most part) and not on my pillow or sheets. But alas, this review is not about Dance! It&#x27;s about about the Bridal Makeup Finish, and with the description listed, I was getting really excited because I thought it would be even better than DANCE! But that is not be....seriously...do not waste your money with this one....stick to either Dance! or Cool (which I haven&#x27;t tried Cool but its description is very similar to Dance!).  With all that said, I am going to give it one more try when I go back to using my Makeup Forever Mattifying Foundation as it MAY be the foundation I was using this with (Classified Era R9) (and thats a whole &#x27;nother review...LOL)....but ironically, I found that the Classified Era foundation makeup lasted LONGER when I didn&#x27;t spray this on...so I will provide an update...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried this product but I&#x27;ve seen great reviews on this setting spray so we will see!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This spray instantly made my face look like plastic. Even though it says it controls excess shine, it 100% has a shine to it immediately after you apply it. I guess the key word there is \\&quot;excess.\\&quot; I suppose after 8 hours of wear, it did control \\&quot;excess\\&quot; shine, in that my face didn&#x27;t look any shinier than it did when I first applied it. It also seemed to make my already large pores look even larger. I have very oily skin, so there might be a chance that this would look ok on women with dry skin, but I kind of doubt it. The shine that it produces isn&#x27;t that nice dewy, glowing look some people go for. It&#x27;s more like... well, plastic is the best way I can describe it. The only time I can see this spray coming in handy is if you are going to be outside on a hot day, and you don&#x27;t want your face to resemble a clown in a grease pit by the end of the day. After reading some other reviews, it seems as though I need to try the \\&quot;No More Shine\\&quot; version of this. Wish I would have known that before I purchased it, as most of the 5 star reviews say it didn&#x27;t make the users shiny. I don&#x27;t understand how they can label this a bridal makeup finish. I was under the impression that you don&#x27;t want a shiny finish for pictures, especially bridal ones. Apparently I was sorely mistaken, and that cost me $29. Live and learn I guess.</li>
            <li> I live in the Caribbean and have oily skin. I saw great reviews for this product and I don&#x27;t doubt that it works well on others, it just was not for me. It is effective in removing the overly made up look I sometimes get if i&#x27;m heavy handed with my foundation, but it does nothing to help my makeup last longer or keep the oil at bay even if I stay indoors with the air condition on all day. It didn&#x27;t hurt to try it however since it didn&#x27;t irritate or break me out. It just had 0 impact, positive or negative.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I live in Arizona and it stays on all day I usually apply before and after I finish my makeup and also too when I go out it doesn&#x27;t rub off :) I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d actually gotten this initially just to set my makeup for a costume, but I figured &amp;#34;meh, why not?&amp;#34; this summer when the heat and humidity had my makeup looking like it was melting.  Since I started wearing this over my makeup, I haven&#x27;t had that issue come up at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, when I get home from work and just need a little shine reducing touch-up, this stuff works wonders.  No need to apply more powder and run the risk of looking like my makeup&#x27;s been caked on.  Would be really useful for a wedding that runs the length of the day (especially in the summer) - just give yourself a spritz to matte things back up if you notice yourself getting a little shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The finish also seems to hold up reasonably well to blowing your nose occasionally, as I recently had a terrible summer cold.  Yes, if you&#x27;re blowing your nose several times an hour your makeup WILL come off.  But maybe once or twice through the day?  Just check, maybe blend your makeup back out a bit, but you&#x27;ll still be mostly intact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth it!</li>
            <li> Read some wonderful reviews about this but it didn&#x27;t work for me. I wear make up forever face and body foundation and their full coverage concealer. I wanted my makeup to last longer in to the day, now that it&#x27;s almost 100 degrees everyday but sadly it didn&#x27;t do that for me. It actually made my make up look blotchy and the finish uneven after applying it. I have combination skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my opinion it is the best one out there! It literally holds the oils from my t-zone at bay. And if you have an oily acne prone skin you know how bad that can get! Your make up will hold for at least 8 hours and will still look practically flawless. This is a must not just for brides but for anyone that wants long lasting makeup.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff!! I would go to work looking great and come home looking pail and ill.  With this I still look good at the end of a long day of work.  I rub my face all the time and it still holds up.  When I sweat, most of my make up stays put even with dabbing the sweat. I apply it after I am done with everything.</li>
            <li> Smells pretty and works wonders</li>
            <li> I have really oily skin and this product kept the shine away through out the day. I am also a MUA and always looking for products for my clients. This product is something I will certainly use with clients. It creates a semi-matte look but skin still looks like skin which is so important to me as I am always striving for a natural finish with my clients, no looking fake or way to made up. I wore this to a wedding and danced the night away with no touch-ups and my skin and makeup looks amazing at the end of night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice that using this product with a few sweeps in the T-zone vs. just one spray really helped my skin. If you have really oily skin consider misting over those really oily spots a few times.</li>
            <li> Overpriced!! Model in A Bottle is much better!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Skindinavia No More Shine oil control Spray for years, but happened upon the Bridal version at a lower price, so I decided to try it. For me, no comparison- No More Shine is WAY better. Yeah, the bridal spray seals, but it did absolutely *nothing* for shine control. I might as well just have sprayed my face with a light misting of hairspray like we did in the matte-infested 90&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m absolutely kicking myself for being such a tightwad, and not going for my tried and true No More Shine version! I just flushed $25 down the toilet on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I feel sorry for all those shiny brides.</li>
            <li> Long lasting product! I wish there is more product because I used this product everyday. I will definitely repurchase this product once I am done with my bottle.</li>
            <li> This is the company that makes the same product sold by Urban Decay. You get a much better price buying it direct from Skindinavia.</li>
            <li> it keeps make up in place very well. It performs great in dry and humid climates.</li>
            <li> Arrived as promised, packed well without any damage or leakage. It works as advertised without any odor, stickiness or tightness.The only issue I have had is that my skin feels grainy after a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> I did not see difference but feels nice on the skin, also I thought it was suppose to keep the skin matte  it did not</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  I have worked out, sweated and the makeup stays!  Very nice!!</li>
            <li> Was skeptical when I ordered it, but was pleasantly surprised it really works true to their claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had all day meetings yesterday and at the end of the day, my foundation was still Dewey fresh, eyeshadow and blusher colors were still vibrant as if just applied.&lt;br /&gt;It even gives a nice glow to my complexion , though might ve been a figment of my imagination.&lt;br /&gt;This is in contrast with my previous experience when makeup became dull &amp; worn out by the end of a hectic day.</li>
            <li> No matter what occasion you need this stuff. This honestly keeps your make up so beautifully in place and it really is tear resistant. One of the best products I&#x27;ve brought for my make up bag</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, and this setting spray doesnt give me breakouts. First, i clean, use facial toning, and moistiruzing cream to my face, waited 15 minutes, and i put my foundation and eye concealer and sprayed it, and waited to dry, and then did my eye makeup and blush and my makeup last all day in this hot sweaty weather, i didnt retouch, and everybody is right skindinavia is the same product of Urban Decay, it same in their description or the back of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and really like the way it works.  I would recommend it for anyone who wants to keep their make-up looking great!</li>
            <li> My skin type is more on the oily side, so getting my makeup to stay put has always been an ongoing process until I discovered Skindinavia Bridal Makeup Finish, thanks to Goss Makeup Artist on YouTube.  I can&#x27;t even count how many setting sprays I&#x27;ve tried and this is by far my favorite.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but TOTALLY worth it.</li>
            <li> I use this after I apply my foundation, and before my setting powder. I can usually go about 4 hours before my nose gets shiny, so I think its working well. With this brand, my face doesn&#x27;t feel tight after it dries- so that is a plus. This brand, and Urban Decay works well.</li>
            <li> Excellent setting spray, could not keep my makeup flawless and on all day without it. Will repurchase many times!  Makeup essential!!</li>
            <li> makeup stays all day. pleasant odor. i like it better than urban decay&#x27;s makeup finisher spray. would definitley reccomnd product.</li>
            <li> For those of us with extra extra oily skin&lt;br /&gt;this product should be sprayed on BEFORE  liquid foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want extra oil absorption buy milk of magnesium and apply it with a cotton ball. Then spray skindinavia&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works very well!</li>
            <li> I get a very nice finish with my makeup and it really does help my foundation last all day.  The finish is very clean and natural looking instead of shiny.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, extremely happy, does exactly what it is suppose to do, only reason I gave it 4 star was the price of delivery to Australia  cost as much as the product . Would love to buy again but delivery making it not worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as good as anything I&#x27;ve tried.....Have yet to find anything that truly lasts as long as  the product claims.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but this stuff works. Feels great on the skin. I have tried other sprays that did nothing and made my skin feel tight. Very subtle scent. I will repurchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wedding day, and I am so glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not feel sticky, and did wonders to set my bridal make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also spritz some on my legs when I wear dresses or shorts, as it adds a dewey glow to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just make sure you cover your eyes before spraying...definitely a keeper!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle.  It helps keep my make-up in place all day.  Minimizes fading.</li>
            <li> I do notice that my foundation stays in place longer using this, but I&#x27;m not sure it would last an entire wedding evening of crying, dancing, sweating, etc. For everyday use with a primer and a light dusting of rice powder on my t-zone to control shine, it works wells to keep my makeup from melting off in warm weather, noticeably better than with just primer and rice powder alone.</li>
            <li> I was a bit sceptical about this product but hooray!! it definitely delivers. My makeup looks fresh and survives humidity, my oily skin  and sweat thus my 5 star rating. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughters outside wedding. It was 95 degrees and very humid. My makeup looked as good at the end of the reception (indoors) as it did in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased and would recommend to anyone who wants to stay looking fresh all day.</li>
            <li> I use powder foundations and setting powder due to oily skin.  This products brings back that skin look, as opposed to powdery look, and makes makeup last longer.  Good for oily skin.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this finishing spray.  It works for my combination skin, especially in the summer months.  Gives a polished finish to my makeup and holds everything in place all day long.  Second purchase through Amazon and would not hesitate to repurchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product a handful of times but I don&#x27;t feel it sets my makeup as much as I&#x27;d hoped. Think I&#x27;ll stick to mac fix+</li>
            <li> Helps set makeup reliably, easy on skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, this does not irritate it. This really helps my makeup stay put.  I love it so much, I give it as gifts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a young person, medium to oily skin, African American descent. I ordered this because my make-up always comes off and I was looking to make a better impression than having half my face gone by lunch. Each time I used this though, I would get these raised bumps on my face (the first time I blamed it on an allergic reaction to something else) and the last time I peeled large flakes of very dry skin off my forehead the next few days.  I&#x27;m going to do a skin test to be sure, but I&#x27;m under the impression that this stuff is making my top layer of skin peel off.</li>
            <li> As much as I wanted to love this product, it did nothing for me at all.  I&#x27;m not sure if it is the real product that is being sold here because it did nothing to prevent my oily skin.  After 5-10min I had to use my blotting paper.  I continued to give it a try but still nothing at all Boo......</li>
            <li> Great Purchase. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a makeup setting spray that ACTUALLY works. I&#x27;ve tried Urban Decay&#x27;s All Nighter - nothing, I&#x27;ve tried Kat VonD&#x27;s setting spray, nada... This one seems to be doing the trick!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a replacement for my Urban Decay spray (I needed something quick I could get through Prime) and it does the job.  I prefer the Urban Decay brand&#x27;s staying power, but this one doesn&#x27;t seem to clog my pores at all like the UD did.  Would recommend to any makeup lover, even if you aren&#x27;t a bride!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  Fast service.</li>
            <li> Skindinavia makes the Urban Decay sprays. I was unable to make it in to ULTA to get another one so i tried this. Its a little expensive but it does work!!!</li>
            <li> Beautiful. Sets your makeup with a silky touch, but no fake skin look. Makeup stays put for hours without retouching.  Photographs beautiful.</li>
            <li> This finishing spray is exactly what I needed!!!  I have combination skin and sweat a lot, but with this finishing spray, it doesn&#x27;t matter!  My makeup stays perfect when I use this!  Yesterday, I took a nap during the day.  No stains on my perfectly white pillow AND I had both sides of my face all over that thing trying to get comfortable!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this product, even when all the reviews I read had positive remark.  However I have to admit it really works.  My foundation and drawn in bows did not melt off.  I&#x27;m pretty impressed with the product.</li>
            <li> keeps my makeup in place.</li>
            <li> Keeps your makeup perfect all day. I also appreciate that there&#x27;s no shine or stickiness to it, it just feels like there&#x27;s nothing there at all. This is the first and only makeup finishing spray I&#x27;ve tried so I have nothing to compare it to, but I&#x27;m pretty confident it beats the competition.</li>
            <li> his stuff is wonderful.  I&#x27;m over 60 and let me tell you...if there&#x27;s a product out there that helps keep my makeup on and still looking good 6 hours later I&#x27;ve tried it.  Over $100.00 &amp; under $100.00.  Some left me feeling like I&#x27;d mistakenly used my hairspray, some were OK, but nothing ever helped with mascara smudges (absolutely essential for me).........until I tried this.  I try hard to have my makeup look finished, but not overdone.  Not so easy when your my age.  This works beautifully. Spray a quick X and ....voila!...perfect.  My mascara smudges. Always.  No matter which brand or style. I have tried concealer, primers, powders and virtually everything advised to keep your mascara from smudging..... Nothing worked. THIS WORKS!!!!

Amazing product. I love it and so does my daughter who tried it and promptly &amp;#34;borrowed&amp;#34; it right out to her car. (But I&#x27;m on to that trick).  It&#x27;s made by the same company that makes Urban Decay whose eye and lip pencils are a staple in my makeup case.  (I use the Skindinavia 10 Years Younger Makeup Finish)</li>
            <li> I got this Skindinavia Bridal Make Up finish for my wedding day after reading a bunch of great reviews about it. I even went to go pick up my wedding dress at David&#x27;s Bridal and saw a 1 oz bottle (this one is 4 oz) for $17.99! I spray it on after I put everything on, except for mascara. Its unbelievable. When I wear it, I never have to re-do my face make up from the day when going to the bar with friends.</li>
            <li> I used this for my wedding in June.  It definitely helped out keeping my makeup put, but it doesn&#x27;t do what the label says it does.  I still sweated off a good bit through the reception and had to have touch ups.  That being said, my makeup wouldn&#x27;t have made it though the ceremony without it and it worked much better than the e.l.f. brand I tried from Target.</li>
            <li> I like the product and will order again.. It does help my very oily skin. I stay mat a little longer.</li>
            <li> This works best on my oily skin if I apply it b4 and after applying my makeup. It gives a dewy look so I apply blot power afterwards to have a truly matte look</li>
            <li> I like it, Doesn&#x27;t keep me completely matte but I do have super oily skin, it definitely adds life to my makeup longevity.</li>
            <li> I think it works pretty well</li>
            <li> This is a must have people I am serious,this is the best spray ever,I have been wearing this spray now for about a year i had a 4ounce bottle for that long you only need a little my makeup stays flawless people always ask what i use i hate to say ,to be honest but i guess sharing is caring!! so now i finally decided to buy a bigger bottle not to big but it will last you can also puchase on the site with refills!!YEP but this site is so convenient for me as i shop for other goodies!!!</li>
            <li> this makeup finish was just what was required it met all my needs and i would happily recommend this item to any of my friends. Thank you for a great item</li>
            <li> Purchased it for my wedding and I love it!!! Just make sure you don&amp;#34;t spray too close to your face, it tends to leave little clumps and let it fully dry before adding more make up or spray</li>
            <li> This product comes out in a very nice fine mist.  I tend to use it after every application or between I should say, i.e., after the moisturizer spray, after the foundation spray and final setting spray.  Not 16 hours but most of the day a fresh look.  The eye shadow tends to stay in place very nicely.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this product.  Its a keeper!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! It stops my skin from getting really oily during the day, it&#x27;s gives my makeup longevity and gives me a beautiful finish. I really can recommend this product enough, just beautiful! Will defiantly repurchase when it&#x27;s finished.</li>
            <li> one of the best setting sprays on the market i use it with all my clients to set the makeup for hours guaranteed is not moving.</li>
            <li> Works great for setting makeup after. I see a noticeable difference in the longevity of my makeup. Also helps my powder and liquid foundations from transferring. Also leaves a natural finish and no residue. I&#x27;m sure for the price there are easier ways to set makeup, but I prefer to spray and go.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve over-powdered your face, or want your makeup to look more natural, this will do it!</li>
            <li> Does not seem to really lengthen my makeup wearing time :(</li>
            <li> i spritz my face as the final step in my makeup routine and my makeup stays put all day.  i have very dry skin so i don&#x27;t like to use any powder at all as it makes my skin look cakey and shows any patchy dry spots i may have.  i spray my face with this and don&#x27;t use any powder and my makeup is set all day!</li>
            <li> Read about this and was glad to find it on Amazon- great price, great seller. I love the item- it works as advertised and is better than any base primer I&#x27;ve ever used. This is the answer. Great seller, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I love urban decay setting spray, which is made by skindinavia. So i bought Skindinavia&#x27;s setting spray since UD setting spray wasnt on amazon. First time getting the bridal spray. It does help my makeup last longer and gives a dewey look.</li>
            <li> Never used this kind of product  before, but I was tired of having to re-apply eyeshadow and blush, so I tried this out.&lt;br /&gt;AMAZING!  My makeup lasted all day without irritation.  I didn&#x27;t even remember I had used it until I came home from an outing to find that my makeup was still exactly as I had applied it earlier that day.&lt;br /&gt;10/10!</li>
            <li> For 29 bucks I was expecting something a lot better.  My skin is dry but I still feel like my makeup smears and falls off even when I spray this on my face.  Won&#x27;t buy again.  Makeup probably lasts an hour longer.....maybe.</li>
            <li> My favorite makeup holding spray. It&#x27;s 100% worth it, I use it instead of setting powder (though women who have even oilier skin than I do may benefit from using both if they wish). I have used all of Urban Decay&#x27;s highly rated makeup setting sprays (De-slick, the refresh/hydration one, Stay all day), and this Skindavia &amp;#34;Bridal Finish&amp;#34; one is imo noticeably better. Now don&#x27;t get me wrong, I do notice a difference using the Urban Decay ones vs. not using them. But as far as I can tell, I think Skindavia actually also formulates the Urban Decay sprays as well - and this one for some reason just has that extra staying power for me even over Urban Decay&#x27;s long-lasting one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would rate myself as having fairly oily (but not the oiliest) skin, and I can easily go 8 hours without touching up and look pretty close to how I was the moment I walked out the door in the morning. I&#x27;ve never been cheap about makeup but this one really is much better, in my opinion, than even its more expensive competitors.</li>
            <li> This stuff works!  I tend to get shiny throughout the day and this product definitely makes me less so.  I use my sunscreen, then spritz this on my face and apply foundation a little loose powder. Definitely reduces shine.</li>
            <li> I have used similar high end makeup finish products, but this is absolutely THE BEST!  I can go all day and not even check my makeup.  I can put it on at 6 am and at 7 or 8\pm my makeup still looks great.  Please keep this one in stock, i need to reorder soon!</li>
            <li> It makes your make up look matte and it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell like some other products.  The spray coverage is wide enough and it sprays on softly. The only thing is that it doesn&#x27;t keep the make up on any longer than other sprays. It&#x27;s just like any other spray in that respect because as my skin gets oily throughout the day, the make up starts to come off at the end of the day just like with other brands.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin look dewy and natural. Lasts a long time. Love it</li>
            <li> This definitely makes my makeup stay in place (even in hot/humid weather)!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It gives me a flawless look after I apply my makeup and lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> For some reason, setting sprays aren&#x27;t working out especially Mac&#x27;s fix plus, the bridal seemed to show my lines but make my tone oilyer! Wth!? Just my experience but I&#x27;m such a product junkie I have all of the and none has done me the justice I&#x27;m looking for so I&#x27;m still searching for my soul mate here!</li>
            <li> I used this on my wedding day and pre wedding event. The events were held in humid Kauai HI, &amp; on a Boat.  The humid weather and the moist weather did not affect my makeup.  I face remained looking flawless and fresh all day and into night. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing since apple pie LOL  I have VERY oily skin and my make up always runs after a few hours no matter what I used. I watched GOSSMAKEARTIST on YOUTUBE and he recommended this on one of his turtorials and I ordered it the same day, thinking okay I will try ONE more thing. It worked and could not believe it,I keep checking in the mirror at work thinking I will getting the usual greasy mess and shining around my nose and forehead, and nothing but a little on my nose. I was hooked. LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> This spray smells strong it reminded me of rubbing alcohol, bottle is super tiny aswell. I  wore this spray for 7 hours straight and I have super sensitive and oily skin. My skin gets oily even if I don&#x27;t wear makeup. I decided to put on powder and sprayed my face before and a little after ( keeping the spray as far as possible after powder application). I live on the east coast and it gets super humid here. Well my powder is still intact. My face is not oily whatsoever and my powder foundation did not melt.  I will be back to update after I wear this with foundation,concealer,powder and blush in may.</li>
            <li> I hav ebeen using Urban Decay&#x27;s All-Nighter setting spray for some time and was willing to try this product. While it&#x27;s nice, I don&#x27;t believe this setting spray has the lasting power as UD&#x27;s All-Nighter.</li>
            <li> This made my face look wrinkly and I felt it showed off my pores more</li>
            <li> This did nothing for my oily skin with keep my makeup set. Waste of money in all honesty. There&#x27;s gotta be something better out there</li>
            <li> I noticed the young lady behind the counter at our local pharmacy always looked so beautiful, with makeup almost doll-like and &amp;#34;cat eye&amp;#34; eyeliner finishing at the far outer corners with sharp, clean points--even at the end of the day. I finally got the courage to ask her about her makeup... I asked which brand of eyeliner she was using to keep it from flaking off or smudging a the corners. She said that while you get what you pay for in makeup, the trick is to use set-spray. Because it isn&#x27;t sold at the store, I couldn&#x27;t wait to get home and order it online! It arrived within a couple of days, and guess what? It DOES work! And now I am getting other people asking ME how I keep MY makeup so perfect all day long! I want to add that I was worried I might break out from using it, since my skin is very sensitive to anything that clogs the pores, but I&#x27;ve been using it for about two months, now, and I have yet to break out, even despite going to bed a couple of times without washing it off! I simply cannot say enough good things about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I read the other reviews, and I&#x27;m wondering if the people who said it didn&#x27;t work remembered to spray it on BEFORE and after putting on their makeup? I give it an A+ and have already bought it as gifts for two friends. 😉 Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product for about 3 weeks, and I like it a lot. It makes may skin glow, without being too shiny. I feel like it sets my makeup nicely, helps it last throughout the day- (~9am- 7pm), and stay in place. But I&#x27;m not sure it would last 16 hours, as I have oily skin and it gets hot where I go to school and live (La Jolla/San Diego). I do have to blot once or twice a day, but I know that there is no way around that because of my oily skin. When I do blot, makeup doesn&#x27;t transfer. It also hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts or other irritations on my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would, recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item to help waterproof my makeup on hot and sweaty days. It works pretty well. Not perfect, but nothing ever is.</li>
            <li> I wear this evey time i put on makeup and i feel like the makeup stays on stronger and longer..&lt;br /&gt;I dont have much proof that is does though so it could juat be in my head but i like it</li>
            <li> Amazing! Locks in your makeup so it doesn&#x27;t transfer, keeps your makeup from caking up, prevents shine, never have to re-powder, and doesn&#x27;t cause break outs! I love this stuff! It is the best I have ever used. I normally have very oily shiny skin and have to blot/powder frequently but with this stuff my makeup stays put and I only have to blot occasionally, never repowder. I&#x27;m also acne prone and I have never had a breakout caused by this stuff. It is an absolutely must in my daily routine!</li>
            <li> Helps make up stay in place and helps control oily skin. Has little to no smell and dries quickly. I use it everyday and haven&#x27;t had any problems.</li>
            <li> Great product. I used this for my wedding and now I use it daily. I have a medium complexion so my makeup rubs off brown-colored marks if it runs. This helps moisturize and set my makeup. Not good for oil control though so if you have combination skin like mine then you will still need to blot shiny spots.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really keep my makeup on- I followed the instructions and I was still able to sweat it off just by normal behavior.</li>
            <li> I can tell a difference, but I still have to touch up my makeup throughout the day. It seems that my makeup stays in place better, but my face still gets a frequent shine.</li>
            <li> I saw all the amazing reviews about this product and was thrilled.  I spend half of my day attached to a phone and my makeup always rubs off on the phone leaving a gross residue.  So a settling spray that held for up to 16 hours was a dream send.  16 seconds is more like it:(  The first call I got on, I looked down at phone face after and sure enough there was makeup residue!!!  This product did not hold up at all.  There was just as much make up on the phone as usual (and I don&#x27;t wear a ton of makeup).  It&#x27;s obvious that lots of people love this product, but BEWARE it DOES NOT set makeup enough to talk on phone.  Sales reps be cautioned.  THIS IS NOT THE PRODUCT FOR US.</li>
            <li> I was never a big fan of spray finishes because i always set with powder. However, this is really good if you went &amp;#34;powder crazy&amp;#34; and look way too matte. Spray this and you will somewhat fix that overly-dry look. I have the MAC Fix+ and I have begun using Skindinivia much more than it. Great buy.</li>
            <li> Great makeup setting spray for someone not looking for a too hard of a hold. I do still get some makeup that may come off on my clothes and hands but no where near as much as if I didn&#x27;t have any setting spray on at all. The main ingredient in this setting spray is water not alcohol, so it will not be as sticky as a setting spray such as Ben Nye or Model in a Bottle. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I&#x27;ve been using for over two years and I always ensure I don&#x27;t run out.  Makeup stays fresh all day!</li>
            <li> if you use this as an oil mattifier it works wonders.  as for setting your makeup this is not your product.  Hands down the BEST makeup setter out there is MODEL IN A BOTTLE.  I use this to oil matt after foundation is applied then use model in a bottle to set.  makeup will last thru a workout and 115 degree heat here in phx.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference to my makeup.  It smells better than I expected, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and I live in the deep south where the summers are brutal and the chance of ruining your makeup is 100%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This spray is literally the only thing that saves me. It keeps my makeup on, even on the most hot and humid of days. I have used both this spray and the oily skin spray. The bridal spray is my favorite of the two. I use it on days when it is absolutely IMPERATIVE that my makeup stay in place.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I have never tried a spray finish for makeup before.  Love this idea and will purchase again.  Really does make my &amp;#34;face&amp;#34; still look fresh at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Your makeup stays put all day.  This is easy to use and dries really fast.  There is no odor to this product either.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for several weeks now and so far I am not overly impressed.  I think Urban Decay&#x27;s version has better staying power.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time last week and it turned out pretty good. My face didn&#x27;t look wet like I thought it would be after spraying it on. It was really hot in GA, after Church I went a few places but it did the job nicely. I will continue to use it to see if any changes come up. My skin is oily in the T-zone but not real bad. I liked it so far.</li>
            <li> Gives good effect. Make up looks lovely on pictures. Definitely u can try this product once and if you like what u see then u can order it often.</li>
            <li> It was my first time buying it and i instantly fell in love with this product. It actually does make my makeup last longer and it also prevents my face from gettin oily!!! I have tried the sheets that take the oil off my face but only takes it off temporarily. It makes my makeup last from sun up to sun down. I just mist my face 3 times once im done with my make up and thats it. I will defenitlt purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Did not work as stated.  I tried it over my make up and it did not hold my make up at all.</li>
            <li> Great product! I wear it on days I go to school and work. I do find that I don&#x27;t get as oily when I use this product.</li>
            <li> this product really delivers, I tried it on already twice and the result has been unbelievable , the makeup has stayed on even in humid hot weather</li>
            <li> I have always had a real problem with makeup staying put.  That is one reason why I switched to Bare Minerals (if you haven&#x27;t used that brand, you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re missing!).  However, for my wedding, I needed a little extra staying power I thought, so I got this.  I now use it every day!  At the end of the day when I take off my makeup I am amazed at how much comes off on my towelette.  That means that very little has worn off during the day.  And my daughter commented the other day how fresh my skin looked, what was my secret!  I will definitely buy this one again.</li>
            <li> Probably the best mattifying spray I&#x27;ve ever used...and I&#x27;ve tried them all (like urban decays different ones) Keeps me matte from 6am to whenever I take my makeup off (around 9-10)!</li>
            <li> Now I can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t express enough how much I love this stuff. It keeps makeup on for well over 16 hours.</li>
            <li> I had to return this. My make up actually came off sooner than normal when I used this. I was very disappointed. But I&#x27;m glad Amazon makes it so easy to return something.</li>
            <li> Five stars isn&#x27;t enough stars to express how wonderful this product is!!!!,,,, this really sets ur makeup all day! One day I had on my make up for the 8 hours at work n then went to exercise I. The afternoon,,,even though I sweat it was still there!! I keep one in my amazon cart because I will never do without this ever again</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing. I work at a bakery and i am around moisture, high heat, freezing temperatures and lots of movement and heavy lifting a lot. But I wanted my makeup to still be in place when I talked to customers. I chose the bridal one because i figured it would be that extra strength that i have been looking for, and I was right! I never have to touch up. it doesn&#x27;t get greasy. this stuff is gold.</li>
            <li> Bought this Skindinavia Bridal Makeup Finish for the first time. LOVED IT!!!! Used it for my cousins wedding last weekend. I was running all day long from morning until 2 AM. A long, fabulous day ... and when I was ready to drop ... my feet were killing me, but my make-up hadn&#x27;t faded or budged an inch! Thank you Skindinavia!</li>
            <li> Wish I had ordered a larger size, but love it</li>
            <li> Love this spray...definitely coming back for more...</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wedding day and couldn&#x27;t be happier. My makeup stayed absolutely perfect from 8:30 AM to 10 PM, through all the running around and sweating. I didn&#x27;t have to touch up once, which never happens when I don&#x27;t spray this on. I stayed picture perfect all day. This is one of my favorite purchases!</li>
            <li> Simply amazing , your makeup will last longer and feel fresh and natural. This is my second bottle and I LOVE it</li>
            <li> This product is supposed to help your makeup last longer and it did not work at all</li>
            <li> Very good and lasts your makeup all day so glad I got this and cheaper than the urban decay one</li>
            <li> I heard this was a dupe for an Urban Decay spray, well it must be - it works fantastically. I feel like this locks everything in and makes my makeup immune to the environment. I wish there were mini-bottles so I could fly with it and take it on travel. I have normal skin and use a variety of foundations.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff...does what it says, makes your face wet for a minute or 2 but once it dries your makeup wont budge. And one bottle lasts me about 8 months with daily use.</li>
            <li> I thought it was gonna hold my makeup in place but my face was shiney and smudged eyeliner not for me&lt;br /&gt;Prompt delivery</li>
            <li> This is the holy grail of setting sprays. The Urban Decay spray is made by Skindinavia, read their bottle, you&#x27;ll see their name. I add half of this bottle to a 3oz travel bottle for on the go use. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and it&#x27;s incredibly hard to make my makeup last all day. I started using this after I put my make up on and it&#x27;s a noticeable difference!! My make up lasts  a good 8-10 hours!! I use it every day!!</li>
            <li> This stuff didn&#x27;t work for me at all. My make up does not last and I still get oily.</li>
            <li> This is a great setting spray. It sprays a fine mist and helps your makeup last longer.  But just an FYI--this is the exact same thing as those Urban Decay setting sprays.  If you look on the back of your UD bottle it says \\&quot;Skindinavia\\&quot; at the top.  So...basically, go with whichever you can get the better deal on because it&#x27;s the EXACT same thing.</li>
            <li> I would swear that there is nothing in the bottle but water. Have used Urban Decay All Nighter spray and expected this to be similar. It is not. Would not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I WAS SO EXITED TO GET THIS PRODUCT, AND NOW I DONT REALLY KNOW HOW TO FEEL.&lt;br /&gt;IT DOES MAKE MY MAKE UP LAST, HOWEVER I PUT THIS ON RIGHT AFTER I FINISH MY MAKE UP, AND IT SEEN TO MAKE MY FACE MORE SHINY RIGHT WAY.  WHEN I FIRTS PUT ON MY MAKE UP, IT LOOKS SO MATTE FINISH, THEM I SPRAY THIS ON AND MY FACE CHANGED TO MORE SHINY, LITTLE BIT OILY LOOKING. DONT UNDERSTAND.</li>
