            <li> Its ok,,,, doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, almost smells old.  And it does not last at all.  I guess for putting on something after you get out of the shower, before bed would be good.</li>

            <li> This fragrance is very good. Good smell and durable</li>

            <li> Great scent long lasting highly recommend</li>
            <li> I started the day off,with Dosis Amor for eight hours. I decided,to try after that time,to use,the Dosis De Carrino and drifted off to dream woke smelling like,i just bought Designer fragrance that cost $95.00 at the high end cosmetic counter at one of the major department stores like Macys,Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom but still have $85.00 left to do with what i please. Its that wonderful! You could wear this and say that its a secret concoction just for me when everyone asks,and they will.</li>
            <li> Nice, not too over-powering!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this fragrance...Will order a few bottles next time</li>
            <li> recommend good products supplier</li>
            <li> Smell good but is not long lasting..... love the. Ring!</li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s overpowering, in scent.  The parfum is cheap and so is the scent.  I&#x27;ve worn expensive parfums and I have tried a couple cheap ones but I wouldn&#x27;t wear this one out, in public.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again or recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> excellent product thanks.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume.  Very fresh and light.  The sent will last about half a day.</li>
            <li> My dauhter just looooove the smell, it´s awesome!</li>
            <li> Beautiful scent, beautiful bottle.....sprayer didn&#x27;t work, so can&#x27;t be used.  2nd time this has happened with this cologne.</li>
            <li> I only purchased one bottle initially to see if this was befitting for a gift, or if it would be watered down because of this price.  IT SMELLS AMAZING. I&#x27;ve ordered 4 more, and one is for myself. I&#x27;m picky about what I wear,  and what I give to others. I loved this. Thanks!  Happy Holidays.</li>
            <li> beautiful packaging, great scent!&lt;br /&gt;got this for my wife, shes absolutely &amp;#34;in love&amp;#34; with it... talk about your competition;-)</li>
            <li> Not my taste in sents. Will not purchase again</li>
