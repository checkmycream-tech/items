            <li> iCape 1.0 has completely sold out.</li>
            <li> I do wish it had been a bit cheaper, but hopefully it will last as long as I need it to since I won&#x27;t be using it a ton.</li>
            <li> The back is not full length, but it goes down far enough since I always have them seated.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend, just plain and simple.</li>
            <li> I have trouble getting him to look down when I want to cut the back because he&#x27;s usually watching tv.</li>
            <li> The material isn&#x27;t very thick or plastic so it won&#x27;t make my kids sweat underneath (it also probably isn&#x27;t waterproof but that wasn&#x27;t a factor for me).</li>
            <li> When cutting children&#x27;s hair, the kids sit still and play their little games.</li>

            <li> Very very good Cape exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> My clients love this cape! Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping love it</li>
            <li> iCape 1.0 has completely sold out. iCape 2.0 is now available for purchase and is available in black and red. To get your iCape 2.0, click on the product link below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00VISQJ2Q iCape 2.0 - Hair Cutting Cape with Window for Mobile Devices]]</li>
            <li> Cool concept but in a barbershop with lots of lady barbers this is perfect to keep those creeps being a meat beater in the chair! It happens people?</li>
            <li> I just need a cape for family haircuts at home, and this fits the bill. The material isn&#x27;t very thick or plastic so it won&#x27;t make my kids sweat underneath (it also probably isn&#x27;t waterproof but that wasn&#x27;t a factor for me). The back is not full length, but it goes down far enough since I always have them seated. I am thrilled that it has the window (it&#x27;s actually a pocket on the inside with a window on the front) so my son can be entertained with the ipad while I cut his hair. I have trouble getting him to look down when I want to cut the back because he&#x27;s usually watching tv. There&#x27;s also a tiny pocket with a hold next to the window that I assume is for cords to come through in case you need to plug something in(?) Doubt I&#x27;ll be using that. I do wish it had been a bit cheaper, but hopefully it will last as long as I need it to since I won&#x27;t be using it a ton.</li>
            <li> I love it, &amp; my clients love it!&lt;br /&gt;Wish it came in more colors</li>
            <li> I love this. The design is very nice and the material isn&#x27;t too hot. Definitely recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend, just plain and simple.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for someone.  They were very pleased and it arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> Cool cape for the customers but threads are starting to tear around the window</li>
            <li> Works well! When cutting children&#x27;s hair, the kids sit still and play their little games. I recommend this for those who cut clients that are always on their phone/tablet. My clients love it!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend uses this when cutting hair. His customers love it.</li>
            <li> BOught it for my husband that&#x27;s a barber &amp; his customers love it. Fast on time shipping. Definitely buying another one soon!!!!</li>
            <li> Fast shipment. My clients enjoy using this cape</li>
            <li> My husband is a barber and all the guys in the shop are jealous because his clients LOVE this!!! Very good quality</li>
            <li> It works pretty well. Many clients enjoy it. It could be a bit longer because when you put your ipad or device closer to your face it does pull the entire cape up your legs. But it was a good purchase and has been useful.</li>
            <li> Brilliant Idea my customers love it</li>
