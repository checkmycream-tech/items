            <li>I&#x27;m so happy to finally get my hands on this product!</li>
            <li>My skin just drinks it in and feels so smooth.</li>
            <li>I was SO worth the wait!  </li>
            <li>would love it if the dropper was more fluid</li>
            <li>When I first received my O.P.Y.N., I liked the simple, earth-friendly packaging and loved the relaxing natural scent.</li>
            <li>I love how natural the product is</li>
            <li>It has a nice even color and feels firm and healthy.</li>
            <li>This product moisturizes and hydrates your face, but will not clog your pores, instead your left with glowing, fresh looking skin that belies your age !!!</li>
            <li>I have a rosy glow right after it goes on.</li>
            <li>This oil makes my skin glow and feel fresh and young, plus it smells and feels fantastic.</li>
            <li>No chemicals, nothing unnatural leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>While visiting my alma mater over the weekend (visiting after 11 years), I got my first compliment from my professor about my youthful skin.</li>
            <li>skin feels and looks much healtheir since using OPYN!</li>
            <li>This product is wonderful as it soaks in, is not oily and leaves my skin nourished all day (unlike some other products when I feel like I need to reapply half way through the day).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also seeing positive results in my complexion.</li>
            <li>I tried Manveena&#x27;s Solutions O.P.Y.N face oil for the first time without expecting much.</li>
            <li>Not only is it all natural, but it actually works and smells amazing!</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>And the bonus is I don&#x27;t have to use harmful chemicals found in so many other products any longer.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>But it worked amazingly on their tender soft skin and they want to use it everyday now!</li>
            <li>Have been waiting for the new shipment to come up on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve barely had a blemish in the past couple months which is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive nose and have always purchased unscented products as they tend to bother me.</li>
            <li>even on my sensitive face!</li>
            <li>It also matters to me that this oil is natural and has not been tested on animals!</li>
            <li>And, I say that as someone who does not usually prefer scented products.</li>
            <li>The lovely smell of this face oil is not overwhelming</li>
            <li>Love the fact that it is organic with no chemicals or harsh additives!</li>
            <li>Thanks Manveena for creating such a high-quality product!!!</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and I love the texture and smell.</li>
            <li>The pure oils work with your skin to give you what you need whether your dry, need balance or improve your skin tone.  </li>
            <li>I could hardly wait for this face oil to become available.</li>
            <li>I have normal to dry skin, but worry about products being too oily.</li>
            <li>and I have had quite a few compliments of those who have gotten close enough to me to smell it ;) as I apply on my neck and decolletage area as well as my face.</li>

            <li> I am a woman in my late 40&#x27;s and always looking for an organic product to make my face look youthful and radiant like it did in my 20&#x27;s, and OPYN is my Fountain of Youth!  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m loving this product! I think it is the O.P.&amp;#34;I&amp;#34;.N!! A little goes a long way and I love the texture and smell. Not too oily, but you can feel it going to work as soon as you put it on. I&#x27;m also seeing positive results in my complexion. I&#x27;m recommending it to friends and will continue my use of this product!</li>

I love this face oil!  I can&#x27;t wait to order the hair serum!</li>
            <li> I LOVE Manveena&#x27;s face oil. I&#x27;m over 50, so caring for my aging skin is very important. This oil makes my skin glow and feel fresh and young, plus it smells and feels fantastic. It&#x27;s done amazing things for the crepe-y neck business we all get.

            <li> Manveena&#x27;s Pure Face Oil is a truly great product! It is lightweight on the skin and looks fabulous by itself or when worn with makeup. I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I have used geranium oil for years for wrinkles but OPYN allows me to take one step out and use this oil as my anti wrinkle and moisturizer in one. I was worried that my sunscreen would not go over it well since this is an oil, but after a minute or two I apply my sunscreen over top and it&#x27;s perfection. Glowing skin, seemingly less wrinkles!!! My boyfriend has oiler skin than me, and he loves this product too.&lt;br /&gt;I would love it if the dropper was more fluid, I feel I&#x27;m shaking the bottle to death to even get a tiny amount.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best skin health investment I have ever made !!! Love that this product is 100% Organic... No chemicals, nothing unnatural leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. Goes on nice, soaks into the skin and starts HEALING ! This product moisturizes and hydrates your face, but will not clog your pores, instead your left with glowing, fresh looking skin that belies your age !!!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product!  It moisturizes my dry skin without any surface residue. Doesn&#x27;t feel like an oil at all.&lt;br /&gt;After coming back from spring break in Jamaica, I used in on my kids face to moisturize their dry skin that had begun to peel. So mad at myself that I forgot to bring it with me on the trip! But it worked amazingly on their tender soft skin and they want to use it everyday now! The scent it refreshing. I have recommended to all my friends. It truly is the O.P.Y.N. (only product you need)!!!</li>
            <li> While visiting my alma mater over the weekend (visiting after 11 years), I got my first compliment from my professor about my youthful skin. I attribute it to Manveena&#x27;s face oil. Thanks.</li>
            <li> When I first received my O.P.Y.N., I liked the simple, earth-friendly packaging and loved the relaxing natural scent. But after using it for a couple of weeks, I loved how my skin was reacting. It had calmed down, and I no longer had acne or any other inflammation. My skin felt softer, and I swear my pores even seemed smaller. I love knowing that the product is 100% natural and organic, which is great for me and for our planet. Thanks Manveena for creating such a high-quality product!!!</li>
            <li> My skin loves this luxurious and wonderfully made oil! Love the fact that it is organic with no chemicals or harsh additives! GREAT job Manveena!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product! I typically have combination skin, I had to use oil blotting sheets all time.  I&#x27;ve been using this for the past 4 months and it&#x27;s completely neutralized! I never think I look oily anymore or see dry patches.

I love how natural the product is and it has a good smell.</li>
            <li> I tried Manveena&#x27;s Solutions O.P.Y.N face oil for the first time without expecting much. My skin wasn&#x27;t perfect but I had always been alright with it. I didn&#x27;t really need any crazy products. Curious, I gave this product a try. After using the oil for just three days, I could already feel and see a difference in my skin. Now, three weeks in, I&#x27;m amazed. My face is softer and smoother. It has a nice even color and feels firm and healthy. I look forward to using this product for a long time. I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> Love this product!!! Skin feels, looks and smells amazing! A little goes a long way...a definate MUST HAVE!!!</li>
            <li> Manveena&#x27;s Pure Face Oil is simply amazing. A pure blend of organic oils, it has a beautiful smell and will change your skin forever! I tried it a few months ago and could not believe the changes in my skin. I bought a few bottles for friends for Christmas and they told me they were literally fighting with their boyfriends and husbands because they didn&#x27;t want to share it! Do yourself a favor and give it a try. You will not regret it!</li>
            <li> Simply put...this product works!  I&#x27;ve tried everything and this is only product that does it all...and is organic.  The pure oils work with your skin to give you what you need whether your dry, need balance or improve your skin tone.  My teenager also uses it to help manage her acne (yes, works on all skin types!)  Love this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy to finally get my hands on this product! I LOVE this stuff! Not only is it all natural, but it actually works and smells amazing! Can&#x27;t say that about any of the hundreds of beauty items I have tried and collected over the years. Thank you for finally making a product that I feel safe using on my skin AND that works wonders!!!!</li>
            <li> Have been waiting for the new shipment to come up on Amazon.  This is the best skin serum for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Smells great and works like a charm! Buying another for my boyfriend..&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels and looks much healtheir since using OPYN!</li>
            <li> I could hardly wait for this face oil to become available. I was SO worth the wait!  My skin just drinks it in and feels so smooth. I have a rosy glow right after it goes on. To top it off, it smells great!  I bought one for myself and one for my mom and we both love it. Give it a try, you will not be disappointed!!</li>
