            <li> saved me a lot of pain and one container lasts a long time since I use just a bit every day.</li>
            <li> I definitely bought a size up due to all the reviews.  </li>

            <li> They now glide against it each other rather than rub, and I don&#x27;t have any blisters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> They slipped out, they were not comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Not great, I bough this for everyday wear but after a week of daily use spacers began to soften</li>
            <li> I tried to locate toe separators in small sizes.</li>
            <li> i have a bunnionette and these work wonders inside my shoes at least 2xs a week....</li>
            <li> Too small for anybody but a bay, it is absolutely useless even to adults with small feet.</li>
            <li> My small toe rubs again the forth toe and gives me painful blisters.</li>
            <li> Sad.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> worked perfectly as a spacer for my son.  I definitely bought a size up due to all the reviews.  A size up was perfect for my son size 7 (mens).</li>
            <li> do keep toes apart and are soft enough not to hurt as some others do</li>
            <li> wish they came in different sizes for different sized feet/toes</li>
            <li> Great. I needed a smaller separator and this fit the bill.</li>
            <li> Amazing fast, well priced and postage was super well priced</li>
            <li> Have used these for years...so much better than bunion surgery!</li>
            <li> The picture shows different sizes as if each would fit between different toes.  They are all one size.  I needed one for my pinky toe, but they ended up too big.  Another way the company is deceptive is that it has another listing for under 5 dollars for the same product, but each item ships at an additional fee.  It ends up to be more expensive than this $14.99 rate w/ free super saver shipping.</li>
            <li> What? won&#x27;t reverse problem. Sad.</li>
            <li> Love these to keep your toes separate.</li>
            <li> these are very comfortable for daily wear.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my podiatrist for my corns. What a relief! I could wear them all day with all shoes and even wore them with sandals. Corns are gone but I just ordered 2 more packs.</li>
            <li> These gel toe spacers are sold widely, but this seller is the only one I&#x27;ve found that sells a small size. Nice quality.</li>
            <li> If you use toe spacers, these are excellent, long lasting, washable, stay where you put them...</li>
            <li> These are great toe spacers, but it&#x27;s important to note that unlike the picture they&#x27;re all the exact same size.</li>
            <li> Ballerina Granddaughter says perfect spacers and affordable price. Sizes great for Big toe and little toe space which she likes on left foot.</li>
            <li> These work great,they are very comfortable,and easy to clean. I can even wear them with open toe shoes, and they are not visible.After foot surgery I had a problem with corns. These nifty little cushions solved the problem.</li>
            <li> My small toe rubs again the forth toe and gives me painful blisters. I hoped these toe spacers would solve the problem, but they did not work for me. They slipped out, they were not comfortable.  Note that they are all the same size, the stock photo makes them look different but it is an optical illusion.  After trying it for about a week I threw them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did find a solution that works for me.  I use BodyGlide [[ASIN:B00027CDKQ Bodyglide Advanced Technical Formula - .45 oz]] between my toes.  They now glide against it each other rather than rub, and I don&#x27;t have any blisters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This saved me a lot of pain and one container lasts a long time since I use just a bit every day. I hope this solution will help someone else with a similar problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
            <li> These are great and so far I do not notice any smell from these as I have from some others. They are also easily washable if there are any problems.</li>
            <li> GREAT I USE THEM WHEN I POLISH MY TOE NAILS AND WHEN I POLISH MY FINGER NAILS. I THANK YOU</li>
            <li> Helps keep toes straight and is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> I received a good size for my foot, but I do have a hard time getting them to stay in-between my toes.</li>
            <li> The toe spacers have made a tremendous difference.  I had a great deal of pain from where my little toe constantly rubbed the inside of the toe next to it. I had tried &amp;#34;toe bandages&amp;#34;, which did not work as well and constantly fell off.  I got the toe spacers just before a trip to Italy where I did a lot of walking.  The pain I had disappeared, and it was great.&lt;br /&gt;I have to be careful to position the toe spacer correctly and put my socks on carefully over it, but it generally stays in place very well and I don&#x27;t have to worry about it after that.  The toe spacers are very durable and can be washed and used again.  I only wash mine every couple of weeks.  They are colorless, so you have to be careful not to lose one.</li>
            <li> Working well, my poderist recommended for a spacer between my baby toe and the one new to it. If it can keep me from surgery I will be happy.</li>
            <li> These are outstanding for people with hammer toes, or problems with toes that cross over each other, or toes that rub together and form callouses in between the toe. They can be cut, or trimmed to fit perfectly. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Much better than the larger ones I had. Work Great!</li>
            <li> i have a bunnionette and these work wonders inside my shoes at least 2xs a week....</li>
            <li> My husband and I both have a toe that crosses over our big toe. These have worked wonders keeping them apart and pain free. So comfortable to wear too. Soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It helps to keep the toes in position which can help some shoes fit better.</li>
            <li> I tried to locate toe separators in small sizes. The Pedifix Gel Visco-gel toe spacers come in just the right siaze and do exactly what I bought them for: to be comfortable and help me walk and sleep without pain.</li>
            <li> I have joint problems in my legs since I was little, and I was in dance classes for years. Just found out I have hammer toe and it could be the cause of my pain. Been wearing these for about half hour and they&#x27;re much more comfortable than I thought. Definetly excited about seeing if the really help correct my toes.</li>
            <li> I have been experiencing pain in the ball of my foot that my Doctor said might be Mortons Neuroma. These little puppies have significantly reduced the pain I was experiencing. Very grateful I gave these a try.</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Not great, I bough this for everyday wear but after a week of daily use spacers began to soften so I cant even notice there are on my foot and there&#x27;s almost no extra spaces between my toes. Maybe a little harder material will work better.</li>
            <li> I like most everything about this product except I was expecting a smaller size. Is quite a lot to put between a little toe and the one next to it. Probably ok for the big toe or the second toe.</li>
            <li> The toe spacers work well and they are comfortable. I could only find medium sizes in retail stores, which are too big. The small size work perfectly for me. I use them primarily in athletic shoes when I work out.</li>
            <li> These are a unique, soft but sturdy gel that do the job and are virtually unnoticeable when used. Really like them.</li>
            <li> Too small for anybody but a bay, it is absolutely useless even to adults with small feet. The package only includes one set, so you have to buy two for both of your feet. Thank Heaven I only bought one.</li>
            <li> My toes have started to get mishapened and crooked because of arthritis. This causes them to hurt.  I have found by straightening them with these spacers helps a lot.</li>
            <li> These work well for keeping my toes properly aligned.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t walk without them! I have bunions on both feet and use these to keep my big toes from crossing over the second toes. They are soft and easily washed.</li>
            <li> After purchasing and trying many different toe spacers, these particular spacers have worked the best.  I use them every day.</li>
