            <li>This one is nice as well though.</li>
            <li>The smell of the body wash is wonderful and leaves my skin feeling very soft.  </li>
            <li>&quot; Undoubtedly, this new Dove provides even greater moisturizing, it&#x27;s impressive.</li>
            <li>The scent is very light.</li>
            <li>but im glad i did</li>
            <li>I am so glad I purchased this product.  </li>
            <li>, my skin wasn&#x27;t itching or scratching after my shower, even when I forgot to use lotion. :)</li>
            <li>This one is my favorite for its moisturizing benefits.</li>
            <li>I love this body wash.  </li>
            <li>Great product; moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li>I needed more body wash</li>
            <li>Bear with me, I get better when the cob-webs are cleared from my fuzzy brain.    </li>
            <li>My favorite product at an unbeatable price.</li>
            <li>MORE FREE STUFF, OF COURSE!</li>
            <li>pleased?</li>
            <li>It softens my skin and leaves a nice clean scent that is never cloying.</li>
            <li>Great for my skin; leaves me soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The sensitive skin formula may have changed a bit over time, but it&#x27;s been great</li>
            <li>I love this particular pack because it comes with a Free Pouf which is always good hygeine to refresh your body poufs every once in awhile.</li>
            <li>I love the new sleek design and Dove is by far the best Moisturizing body wash out there.  </li>
            <li>Scent aside, this wash leaves my skin feeling clean, healthy, and nourished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t irritate skin and has a light scent.</li>
            <li>However, I really enjoy perfumed shower gels etc and didn&#x27;t like the smell of this.</li>
            <li>and now I really, really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor - ditch the fruity, scented, cheap soap and treat your skin with care.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of not only getting you clean and smelling good, it makes your skin really soft.</li>
            <li>: \\&quot;Dove&#x27;s mission is to widen today&#x27;s stereotypical view of beauty and inspire all women to feel beautiful and take great care of themselves.\\&quot;)     ...</li>
            <li>I like the Sensitive Skin version better because the scent is much better and it feels like it leaves your skin softer and smoother.</li>
            <li>right!    </li>
            <li>Truthfully, what really sold me was the \\&quot;pouf.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>good to the last dribble.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, and plan to keep buying it once I run out (which will be quite some time because you get so MUCH of the stuff).</li>
            <li>It smells fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>I normally use the Eucerin Calming Body Wash, which I love</li>
            <li>lol     My dove and pouf arrived and after a few showers, I must admit it does have zip; my body now feels like a velvet glove ... or a satin sheet?</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what to do with that, but I thought I&#x27;d have fun experimenting.</li>
            <li>more than any i&#x27;ve tried thus far.</li>
            <li>the price was right, and with Amazon Prime, it arrived in one business day for no shipping charge at all (they said 2, but it arrived in 1 -</li>
            <li>If anyone from Dove reads these reviews - please, please consider reducing the level of the scent and/or replacing it with something mild like the old original Dove bar soap scent.</li>
            <li>I really like the ever so light scent and to my surprise it worked really well</li>
            <li>However; wow the scent is way too strong.</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t exactly feel \\&quot;beautiful,\\&quot;</li>
            <li>most body washes as more-or-less equal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gentle body wash that leaves you soft and clean.</li>
            <li>I really like the Dove body wash, it is creamy like a lotion and lathers like a body wash should.  </li>
            <li>Not too much to say ..</li>
            <li>I will say it isn&#x27;t super soapy, so people who enjoy a good lather may be disappointed.  </li>
            <li>I recently tried the latest evolution of the product, now called, \\&quot;Deep Moisture.\\</li>
            <li>even the puff was high quality.</li>
            <li>I will not buy this soap again unless they go back to a flat top.</li>
            <li>My personal favorite is Dove Sensitive Skin Body Wash, but this one is a close second.</li>
            <li>This amounts to throwing way about 10% of the contents &#x3D; more waste, as well as the equivalent of a 10% price increase.</li>
            <li>The soap is fine, but DOVE changed the design of the container from a flat top to the current one, which does not allow you to rest it on its head upside down to use the remainder of the contents.</li>
            <li>And with the free smaller size and pouf, it is cheaper than your local drugstore.</li>
            <li>My skin hasn&#x27;t been this soft in years!  </li>
            <li>To respond to one of the reviewers who wasn&#x27;t pleased with the new bottle design because s/he couldn&#x27;t place the bottle upside down to get the last \\&quot;dregs\\&quot; of moisturizing soap, here&#x27;s a tip that I taught my kids years ago: Just add some water to the mix and VOILA:</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use the remaining \\&quot;old version,\\</li>
            <li>B000AO2NXS sensitive skin body wash]] for years.</li>
            <li>, the product is a lot better on my hands than i thought it would be , it doesnt leave my hands oily feeling like some of the other products do, and it softens them back up after a long say hanging and finishing drywall</li>
            <li>We live in Southern California where the humidity can drop to 12% when the Santa Ana winds blow.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a high quality body wash that doesn&#x27;t dry the skin.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it smelled just like a Greyhound bus station I&#x27;d once walked into in Chicago, IL, but then after a few uses I gotten used to it</li>
            <li>if your skin is dry, i would steer clear of any shower &#x27;gel&#x27;).</li>
            <li>I have dry sensitive skin that gets even drier in the winter.</li>

            <li> I deleted one star because I think the price is too high; I could have purchased it at Target for much less.</li>
            <li> Not a perfect 5 Stars but certainly above average in what it does which is provide deep moisture and a clean result.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and when winter comes around, it&#x27;s almost unbearable because of the itching and dryness.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve seen a dermatologist in the past for treatment and recommendations, and Dove works for me.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dove Body Wash the past 3-4 years.</li>
            <li> Mo more nasty washcloths to use.</li>
            <li> I am very lazy about lotion and don&#x27;t like the greasy feeling it leaves behind.  </li>
            <li> This is seriously moisturizing!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a bit on the expensive side.</li>
            <li> Sorry, Amazon.    </li>
            <li> I hate to use it before bed as it just clings.</li>

            <li> I am totally impressed with this product.  My skin hasn&#x27;t been this soft in years!  I am very lazy about lotion and don&#x27;t like the greasy feeling it leaves behind.  With this body wash I don&#x27;t even need it!  I will say it isn&#x27;t super soapy, so people who enjoy a good lather may be disappointed.  But if you&#x27;re looking for moisture, this is the product for you!</li>
            <li> im a drywall contractor so my hands are always very dry, i had purchased this product just to fill out the rest of my amazon gift card but im glad i did, the product is a lot better on my hands than i thought it would be , it doesnt leave my hands oily feeling like some of the other products do, and it softens them back up after a long say hanging and finishing drywall</li>
            <li> I am so glad I purchased this product.  It softens my skin and leaves a nice clean scent that is never cloying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really impressed by the Dove Deep Moisture Body Wash. I have dry skin and when winter comes around, it&#x27;s almost unbearable because of the itching and dryness. I normally use the Eucerin Calming Body Wash, which I love but it&#x27;s a bit on the expensive side. I really like the ever so light scent and to my surprise it worked really well, my skin wasn&#x27;t itching or scratching after my shower, even when I forgot to use lotion. :)</li>
            <li> I have dry sensitive skin that gets even drier in the winter. I am a fan of Dove&#x27;s Body Wash line. I have used almost every kind that they have. This one is my favorite for its moisturizing benefits. This is the one that keeps my skin from looking like crocodile skin! The scent is very light. So if you prefer your body wash with a stronger scent, try one of Dove&#x27;s other body washes. I personally prefer my body wash not overpowering my perfume. This is seriously moisturizing! And with the free smaller size and pouf, it is cheaper than your local drugstore.</li>
            <li> I really like the Dove body wash, it is creamy like a lotion and lathers like a body wash should.  The smell of the body wash is wonderful and leaves my skin feeling very soft.  The only downfall was the small pouf that came with it, it seems extra small.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dove Body Wash the past 3-4 years. It&#x27;s a high quality body wash that doesn&#x27;t dry the skin. I recently tried the latest evolution of the product, now called, \\&quot;Deep Moisture.\\&quot; Undoubtedly, this new Dove provides even greater moisturizing, it&#x27;s impressive. However, I cannot use this product. It has a \\&quot;musky\\&quot; scent that the previous version did not. The scent remains on your body throughout the day. I&#x27;ll use the remaining \\&quot;old version,\\&quot; I have while I hunt for a replacement body wash.</li>
            <li> Not too much to say .. It&#x27;s a gentle body wash that leaves you soft and clean. It won&#x27;t irritate skin and has a light scent. My personal favorite is Dove Sensitive Skin Body Wash, but this one is a close second. I like the Sensitive Skin version better because the scent is much better and it feels like it leaves your skin softer and smoother. This one is nice as well though.</li>
            <li> I love this body wash.  It is a great way to moisturize the skin.  It smells fresh and clean.  The pouf is wonderful too.  Mo more nasty washcloths to use.</li>
            <li> Great product; moisturizes very well. We live in Southern California where the humidity can drop to 12% when the Santa Ana winds blow. This is the perfect remedy for those days. It lasts all day, and eliminates the need for lotion after the shower. However; wow the scent is way too strong. I hate to use it before bed as it just clings. If anyone from Dove reads these reviews - please, please consider reducing the level of the scent and/or replacing it with something mild like the old original Dove bar soap scent.</li>
            <li> This product does feel great on your skin. However, I really enjoy perfumed shower gels etc and didn&#x27;t like the smell of this. Not pretty or perfumy at all - gave it away.</li>
            <li> The soap is fine, but DOVE changed the design of the container from a flat top to the current one, which does not allow you to rest it on its head upside down to use the remainder of the contents. This amounts to throwing way about 10% of the contents &#x3D; more waste, as well as the equivalent of a 10% price increase. I will not buy this soap again unless they go back to a flat top.</li>
            <li> I needed more body wash like I needed a ... well, since I&#x27;m in an early-morning non-creative funk, I&#x27;ll use a worn-out cliche: like I needed a \\&quot;hole in the head.\\&quot; Bear with me, I get better when the cob-webs are cleared from my fuzzy brain.    But when Amazon sent me a promotional, bearing the time-honored name of Dove, saying it \\&quot;deeply moisturizes,\\&quot; I couldn&#x27;t resist.  Truthfully, what really sold me was the \\&quot;pouf.\\&quot; I don&#x27;t know what to do with that, but I thought I&#x27;d have fun experimenting. ... lol     My dove and pouf arrived and after a few showers, I must admit it does have zip; my body now feels like a velvet glove ... or a satin sheet? So all is happy in Sunny Cali. (I don&#x27;t exactly feel \\&quot;beautiful,\\&quot; but I got a big \\&quot;lol\\&quot; from this dramatic line in their product description: \\&quot;Dove&#x27;s mission is to widen today&#x27;s stereotypical view of beauty and inspire all women to feel beautiful and take great care of themselves.\\&quot;)     ... Mission? Yeah ... right!    I deleted one star because I think the price is too high; I could have purchased it at Target for much less. Sorry, Amazon.    P.S. To respond to one of the reviewers who wasn&#x27;t pleased with the new bottle design because s/he couldn&#x27;t place the bottle upside down to get the last \\&quot;dregs\\&quot; of moisturizing soap, here&#x27;s a tip that I taught my kids years ago: Just add some water to the mix and VOILA: good to the last dribble.</li>
            <li> My favorite product at an unbeatable price. How can you beat that?  MORE FREE STUFF, OF COURSE!</li>
            <li> Great for my skin; leaves me soft and moisturized.  Wonderful smell; I can&#x27;t say enough!  Great body wash. Dove has done it again!</li>
            <li> At first I thought it smelled just like a Greyhound bus station I&#x27;d once walked into in Chicago, IL, but then after a few uses I gotten used to it and now I really, really enjoy it. It does a great job of not only getting you clean and smelling good, it makes your skin really soft. I love this stuff, and plan to keep buying it once I run out (which will be quite some time because you get so MUCH of the stuff). It&#x27;s a really wonderful value for the price!</li>
            <li> I love the new sleek design and Dove is by far the best Moisturizing body wash out there.  I love this particular pack because it comes with a Free Pouf which is always good hygeine to refresh your body poufs every once in awhile.</li>
            <li> THIS BODY WASH WAS WORKING GOOD AND THE SMELL WAS GREAT. I LIKE THIS BODY WASH. THE PRICE WAS GREAT. MY FAMILY LIKE IT TOO. IT&#x27;S GOOD PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> i have tried most of the expensive shower gels and body washes, including doctor bronner&#x27;s. for those of us athletes who shower frequenty, getting some moisture locked-in during a shower is a MUST. the gels are simply too drying (a by-product of all gels? that seems to be the case. if your skin is dry, i would steer clear of any shower &#x27;gel&#x27;). most body washes as more-or-less equal. this one, however, is not. it provides ALOT of moisturizing. more than any i&#x27;ve tried thus far. even the puff was high quality. the price was right, and with Amazon Prime, it arrived in one business day for no shipping charge at all (they said 2, but it arrived in 1 - so did everything else i ordered that day). pleased? oh, yeah!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dove&#x27;s [[ASIN:B000AO2NXS sensitive skin body wash]] for years. I have sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve seen a dermatologist in the past for treatment and recommendations, and Dove works for me. I decided to try the deep moisture formula to change things up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sensitive skin formula may have changed a bit over time, but it&#x27;s been great and I haven&#x27;t had any qualms about it. Deep moisture is very, very similar, except that it has a scent which I&#x27;m on the fence about. Scent aside, this wash leaves my skin feeling clean, healthy, and nourished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m such a creature of habit that I feel naked without it on the road. Do yourself a favor - ditch the fruity, scented, cheap soap and treat your skin with care. Go Dove or go home!</li>
