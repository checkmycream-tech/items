    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I like it the best</li>
            <li>and I am so happy that I found it!</li>
            <li>When it did spray it was a great product, but since I can&#x27;t use it at all</li>
            <li>-what&#x27;s the point of how great of a product it was.</li>
            <li>Forget Bumble &amp; Bumble (which I didn&#x27;t like(.  Get this and be happy.  </li>
            <li>and I have longed for the kind of hair that would allow me to get two days out of all that work!  </li>
            <li>Leaves your hair refreshed and good for another day.</li>
            <li>I still give it 5 stars because now I will be able to get two days out of a blow-dry!  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and smells great.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance could be improved upon as it is very strong and perfume-y upon application, but after an hour or so, I didn&#x27;t notice it.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced the clogged nozzle as others have stated, but I shake the can VIGOROUSLY before and during use (the first instruction on the top of the can is \\&quot;shake well\\&quot;).  </li>
            <li>However like most things this product was just too good to be true.</li>
            <li>No matter how many times I stick a safety pin through its horizontal hole or when I take off the orange top to reveal the spout and stick a pin in the vertical spout.</li>
            <li>I love the product.  </li>
            <li>This product is okay.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product!</li>
            <li>I would also recommend reading more reviews, because if you think you&#x27;ll get a bottle that will \\&quot;work\\&quot;, think again.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Being a stay-at-home Mom, I don&#x27;t always get a chance to take a shower and this is fabulous at making sure that I am presentable when I need to go out with the kids.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind the smell of it, but my family thinks that it is too strong.</li>
            <li>I have tried running it under warm water, completely removing the nozzle and running it under warm water, using a needle to try and unclog the nozzle and the part that sticks up when the nozzle is removed and....NADA.</li>
            <li>Yes, the nozzle clogs and no matter how much I run it under warm water it won&#x27;t un-clog.  </li>
            <li>I used the product and it was fabulous.</li>
            <li>And the smell, which was pleasant enough, is so incredibly strong that it is overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure if clogging wasn&#x27;t an issue</li>
            <li>For something that is supposed to make you feel clean and  refreshed after using this product</li>
            <li>The best way to describe it is a cross between old lady perfume and funeral</li>
            <li>I purchased a bottle of Ojon Rub-Out Dry Cleanser thinking it would be great to skip a day of washing my hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this product and loved the results-it got the oil out of my hair and made it more full, however, I had to exchange it three times due to the fact that the can kept clogging.  </li>
            <li>It can take up to an hour and a 1/2 to straighten my hair so naturally preserving the straightness for a day would be amazing.</li>
            <li>this dry cleanser would be a good product.</li>
            <li>I used Ojon and it smells intense (like a cheap perfume that wouldn&#x27;t go away)</li>
            <li>Fuhrer&#x27;s didn&#x27;t really do much for me and a drugstore brand named Salon Grafix (SG) works effectively but smells like old lady hairspray.</li>
            <li>I do like that the ingredients are more natural and don&#x27;t contain parabens, but the nozzle design needs adjusting.</li>
            <li>I have a lot left in my spray can, but I would happily give it away because I know I&#x27;ll never waste my time with it again.</li>
            <li>I purchased $63 worth of product and was only able to use about $15 worth of it.</li>
            <li>I tried hot water, I tried cleaning the nozzle.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the product for the short amount of time that it worked.</li>
            <li>The reviews here that say that the nozzle clogs after the first time</li>
            <li>Then I run the nozzle under hot water when I&#x27;m finished.</li>
            <li>Now I use Oscar Blandi&#x27;s power, which is a fabulous product, but sprays are just a little better.</li>
            <li>My biggest disappointments are the constant nozzle clogging and the extremely strong fragrance.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item in a large can at Sephora.  </li>
            <li>it self is pretty decent, however the canister the product comes in and the customer service of Ojon is the reason I&#x27;m giving it 1 star.  </li>
            <li>I liked the product - the smell was a little off, but it worked.</li>
            <li>when I was ready to wash it).</li>
            <li>and it really works without leaving a residue.</li>
            <li>&quot; This lasts much longer, doesn&#x27;t smell toxic and costs around $18.</li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t really say as the one time I used it</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s much cheaper than this product.  </li>
            <li>the product works really well.</li>
            <li>do out straight takes a lot of time</li>
            <li>and it was amazing, as if I&#x27;d taken a shower and styled my hair in less than a minute!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and gives my thick but fine hair lots of volume.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, I bought my product from a local cosmetics shop and they allowed me to RETURN FOUR BOTTLES in a row.</li>
            <li>I used it once this morning, and it seemed to do a decent job on my hair.  </li>
            <li>so i had high hopes of this working</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little too overwhelming.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s enough to make this product worth the cost for me.  </li>
            <li>I am someone who has fine, curly hair (but a lot of it)...not to mention extremely oily.  </li>
            <li>I had to return it to the store to get a new one after purchasing.  </li>
            <li>and it made my hair look so shiny and wet that it looked MORE greasy than it actually was.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure why others have so many problems with it...</li>
            <li>i would recommend buying the small size though, so even if it clogs, you used most of it already.</li>
            <li>Ojon Rub-Out Dry Cleanser has a strong and lasting odor, and while the smell is a \\&quot;hair</li>
            <li>Besides the light yellow stain that it left on my counter, I shudder to think how many dollars worth of product was emptied out of the can in this little incident---at $24, this stuff is definitely NOT cheap.  </li>
            <li>More important than the unpleasant smell, the spray doesn&#x27;t seem to have much of a cleansing effect or help with reducing oily build-up on hair.  </li>
            <li>Its a very ashy smell, in my hair it smelled like baby powder the next morning (</li>
            <li>Wow, I logged on to write about how the spray nozzle got clogged up</li>
            <li>The nozzle clogs up so frequently</li>
            <li>The only downside of this stuff is the intense baby powder smell.  </li>
            <li>It smells like a cross between incense and some old lady&#x27;s perfume.  </li>
            <li>Turn the container upside down and shake it until your arm hurts when you first get it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend trying to find another dry shampoo that doesn&#x27;t have this same issue, because it really will clog on you.     </li>
            <li>It also left my hair feeling soft and put some umph back into it so that I didn&#x27;t look like I had bedhead.  </li>
            <li>As a frequent dry shampoo user, I have to say this one has the freshest shampoo-like scent</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, oily at roots, really dry about midway thru to the ends</li>
            <li>I encourage others to purchase Batiste in the little light green bottle</li>

            <li> I encourage others to purchase Batiste in the little light green bottle</li>
            <li> My hair looked extra greasy and flat.</li>
            <li> The other problem I found was that it left a very visible, white powder in my (dark) hair.  </li>
            <li> I havent used it long enough to know if my bottle would clog</li>
            <li> It also does not last long.</li>
            <li> Within less than one day of shampooing my hair will appear oily near the roots.  </li>
            <li> My third complaint is the directions on the bottle are not very clear of how much product is needed for it to work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really disappointing that the company can&#x27;t do more to fix this faulty nozzle.</li>
            <li> This product refreshes my hair enough to allow me to wash every other day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products which have left my hair looking greyish</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been checking out dry shampoo products and found this one at Sephora, so decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try the Oscar Blondi Pronto dry shampoo POWDER...</li>
            <li> Try Oscar Blandi&#x27;s Dry Shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Forget Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s Dry Shampoo also.</li>
            <li> Also Salon Grafix sells a dry shampoo at Rite Aid for around $9.</li>
            <li> Forget about not washing my hair...until I discovered Ojon Rub-Out Dry Cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I even tried Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s brown dry shampoo, but anytime I touched my hair (which felt gunky)</li>
            <li> About two years ago, I discovered this product and fell in love quickly only to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It also goes on really wet and doesn&#x27;t soak up the oil.  </li>
            <li> I got absolutely no volume from using this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now spent a ton of money on a product I got to use once.     </li>
            <li> Every time that you need to use it, shake it, spray for a few seconds, shake it again, spray for a few seconds and continue that pattern as long as possible.     </li>
            <li> Sounds like lots of other users have this problem too.  </li>
            <li> When it worked I agreed with the other reviews about its effect and scent.  </li>
            <li> Due to the smell.  </li>
            <li> I just sprayed this stuff on my dirty, day old hair and 5 minutes later it looks terrific.  </li>
            <li> I read the other reviews and decided that despite the complaints of clogging, I was going to purchase this product anyway.</li>
            <li> I hoped this spray would help freshen up my heavy oily hair so that I wouldn&#x27;t feel the need to wash it every single day...</li>
            <li> I have tried many different dry shampoos and I think this was the worst of them all.  </li>
            <li> Second complaint is that is just doesnt work.</li>
            <li> This product is average so save your money.</li>
            <li> I came back 1/2 hour later, to find that the can had somehow spewed out an 8 inch stream, plus a few various splotches, of disgusting yellow fluid, down the side of the can and out onto my white marble countertop!!  </li>
            <li> $24 down the drain.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really too bad these guys can&#x27;t come up with a functional delivery system for this product, because it seemed like it might have potential.</li>
            <li> I was using it to get the slightly oily look out of my hair.</li>
            <li> Sadly, after 3 uses, the new bottle clogged as well.  </li>
            <li> The powdery liquid just oozes out of the bottom of the nozzle.  </li>
            <li> Wasted alot of money on this product.  </li>
            <li> waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> however, it clogged after a few uses, just like everyone else.</li>
            <li> My first complaint is that it stinks.</li>
            <li> I have also tried the OSIS dust dry shampoo and it is not great.</li>
            <li> I felt I was never able to fully access all of the product in the can.</li>
            <li> This might not be an issue for fair-harired people, but I felt silly with white powder in my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a very heavy powder smell.     </li>
            <li> But, each morning, I find that the grease fairy has been very generous to me. :(  </li>
            <li> I used it before a holiday party because I was running late</li>

            <li> Ridiculous at that price.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this shampoo, but it smells very unpleasant - the overpowering floral scent lingered all day.  </li>
            <li> This product is no good.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not a pleasant one.</li>
            <li> who knows how it will work, but at least as a powder, I don&#x27;t have to worry about it exploding on my countertop!  </li>
            <li> It made it worse.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I am NOT pleased with this!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the nozzle doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I used it once and it was amazing, as if I&#x27;d taken a shower and styled my hair in less than a minute! But not even a week later, I tried to use it for the second time and it is clogged, nothing will come out.  No matter how many times I stick a safety pin through its horizontal hole or when I take off the orange top to reveal the spout and stick a pin in the vertical spout. For a second it seemed promising, but now I consider this product AN ABSOULUTE WASTE of money.    I have also tried the OSIS dust dry shampoo and it is not great. It gives my hair body, but it still looks greasy.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different dry shampoos and I think this was the worst of them all.  I used it before a holiday party because I was running late and it made my hair look so shiny and wet that it looked MORE greasy than it actually was.  And the smell, which was pleasant enough, is so incredibly strong that it is overpowering.  I returned this after one use.</li>
            <li> I love the product.  It&#x27;s light and gives my thick but fine hair lots of volume.  Unfortunately the nozzle doesn&#x27;t work.  The powdery liquid just oozes out of the bottom of the nozzle.  Sounds like lots of other users have this problem too.  Too bad.</li>
            <li> This is the worst smelling product.  It smells like a cross between incense and some old lady&#x27;s perfume.  It also goes on really wet and doesn&#x27;t soak up the oil.  Disapointed.</li>
            <li> I will start off by saying the actual rub out product it self is pretty decent, however the canister the product comes in and the customer service of Ojon is the reason I&#x27;m giving it 1 star.  I purchased a can of Rub Out and the nozzle seized after about 3 uses.  I thought I got a dud, so I purchased another, it seized after 1/4 of the product was used.  I purchased one last canister it seized after 6 uses.  I have tried taking them back to Sephora where I purchased them and they won&#x27;t take them back because they&#x27;ve been used.  I purchased $63 worth of product and was only able to use about $15 worth of it. I have contacted Ojon several times about this and they haven&#x27;t responded.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair. It can take up to an hour and a 1/2 to straighten my hair so naturally preserving the straightness for a day would be amazing. However like most things this product was just too good to be true. My first complaint is that it stinks. It made my hair smell like I burned in-scents or hung out a a hooka bar all night. Its a very ashy smell, in my hair it smelled like baby powder the next morning (when I was ready to wash it). Second complaint is that is just doesnt work. I was using it to get the slightly oily look out of my hair. It made it worse. My hair looked extra greasy and flat. I got absolutely no volume from using this. Even after throughly brushing and slightly back combing the root. My third complaint is the directions on the bottle are not very clear of how much product is needed for it to work. I havent used it long enough to know if my bottle would clog and I doubt that I will ever use it again. For something that is supposed to make you feel clean and  refreshed after using this product I just felt dirty.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item in a large can at Sephora.  Used twice and the nozzle clogged.  I purchased a smaller can, used once and the nozzle clogged.  Wasted alot of money on this product.  I thought of returning them to Sephora, but i read in another review that they would not return a used item....too bad.  I would not recommend this product at all.</li>
            <li> About two years ago, I discovered this product and fell in love quickly only to be disappointed. As a frequent dry shampoo user, I have to say this one has the freshest shampoo-like scent and it really works without leaving a residue. The problem, which I am unable to overcome, is the issue with the sprayer getting clogged. Luckily, I bought my product from a local cosmetics shop and they allowed me to RETURN FOUR BOTTLES in a row. I tried hot water, I tried cleaning the nozzle. I never tried sticking an earring in it like another reviewer suggested, but I had enough. Probably because of their embarassment, one of the cosmetic store employees told me they had heard Ojan was improving their bottle. So I waited diligently for about a year before purchasing another bottle only to find that, just like before, after about 2 uses, the nozzle clogs.     DEAR OJAN - PLEASE IMPROVE YOUR PACKAGING DESIGN SO I CAN CONTINUE TO USE YOUR PRODUCT!!! It is a horrible design flaw that has to cost a ton of money in returns and in loss of potential return customers - LIKE ME!    Now I use Oscar Blandi&#x27;s power, which is a fabulous product, but sprays are just a little better. I have heard similar reports in Blandi&#x27;s spray and have avoided it as a result. Fuhrer&#x27;s didn&#x27;t really do much for me and a drugstore brand named Salon Grafix (SG) works effectively but smells like old lady hairspray.</li>
            <li> After 3 uses, the nozzle clogged.  $24 down the drain.  Thinking this might have been a fluke, I bought another.  When it worked I agreed with the other reviews about its effect and scent.  Sadly, after 3 uses, the new bottle clogged as well.  Ridiculous at that price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been checking out dry shampoo products and found this one at Sephora, so decided to give it a try.  I used it once this morning, and it seemed to do a decent job on my hair.  I then put the cap back on, and stood it upright on my counter.  I came back 1/2 hour later, to find that the can had somehow spewed out an 8 inch stream, plus a few various splotches, of disgusting yellow fluid, down the side of the can and out onto my white marble countertop!!  Needless to say, I am NOT pleased with this!  Besides the light yellow stain that it left on my counter, I shudder to think how many dollars worth of product was emptied out of the can in this little incident---at $24, this stuff is definitely NOT cheap.  I will be returning this can to Sephora for a refund.  I&#x27;m going to try the Oscar Blondi Pronto dry shampoo POWDER...who knows how it will work, but at least as a powder, I don&#x27;t have to worry about it exploding on my countertop!  It&#x27;s really too bad these guys can&#x27;t come up with a functional delivery system for this product, because it seemed like it might have potential.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and loved the results-it got the oil out of my hair and made it more full, however, I had to exchange it three times due to the fact that the can kept clogging.  I finally gave up on it and went to another product.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the product for the short amount of time that it worked. Now it is clogged and won&#x27;t spray. When it did spray it was a great product, but since I can&#x27;t use it at all-what&#x27;s the point of how great of a product it was.</li>
            <li> Wow, I logged on to write about how the spray nozzle got clogged up and I see that I should have read the reviews before I bought this.  Yes, the nozzle clogs and no matter how much I run it under warm water it won&#x27;t un-clog.  Bummer!</li>
            <li> This product is okay. My biggest disappointments are the constant nozzle clogging and the extremely strong fragrance. The nozzle clogs up so frequently I felt I was never able to fully access all of the product in the can. The fragrance they use is almost obnoxious.  Try Oscar Blandi&#x27;s Dry Shampoo.  I like it the best</li>
            <li> This product is average so save your money. I do like that the ingredients are more natural and don&#x27;t contain parabens, but the nozzle design needs adjusting. While my product did not clog, my mother&#x27;s spray had to be returned. The contents are so concentrated that when you spray it,  the smell makes you gag. It also does not last long. I have a short bob and use it about 3 times a week. This only lasted around 6 weeks. Too expensive. Forget Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s Dry Shampoo also. Total rip off. Go with an actual powder that you shake out into your hands like Cake&#x27;s \\&quot;Satin Sugar.\\&quot; This lasts much longer, doesn&#x27;t smell toxic and costs around $18. This lasts for months. Also Salon Grafix sells a dry shampoo at Rite Aid for around $9.</li>
            <li> I suppose the product works alright, I can&#x27;t really say as the one time I used it I had to wash my hair.  Why? Due to the smell.  The best way to describe it is a cross between old lady perfume and funeral home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISGUSTING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I just sprayed this stuff on my dirty, day old hair and 5 minutes later it looks terrific.  The only downside of this stuff is the intense baby powder smell.  My boyfriend hugged me and literally said, \\&quot;What did you spray in your hair? Please never do that again.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I liked the product - the smell was a little off, but it worked. I used it once and then tried to use it 3 days later and the nozzle stopped working. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> so i had high hopes of this working but after a couple uses, it spurted out yellow stains on my face and clothes and after one night of it sideways in a drawer, it leaked yellow oil allllll over. ew. i am going back to baby powder!</li>
            <li> My hair type is extremely coarse, red hair.  Within less than one day of shampooing my hair will appear oily near the roots.  I hoped this spray would help freshen up my heavy oily hair so that I wouldn&#x27;t feel the need to wash it every single day...Unfortunately, if your hair type is like mine, I&#x27;d recommend brushing some baby powder into your hair to absorb the oiliness until a better product comes along.  Ojon Rub-Out Dry Cleanser has a strong and lasting odor, and while the smell is a \\&quot;hair spray\\&quot; smell it&#x27;s not a pleasant one. It&#x27;s a little too overwhelming. More important than the unpleasant smell, the spray doesn&#x27;t seem to have much of a cleansing effect or help with reducing oily build-up on hair.  I was disappointed after trying it a couple of times. I saw virtually no improvement in my hair&#x27;s state. I have a lot left in my spray can, but I would happily give it away because I know I&#x27;ll never waste my time with it again.</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews and decided that despite the complaints of clogging, I was going to purchase this product anyway. This was a mistake. After one use, the nozzle clogged entirely, and despite my numerous attempts to unclog it- won&#x27;t budge. I&#x27;ve now spent a ton of money on a product I got to use once.     I&#x27;d recommend trying to find another dry shampoo that doesn&#x27;t have this same issue, because it really will clog on you.     It&#x27;s really disappointing that the company can&#x27;t do more to fix this faulty nozzle. I&#x27;m pretty sure if clogging wasn&#x27;t an issue this dry cleanser would be a good product.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product! Being a stay-at-home Mom, I don&#x27;t always get a chance to take a shower and this is fabulous at making sure that I am presentable when I need to go out with the kids. I don&#x27;t mind the smell of it, but my family thinks that it is too strong. It&#x27;s like a very heavy powder smell.     The reviews here that say that the nozzle clogs after the first time, I see how it can happen, but I have never had the problem. Turn the container upside down and shake it until your arm hurts when you first get it. Every time that you need to use it, shake it, spray for a few seconds, shake it again, spray for a few seconds and continue that pattern as long as possible.     My husband calls it my shower in a can and I am so happy that I found it!</li>
            <li> I purchased a bottle of Ojon Rub-Out Dry Cleanser thinking it would be great to skip a day of washing my hair. I used the product and it was fabulous. I thought I had finally found the product I would be using for some time. UNFORTUNATELY, that was the last time I was able to use the product. The nozzle clogged. I have tried running it under warm water, completely removing the nozzle and running it under warm water, using a needle to try and unclog the nozzle and the part that sticks up when the nozzle is removed and....NADA. Nothing. It will not work correctly. If it does spray it comes out in spurts and sprays everywhere. I have had to change shirts twice after trying to get this product to spray. It just leaks this awful looking yellow liquid instead of spraying. I would recommend getting another product until the company fixes this problem. I would also recommend reading more reviews, because if you think you&#x27;ll get a bottle that will \\&quot;work\\&quot;, think again. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Forget Bumble &amp; Bumble (which I didn&#x27;t like(.  Get this and be happy.  Easy to use and smells great.  Leaves your hair refreshed and good for another day. LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> This product is no good.  I encourage others to purchase Batiste in the little light green bottle and it&#x27;s much cheaper than this product.  I used Ojon and it smells intense (like a cheap perfume that wouldn&#x27;t go away) and it still left my hair looking greasy after using it.  It&#x27;s way overpriced for its quality.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product at least 6 times and have never had an issue with it clogging.  I am not sure why others have so many problems with it... I have an oily scalp/hair and used to have to wash my hair every day.  This product refreshes my hair enough to allow me to wash every other day.  This saves me about 4 hours a week in washing and styling.  That&#x27;s enough to make this product worth the cost for me.  I would have given it 5 stars if the scent was milder.  I have to use it at night, so the smell has time to dissipate.</li>
            <li> the product works really well. i&#x27;m not too fond of the vanilla smell, but that&#x27;s a personal choice. however, it clogged after a few uses, just like everyone else. i would recommend buying the small size though, so even if it clogs, you used most of it already.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this shampoo, but it smells very unpleasant - the overpowering floral scent lingered all day.  I had to wash my hair to get the smell out.  The other problem I found was that it left a very visible, white powder in my (dark) hair.  This might not be an issue for fair-harired people, but I felt silly with white powder in my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  The smell is musky and kinda like incense to me.  Not overpowering, but I like it.  I have naturally curly hair, oily at roots, really dry about midway thru to the ends so if I wash every day, it breaks off badly.  This stuff helps and extends days between washing my hair.  I do agree with the nozzle clogging.  I had to return it to the store to get a new one after purchasing.  I will try the safety pin idea next time.</li>
            <li> I am someone who has fine, curly hair (but a lot of it)...not to mention extremely oily.  Blowing my &#x27;do out straight takes a lot of time and I have longed for the kind of hair that would allow me to get two days out of all that work!  But, each morning, I find that the grease fairy has been very generous to me. :(  Forget about not washing my hair...until I discovered Ojon Rub-Out Dry Cleanser.  I&#x27;ve tried other products which have left my hair looking greyish (I have brown hair, so the white powders show) and gunky feeling.  I even tried Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s brown dry shampoo, but anytime I touched my hair (which felt gunky), I had brown fingers!  Ojon is COLORLESS!!  It also left my hair feeling soft and put some umph back into it so that I didn&#x27;t look like I had bedhead.  The fragrance could be improved upon as it is very strong and perfume-y upon application, but after an hour or so, I didn&#x27;t notice it.  I still give it 5 stars because now I will be able to get two days out of a blow-dry!  I haven&#x27;t experienced the clogged nozzle as others have stated, but I shake the can VIGOROUSLY before and during use (the first instruction on the top of the can is \\&quot;shake well\\&quot;).  Then I run the nozzle under hot water when I&#x27;m finished.</li>
