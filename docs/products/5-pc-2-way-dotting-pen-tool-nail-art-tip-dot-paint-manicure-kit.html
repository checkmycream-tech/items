            <li> They took very long to get here.</li>
            <li> Just how I expected them to be</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that it took over a month to get here.</li>
            <li> However as I was cleaning one of the tools broke in half as soon as I used it.</li>
            <li> , it wasn&#x27;t due until the Oct 2 - Oct 27, I got it on Sept 20!!</li>
            <li> Green one had a bent tip on one side.</li>
            <li> No i wasn&#x27;t rubbing it hard</li>
            <li> I noticed that the size of the dots look fairly similar in size, but it&#x27;s not a huge deal since the price wasn&#x27;t outrageous.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t broken or anything.</li>
