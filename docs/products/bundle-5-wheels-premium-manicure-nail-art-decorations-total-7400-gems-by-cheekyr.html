            <li>so way too many for me to count.</li>
            <li>Love the rhinestones.</li>

            <li>This item shipped very quickly.</li>

            <li>There&#x27;s a huge variety of rhinestones in this bundle</li>
            <li>In this bundle, you get a huge variety of rhinestones.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, the description of this product is accurate.</li>
            <li>These gems are a huge variety to add to my nail art collection.</li>
            <li>but I do enjoy putting it on customers.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re like \\&quot;awww,</li>
            <li>then you can see they are cheaply made.</li>
            <li>just a smooth surface (like how they look like after you apply a topcoat, but in this case, they look like it without the topcoat)</li>
            <li>They look cheap compared to swarovsky stones, but what can I say.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are so many shapes and colors that I can make all kinds of fun designs and show them off .  </li>
            <li>that was thoughtful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the money I paid for it for sure.</li>
            <li>The different colors, shapes and sizes for the price along with the quantity is great</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m overall happy with it</li>
            <li>These rhinestones are great if your just starting a collection or something.</li>
            <li>Each wheel is filled to the brim with rhinestones.</li>
            <li>Really good product came complete</li>
            <li>They are so pretty!!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!!</li>
            <li>They stayed on very nicely and last for about a week without one falling off.</li>
            <li>This item was extremely cheap, and worth every penny!</li>
            <li>So much fun!</li>
            <li>This is beyond worth it!</li>
            <li>TOTALLY WORTH THE BUY!</li>
            <li>I have seen a small pack of rinestones in stores for upwards of $10.00, so this a GREAT deal!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure they are 1mm, which is the smallest size for rhinestones(wish</li>
            <li>I am having a lot of fun with my rhinestones!  </li>
            <li>My grand daughter is 14 and loves decorating her nails, this is perfect, it has different colors and different shapes.</li>
            <li>the shipment came much quicker than expected...extremely happy and going back for more...</li>
            <li>I do my own nails &amp; am always looking for something new &amp; funky to do with them.</li>
            <li>There are so many different kinds and tons of each kind.</li>
            <li>All this stuff is made in China for super cheap</li>
            <li>Overall I am very pleased with the purchase and with prime delivery, I received it very quickly.  </li>
            <li>The rhinestones are really super small (ranging) and they are the perfect size for nail placement.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I ordered this in lieu of some of the negative reviews, as this was a really good buy!</li>
            <li>I just have tons and tons of these wheels and they will be added to my special collection.</li>
            <li>When I received these rhinestones they were packaged well and they were in there right spots in the wheel!</li>
            <li>This makes the rhinestones harder to put on, but they look great and stay on when they are.</li>
            <li>Love the packaging, it was neat and very compact...</li>
            <li>Each wheel was full to the brim with all the rhinestones.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>there is soooo much variety love it</li>
            <li>Overall, good buy for the price.</li>
            <li>I love how much you receive for your money.</li>
            <li>fast delivery love it</li>
            <li>Because I love them so much.</li>
            <li>Got these for my sister who uses these for her own Natural Nails.</li>
            <li>For those who like to change up their nails this will be a good product for you also the stones come in different shapes sizes and colors.</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>Keeping the pieces in their bins is challenging, especially if you live in a drier state where static electricity is abundant.</li>
            <li>cheeky is the main seller i will purchase from in the future because they have blown me away with their great prices, selection, and fantastic quality.&lt;br /&gt;i</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly and was packaged well.  </li>
            <li>Also, the sizes of the rhinestones are not all the same: this makes for more interesting nail art designs however it does take some guess work when trying to get matching sizes and colors quickly to apply to nail glue.</li>
            <li>Quick shipment as well, everything you will need.</li>
            <li>a las uñas super bien, no tengo queja alguna</li>
            <li>Super convenient.</li>
            <li>the shipping was quick for it coming from overseas.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that there are so many and in different shapes, too.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful little gems.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend :)</li>
            <li>lots of colors and shapes love the selection, highly recommend to all buyers.</li>
            <li>They did seem a little more sparkly before the top coat went on, so I do plan to try another top coat.  </li>
            <li>There are tons of them and they are all very pretty and sparkly</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>They are small and can be dropped easily but they give you so many of each kind that you probably wouldn&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li>very fun and pretty.  </li>
            <li>But the rhinestones themselves are wonderful, they last long too.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product if you want a lot of pretty gems for a low price, the look beautiful on your nails</li>
            <li>they are so pretty!</li>
            <li>Love all the options and colors and the amount of clear ones!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be back for more!  </li>
            <li>Huge amount of stones with a large variety of colors and shapes.</li>
            <li>because first of all, it&#x27;s a lot of stones, very nice shapes, nice colors, so many different colors, but I got used to bigger rhinestones earlier</li>
            <li>i bought more and cheaper at the dollar store and Michael&#x27;s  also it was very plastic cheap looking when u put any glue or clear polish</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I bought them; I was looking for fun</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used the product yet, but will have fun when I do.  </li>
            <li>They were worth the one month wait.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the inconvenience.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money as they come in wheels for storage.</li>
            <li>already did a set of nails using clear top coat for adhesive</li>
            <li>The containers are smaller than expected but they still hold a lot of rhinestones, and are the perfect size for additions to your nail art collection.</li>
            <li>But I opened these things up and good god, they really are TINY.  </li>
            <li>Multiple shapes and colors make this a one of a kind buy.</li>
            <li>They came nicely packaged and weren&#x27;t all mixed together like some others I&#x27;ve purchased</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>I would love to find a place where they sell glass rhinestones like the old days.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just recently started doing my own nails after 17 years of going to the salon.</li>
            <li>well worth the wait for the price</li>
            <li>I also liked the actual size of the stone themselves.</li>
            <li>If your going to a Party or just for fun.  </li>
            <li>They come in all different shapes and sizes (all small), but they fit perfectly on the nail for nail art.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for small rhinestones for nail art, and you want a good variety and good price, these are definitely the way to go.</li>
            <li>and she used them right away.  </li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>Not the right size for the project I was working on</li>
            <li>This came right away, was what she wanted, was what it said it was</li>
            <li>The quality is pretty much what you expect for buying cheap plastic rhinestones from China...</li>
            <li>The wheels themselves are made very nicely, and the top spins so you only have one compartment open at a time, and it spins so smoothly that you don&#x27;t have to worry about it getting stuck, or jerking it open and spilling the rhinestones.</li>
            <li>it comes in great packaging and although the wheels are kind of small there are enough pieces in each section for you to be able to do multiple sets of nails...</li>
            <li>Awesome price especially for beginners like myself and being tight on money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not hard to sort the gems and you should know that the case isn&#x27;t gonna be huge.</li>
            <li>The wheel design is so great because you only have one color open at a time.</li>
            <li>I place them on my nails using a clear top coat as opposed to glue, because I don&#x27;t like to use too much acetone polish remover.  </li>
            <li>Package came wrapped nice and secure and all the little rhinestones stayed exactly where they were supposed to be.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE these little nail jewels - they are so cute &amp;&amp; pretty</li>
            <li>Other than this though I am very pleased with these stones.</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast</li>
            <li>Comes in large variety and worth its price.</li>
            <li>if you want big perfectly sorted gems in a huge case GO BUY MORE EXPENSIVE GEMS!</li>
            <li>Its exactly as described and shown.  </li>
            <li>which is exactly what I ordered them for...</li>
            <li>I am not much of a flashy person</li>
            <li>I got 5 disks of rhinestone, which is exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>The stones in most of the wheels were mixed up, and some of them were not even molded</li>
            <li>Very versatile set of rhinestones!</li>
            <li>Everything was exactly as pictures.</li>
            <li>and it was exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>They are pretty.</li>
            <li>If I ever run out ;)</li>
            <li>all the time, totally rocks, people tell they love my nails</li>
            <li>I will order more next year.</li>
            <li>They do stay on quite a while and wear well, especially if you use a top coat on your nails after you place your gems.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>I love all the different colors and shapes.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Exactly what was represented in the pics .</li>
            <li>These are ok for the price but constantly fall off the nail even after being glued on.  </li>
            <li>BUT THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know which ones I want to use first.</li>
            <li>The five rhinestones wheels come exactly as shown in the picture- and are absolutely bursting with shiny gems!</li>
            <li>Its a ton of cute tiny rhinestones.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Many different colors and shapes to choose from.</li>
            <li>I think I will have to look to order some larger stones but these will do for many options on the nails.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>and they are so pretty.  </li>
            <li>Decent price, quick shipping</li>
            <li>If you like nail gems these are worth the price which is very affordable.</li>
            <li>the money, FAST shipper too!</li>
            <li>I love the actual rhinestones.</li>
            <li>More than enough for my money!</li>
            <li>You get exactly whats in the picture.</li>
            <li>I have larger hands so it will take more to cover my nails.</li>
            <li>They are quite pretty, came packaged well, even if they are in a zip bag, and there are tons of them.</li>
            <li>I received this item on time and it was exactly as described and exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>It came exactly as it is shown.</li>
            <li>It was very fiddly to fix (particularly with freshly painted nails!)</li>
            <li>There are two wheels with the different shapes; one is in different colors and the other in rhinestones, which is perfect for me since I want something different every time I do my own nails.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very please with it and the price was right.</li>
            <li>but they are beautiful and unlike some of the other reviews mine didnt come all mixed together.</li>
            <li>A lot of the colors were similar but a shade or two different, but they were pretty colors &amp; had a good variety of shapes.</li>
            <li>These gems are super tiny, they are good for small detailed nail art.</li>
            <li>A bit hard to turn the top to get to the selections, so don&#x27;t love the packaging.</li>
            <li>Love all the designs (one wheel of clear circles, one of clear shapes, two of colored shapes, and one of colored circles).</li>
            <li>These are a bit smaller than I had expected, but they are very nice.</li>
            <li>This lasts a LONG time too. :)</li>
            <li>I figured 2-3mm would be a good small size.  </li>
            <li>They come in easy to use container that prevents spillage of the different varieties of gems.</li>
            <li>I Love the fact that you get so many for such a low price, however the rhinestones seem to be like plastic and don&#x27;t have that shine once you put clear polish on top of them, but I use them anyway because I spent my money on them.</li>
            <li>There is a large variety in colors as well as shapes.</li>
            <li>and I loved every single circle that contained all different kinds of nail gems.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They came nicely packaged in a bubblewrap envelope and stacked and put tightly in a little bag to try to keep them from spilling.</li>
            <li>A huge variety of rhinestones in all different shapes, sizes, and colors.</li>
            <li>Thanks again.</li>
            <li>they looked very kiddish</li>
            <li>Came much quicker than promised.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t really have any facets cut in, and they don&#x27;t seem to sparkle.  </li>
            <li>I will absolutely be ordering again</li>
            <li>Overall i would not recommend this product because it seems cheaply made and the customer service is crappy.</li>
            <li>PACKAGE AND FAST DELIVERY.....</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves them.</li>
            <li>But it came at a reasonable time.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I even got a whole wheel with all silver.</li>
            <li>I really would not buy these again.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>and the lids of each container wasn&#x27;t secure, so the rhinestones were mixed together and are everywhere within/out of the containers.</li>
            <li>they seem reassuring when i was contemplating on them, not so much after i got the item.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much</li>
            <li>It came a lil fast considering</li>
            <li>and i thought it was very miss leading the  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much Cheeky</li>
            <li>They arrived very neatly packaged and no rhinestones were out of place.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the different shades, shapes and the convenience of the product.</li>
            <li>I bought a set of 3 tweezers from Amazon that are straight, slanted and curved and they are awesome!&lt;br /&gt;Worth</li>
            <li>But I can&#x27;t really afford diamonds so this will have to do for a while.</li>
            <li>i really like the colors and shapes.</li>
            <li>i really like these.</li>
            <li>I used some clear coat to adhere them to my nails and then put several more layers over to set them.</li>
            <li>Good Price, not amazing quality, but not poor quality.</li>
            <li>Just a little dull, but the packaging was great, every slot is packed FULL!  </li>
            <li>This is more than I expected!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been interested in nail art for awhile, so I decided to get some rhinestones to add a little more dimension to my nails.  </li>
            <li>I also use these for other craft projects as well, most with paper and metal using glue with these methods.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know these little small things can&#x27;t all be perfect!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these stones and the other designs by Cheeky...</li>
            <li>I am so excited about my purchase and will definitely continue to order from this company...</li>
            <li>The rhinestones are beautiful but the entire package was smaller than expected.</li>
            <li>some of the nail rhinestones look very cheap tried using the the black ones wasn&#x27;t satified at all</li>
            <li>The two silver ones are not the same one is full of circles</li>
            <li>I like them, and I love the little wheel they came in (very convenient).</li>
            <li>But I love them none the less.</li>
            <li>But as Cheeky being my number one favorite name brand I won&#x27;t expect any less of their products.</li>
            <li>Also when i finally did receive it, it was shoved into a ziplock bag and then shoved into a cheap manilla envelope, so one of the clear tops were cracked and just about every one of the stones had spilled out of it.</li>
            <li>Vibrant and radiant colors</li>
            <li>They are wonderful for making small gem designs and flowers and maybe a small section of bling</li>
            <li>I love the various colors and look forward to all of the different designs I can create with them.</li>
            <li>As well as just your standard rhinestone, in many different colors.  </li>
            <li>There are TONS of super tiny stones.</li>
            <li>These gems are little tricky to get on at first, but easy once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>Easy to use &amp; stays put (as long as you use a clear coat after applying).</li>
            <li>highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it was my top coat; it does look a little yellowish in the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I love these little nail gems.  </li>
            <li>i was very satisfied with this item, a little smaller than I imagined</li>
            <li>They came a whole 22 days early and suprised me in the mailbox for my Birthday.</li>
            <li>Hearts, flowers, teardrops, stars, diamonds and many round.  </li>
            <li>gems!i kinda wish they had a few more sizes</li>
            <li>Another review I read said they aren&#x27;t cut/carved like a diamond would be, but they are round how they end up after putting a top coat over them.</li>
            <li>You can definitely have fun creating a new design for your nails.</li>
            <li>The only reason why I&#x27;m not so super excited about them is that the only regret is I should have brought the ten pack instead.</li>
            <li>but these little rhinestones really look cheap...</li>
            <li>ordered it nov 30th 2012 its now jan 1 2013 still didnt get it if i new</li>
            <li>Brand new.</li>
            <li>Easy dial selector and holds them tight with normal travel.</li>
            <li>The wheels were smaller than expected but there is plenty of the rhinestones for more than one application.</li>
            <li>Is exactly as pictured colors and shapes are all the same as in the picture.....</li>
            <li>They are small, cute containers.</li>
            <li>These are exactly as they are shown - an assortment of different colors</li>
            <li>Spend the extra money and get something higher quality.</li>
            <li>I love that there are not only multiple colors to choose from but, also multiple shapes and sizes.</li>
            <li>This product came extra fast!  </li>
            <li>The only downside I have is that the first time i used one of the coloured stone wheels it would not twist, and the reason was there were rhinestones stuck in the side of the pot.</li>
            <li>Exactly pictured just smaller but haven&#x27;t even put a dent in them!</li>
            <li>these are plentiful and pretty enough!</li>
            <li>Other than that, there were so many in different shapes and colors!</li>
            <li>The wheels are on the small size but the color selection is just phenomenal.</li>
            <li>I recommend these products considering to buy one nail art decoration at the store is about the same as this whole set!</li>
            <li>Alot for my money&#x27;s worth and I won&#x27;t run out of jewels for a long time!</li>
            <li>I was a little iffy about buying this because of other reviews saying that they didn&#x27;t get a lot of rhinestones, but luckily mine were completely full!  </li>
            <li>the other is full of diamonds, squares, stars ovals and</li>
            <li>There is such a large assortment to choose from and a large amount of rhinestones overall.</li>
            <li>they are more like little pieces of glass with silver on the back.  </li>
            <li>That said, you will be hard pressed to find a better value.</li>
            <li>when put on nail can hardly see them, this is the way all the rhinestones are that I received, I can assure you I will never order any more of these</li>
            <li>I like the vibrancy of the colors, and the clarity with the clear stones.</li>
            <li>but i really thought the wheels would be larger.</li>
            <li>I surprised my daughter with it for her birthday</li>
            <li>However, I personally wouldn&#x27;t really call them rhinestones...</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore using them for both my nails and different deco projects!</li>
            <li>I bought this years ago and am still no where near running out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;As far as packaging goes-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised by all these 4-5 stars comment.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These cost nearly nothing compared to them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The only problem I have is when you turn the wheel, sometimes a few rhinestones will stick to the lid (maybe static??)</li>
            <li>However, when they came the wheels are actually really super small - not to mention that they don&#x27;t turn very well</li>
            <li>but i got a ton of rhinestones enough for a super long time.</li>
            <li>These rhinestone are in tiny little cases, but they are tiny little rhinestones - great for natural nails.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s very... flat and cheap-looking(I</li>
            <li>I wanted smaller ones, and the roll of siler circles are all the exact same size.</li>
            <li>Rhinestones look pretty (as expected).</li>
            <li>One of the triangles is full of what looks like green livers, can anyone tell me what they are supposed to be?</li>
            <li>There is also one wheel with all round rhinestones; the rest are colored and all of the wheels are completely full.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to use for nails and other things like jewelry!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a lot of fun creating endless designs and patterns with these!</li>
            <li>, cheap stuff to put on my kids&#x27; nails knowing they would probably only stick around for a few hours.  </li>
            <li>These little gems arrived well put together in each individual little section and there are sooo many of them!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to add a little sparkle to their nails</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fun way to accessories your nails giving it a little bling.  </li>
            <li>These are small, but they are the exact same size as ones I&#x27;ve found at Sally&#x27;s or Wal-mart, and these have a TON more stones for the same price or less.</li>
            <li>I love that they are tiny, make it hard to knock them off during my daily routine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of difficult to see in the picture, so</li>
            <li>made a large order with cheeky and everything was packaged fantastically and it was delivery before expected!</li>
            <li>The last disk is colourful shapes-light blue squares, orange tear drops, black circles, bright pink ovals, blue and red circles, yellw rectangles, purple hearts, pink stars, light pink flowers purple triangles, and green rain drops.</li>
            <li>Some of the assorted shape rhinestones are a little bigger, but the majority are super tiny circles.  </li>
            <li>But when you do turn the wheels full with the rhinestones they do sometimes get out of place and blend with the other rhinestones but other</li>
            <li>If they end up round after the top coat why does it matter if they&#x27;re round beforehand?</li>
            <li>The cost was extremely reasonable especially compared to other brands.  </li>
            <li>The first disk was all round diamond coloured rhinestones.</li>
            <li>The only down side is that most of them are quite small</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re very slow with opening for the most part you can push the gem back into its slot off the lid instead of getting it mixed into the next slot.</li>
            <li>They are small enoyugh that you can put them on your body/face with eyelash glue without it looking weird (Halloween), and they also look great on nails.</li>
            <li>People giving poor reviews because &amp;#34;the gems are mixed up&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;it&#x27;s smaller than I expected, I assumed they were bigger.&amp;#34; Need to really think about what they are saying, they just got 5 wheels of pretty, decent quality nail gems.</li>
            <li>I really like these little</li>

            <li> And stop assuming things that you can easily figure out by reading the description!</li>
            <li> If your doing business with them they are worth the investment and are sure to bring in tons of money and will bring a great return.</li>
            <li> better than something you&#x27;d get at the dollar store, but not as nice as what you might pay a lot more for at a craft store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Incredible price for high quality stones.</li>
            <li> , I thought 7400 was too good to be true.</li>

            <li> Words do not describe how much I love these jewels.</li>
            <li> There are plenty rhinestones in each wheel, but I feel that the wheels could have a better design.</li>
            <li> &quot; they&#x27;re more like colored drops of plastic on silver backgrounds, they don&#x27;t have that \\&quot;cut gem\\</li>
            <li> Some of the gems were mixed but very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Just wish that they were more shiny.</li>

            <li> I forgot how much I purchased them for (under $5) which was a great price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, they come in a lot of cute colors and shapes.</li>
            <li> i love</li>
            <li> The shapes aren&#x27;t my favorite, but I&#x27;m sure someone will want them at some point.</li>

            <li> I love the packaging.</li>
            <li> But after reading the reviews of Cheeky&#x27;s rhinestone wheels, I felt confident buying the 5 wheel set of nail rhinestones.  </li>
            <li> The quality is excellent and I will definitely buy from them again!</li>
            <li> I received this item today and I have to say I love love love the rhinestone wheels.  </li>

            <li> I love this every time i do my nails</li>
            <li> they should be up front with how many are in each wheel  </li>
            <li> and I love your products and prices.  </li>
            <li> 8-)</li>
            <li> This is for my granddaughter, who does nails better than most</li>
            <li> I have used these every day and I love the containers the stones come in.</li>
            <li> Just tape the wheel top</li>
            <li> I look forward to using them more.</li>
            <li> Overall its great!</li>
            <li> I order alot of nail art items and this one is just ok.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even try to count how many - there are 5 wheels with 12 spots of stones,</li>
            <li> so way too many for me to count.</li>
            <li> Love the rhinestones.</li>
            <li> I will order more for sure...just what we wanted to have the glitzy look.</li>
            <li> I love this set.</li>
            <li> Make sure you use tweezers or a nail brush to apply them.</li>
            <li> :). . . . . . . .</li>
            <li> I will still use them, as I wanted them, but most of them are under 1mm.</li>
            <li> so why pay more than you have to.</li>
            <li> Love the gems...</li>
            <li> Be sure to check if the size of rhinestones will work for you.</li>
            <li> love it thank you</li>
            <li> I like them a lot and use them for my pedicures :]</li>
            <li> They arrived in a padded envelope and the 5 wheels were stacked on top of eachother enclosed in a ziploc bag.</li>
            <li> i love cheeky and have referred clients and all my friends on facebook and instagram to cheeky.</li>
            <li> I get to be extra creative with my manicures every week!!!</li>
            <li> The stones included are super cute!</li>
            <li> These are amazing, once I got them I used them right away!</li>
            <li> They look pretty good unless you look at them under a magnifying glass</li>
            <li> This was a pretty good value fo what i paid for.</li>
            <li> I loved and got funny whit it.</li>
            <li> Have fun!!</li>
            <li> The containers have a twist top with a cut out which makes it easy to get the colour that you want from the containers.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t see these being worth nine dollars or more.  </li>
            <li> Bought to go alone with other nail things for my daughter for Christmas, she is very happy and is already using them on her friends as well :) Will be doing business again with seller.</li>
            <li> lots and lots of gems, some same colors but very good.  </li>
            <li> They look pretty and every manicure, and there are lots, so I can get very creative.</li>
            <li> I love these I use them almost every time I do my nails or scrapbook or anything crafty</li>
            <li> I received the product well before expected and am happy with it!</li>
            <li> kids love having finger and toes done came on time, enjoy using them</li>
            <li> They are great for the price however when I put clear coat or gel over them they get all cloudy.</li>
            <li> They are a great size for my 11 year old though.</li>
            <li> Love the shapes that come with it and the colors are beautiful only thing</li>
            <li> Great gift for a young woman.</li>
            <li> Fun for doing my own nails at home.</li>
            <li> I love all the differt shapes they&#x27;re fun and easy to apply to your nails!</li>
            <li> I was thrilled that the product was as described, shipped quickly, and securely.  </li>
            <li> Could not reccomend more highly!!!!&lt;br /&gt;It got to me within about a week and a half which is impressive</li>
            <li> it came from far and it has so many options!!</li>
            <li> Such a good deal!</li>
            <li> The rhinestones went on easy to the nail.</li>
            <li> This item shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> But the tops turn easily so I can see why some peole might have has an issue with that.</li>
            <li> They came off fairly easily with nail polish remover though.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> The wheels make it easy to keep them organized and in view.</li>
            <li> I do a ton of nailart for fun and this is the ultimate bundle for an incredible price!</li>
            <li> I am a first time at doing my own nail designs but these are easy to include in the design.</li>
            <li> There are 12 slots in each disk and they are all full to the top with rhinestones.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really kind of funny.</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly!  </li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;m so happy I decided to get them - highly recommend these for any girl who wants to doll up her nails :)</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a huge variety of rhinestones in this bundle</li>
            <li> In this bundle, you get a huge variety of rhinestones.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, the description of this product is accurate.</li>
            <li> These gems are a huge variety to add to my nail art collection.</li>
            <li> but I do enjoy putting it on customers.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re like \\&quot;awww,</li>
            <li> then you can see they are cheaply made.</li>
            <li> just a smooth surface (like how they look like after you apply a topcoat, but in this case, they look like it without the topcoat)</li>
            <li> They look cheap compared to swarovsky stones, but what can I say.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are so many shapes and colors that I can make all kinds of fun designs and show them off .  </li>
            <li> that was thoughtful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth the money I paid for it for sure.</li>
            <li> The different colors, shapes and sizes for the price along with the quantity is great</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m overall happy with it</li>
            <li> These rhinestones are great if your just starting a collection or something.</li>
            <li> Each wheel is filled to the brim with rhinestones.</li>
            <li> Really good product came complete</li>
            <li> They are so pretty!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!!</li>
            <li> They stayed on very nicely and last for about a week without one falling off.</li>
            <li> This item was extremely cheap, and worth every penny!</li>
            <li> So much fun!</li>
            <li> This is beyond worth it!</li>
            <li> TOTALLY WORTH THE BUY!</li>
            <li> I have seen a small pack of rinestones in stores for upwards of $10.00, so this a GREAT deal!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure they are 1mm, which is the smallest size for rhinestones(wish</li>
            <li> I am having a lot of fun with my rhinestones!  </li>
            <li> My grand daughter is 14 and loves decorating her nails, this is perfect, it has different colors and different shapes.</li>
            <li> the shipment came much quicker than expected...extremely happy and going back for more...</li>
            <li> I do my own nails &amp; am always looking for something new &amp; funky to do with them.</li>
            <li> There are so many different kinds and tons of each kind.</li>
            <li> All this stuff is made in China for super cheap</li>
            <li> Overall I am very pleased with the purchase and with prime delivery, I received it very quickly.  </li>
            <li> The rhinestones are really super small (ranging) and they are the perfect size for nail placement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I ordered this in lieu of some of the negative reviews, as this was a really good buy!</li>
            <li> I just have tons and tons of these wheels and they will be added to my special collection.</li>
            <li> When I received these rhinestones they were packaged well and they were in there right spots in the wheel!</li>
            <li> This makes the rhinestones harder to put on, but they look great and stay on when they are.</li>
            <li> Love the packaging, it was neat and very compact...</li>
            <li> Each wheel was full to the brim with all the rhinestones.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> there is soooo much variety love it</li>
            <li> Overall, good buy for the price.</li>
            <li> I love how much you receive for your money.</li>
            <li> fast delivery love it</li>
            <li> Because I love them so much.</li>
            <li> Got these for my sister who uses these for her own Natural Nails.</li>
            <li> For those who like to change up their nails this will be a good product for you also the stones come in different shapes sizes and colors.</li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> Keeping the pieces in their bins is challenging, especially if you live in a drier state where static electricity is abundant.</li>
            <li> cheeky is the main seller i will purchase from in the future because they have blown me away with their great prices, selection, and fantastic quality.&lt;br /&gt;i</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and was packaged well.  </li>
            <li> Also, the sizes of the rhinestones are not all the same: this makes for more interesting nail art designs however it does take some guess work when trying to get matching sizes and colors quickly to apply to nail glue.</li>
            <li> Quick shipment as well, everything you will need.</li>
            <li> a las uñas super bien, no tengo queja alguna</li>
            <li> Super convenient.</li>
            <li> the shipping was quick for it coming from overseas.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that there are so many and in different shapes, too.  </li>
            <li> Beautiful little gems.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend :)</li>
            <li> lots of colors and shapes love the selection, highly recommend to all buyers.</li>
            <li> They did seem a little more sparkly before the top coat went on, so I do plan to try another top coat.  </li>
            <li> There are tons of them and they are all very pretty and sparkly</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> They are small and can be dropped easily but they give you so many of each kind that you probably wouldn&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li> very fun and pretty.  </li>
            <li> But the rhinestones themselves are wonderful, they last long too.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product if you want a lot of pretty gems for a low price, the look beautiful on your nails</li>
            <li> they are so pretty!</li>
            <li> Love all the options and colors and the amount of clear ones!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be back for more!  </li>
            <li> Huge amount of stones with a large variety of colors and shapes.</li>
            <li> because first of all, it&#x27;s a lot of stones, very nice shapes, nice colors, so many different colors, but I got used to bigger rhinestones earlier</li>
            <li> i bought more and cheaper at the dollar store and Michael&#x27;s  also it was very plastic cheap looking when u put any glue or clear polish</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I bought them; I was looking for fun</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used the product yet, but will have fun when I do.  </li>
            <li> They were worth the one month wait.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the inconvenience.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money as they come in wheels for storage.</li>
            <li> already did a set of nails using clear top coat for adhesive</li>
            <li> The containers are smaller than expected but they still hold a lot of rhinestones, and are the perfect size for additions to your nail art collection.</li>
            <li> But I opened these things up and good god, they really are TINY.  </li>
            <li> Multiple shapes and colors make this a one of a kind buy.</li>
            <li> They came nicely packaged and weren&#x27;t all mixed together like some others I&#x27;ve purchased</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I would love to find a place where they sell glass rhinestones like the old days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just recently started doing my own nails after 17 years of going to the salon.</li>
            <li> well worth the wait for the price</li>
            <li> I also liked the actual size of the stone themselves.</li>
            <li> If your going to a Party or just for fun.  </li>
            <li> They come in all different shapes and sizes (all small), but they fit perfectly on the nail for nail art.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for small rhinestones for nail art, and you want a good variety and good price, these are definitely the way to go.</li>
            <li> and she used them right away.  </li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> Not the right size for the project I was working on</li>
            <li> This came right away, was what she wanted, was what it said it was</li>
            <li> The quality is pretty much what you expect for buying cheap plastic rhinestones from China...</li>
            <li> The wheels themselves are made very nicely, and the top spins so you only have one compartment open at a time, and it spins so smoothly that you don&#x27;t have to worry about it getting stuck, or jerking it open and spilling the rhinestones.</li>
            <li> it comes in great packaging and although the wheels are kind of small there are enough pieces in each section for you to be able to do multiple sets of nails...</li>
            <li> Awesome price especially for beginners like myself and being tight on money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not hard to sort the gems and you should know that the case isn&#x27;t gonna be huge.</li>
            <li> The wheel design is so great because you only have one color open at a time.</li>
            <li> I place them on my nails using a clear top coat as opposed to glue, because I don&#x27;t like to use too much acetone polish remover.  </li>
            <li> Package came wrapped nice and secure and all the little rhinestones stayed exactly where they were supposed to be.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE these little nail jewels - they are so cute &amp;&amp; pretty</li>
            <li> Other than this though I am very pleased with these stones.</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast</li>
            <li> Comes in large variety and worth its price.</li>
            <li> if you want big perfectly sorted gems in a huge case GO BUY MORE EXPENSIVE GEMS!</li>
            <li> Its exactly as described and shown.  </li>
            <li> which is exactly what I ordered them for...</li>
            <li> I am not much of a flashy person</li>
            <li> I got 5 disks of rhinestone, which is exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> The stones in most of the wheels were mixed up, and some of them were not even molded</li>
            <li> Very versatile set of rhinestones!</li>
            <li> Everything was exactly as pictures.</li>
            <li> and it was exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> They are pretty.</li>
            <li> If I ever run out ;)</li>
            <li> all the time, totally rocks, people tell they love my nails</li>
            <li> I will order more next year.</li>
            <li> They do stay on quite a while and wear well, especially if you use a top coat on your nails after you place your gems.  </li>
            <li> It is exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> I love all the different colors and shapes.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Exactly what was represented in the pics .</li>
            <li> These are ok for the price but constantly fall off the nail even after being glued on.  </li>
            <li> BUT THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know which ones I want to use first.</li>
            <li> The five rhinestones wheels come exactly as shown in the picture- and are absolutely bursting with shiny gems!</li>
            <li> Its a ton of cute tiny rhinestones.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Many different colors and shapes to choose from.</li>
            <li> I think I will have to look to order some larger stones but these will do for many options on the nails.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> and they are so pretty.  </li>
            <li> Decent price, quick shipping</li>
            <li> If you like nail gems these are worth the price which is very affordable.</li>
            <li> the money, FAST shipper too!</li>
            <li> I love the actual rhinestones.</li>
            <li> More than enough for my money!</li>
            <li> You get exactly whats in the picture.</li>
            <li> I have larger hands so it will take more to cover my nails.</li>
            <li> They are quite pretty, came packaged well, even if they are in a zip bag, and there are tons of them.</li>
            <li> I received this item on time and it was exactly as described and exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> It came exactly as it is shown.</li>
            <li> It was very fiddly to fix (particularly with freshly painted nails!)</li>
            <li> There are two wheels with the different shapes; one is in different colors and the other in rhinestones, which is perfect for me since I want something different every time I do my own nails.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very please with it and the price was right.</li>
            <li> but they are beautiful and unlike some of the other reviews mine didnt come all mixed together.</li>
            <li> A lot of the colors were similar but a shade or two different, but they were pretty colors &amp; had a good variety of shapes.</li>
            <li> These gems are super tiny, they are good for small detailed nail art.</li>
            <li> A bit hard to turn the top to get to the selections, so don&#x27;t love the packaging.</li>
            <li> Love all the designs (one wheel of clear circles, one of clear shapes, two of colored shapes, and one of colored circles).</li>
            <li> These are a bit smaller than I had expected, but they are very nice.</li>
            <li> This lasts a LONG time too. :)</li>
            <li> I figured 2-3mm would be a good small size.  </li>
            <li> They come in easy to use container that prevents spillage of the different varieties of gems.</li>
            <li> I Love the fact that you get so many for such a low price, however the rhinestones seem to be like plastic and don&#x27;t have that shine once you put clear polish on top of them, but I use them anyway because I spent my money on them.</li>
            <li> There is a large variety in colors as well as shapes.</li>
            <li> and I loved every single circle that contained all different kinds of nail gems.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They came nicely packaged in a bubblewrap envelope and stacked and put tightly in a little bag to try to keep them from spilling.</li>
            <li> A huge variety of rhinestones in all different shapes, sizes, and colors.</li>
            <li> Thanks again.</li>
            <li> they looked very kiddish</li>
            <li> Came much quicker than promised.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t really have any facets cut in, and they don&#x27;t seem to sparkle.  </li>
            <li> I will absolutely be ordering again</li>
            <li> Overall i would not recommend this product because it seems cheaply made and the customer service is crappy.</li>
            <li> PACKAGE AND FAST DELIVERY.....</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves them.</li>
            <li> But it came at a reasonable time.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I even got a whole wheel with all silver.</li>
            <li> I really would not buy these again.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> and the lids of each container wasn&#x27;t secure, so the rhinestones were mixed together and are everywhere within/out of the containers.</li>
            <li> they seem reassuring when i was contemplating on them, not so much after i got the item.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much</li>
            <li> It came a lil fast considering</li>
            <li> and i thought it was very miss leading the  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much Cheeky</li>
            <li> They arrived very neatly packaged and no rhinestones were out of place.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the different shades, shapes and the convenience of the product.</li>
            <li> I bought a set of 3 tweezers from Amazon that are straight, slanted and curved and they are awesome!&lt;br /&gt;Worth</li>
            <li> But I can&#x27;t really afford diamonds so this will have to do for a while.</li>
            <li> i really like the colors and shapes.</li>
            <li> i really like these.</li>
            <li> I used some clear coat to adhere them to my nails and then put several more layers over to set them.</li>
            <li> Good Price, not amazing quality, but not poor quality.</li>
            <li> Just a little dull, but the packaging was great, every slot is packed FULL!  </li>
            <li> This is more than I expected!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been interested in nail art for awhile, so I decided to get some rhinestones to add a little more dimension to my nails.  </li>
            <li> I also use these for other craft projects as well, most with paper and metal using glue with these methods.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know these little small things can&#x27;t all be perfect!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these stones and the other designs by Cheeky...</li>
            <li> I am so excited about my purchase and will definitely continue to order from this company...</li>
            <li> The rhinestones are beautiful but the entire package was smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> some of the nail rhinestones look very cheap tried using the the black ones wasn&#x27;t satified at all</li>
            <li> The two silver ones are not the same one is full of circles</li>
            <li> I like them, and I love the little wheel they came in (very convenient).</li>
            <li> But I love them none the less.</li>
            <li> But as Cheeky being my number one favorite name brand I won&#x27;t expect any less of their products.</li>
            <li> Also when i finally did receive it, it was shoved into a ziplock bag and then shoved into a cheap manilla envelope, so one of the clear tops were cracked and just about every one of the stones had spilled out of it.</li>
            <li> Vibrant and radiant colors</li>
            <li> They are wonderful for making small gem designs and flowers and maybe a small section of bling</li>
            <li> I love the various colors and look forward to all of the different designs I can create with them.</li>
            <li> As well as just your standard rhinestone, in many different colors.  </li>
            <li> There are TONS of super tiny stones.</li>
            <li> These gems are little tricky to get on at first, but easy once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use &amp; stays put (as long as you use a clear coat after applying).</li>
            <li> highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it was my top coat; it does look a little yellowish in the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I love these little nail gems.  </li>
            <li> i was very satisfied with this item, a little smaller than I imagined</li>
            <li> They came a whole 22 days early and suprised me in the mailbox for my Birthday.</li>
            <li> Hearts, flowers, teardrops, stars, diamonds and many round.  </li>
            <li> gems!i kinda wish they had a few more sizes</li>
            <li> Another review I read said they aren&#x27;t cut/carved like a diamond would be, but they are round how they end up after putting a top coat over them.</li>
            <li> You can definitely have fun creating a new design for your nails.</li>
            <li> The only reason why I&#x27;m not so super excited about them is that the only regret is I should have brought the ten pack instead.</li>
            <li> but these little rhinestones really look cheap...</li>
            <li> ordered it nov 30th 2012 its now jan 1 2013 still didnt get it if i new</li>
            <li> Brand new.</li>
            <li> Easy dial selector and holds them tight with normal travel.</li>
            <li> The wheels were smaller than expected but there is plenty of the rhinestones for more than one application.</li>
            <li> Is exactly as pictured colors and shapes are all the same as in the picture.....</li>
            <li> They are small, cute containers.</li>
            <li> These are exactly as they are shown - an assortment of different colors</li>
            <li> Spend the extra money and get something higher quality.</li>
            <li> I love that there are not only multiple colors to choose from but, also multiple shapes and sizes.</li>
            <li> This product came extra fast!  </li>
            <li> The only downside I have is that the first time i used one of the coloured stone wheels it would not twist, and the reason was there were rhinestones stuck in the side of the pot.</li>
            <li> Exactly pictured just smaller but haven&#x27;t even put a dent in them!</li>
            <li> these are plentiful and pretty enough!</li>
            <li> Other than that, there were so many in different shapes and colors!</li>
            <li> The wheels are on the small size but the color selection is just phenomenal.</li>
            <li> I recommend these products considering to buy one nail art decoration at the store is about the same as this whole set!</li>
            <li> Alot for my money&#x27;s worth and I won&#x27;t run out of jewels for a long time!</li>
            <li> I was a little iffy about buying this because of other reviews saying that they didn&#x27;t get a lot of rhinestones, but luckily mine were completely full!  </li>
            <li> the other is full of diamonds, squares, stars ovals and</li>
            <li> There is such a large assortment to choose from and a large amount of rhinestones overall.</li>
            <li> they are more like little pieces of glass with silver on the back.  </li>
            <li> That said, you will be hard pressed to find a better value.</li>
            <li> when put on nail can hardly see them, this is the way all the rhinestones are that I received, I can assure you I will never order any more of these</li>
            <li> I like the vibrancy of the colors, and the clarity with the clear stones.</li>
            <li> but i really thought the wheels would be larger.</li>
            <li> I surprised my daughter with it for her birthday</li>
            <li> However, I personally wouldn&#x27;t really call them rhinestones...</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore using them for both my nails and different deco projects!</li>
            <li> I bought this years ago and am still no where near running out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;As far as packaging goes-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised by all these 4-5 stars comment.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These cost nearly nothing compared to them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The only problem I have is when you turn the wheel, sometimes a few rhinestones will stick to the lid (maybe static??)</li>
            <li> However, when they came the wheels are actually really super small - not to mention that they don&#x27;t turn very well</li>
            <li> but i got a ton of rhinestones enough for a super long time.</li>
            <li> These rhinestone are in tiny little cases, but they are tiny little rhinestones - great for natural nails.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s very... flat and cheap-looking(I</li>
            <li> I wanted smaller ones, and the roll of siler circles are all the exact same size.</li>
            <li> Rhinestones look pretty (as expected).</li>
            <li> One of the triangles is full of what looks like green livers, can anyone tell me what they are supposed to be?</li>
            <li> There is also one wheel with all round rhinestones; the rest are colored and all of the wheels are completely full.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun to use for nails and other things like jewelry!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of fun creating endless designs and patterns with these!</li>
            <li> , cheap stuff to put on my kids&#x27; nails knowing they would probably only stick around for a few hours.  </li>
            <li> These little gems arrived well put together in each individual little section and there are sooo many of them!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to add a little sparkle to their nails</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fun way to accessories your nails giving it a little bling.  </li>
            <li> These are small, but they are the exact same size as ones I&#x27;ve found at Sally&#x27;s or Wal-mart, and these have a TON more stones for the same price or less.</li>
            <li> I love that they are tiny, make it hard to knock them off during my daily routine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of difficult to see in the picture, so</li>
            <li> made a large order with cheeky and everything was packaged fantastically and it was delivery before expected!</li>
            <li> The last disk is colourful shapes-light blue squares, orange tear drops, black circles, bright pink ovals, blue and red circles, yellw rectangles, purple hearts, pink stars, light pink flowers purple triangles, and green rain drops.</li>
            <li> Some of the assorted shape rhinestones are a little bigger, but the majority are super tiny circles.  </li>
            <li> But when you do turn the wheels full with the rhinestones they do sometimes get out of place and blend with the other rhinestones but other</li>
            <li> If they end up round after the top coat why does it matter if they&#x27;re round beforehand?</li>
            <li> The cost was extremely reasonable especially compared to other brands.  </li>
            <li> The first disk was all round diamond coloured rhinestones.</li>
            <li> The only down side is that most of them are quite small</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re very slow with opening for the most part you can push the gem back into its slot off the lid instead of getting it mixed into the next slot.</li>
            <li> They are small enoyugh that you can put them on your body/face with eyelash glue without it looking weird (Halloween), and they also look great on nails.</li>
            <li> People giving poor reviews because &amp;#34;the gems are mixed up&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;it&#x27;s smaller than I expected, I assumed they were bigger.&amp;#34; Need to really think about what they are saying, they just got 5 wheels of pretty, decent quality nail gems.</li>
            <li> I really like these little</li>
            <li> black,4 different shades of pink, 4 different greens, 3 different purples, 3 differnt blues and 1 duplicate, 2 of the same red, a couple differnt yellows and oranges.</li>
            <li> I really like these little gems!</li>
            <li> I have only used it one time and it did not last very long on the nails.</li>
            <li> Nothing can really prepare you for how incredibly small these are.  </li>
            <li> I think they are going to last me a long time.</li>
            <li> I have small purple circles and small light purple circles, something like that.</li>
            <li> I plan to use them for crafting and jewelry purposes rather than for nail art, so it may be more difficult to work with than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Because of the reviews, I was aware that they were very small rhinestones.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t super shiny, the colored ones, so they look a little dull.</li>
            <li> She did recently get some tweezers to apply them but before that she would use a toothpick with a small amount of clear coat applied to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tons of rhinestones in different colors and shapes my money was well spent</li>
            <li> Its difficult to get out the exact color you want because in the process of sliding open to the section you want, the stones get mixed around instead of being properly seperated</li>
            <li> they arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> however the container was much smaller than what i expected.</li>
            <li> then we expected them to&lt;br /&gt;be, but they are definitely useable.  </li>
            <li> AND SOME ONLY HAS 4O!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;i counted as i saw how empty the wheels looked</li>
            <li> it was going to take this long would of never ordered it ....</li>
            <li> WAY TO LONG OF A DILIVERY</li>
            <li> I had to wait a long time</li>
            <li> These stay all week long with no issues.</li>
            <li> They are smaller than I would have expected, but plenty of rhinestones so no worries.</li>
            <li> These are a lot smaller than other rhinestone wheels I have purchased.</li>
            <li> Every tiny piece was in the section it belonged (none were spilled out like I read on other sellers review pages).</li>
            <li> the colors were mixed up with each other, and I can&#x27;t tell which size is which because it&#x27;s all mixed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> cause I did read other reviews that said the same thing happened to them</li>
            <li> and I would have expected these to be a little bigger than they actually are..</li>
            <li> You get one wheel of all small clear stones, 2 wheels of small colored stones, one wheel of clear shaped stones, and one wheel of colored shaped stones.  </li>
            <li> i like my purchase the stones just seem smaller than average for nail designs</li>
            <li> They are actually small enough for nails, I got a wheel of all clear small round stones, a wheel of all clear shapes (tear drop, flowers hearts etc)</li>
            <li> I expected these to be big enough for pedicures, but they are definetly for manicures only because they are very small.</li>
            <li> I thought they would have been a little bit larger</li>
            <li> Not a big deal, but I&#x27;m a little OCD when it comes to organization</li>
            <li> Also the rhinestones in the picture look a little bigger than the ones I received.</li>
            <li> they are a little smaller than what i was expecting</li>
            <li> Came sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> I have made palm trees, shooting stars, lines of pink ombre affect.</li>
            <li> Unless you apply rhinestones EVERYDAY these will last a while!</li>
            <li> but at this point not really caring since there seems to be a lot of them.</li>
            <li> I got 3 colored wheels (two round shaped, one different shapes) and two clear/silver wheels (one round shaped one different shapes).</li>
            <li> They arrived when expected and came all together in a bag.</li>
            <li> it took forever to get to me (way longer than the expected date) and then when i tried to contact them to try and see where they may be, the customer service person had an attitude from hell!</li>
            <li> the design possiblities are endless</li>
            <li> so now I find myself using other rhinestones.</li>
            <li> In other words no lose stones unless I dropped them without closing case lol&lt;</li>
            <li> I cannot imagine when I will even use all of these up due to their bountiful nature.</li>
            <li> so we bought these jewels to go along with our other tools and paints.</li>
            <li> Some of the sizes and shapes are a bit too big for small nails (like mine).  </li>
            <li> Not much that can go wrong with little rhinestones, right?  </li>
            <li> was that I thought they were much bigger, well at least the tins that held them.</li>
            <li> a few other products I purchased from cheeky and will continue to purchase from them.</li>
            <li> They have a lot of varieties, and it contains bigger ones too, but the majority is very small...</li>
            <li> The rhinestones are mixed up so it&#x27;s hard to twist the wheel because it&#x27;s trapped around the edges.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re less than 3 inches in diameter.</li>
            <li> maybe less?  </li>
            <li> I think I read where someone said they didnt get black</li>
            <li> but I had 2 of the wheels that had black stones.  </li>
            <li> HALF BROKEN!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> Also it took two and a half weeks to get these because they are coming from china.</li>
            <li> and made a bit of a mess in doing so.</li>
            <li> You do get a lot for how little they cost.  </li>
            <li> Some other reviewers mentioned how small the wheels and stones are.</li>
            <li> They ship from China and it takes a little while, but mine arrived weeks ahead of the scheduled date.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used them yet, but I count a little over 40 in each 12-slot wheel of 5.</li>
            <li> STOP being whiney little brats.</li>
            <li> There are little stars, crescents, hearts - in a bunch of colors.</li>
            <li> However, i&#x27;m not a fan of the little wheel in which they came in.</li>
            <li> Some reviews said the cases arrived broken and the rhinestones were everywhere and it was just a big mess, this was not the case for me.</li>
            <li> The product is almost what I expected I wanted small rhinestones,  but not quite that small.  </li>
            <li> I received my gems within a few days.  </li>
            <li> I have used a few on my nails</li>
            <li> When thoroughly dried the gems did not chip off.</li>
            <li> The wheels they came in were very low quality, and one of them is broken.</li>
            <li> mean, they ARE inexpensive, i just wish they don&#x27;t look so, at least not that obvious).</li>
            <li> I ordered these nail gems and I was super disappointed.</li>
            <li> super disappointed.</li>
            <li> They seem a little wonky to be half hearts.</li>
            <li> The wheels look small but they are packed with tons of little rhinestones.</li>
            <li> to get them out are a little small.</li>
            <li> really well!you will need some sort of tweezers to apply these little bad boys because there is no way you could do it with your fingers.</li>
            <li> so they are a little difficult to see, but they add such character to your nails when applied.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;IT HAS VERY LITTLE PRODUCT  </li>
            <li> when the price was 3.00 with 6.00 shipping so 9.00 isn&#x27;t bad for 490 rhinestones, really.</li>
            <li> The wheels are small.</li>
            <li> When I got them I was not expecting everything to be so small.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of rhinestones, but they are so small that you would never think it could be 7400 of them.  </li>
            <li> they are small but plentiful</li>
            <li> So Im not sure if there is 7400 in this set</li>
            <li> Just that there were three wheels of small circles</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really small.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a joke the stones are so small you need a magnifying glass to pick them up and</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really, really small.  </li>
            <li> i order this product and they sent me the wrong something completely different.</li>
            <li> they had poor customer service...be careful.</li>
            <li> The cases that the gems come in are really really small, like two inches across, and the gems inside are pencil point size.</li>
            <li> My problem with this item is that usually you attach the stones with glue and with these stones when you add the glue</li>
            <li> The gems get stuck in the wheel and make it difficult to open.</li>
            <li> I bought a small pack from Sally&#x27;s beauty supply and paid $12 for a fraction of the amount.  </li>
            <li> the wheels are packed with the product unlike wheels i have purchased in the past at beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li> You get a lot for very few $$$$s</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s not very good quality too.</li>
            <li> I had expected them to be bigger, and was quite disappointed that they were so small.</li>
            <li> When this came in the mail it was very poorly packaged and they are smaller than a doorknob and the rhinestones inside were very small about the size of beads.</li>
            <li> so you have to push it fairly hard</li>
            <li> I read several horror stories about disappointed customers from other websites/sellers.  </li>
            <li> A little frustrating.</li>
            <li> (At least my wheels were hard to turn)&lt;br</li>
            <li> would recommend them with a warning about how crazy tiny these are.  </li>
            <li> least 2 time a month ...will recommend to family friends neighbors and others...</li>
            <li> I got these 5 days late.</li>
            <li> i was shocked and pleasantly surprised at the quality and selection of these wheels.</li>
            <li> a few of them are broken.</li>
            <li> They are very small and hard to pick up.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think the trays were going to be so small though, but they are quite sturdy and the filter is convenient!</li>
            <li> They are ridiculously small!</li>
            <li> These are very very small rhinestones that can be used for nails or even for makeup.</li>
            <li> When i look at the rhinestones, they are very small.</li>
            <li> There were different colors and shaped in the wrong compartment and the dividers don&#x27;t desperate them at all.</li>
            <li> Moreover when i open the package i was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the wheels, it is very hard to turn the wheels to get to the rhinestones.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She says she would recommend this to anyone who wants fancy looking nails that doesn&#x27;t want to pay outrageous prices at a nail salon.</li>
            <li> It took approximately 4 weeks from where it shipped (Hong Kong) to here.</li>
            <li> they do not sparkle at all and are dull and awkward shapes.</li>
            <li> I am afraid that they will spill everywhere if I turn to hard.</li>
            <li> For the price of these little gems, you can not go wrong!!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much sorry</li>
            <li> but the quality is poor!</li>
            <li> but I am unhappy with the quantity that they stated that I did not get and how there are some broken rhinestones.</li>
            <li> When I opened the package the packaging was VERY sloppy.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s crazy.  </li>
            <li> One of the containers got jostled so badly that the rhinestones got stuck in the side area where the plastic wheel turns.</li>
            <li> shipping wasn&#x27;t bad either.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed...</li>
            <li> I was disappointed, but they did reimburse me my money.</li>
            <li> I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT&lt;</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t stay on unless you use topcoat, and then they cloud up and look nasty.</li>
            <li> I tried them once and my nails came out looking horrible with them</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Upon receiving this in the mail it was opened and the rhinestones were scattered everywhere inside the packaging</li>
            <li> Comes in large variety and worth its price. This set will last you for quite a while! I bought this maybe 2-3 years ago and its still not even close to finish.</li>
            <li> These are awesome! Cheeky has the best nail rhinestones, very happy!</li>
            <li> I love these!! I get to be extra creative with my manicures every week!!! This lasts a LONG time too. :)</li>
            <li> Beautiful little gems. Perfect for anyone wanting to do nails. These are tiny tiny gems but big in beauty. Cute</li>
            <li> Thank you so much sorry had&#x27;nt  wrote a review before but I love the gems n great value for money I will deffo shop with u again.. I will most deffo have a look on your site for more nail stuff..  Thanks again.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and was packaged well.  Its exactly as described and shown.  There&#x27;s some static on the plastic lid so as you twirl around some of the gems can mix up but they weren&#x27;t that way from shipping.  If you&#x27;re very slow with opening for the most part you can push the gem back into its slot off the lid instead of getting it mixed into the next slot.</li>
            <li> When i received the rhinestones i was very happy. I would have given them a 5 but i really thought the wheels would be larger. great selection</li>
            <li> Great Product nail rhinestone wheels. I surprised my daughter with it for her birthday and she used them right away.  The rhinestones went on easy to the nail.</li>
            <li> some of the nail rhinestones look very cheap tried using the the black ones wasn&#x27;t satified at all they looked very kiddish but u get what u pay for.......</li>
            <li> Received on time. Rhinestones look pretty (as expected). Packaging smelled of cigarette smoke. The wheels are small. (Only about 2 inches in diameter)</li>
            <li> Came much quicker than promised.  Nice quality</li>
            <li> These are inexpensive.  That&#x27;s why I bought them; I was looking for fun, cheap stuff to put on my kids&#x27; nails knowing they would probably only stick around for a few hours.  However, I personally wouldn&#x27;t really call them rhinestones...they are more like little pieces of glass with silver on the back.  They don&#x27;t really have any facets cut in, and they don&#x27;t seem to sparkle.  Maybe it was my top coat; it does look a little yellowish in the bottle.  They did seem a little more sparkly before the top coat went on, so I do plan to try another top coat.  Regardless, they weren&#x27;t show stopping before the top coat!  But, they do have a lot of colors and shapes, and there are many pieces included.  For the price, they are unbeatable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my purposes, I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Use these on my nails and my artwork.  Cannot beat the price!</li>
            <li> Packaging was great, wrapped securely in a Ziploc bag no spillage what s ever.... Is exactly as pictured colors and shapes are all the same as in the picture..... Perfect for mani/pedi  which is exactly what I ordered them for...</li>
            <li> Came sooner than expected. Great price for the quantity. I like the ease in using the wheel and not have to worry about them all spilling out.</li>
            <li> Fun for doing my own nails at home.</li>
            <li> My customers love rhinestones! It&#x27;s a fun way to accessories your nails giving it a little bling.  I am not much of a flashy person but I do enjoy putting it on customers.</li>
            <li> How can you *not* feel glamorous with these plastic rhinestones on your fingernails? They look great! These gems are little tricky to get on at first, but easy once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> I love them. They are small, cute containers. Lots of different colors and shapes (stars, hearts, rectangles, squares, flowers. Awesome price especially for beginners like myself and being tight on money. They came a whole 22 days early and suprised me in the mailbox for my Birthday.</li>
            <li> Love the variety I have with these stones.  Good quality.  I like the vibrancy of the colors, and the clarity with the clear stones.</li>
            <li> When I received these rhinestones they were packaged well and they were in there right spots in the wheel! They are beautiful and I use them for my DIY phone cases. Nueva use of the variety of colors and shapes, I get a great selection to choose from! I will absolutely be ordering again</li>
            <li> When I received my rhinestones they were prefectly packaged. I received them the day they told me I would. I got 5 disks of rhinestone, which is exactly what I ordered. There are 12 slots in each disk and they are all full to the top with rhinestones. The first disk was all round diamond coloured rhinestones. The second disk are the same diamond colour but they are all different shapes, flowers- 3 sizes of circles, rain drop, tear drop, hearts, ovals, triangles, squares, rectangles and stars. Two disks have all different colours. Some are duplicats but I dont mind cuz I will still use them. Examples of some of the colours- black,4 different shades of pink, 4 different greens, 3 different purples, 3 differnt blues and 1 duplicate, 2 of the same red, a couple differnt yellows and oranges. The last disk is colourful shapes-light blue squares, orange tear drops, black circles, bright pink ovals, blue and red circles, yellw rectangles, purple hearts, pink stars, light pink flowers purple triangles, and green rain drops. I have already done my nails like 5 times with these and they look amazing on! I am 100% satisfied with the product I received and I am also 100% satisfied with the seller. I definetly recommend this product and the seller. :)</li>
            <li> This is more than I expected!  You know how sometimes you get your hopes up and then something arrives and you&#x27;re like \\&quot;awww, man!\\&quot;  Not this!  I was very excited to see all the sizes, shapes and colors!!  And SO AFFORDABLE!!</li>
            <li> I ordered these items by mistake. They are very small and hard to pick up. I have only used it one time and it did not last very long on the nails.</li>
            <li> LOVE these, I use them often.</li>
            <li> the rhinestones are tiny and when you put on your topcoat they almost disappear entirely except for the fogginess or whiteness that they get afterwards. They didnt even sparkle at all. it took forever to get to me (way longer than the expected date) and then when i tried to contact them to try and see where they may be, the customer service person had an attitude from hell! I couldnt believe it!! I told them i would never purchase anything with their name on it ever again and that was that. Also when i finally did receive it, it was shoved into a ziplock bag and then shoved into a cheap manilla envelope, so one of the clear tops were cracked and just about every one of the stones had spilled out of it. The stones in most of the wheels were mixed up, and some of them were not even molded/cut right so i ended up having to toss alot out because they were malformed. Overall i would not recommend this product because it seems cheaply made and the customer service is crappy. I gave 2 stars because i am too nice.</li>
            <li> Although these are smaller containers that you would buy in the store, they still have a lot of stones in them.  I would def. purchase them again!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much as these were so inexpensive however they are so easy to use and the packaging is wonderful. The wheel design is so great because you only have one color open at a time. This way you do not spill the rest. I have made palm trees, shooting stars, lines of pink ombre affect. Very versatile set of rhinestones!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a huge variety of rhinestones in this bundle and I&#x27;m definitely not running out anytime soon. They&#x27;re easy to apply, perfect size, and the container wheel that holds all the rhinestones is so convenient.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these rhinestones for a while now and I love them!(: Definitely recommend these for rhinestone lovers and nail art fanatics!</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this product, it was a good price and exactly as described. I will be shopping here again x</li>
            <li> the only problem was that i thought i was getting a much larger case like the pictures showed but the actual size is no where compareable to the item..</li>
            <li> Everything was exactly as pictures. I can&#x27;t wait to start getting creative with my nail designs. Who needs a nail salon?!</li>
            <li> I do my own manicures.  These are exactly as they are shown - an assortment of different colors/shapes rhinestones for your nails.  It is what I wanted.</li>
            <li> LIKE I SAID BEFORE......OMG...I JUST LOVE THEM.....PACKAGE AND FAST DELIVERY.....GREAT PRODUCT....I WILL ORDER MORE AND I WILL TELL ALL MY GIRLS IN SCHOOL WITH ME ABOUT THIS.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been interested in nail art for awhile, so I decided to get some rhinestones to add a little more dimension to my nails.  In this bundle, you get a huge variety of rhinestones. It&#x27;s kind of difficult to see in the picture, so what you get is: 1 wheel of silver circles, 1 wheel of silver shapes (flowers, teardrops, rectangles, etc.), 1 wheel of colored shapes, and 2 wheels of colored circles. The wheels themselves are made very nicely, and the top spins so you only have one compartment open at a time, and it spins so smoothly that you don&#x27;t have to worry about it getting stuck, or jerking it open and spilling the rhinestones. The different colors/shapes are separated almost perfectly, so you won&#x27;t need to dig around with a toothpick to find what you want.</li>
            <li> Love it! Tons of rhinestones in different colors and shapes my money was well spent and it was exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> When I bought these, I assumed the container&#x27;s were larger.  When I got them I was not expecting everything to be so small. When I opened the package the packaging was VERY sloppy.  There were rhinestones all over the place in the package.  I honestly don&#x27;t see these being worth nine dollars or more.  I was disappointed...</li>
            <li> These are so cheap! Qutie a few of them are broken. They don&#x27;t stay on unless you use topcoat, and then they cloud up and look nasty. Spend the extra money and get something higher quality.</li>
            <li> Love the colors...it&#x27;s great stuff.  Now I just need to get glitter!!!  It&#x27;s fun to use for nails and other things like jewelry! The product arrived as scheduled...thank you!!</li>
            <li> I loved how there were so many in the container and I have so many options for nail art I change my designs every2-3 days so I am well stocked up.</li>
            <li> More Gems added to my hoard. Use these as accents on each nail or only have one accent finger on each hand. In any case rhinestones are awesome for catching someones attention to a particular spot on your nails!</li>
            <li> Love the packaging, it was neat and very compact... Didn&#x27;t think the trays were going to be so small though, but they are quite sturdy and the filter is convenient!</li>
            <li> I Recieved the rhinestones perfectly packaged in the mail. Each wheel was full to the brim with all the rhinestones.&lt;br /&gt;I do nails, so all my clients love the gems they get to pick from. I love them i will probably buy more. But when you do turn the wheels full with the rhinestones they do sometimes get out of place and blend with the other rhinestones but other then that. I love them. :) thank you!</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly!  Haven&#x27;t used the product yet, but will have fun when I do.  Lots of colors!  Love options for my nails.</li>
            <li> I use this product for my nails designs. I thought they would have been a little bit larger then what they were. I will make it work anyhow.</li>
            <li> Great assortment of colors and shapes. Easy dial selector and holds them tight with normal travel. Wife loves them.</li>
            <li> These are very very small rhinestones that can be used for nails or even for makeup. I would definitely suggest some rhinestone/craft tweezers to help with picking them up and application. bc they are very tiny!  You do get a lot for how little they cost.  I just bought similar ones at sally for the same price and 1/4  of the volume!</li>
            <li> they are better than i thought it would be. They are pretty. They are somewhat good quality. Lots of them.</li>
            <li> Great great great, this was a great price for so many colors and shapes. CHEEKY is the best, will do businesses with the again.</li>
            <li> I recently decided to get back into the art of decorating my nails after a 5 year hiatus. These little gems arrived well put together in each individual little section and there are sooo many of them! I have had these for months now and I have decorated not only my fingernails and toes but, friends and family members have used them as well and I still have enough to last me for over a year. I love that there are not only multiple colors to choose from but, also multiple shapes and sizes. For the price of these little gems, you can not go wrong!!</li>
            <li> Words do not describe how much I love these jewels. I love that they are tiny, make it hard to knock them off during my daily routine. They look pretty and every manicure, and there are lots, so I can get very creative. I will definitely buy these again. They were worth the one month wait.</li>
            <li> Now I can bling my nails and make them sparkle and stand out in the crowd . I am lovin it</li>
            <li> Perfect choice for me b/c there is soooo much variety love it the design possiblities are endless you can be very creative with this set of jewels</li>
            <li> There is a very nice assortment of rhinestones but I wasn&#x27;t expecting the wheels themselves to be so tiny. They&#x27;re less than 3 inches in diameter. There are plenty rhinestones in each wheel, but I feel that the wheels could have a better design. Its difficult to get out the exact color you want because in the process of sliding open to the section you want, the stones get mixed around instead of being properly seperated and then you don&#x27;t know which color rhinestone you&#x27;re going to pick out. Another thing I didn&#x27;t like about this product is that they&#x27;re not actually \\&quot;rhinestones\\&quot; they&#x27;re more like colored drops of plastic on silver backgrounds, they don&#x27;t have that \\&quot;cut gem\\&quot; look so they&#x27;re not as sparkly but they still look alright.</li>
            <li> I was a little iffy about buying this because of other reviews saying that they didn&#x27;t get a lot of rhinestones, but luckily mine were completely full!  There are so many rhinestones and they&#x27;re beautiful. This is a great deal.  I still can&#x27;t believe nail salons charge you $1-$3 per rhinestone! That&#x27;s crazy.  I also received it 3 weeks before it was supposed to arrive. Great deal.  Definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> Bought it for its variety. Variety of colors for every nail design possible. Great quality of workmanship. Vibrant and radiant colors</li>
            <li> Lots of colors and shapes. Some of the gems were mixed but very happy with my purchase. Would buy again.. If I ever run out ;)</li>
            <li> I love these I use them almost every time I do my nails or scrapbook or anything crafty they are so pretty!</li>
            <li> Love my nail bling! I received the product well before expected and am happy with it! Thank you. Cheeky is awesome! I have a few other products I purchased from cheeky and will continue to purchase from them.</li>
            <li> kids love having finger and toes done came on time, enjoy using them all the time, totally rocks, people tell they love my nails</li>
            <li> These are great, the price was right and I always get compliments when I design my nails using them. I will order more next year.</li>
            <li> Wonderful price for sparkles to decorate fingers, toes or craft projects.  A bit hard to turn the top to get to the selections, so don&#x27;t love the packaging.</li>
            <li> I love these little nail gems.  They come in all different shapes and sizes (all small), but they fit perfectly on the nail for nail art.  I place them on my nails using a clear top coat as opposed to glue, because I don&#x27;t like to use too much acetone polish remover.  They do stay on quite a while and wear well, especially if you use a top coat on your nails after you place your gems.  I also use these for other craft projects as well, most with paper and metal using glue with these methods.&lt;br /&gt;If you are into nail art you will love these gems!</li>
            <li> This product came extra fast!  It is exactly as pictured. I love that the rhinestones are this size perfect for what I need to use it for.</li>
            <li> I agree this is probably great value but these little rhinestones really look cheap... to the point where I actually don&#x27;t want to use them at all. I tried them once and my nails came out looking horrible with them so now I find myself using other rhinestones. They are smaller than others, both rhinestones and rhinestone wheels.</li>
            <li> These are lovely and priced wonderfully! I absolutely adore using them for both my nails and different deco projects! So much fun!</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my wife as a gift. She paints her own nails between 1-3 times a week. She absolutely loves them. There are so many different kinds and tons of each kind. She is has used the gems multiple times. She did recently get some tweezers to apply them but before that she would use a toothpick with a small amount of clear coat applied to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She says she would recommend this to anyone who wants fancy looking nails that doesn&#x27;t want to pay outrageous prices at a nail salon.</li>
            <li> They are great for the price however when I put clear coat or gel over them they get all cloudy. Plus the design of the cases are not too great.The colors get all jumbled up. And I probably won&#x27;t use all of the colors. Also, the sizes of the rhinestones are not all the same: this makes for more interesting nail art designs however it does take some guess work when trying to get matching sizes and colors quickly to apply to nail glue. Overall, good buy for the price. Just wish that they were more shiny.</li>
            <li> I love this product as well as my customers. I would definitely buy this again. The quantity and quality is awesome!</li>
            <li> Keeping the pieces in their bins is challenging, especially if you live in a drier state where static electricity is abundant. That said, you will be hard pressed to find a better value. It&#x27;s worth the inconvenience.</li>
            <li> I bought these to do a sparkle gem encrusted mani and it&#x27;s well worth it. You get colored and \\&quot;diamond\\&quot; \\&quot;gems\\&quot; and get tons of them. Well worth the money as they come in wheels for storage. If your doing your own manis you won&#x27;t soon run out. If your doing business with them they are worth the investment and are sure to bring in tons of money and will bring a great return.</li>
            <li> Gift for Jordan and she loved them</li>
            <li> These were cheap and a good product! I think they are going to last me a long time. Glad they have a variety of colors, shapes, and sizes!</li>
            <li> wife love the size the shape the colors she is been using them with no problems she will defiantly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I received my gems within a few days.  The cost was extremely reasonable especially compared to other brands.  They come in easy to use container that prevents spillage of the different varieties of gems.</li>
            <li> I did not know when I was going to received my package. But it came at a reasonable time. And when i opened it I was instantly in Love! There are alot of gems and they are all different shapes and sizes. They are just BEAUTIFUL AND SHINY! AND SO MANY!</li>
            <li> I love it!!!! Its PERFECT!!! It came perfectly and it has all the products in it!!</li>
            <li> 5 wheels?!! Whoa, that is a good deal! I bought this years ago and am still no where near running out. They arrived perfectly and the wheels themselves are great. Love all the options and colors and the amount of clear ones!</li>
            <li> lots and lots of gems, some same colors but very good.  as described. prompt shipment, good packaging, no spills, no breaks.  overall, I&#x27;m really happy!!! already did a set of nails using clear top coat for adhesive, i see no clouding over or dullness so yeah me likey.</li>
            <li> I love all the differt shapes they&#x27;re fun and easy to apply to your nails!</li>
            <li> This is great quality for rhinestones. I love how much you receive for your money. The containers are smaller than expected but they still hold a lot of rhinestones, and are the perfect size for additions to your nail art collection. Rhinestones can be a bit fiddly to apply but they look great on. The containers have a twist top with a cut out which makes it easy to get the colour that you want from the containers. The only downside I have is that the first time i used one of the coloured stone wheels it would not twist, and the reason was there were rhinestones stuck in the side of the pot. It was very fiddly to fix (particularly with freshly painted nails!) and made a bit of a mess in doing so. Other than this though I am very pleased with these stones.</li>
            <li> Looks like there is a good variety of gems.  I love all the different colors and shapes.  They also seem to be the perfect size.</li>
            <li> I read the description thoroughly (it does not specify the size), and several reviews on this product before buying.  Because of the reviews, I was aware that they were very small rhinestones. But I opened these things up and good god, they really are TINY.  I had been to the craft store and looked at some different sizes in person.  I figured 2-3mm would be a good small size.  Nope...these are 1mm...maybe less?  Some of the assorted shape rhinestones are a little bigger, but the majority are super tiny circles.  Nothing can really prepare you for how incredibly small these are.  I plan to use them for crafting and jewelry purposes rather than for nail art, so it may be more difficult to work with than I expected.  As for the 7400 count...NO idea.  I&#x27;m definitely not going to try and count them.  There are a lot of rhinestones, but they are so small that you would never think it could be 7400 of them.  The quality is pretty much what you expect for buying cheap plastic rhinestones from China...better than something you&#x27;d get at the dollar store, but not as nice as what you might pay a lot more for at a craft store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as packaging goes- the 5 wheels were stacked together and sealed in a bag that was taped shut, it was well done and there was no damage or spillage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend them with a warning about how crazy tiny these are.  Perhaps they should mention the size in their product description and provide photo examples.</li>
            <li> came packaged perfectly, tons and tons of colors and shapes.  they are small but plentiful, can&#x27;t wait to use them for my mani-pedi.  highly recommend.  a great deal for the price.</li>
            <li> Witch that wasn&#x27;t a problem at all. In fact there was never a problem. I was totally in love with my item and it came real nice package. In other words no lose stones unless I dropped them without closing case lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend and will also purchase from buyer again. ;) thanks</li>
            <li> I Love the fact that you get so many for such a low price, however the rhinestones seem to be like plastic and don&#x27;t have that shine once you put clear polish on top of them, but I use them anyway because I spent my money on them.</li>
            <li> I ordered these nail gems and I was super disappointed. They are ridiculously small! I would not order these again. Again~ super disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have used a few on my nails but I use them mostly for decorating cards and scrapbooking. They look pretty good unless you look at them under a magnifying glass then you can see they are cheaply made. For what I use them for they work great though.</li>
            <li> So many pretties! If I use 10 of them once a week I will have enough to last me 14 years! Such a good deal!</li>
            <li> fast delivery love it</li>
            <li> This item shipped very quickly. Exactly what was represented in the pics . There are tons of them and they are all very pretty and sparkly</li>
            <li> So Im not sure if there is 7400 in this set but they are beautiful and unlike some of the other reviews mine didnt come all mixed together.</li>
            <li> These are ok for the price but constantly fall off the nail even after being glued on.  I would avoid these.</li>
            <li> i love these!  You get 10 circular containers with the jewels color organized!  They also give you shapes like hearts and flowers! I would definately recommend getting this product!</li>
            <li> THE RHINESTONES ARE GOING TO BE VERY TINY BUT THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED. IT WAS MORE THAN I THOUGHT BECAUSE THEY CAME WITH DIFFERENT DESIGNS ALSO. IN THE STORE YOU PAY ABOUT 1.00 FOR 20, SO THIS IS A GREAT DEAL. IF YOU DO YOU OWN NAILS, YOU WILL LOVE THESE.</li>
            <li> Not much that can go wrong with little rhinestones, right?  I like them, and I love the little wheel they came in (very convenient).</li>
            <li> This was a pretty good value fo what i paid for. It was packaged nice and neatly and I have yet to use them but there are so many to choose from I don&#x27;t know which ones I want to use first.</li>
            <li> Rhinestones are awesome come in many different colors and shapes. Giving as a christmas present. Quick shipment as well, everything you will need.</li>
            <li> blinging out my nails love love LOVE</li>
            <li> I just got mine today and I am very happy with my purchase. They were packaged properly and all were organized neatly in the wheels by color and design. There is such a large assortment to choose from and a large amount of rhinestones overall. Some other reviewers mentioned how small the wheels and stones are. These are small, but they are the exact same size as ones I&#x27;ve found at Sally&#x27;s or Wal-mart, and these have a TON more stones for the same price or less. Personally, I think they are the perfect size. If you&#x27;re looking for small rhinestones for nail art, and you want a good variety and good price, these are definitely the way to go. They ship from China and it takes a little while, but mine arrived weeks ahead of the scheduled date. Very satisfied with this purchase and seller. Highly recommend :)</li>
            <li> Bought to go alone with other nail things for my daughter for Christmas, she is very happy and is already using them on her friends as well :) Will be doing business again with seller. Thank you :)</li>
            <li> I forgot how much I purchased them for (under $5) which was a great price. However, when they came the wheels are actually really super small - not to mention that they don&#x27;t turn very well so you have to push it fairly hard which makes a lot of the jewels pop out of their tray. (At least my wheels were hard to turn)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, they come in a lot of cute colors and shapes. The rhinestones are really super small (ranging) and they are the perfect size for nail placement. Hope this helps! Bye nail lovers.</li>
            <li> I ordered these on Dec. 26 and got them in the mail on Dec. 28th. The estimated delivery date was not until Dec 31st so that was a very nice surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They came nicely packaged in a bubblewrap envelope and stacked and put tightly in a little bag to try to keep them from spilling. None of mine did. But the tops turn easily so I can see why some peole might have has an issue with that. But I think the seller did their best to keep them from spilling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are very tiny so if you want larger rhinestones these are not for you. However, I wanted the tiny ones so these are 100% perfect for me! So excited to try them out today!!!</li>
            <li> These are perfect. they arrived earlier than expected. everything was in its place it was neat when it arrived. i love it can&#x27;t wait to start using them</li>
            <li> This is beyond worth it! There are so many studs and choices you wont know where to begin! Unless you apply rhinestones EVERYDAY these will last a while! TOTALLY WORTH THE BUY!</li>
            <li> When this came in the mail it was very poorly packaged and they are smaller than a doorknob and the rhinestones inside were very small about the size of beads.I even got a whole wheel with all silver. There were different colors and shaped in the wrong compartment and the dividers don&#x27;t desperate them at all. They are wonderful for making small gem designs and flowers and maybe a small section of bling I really would not buy these again. Shipping was very fast it came a day before it was supposed to it came in about 2 days</li>
            <li> These rhinestone are in tiny little cases, but they are tiny little rhinestones - great for natural nails.  They accent, but don&#x27;t overtake your nail.</li>
            <li> Estas gemas vienen en diferentes tamaños, divinas, y muy fuertes se pegan a las uñas super bien, no tengo queja alguna</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive all 5 wheels, but I did get 3 and they are awesome! The shapes aren&#x27;t my favorite, but I&#x27;m sure someone will want them at some point.</li>
            <li> I really like these little gems! They are so pretty!! Some of the gems are miscut and mishapen, but I know these little small things can&#x27;t all be perfect! They are great additives make your mani and pedi&#x27;s so cute! I did my nails with my neice, and she loved them :)</li>
            <li> I am soooo satisfied with my rhinestone bundles. They are exactly what I was expecting and they look FABULOUS on my nails!!! Thanks Cheeky!!!</li>
            <li> I recieved these a Christmas gift and was totally thrilled. The five rhinestones wheels come exactly as shown in the picture- and are absolutely bursting with shiny gems! I used some clear coat to adhere them to my nails and then put several more layers over to set them. When thoroughly dried the gems did not chip off. They came off fairly easily with nail polish remover though. Now I can make salon grade manicures!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these nail decor items. I do my own nails &amp; am always looking for something new &amp; funky to do with them. Easy to use &amp; stays put (as long as you use a clear coat after applying). Would order again!!</li>
            <li> yes you get a lot for your $ but the quality is poor! they do not sparkle at all and are dull and awkward shapes.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this! Alot for my money&#x27;s worth and I won&#x27;t run out of jewels for a long time!</li>
            <li> 5 wheels + 7400 rhinestones &#x3D; 100% satisfaction. You pay the amount for 1 wheel in the store for the price of these 5. Incredible price for high quality stones. Multiple shapes and colors make this a one of a kind buy. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I love it I love it I love it I love it that is all I can say is that I love it</li>
            <li> These are a lot smaller than other rhinestone wheels I have purchased. Nevertheless, the description of this product is accurate. And as always on Amazon, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> What a great purchase! I have seen a small pack of rinestones in stores for upwards of $10.00, so this a GREAT deal! The assortment in this 5 pack is exceptional! I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> the product arrived sooner than I was expecting it. Happy with it im enjoying using them and learning nail design.</li>
            <li> These were delivered really quickly and they look great. They are actually small enough for nails, I got a wheel of all clear small round stones, a wheel of all clear shapes (tear drop, flowers hearts etc) a wheel of tiny varied colors rounds and a slightly bigger version of the multicolored rounds and a wheel of multicolored shapes. They all stayed put where they belong in the packaging as well.</li>
            <li> Very pretty and all so organized I love it!!</li>
            <li> Amazing Deal. These gems are a huge variety to add to my nail art collection.</li>
            <li> Omg! This was a great buy!  If u want bling, this is it. Easy to use. Great price! Love it!</li>
            <li> I cannot imagine when I will even use all of these up due to their bountiful nature. A great deal!</li>
            <li> I gave this package 5 stars because I received my package on time and I loved every single circle that contained all different kinds of nail gems.</li>
            <li> Really good product came complete</li>
            <li> What can I say? Its a ton of cute tiny rhinestones. Exactly what I was looking for. Package came wrapped nice and secure and all the little rhinestones stayed exactly where they were supposed to be. I love the packaging. Super convenient.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!! Many different colors and shapes to choose from. The wheels look small but they are packed with tons of little rhinestones. I LOOOOVE them!! Perfectly packaged too!!</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research when looking for rhinestones to buy online.  I read several horror stories about disappointed customers from other websites/sellers.  But after reading the reviews of Cheeky&#x27;s rhinestone wheels, I felt confident buying the 5 wheel set of nail rhinestones.  I was thrilled that the product was as described, shipped quickly, and securely.  Every tiny piece was in the section it belonged (none were spilled out like I read on other sellers review pages). The quality is excellent and I will definitely buy from them again!</li>
            <li> Great amount of decoration for your nails right at home!  They are easy to use and look really nice.  The wheels make it easy to keep them organized and in view.</li>
            <li> the order came in a on time. which was good. however the container was much smaller than what i expected. Moreover when i open the package i was disappointed. It was just stacked and put in a zipper bag. and the lids of each container wasn&#x27;t secure, so the rhinestones were mixed together and are everywhere within/out of the containers. When i look at the rhinestones, they are very small. I&#x27;m pretty sure they are 1mm, which is the smallest size for rhinestones(wish they could have mention it in the description and/or a chart of the actual size). And it&#x27;s not very good quality too. Just looking at them, they look without cut on the stone. just a smooth surface (like how they look like after you apply a topcoat, but in this case, they look like it without the topcoat) so it&#x27;s very... flat and cheap-looking(I mean, they ARE inexpensive, i just wish they don&#x27;t look so, at least not that obvious). I&#x27;m surprised by all these 4-5 stars comment. they seem reassuring when i was contemplating on them, not so much after i got the item.  will not buy again from this seller.</li>
            <li> I received this item today and I have to say I love love love the rhinestone wheels.  There is a great variety of color and shapes.  Whether there is as many as stated in the description...?  I don&#x27;t know but at this point not really caring since there seems to be a lot of them. The only down side is that most of them are quite small but the description does not say what sizes they are.  Overall I am very pleased with the purchase and with prime delivery, I received it very quickly.  I think I will have to look to order some larger stones but these will do for many options on the nails.  Hearts, flowers, teardrops, stars, diamonds and many round.  I think I read where someone said they didnt get black but I had 2 of the wheels that had black stones.  Would of given a 5 if there were some larger stones in one of the wheels.  Very pleased!!</li>
            <li> These are awesome. They are small enoyugh that you can put them on your body/face with eyelash glue without it looking weird (Halloween), and they also look great on nails. Such a steal!</li>
            <li> cute...for great looking nails...I change my nails @ least 2 time a month ...will recommend to family friends neighbors and others...thank you!</li>
            <li> They are just okay. But I love them none the less. Just that there were three wheels of small circles but if when you get them and compare the wheels well with the one I received there are not duplicate colors. I have small purple circles and small light purple circles, something like that. Or orange circles and gold circles. The two silver ones are not the same one is full of circles the other is full of diamonds, squares, stars ovals and so on.  I just have tons and tons of these wheels and they will be added to my special collection. The only reason why I&#x27;m not so super excited about them is that the only regret is I should have brought the ten pack instead. Why? Because I love them so much. But as Cheeky being my number one favorite name brand I won&#x27;t expect any less of their products.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with this item. The price was great. There are SO many rhinestones!! The only problem I have is when you turn the wheel, sometimes a few rhinestones will stick to the lid (maybe static??) and occasionally they will get transferred into another slot. Not a big deal, but I&#x27;m a little OCD when it comes to organization and it bothers me when they get mixed up. But the rhinestones themselves are wonderful, they last long too. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> For the price, the assortment was amazing compared to others. However, it was delivered with all the rhinestones mixed together in the compartments. One of the containers got jostled so badly that the rhinestones got stuck in the side area where the plastic wheel turns. The only way I could get to the rhinestones in that container was to break it and repackage the rhinestones into another container.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter. Tons of rhinestones for a great value!! The item purchased was received as described by the vendor.</li>
            <li> This pack is perfect..You get a combo of every color and shape possible..I so love it..Thank you so much and I will be buying from you again..Thank you cheeky for a great product..</li>
            <li> They look cheap compared to swarovsky stones, but what can I say.&lt;br /&gt;These cost nearly nothing compared to them.&lt;br /&gt;I gave all to a teenager.</li>
            <li> Which is okay, I thought 7400 was too good to be true. I rated this product a THREE because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I bought this when the price was 3.00 with 6.00 shipping so 9.00 isn&#x27;t bad for 490 rhinestones, really. It took approximately 4 weeks from where it shipped (Hong Kong) to here. I ordered dottting pens from somewhere else that got here in 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I haven&#x27;t used them yet, but I count a little over 40 in each 12-slot wheel of 5. Yes, I counted! SOME OF THE RHINESTONES WERE HALF BROKEN!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The rhinestones look like 1mm-tiny, but that&#x27;s what I wanted. I got 3 colored wheels (two round shaped, one different shapes) and two clear/silver wheels (one round shaped one different shapes). I am happy with the variety but I am unhappy with the quantity that they stated that I did not get and how there are some broken rhinestones. I honestly am unsure if I will buy from them again. Dishonesty (quantity and they shipped later then they said) is no bueno.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, thank you!</li>
            <li> Works great for nail art and its a wonderful deal getting that much for the price I did was amazing.</li>
            <li> I love the variety that I can choose from. I like all the different shapes and colors. I don&#x27;t have 20/20 vision so they are a little difficult to see, but they add such character to your nails when applied. I will order more of this product to gift to friends.</li>
            <li> I love doing my own nails and i love this great deal! It came a lil fast considering it came from far and it has so many options!! I love this every time i do my nails I always atleast use one or two and i still have like a million left! Totally recommendable.</li>
            <li> These were much smaller then we expected them to&lt;br /&gt;be, but they are definitely useable.  Lots of variety but the&lt;br /&gt;holes to get them out are a little small.</li>
            <li> Great Product. Best purchase ever. It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for. I totally recommend this item.  HIGH QUALITY AND GOOD PRICE!!!</li>
            <li> I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;IT HAS VERY LITTLE PRODUCT  EACH SECTION ONLY HAVE 75 RHINESTONES IN IT!!!!!!!!! AND SOME ONLY HAS 4O!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;i counted as i saw how empty the wheels looked and i thought it was very miss leading the  they should be up front with how many are in each wheel  i bought more and cheaper at the dollar store and Michael&#x27;s  also it was very plastic cheap looking when u put any glue or clear polish it drys up matte</li>
            <li> I am having a lot of fun with my rhinestones!  They came a lot sooner than I thought they would and they are so pretty.  There are so many shapes and colors that I can make all kinds of fun designs and show them off .  Everyone loves them and they compliment me on my nails all the time.  Thank you so much Cheeky and I love your products and prices.  I&#x27;ll be back for more!  8-)</li>
            <li> The packaging of this wasnt the business, at all.&lt;br /&gt;All the colors were mixed up with each other, and I can&#x27;t tell which size is which because it&#x27;s all mixed.&lt;br /&gt;However, it&#x27;s use comes in handy and adds a sparkle to any nail</li>
            <li> The picture deceives u. It&#x27;s really small. Save your money and don&#x27;t buy it. You will be upset and maybe even furious as I am. DONT BUY IT!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Just a little dull, but the packaging was great, every slot is packed FULL!  These are tiny things, but that&#x27;s what I wanted!</li>
            <li> My grand daughter is 14 and loves decorating her nails, this is perfect, it has different colors and different shapes.</li>
            <li> You call these rhinestones? It&#x27;s a joke the stones are so small you need a magnifying glass to pick them up and when put on nail can hardly see them, this is the way all the rhinestones are that I received, I can assure you I will never order any more of these</li>
            <li> i was very satisfied with this item, a little smaller than I imagined but the variety made up for it! the shipping was quick for it coming from overseas. overall, I would recommend it to others!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves doing her nails so we bought these jewels to go along with our other tools and paints. She loves the colors and variety. They look great and they were a great value. You get a lot for very few $$$$s</li>
            <li> This has a nice selection of colors, shapes and sizes. I&#x27;m very please with it and the price was right. They came nicely packaged and weren&#x27;t all mixed together like some others I&#x27;ve purchased</li>
            <li> Great for Birthday Sleepovers! And Salon partys...</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried them yet, but great colors</li>
            <li> I really like these little gems!i kinda wish they had a few more sizes but they still worked out really well!you will need some sort of tweezers to apply these little bad boys because there is no way you could do it with your fingers.</li>
            <li> These are a bit smaller than I had expected, but they are very nice. I love the various colors and look forward to all of the different designs I can create with them. Plus some of the shapes are ones I have not seen previously such as squares, flowers, triangles etc.</li>
            <li> Great jewels in a varity of colors</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE these little nail jewels - they are so cute &amp;&amp; pretty &amp;&amp; I&#x27;m so happy I decided to get them - highly recommend these for any girl who wants to doll up her nails :)</li>
            <li> Exactly pictured just smaller but haven&#x27;t even put a dent in them!</li>
            <li> Exceeded my expectations! This is for my granddaughter, who does nails better than most pros(she&#x27;s 12). I also got her the SHANY nail art set to go with it  I recommend this to anyone into pedi-manis!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best price for the amount of rhinestones you get. There is a large variety in colors as well as shapes. Some reviews said the cases arrived broken and the rhinestones were everywhere and it was just a big mess, this was not the case for me. They arrived very neatly packaged and no rhinestones were out of place. Another review I read said they aren&#x27;t cut/carved like a diamond would be, but they are round how they end up after putting a top coat over them. If they end up round after the top coat why does it matter if they&#x27;re round beforehand? Anyway, I was very pleased. Definitely worth the price. Especially since Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply will sell you one of these discs with only 10 rhinestones in each slot for the same price.</li>
            <li> No way to get all those beautiful crstals n colrs n shapes for this rice. Heck u can&#x27;t get these in ANY nail salon. Great product n great delivery.</li>
            <li> People giving poor reviews because &amp;#34;the gems are mixed up&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;it&#x27;s smaller than I expected, I assumed they were bigger.&amp;#34; Need to really think about what they are saying, they just got 5 wheels of pretty, decent quality nail gems. STOP being whiney little brats. It&#x27;s not hard to sort the gems and you should know that the case isn&#x27;t gonna be huge. You still got like, 7500 gems so get over it! if you want big perfectly sorted gems in a huge case GO BUY MORE EXPENSIVE GEMS! And stop assuming things that you can easily figure out by reading the description! You know what they say about assuming...&amp;#62;:/&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product if you want a lot of pretty gems for a low price, the look beautiful on your nails and you will get compliments on them.</li>
            <li> Some of the sizes and shapes are a bit too big for small nails (like mine).  But if you&#x27;re into big bling... these are plentiful and pretty enough!</li>
            <li> Decent price, quick shipping, my daughter loves them for her nails and I plan on using them for paper crafting too.</li>
            <li> Was everything I hoped for and for a great price!!!! Very good for nail art art and designs!! Would definitely recommend this item n seller!! Shipped in a timely fashion!!</li>
            <li> lots of colors and shapes love the selection, highly recommend to all buyers. shipping wasn&#x27;t bad either. If you like nail gems these are worth the price which is very affordable.</li>
            <li> I thought the stones would be a bit bigger.  They&#x27;re really, really small.  I guess I can still use them, but it&#x27;s just not what I thought it would be.  Very cheap looking.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to receiving these rhinestone wheels, but there seemed to have been a mix up from what I was informed. After several weeks of trying to locate my order, I was advised that I wouldn&#x27;t be receiving them. I was disappointed, but they did reimburse me my money.</li>
            <li> Everything is just like the description states.  I enjoy the different shades, shapes and the convenience of the product. I would order again.</li>
            <li> This item was extremely cheap, and worth every penny! I have used these every day and I love the containers the stones come in.</li>
            <li> ordered it nov 30th 2012 its now jan 1 2013 still didnt get it if i new it was going to take this long would of never ordered it ....WAY TO LONG OF A DILIVERY</li>
            <li> i order this product and they sent me the wrong something completely different. And when I called to inform them of their mistake they said they couldn&#x27;t do anything about it. So not only did I lose my money but also the product I wanted. they had poor customer service...be careful.</li>
            <li> I do a ton of nailart for fun and this is the ultimate bundle for an incredible price! Just tape the wheel top so they don&#x27;t accidentally turn and pour out! That&#x27;s my only complaint!&lt;br /&gt;Must-have if you like to do your nails!</li>
            <li> A lot of the colors were similar but a shade or two different, but they were pretty colors &amp; had a good variety of shapes. I look forward to using them more.</li>
            <li> The stones included are super cute! There are little stars, crescents, hearts - in a bunch of colors. As well as just your standard rhinestone, in many different colors.  Some of the  spaces in these wheels are mixed bc a different stone made its way in - but its not a big deal. They&#x27;re not all like this. Overall its great! In case it&#x27;s not listed, these stones are size 2mm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really impressed with the variety of the rhinestones, there&#x27;s so much to choose from. However, the thing I didn&#x27;t like was the packaging. The rhinestones are mixed up so it&#x27;s hard to twist the wheel because it&#x27;s trapped around the edges. Also the rhinestones in the picture look a little bigger than the ones I received.</li>
            <li> The cases that the gems come in are really really small, like two inches across, and the gems inside are pencil point size. Not the right size for the project I was working on but they probably work great for nails so I am &#x27;gifting&#x27; them to my daughter who is a nail art fiend. Also it took two and a half weeks to get these because they are coming from china.</li>
            <li> I order alot of nail art items and this one is just ok. My problem with this item is that usually you attach the stones with glue and with these stones when you add the glue it clouds the rhinestones seeing that they are made of plasic (I think). I would love to find a place where they sell glass rhinestones like the old days. Im on the fence with this one and will try to find another way to attach the stones.</li>
            <li> These nailart rhinestones are great!  You get one wheel of all small clear stones, 2 wheels of small colored stones, one wheel of clear shaped stones, and one wheel of colored shaped stones.  I&#x27;ve had a lot of fun creating endless designs and patterns with these!</li>
            <li> it came very fast all the jewels are beautiful. it came very secure and when i opened the package it even had a thank you note. that was thoughtful.</li>
            <li> i get to play with my nails an dtry to do different things with it. its had lots of nail art</li>
            <li> There are a lot of colors and shapes to choose from.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to add a little sparkle to their nails</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just recently started doing my own nails after 17 years of going to the salon. I decided to give the Rhinestone nail art a try. This is a very good product, in my opinion. There are TONS of super tiny stones. I didn&#x27;t even try to count how many - there are 5 wheels with 12 spots of stones, so way too many for me to count. It&#x27;s definitely worth the money I paid for it for sure. The stones a teeny tiny so you&#x27;ll definitely need tweezers to apply with. I bought a set of 3 tweezers from Amazon that are straight, slanted and curved and they are awesome!&lt;br /&gt;Worth the money, FAST shipper too!</li>
            <li> I love the actual rhinestones. However, i&#x27;m not a fan of the little wheel in which they came in. Once you start turning the wheel the rhinestones start to mix. A little frustrating. Other than that, there were so many in different shapes and colors! They arrived when expected and came all together in a bag. Not bad.</li>
            <li> she is a happy lady now</li>
            <li> Love the rhinestones. Don&#x27;t like the wheels, it is very hard to turn the wheels to get to the rhinestones.</li>
            <li> I had to wait a long time but i got a ton of rhinestones enough for a super long time. well worth the wait for the price</li>
            <li> I still haven&#x27;t decided if I like it or not because first of all, it&#x27;s a lot of stones, very nice shapes, nice colors, so many different colors, but I got used to bigger rhinestones earlier and I would have expected these to be a little bigger than they actually are.. They have a lot of varieties, and it contains bigger ones too, but the majority is very small...&lt;br /&gt;It looks good on nails though...</li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t opened these yet, but they look great.  I will order more for sure...just what we wanted to have the glitzy look.</li>
            <li> This was an amazing buy! I love for my nails to bling! This is the best way to do it. So many shapes, sizes, and colors! I love the colors! More than enough for my money!</li>
            <li> I got these 5 days late. The wheels they came in were very low quality, and one of them is broken. You get exactly whats in the picture. I wanted smaller ones, and the roll of siler circles are all the exact same size.</li>
            <li> But I can&#x27;t really afford diamonds so this will have to do for a while. Amazing selection. I loved the colors and the shape. The wheels are on the small size but the color selection is just phenomenal. I also liked the actual size of the stone themselves. I like mine a bit on the smaller size.</li>
            <li> These are amazing, once I got them I used them right away! They stayed on very nicely and last for about a week without one falling off. I recommend these products considering to buy one nail art decoration at the store is about the same as this whole set!</li>
            <li> The wheels were smaller than expected but there is plenty of the rhinestones for more than one application. The rhinestones were the correct size for nail decoration. Great price!</li>
            <li> I love this set. The variety I received was wonderful. I am a first time at doing my own nail designs but these are easy to include in the design. Make sure you use tweezers or a nail brush to apply them. They are small and can be dropped easily but they give you so many of each kind that you probably wouldn&#x27;t care. I didn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> Good Price, not amazing quality, but not poor quality. Would buy again. :). . . . . . . .</li>
            <li> This is a very simple product to give a touch of glam to manicure!!! I loved and got funny whit it.</li>
            <li> Then these are perfect. I had expected them to be bigger, and was quite disappointed that they were so small. I will still use them, as I wanted them, but most of them are under 1mm. I have larger hands so it will take more to cover my nails. They are a great size for my 11 year old though. They are quite pretty, came packaged well, even if they are in a zip bag, and there are tons of them. Just wish they had been larger stones.</li>
            <li> Arrived quick and in perfect condition. They stay in their containers and are best applied with topcoat and tweezers. Perfect accents for any nails! College friends love my nail decorating habits! Great for beginners and experienced cosmetologists.</li>
            <li> The product is almost what I expected I wanted small rhinestones,  but not quite that small.  However I do use them all the time.  I just wish that they would put the sizes in the description.</li>
            <li> Love the shapes that come with it and the colors are beautiful only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that I thought they were much bigger, well at least the tins that held them.</li>
            <li> This was a GREAT investment.  The different colors, shapes and sizes for the price along with the quantity is great</li>
            <li> Huge amount of stones with a large variety of colors and shapes. Compliments every time I use them in a nailart design</li>
            <li> these are wonderful, just as the pictures, lovely colours. Great Deal</li>
            <li> Great gift for a young woman.</li>
            <li> These gems are super tiny, they are good for small detailed nail art. They aren&#x27;t super shiny, the colored ones, so they look a little dull. The gems get stuck in the wheel and make it difficult to open. I am afraid that they will spill everywhere if I turn to hard. I don&#x27;t want to mix them either. For the price they are a steal.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal for nail rhinestones.  I bought a small pack from Sally&#x27;s beauty supply and paid $12 for a fraction of the amount.  I don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money for nail stones when they fall off anyway.  All this stuff is made in China for super cheap so why pay more than you have to.</li>
            <li> Love the gems...some of them aren&#x27;t has shiny as others but they still look beautiful when you apply them!!!!</li>
            <li> i like my purchase the stones just seem smaller than average for nail designs but i&#x27;m overall happy with it</li>
            <li> This product is great! Be sure to check if the size of rhinestones will work for you. I expected these to be big enough for pedicures, but they are definetly for manicures only because they are very small. Otherwise love them!</li>
            <li> Got my order today in the mail and a lot of the crystals are mixed up..I was worried cause I did read other reviews that said the same thing happened to them</li>
            <li> Got these for my sister who uses these for her own Natural Nails. These stay all week long with no issues. She loves them and makes amazing Nail Ar.</li>
            <li> its the same product they use in the nail salons.. i really like the colors and shapes. love it thank you</li>
            <li> They are smaller than I would have expected, but plenty of rhinestones so no worries. Love all the designs (one wheel of clear circles, one of clear shapes, two of colored shapes, and one of colored circles). One of the triangles is full of what looks like green livers, can anyone tell me what they are supposed to be? They seem a little wonky to be half hearts. It&#x27;s really kind of funny.</li>
            <li> This was part of the 3 nail things my Granddaughter had on her birthday wish list. This came right away, was what she wanted, was what it said it was and so all&#x27;s well with her....and me.</li>
            <li> These rhinestones are great if your just starting a collection or something. i really like these. they are a little smaller than what i was expecting but they are still great and im still gunna use each and every one (:</li>
            <li> For those who like to change up their nails this will be a good product for you also the stones come in different shapes sizes and colors. You can definitely have fun creating a new design for your nails.</li>
            <li> AWESOME!&lt;br /&gt;These are AMAZING! and the price was amazing! Could not reccomend more highly!!!!&lt;br /&gt;It got to me within about a week and a half which is impressive considering it came from china!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;5 STARS FOR SURE! :)&lt;br /&gt;Very HAppy</li>
            <li> This was a good set at a good price. I like them a lot and use them for my pedicures :]</li>
            <li> I use these all of the time, and it doesn&#x27;t look like I will ever run out of rhinestones! These are great as accents on almost any nail design. I would recommend this set to any nail art enthusiast!</li>
            <li> I used these for my Mardi Gra Makeup!!  Go on youtube.  Type in Glitter Eyeshadow or Rhinestone makeup.  Great tips and very cool ideas.  If your going to a Party or just for fun.  Use these Rhinestones for your Eyes and use Eyelash Adhesive to glue them to your face or eyes....very fun and pretty.  Have fun!!</li>
            <li> I received this item on time and it was exactly as described and exactly what I was expecting. A huge variety of rhinestones in all different shapes, sizes, and colors. Each wheel is filled to the brim with rhinestones. The packaging was perfect. They arrived in a padded envelope and the 5 wheels were stacked on top of eachother enclosed in a ziploc bag. I&#x27;m so glad that I ordered this in lieu of some of the negative reviews, as this was a really good buy! I would definitely order from this seller again. (I posted a customer image of what they looked like when I took them out of the packaging.)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these stones and the other designs by Cheeky...it comes in great packaging and although the wheels are kind of small there are enough pieces in each section for you to be able to do multiple sets of nails...I am so excited about my purchase and will definitely continue to order from this company...the shipment came much quicker than expected...extremely happy and going back for more...</li>
            <li> i was shocked and pleasantly surprised at the quality and selection of these wheels. you get what is shown and plenty of it! the wheels are packed with the product unlike wheels i have purchased in the past at beauty supply stores. cheeky is the main seller i will purchase from in the future because they have blown me away with their great prices, selection, and fantastic quality.&lt;br /&gt;i made a large order with cheeky and everything was packaged fantastically and it was delivery before expected! i love cheeky and have referred clients and all my friends on facebook and instagram to cheeky.</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with my purchase. It came exactly as it is shown. All the pieces are there. Brand new. I have been constantly using them. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Well pakaged came on time with great selection</li>
            <li> Love the fact that there are so many and in different shapes, too.  There are two wheels with the different shapes; one is in different colors and the other in rhinestones, which is perfect for me since I want something different every time I do my own nails.  There is also one wheel with all round rhinestones; the rest are colored and all of the wheels are completely full.  I am so glad I invested in these because they could not be more perfect for me.</li>
            <li> The rhinestones are beautiful but the entire package was smaller than expected. This makes the rhinestones harder to put on, but they look great and stay on when they are. Also, topcoat cannot be put on over the rhinestones or they will lose that signature rhinestone finish.</li>
            <li> These were a Christmas gift for my aunt. She loves doing nails and all that so I figured it would be perfect and she uses them all the time.</li>
