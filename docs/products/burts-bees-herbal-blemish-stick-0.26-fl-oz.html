    <ol>
            <li>excellent product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually very happy with Burt&#x27;s Bees products and I use tea tree oil all the time to keep my nose piercing from getting infected</li>
            <li>This is awesome stuff!</li>
            <li>and it works great.</li>
            <li>Burts Bees is a great product.</li>
            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very effective.</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees is always awesome :)</li>
            <li>I have been using this burts bees item for years and have always loved the results.</li>
            <li>Best use is to spot treat acne and lightly hit acne prone areas before they break out.</li>
            <li>Great product for acne problems, not to strong</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>so I guess that&#x27;s kind of nice.</li>
            <li>Easy to carry around and good results.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Burt&#x27;s Bees Herbal Blemish Stick.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>how many times I used it</li>
            <li>Maybe 10 or more times.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m SO GLAD</li>
            <li>This product works incredibly well for me, someone with clear, normal-oily skin and infrequent blemishes.</li>
            <li>Great natural product!</li>
            <li>(And cheaper than buying Tea Tree Essential Oils, lol...)</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s worth the spend!</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and soft, and as close to perfect as it could possibly be.</li>
            <li>so I thought this was a pretty safe bet</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be truthful, when I first used the product</li>
            <li>It works great to dry up blemishes without overdrying the skin around it.</li>
            <li>I was right!</li>
            <li>Like many girls my age, we&#x27;re always looking for that product that will clear our skin.</li>
            <li>But I said let me give it a try, because like other products it may cause dryness first then you&#x27;ll see good results.</li>
            <li>Blemishes seem to clear faster, but they certainly feel better immediately.</li>
            <li>Use at first appearance of pimple twice a day</li>
            <li>REALLY works!</li>
            <li>I figured it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Works much better for me than traditional blemish medications...</li>
            <li>It truly helps get rid of blemishes quickly and naturally.</li>
            <li>This product was absolutely horrendous.</li>
            <li>Now my skin is not the Perfect skin, BUT I never got any crazy breakout.</li>
            <li>It smelled like some rancid mix between tea tree oil and black licorice that honestly burned my nostrils whenever I applied it anywhere near my nose, I even had to stop applying it at night because the smell would keep me awake and make me nauseous.</li>
            <li>Apply to clean, dry skin to avoid some of the adverse effects mentioned in other reviews, and don&#x27;t expect this to work for more chronic acne; it&#x27;s designed as a spot treatment.</li>
            <li>The smell is a little strong at first</li>
            <li>For someone who has very sensitive skin, this product worked over night.</li>
            <li>Upon closer examination of the bottle I discovered that instead of a clear liquid it started with, it got cloudy and had stuff floating in there!</li>
            <li>I tried it for over a month with the other products in the line following directions, but I was breaking out more than when I started.  </li>
            <li>The tea tree and other goodness keeps the zit clean and protected, as well as delivering the medicine I need.</li>
            <li>This product does not dry my skin out, unless I use way too much.</li>
            <li>You can clearly see the results.</li>
            <li>with a dermatologist to clear up this mess.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The clear areas where it is applied DO NOT break out.</li>
            <li>I have tried just about everything it seems, from chemicals made in a lab to natural home remedies, like egg yolk.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 23 yr old girl.</li>
            <li>So I decided to purchase this product being that it&#x27;s natural &amp; uses organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>but I was starting to break out more than usual</li>
            <li>but this was on a whole other level.</li>
            <li>Only product I can use on my oily, dry, very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>For this price, the fact that it is all natural, and that it works, I will be buying this product for a long time!</li>
            <li>After some time, the smell is not so bad and is actually somewhat pleasant.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I read the reviews from Amazon before I made purchase. Some people claimed that the redness has faded and the acne reduced in size after usage. However, I do not see such effect on my face with acne. When I rolled it on my cheeks where those acne are, it irritated my eyes badly. It&#x27;s so similar to irritation caused by onions when cutting onions.</li>
            <li> I have been using this burts bees item for years and have always loved the results. It truly helps get rid of blemishes quickly and naturally. One tube lasts for a while so it&#x27;s worth the spend!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. For someone who has very sensitive skin, this product worked over night. I applied this at night over my night cream and in the morning pimples were smaller. Over a few days pimples were gone. Use at first appearance of pimple twice a day and it works great. Morning wash and evening wash. The smell is a little strong at first but you get used to it. Burts Bees is a great product. Only product I can use on my oily, dry, very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I started using this product for some minor blemishes, but instead within a week I had breakouts all over. Upon closer examination of the bottle I discovered that instead of a clear liquid it started with, it got cloudy and had stuff floating in there! Looks like some bacteria got introduced into the container and grew in there. Not surprising because the applicator comes directly in contact with the problem skin areas. So instead of clearing up my blemishes it was spreading them around! Awful container for such a product. Worst blemish product I ever tried. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Burt&#x27;s Bees Herbal Blemish Stick. I have been battling acne for over a decade now and nothing works as well as this products. I have tried just about everything it seems, from chemicals made in a lab to natural home remedies, like egg yolk. I can feel it working immediately and I see improvement in my skin the next day! My skin is smooth and soft, and as close to perfect as it could possibly be. This product does not dry my skin out, unless I use way too much. That is a definite plus! The only real complaint that I have is the smell. Upon application, you are hit with an extreme and harsh smell that I just cannot describe. After some time, the smell is not so bad and is actually somewhat pleasant. I would not even call this a complaint, it is just me being nit-picky. For this price, the fact that it is all natural, and that it works, I will be buying this product for a long time! Thank you, Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li> One of the few products that gives immediate results by drying the blemish while cleansing the skin. Blemishes seem to clear faster, but they certainly feel better immediately.</li>
            <li> rids my nasty blemishes in 1-2 days after applying morning and night. REALLY works! excellent product. It smells identical to black licorice, so haters beware.</li>
            <li> Great natural product! I like using Burt&#x27;s Bees and this is one of my favorites. It works great to dry up blemishes without overdrying the skin around it.</li>
            <li> works well......but the aroma!!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. And, for me, the smell is not a bother.  The blemish stick not only works well to get rid of emerging and existing pimples, but I can take it on a road trip and use it as an emergency antiseptic.  It stings a little, but if you left your neosporin at home this little vial, with it&#x27;s tea tree oil delight, will kill off the nasties and heal you up. The secret ingredient might just be unicorns.</li>
            <li> This product was absolutely horrendous. I&#x27;m usually very happy with Burt&#x27;s Bees products and I use tea tree oil all the time to keep my nose piercing from getting infected so I thought this was a pretty safe bet but I couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong. I applied it generously, multiple times each day with no results for about a month before I gave up. I know it can take time to see results but I was starting to break out more than usual so I just stopped. The worst part however was the absolutely God awful smell. Like I said, I use tea tree oil all the time and it has actually grown on me but this was on a whole other level. It smelled like some rancid mix between tea tree oil and black licorice that honestly burned my nostrils whenever I applied it anywhere near my nose, I even had to stop applying it at night because the smell would keep me awake and make me nauseous. The one sort of upside to this is that despite being a total failure it didn&#x27;t dry my skin out no matter how many times I used it so I guess that&#x27;s kind of nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years. Tea tree is not for everyone. Some hate the smell. Some get no or bad results. For me it works. When I&#x27;ve got a breakout threatening I roll this stuff on multiple times through out the day. Maybe 10 or more times. The tea tree and other goodness keeps the zit clean and protected, as well as delivering the medicine I need. The usual chemical creams just clog everything up and irritates my skin. I always recommend this product. Easy to carry around and good results.</li>
            <li> I had to use it constantly in order to produce results. It did reduce my blemish. It dried it out but not overally much. You have to be committed to using it for the duration of your blemish.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this made me break out.  I tried it for over a month with the other products in the line following directions, but I was breaking out more than when I started.  I used this products on problem areas and it seemed it irritate them.</li>
            <li> Got this because I heard that Tea Tree Oil will get rid those pesky pimples. When I found this Burt&#x27;s Bees Herbal Blemish Stick with Tea Tree Leaf Oil I figured it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for. I was right! This is awesome stuff! (And cheaper than buying Tea Tree Essential Oils, lol...) Burt&#x27;s Bees is always awesome :)</li>
            <li> Great product for acne problems, not to strong so it doesn&#x27;t dries my skin.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Works much better for me than traditional blemish medications...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it previously. You can clearly see the results. It&#x27;s very effective. I will continue to use this product regularly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 23 yr old girl. Like many girls my age, we&#x27;re always looking for that product that will clear our skin. Now my skin is not the Perfect skin, BUT I never got any crazy breakout. So I decided to purchase this product being that it&#x27;s natural &amp; uses organic ingredients. 2-3 weeks of using it, I got horrible, rash-like looking pimple. It was all over my chin, my jaw area. I got so CRAZY trying to figure out where I got this rash, small pimples from. I was so insecure. Until I realized that it&#x27;s because of this product, I got the horrible, dry pimples all over the area where I ONLY used the roller/stick.&lt;br /&gt;To be truthful, when I first used the product I was a little suspicious due to the smell &amp; instant dryness it causes to the skin. But I said let me give it a try, because like other products it may cause dryness first then you&#x27;ll see good results. I was so disappointed. But I&#x27;m SO GLAD I know where my rash pimples came from &amp; i booked an appt. with a dermatologist to clear up this mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE BE CAREFUL !</li>
            <li> This product works incredibly well for me, someone with clear, normal-oily skin and infrequent blemishes. When I do get them, they are persistent and slow to heal, and with twice to 3x daily applications this product has worked faster than any other natural remedy I&#x27;ve tried. Apply to clean, dry skin to avoid some of the adverse effects mentioned in other reviews, and don&#x27;t expect this to work for more chronic acne; it&#x27;s designed as a spot treatment. Looks to last a while, too - I&#x27;ve applied it about 12 times so far and the liquid level in the bottle is down only about half a centimeter. A+ for this stuff.</li>
            <li> Clears almost everything in 1-2 days. The clear areas where it is applied DO NOT break out. Best use is to spot treat acne and lightly hit acne prone areas before they break out.</li>
    </ol>
