            <li>Not your best work.  </li>
            <li>Excellent liner.</li>
            <li>I spend a ton on trying to find it, and this... is great!</li>
            <li>this is the best brand of eyeliner ever.</li>
            <li>Best eyeliner ever.</li>
            <li>For now I&#x27;m very happy with this one.</li>
            <li>Really good but not as waterproof as I would like!!!</li>
            <li>I really loved this eye liner it went on perfectly</li>
            <li>how happy I am with this product.</li>
            <li>or, as my mom likes to say, raccoon eyes :P it is perfect for smudging, and the tool on the other end works perfectly for this purpose.</li>
            <li>having said that, i think this probably isn&#x27;t the best eyeliner if you are wanting something precise, like a cat eye, and i may not even recommend it for the top lid at all</li>
            <li>Is it still as flawless at the end of the day as when first applied?  </li>
            <li>No, but I&#x27;d love to find the eye pencil that does that!  </li>
            <li>I will post more soon once I go swimming with it on, and I will go underwater!</li>
            <li>It would have been nice if this came with a pencil sharpener.</li>
            <li>In addition to being very easy to apply, the waterproof factor is pretty good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;$20 is a lot for a pencil, but i am more than satisfied with the product and would probably pay even more.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a nice texture and smooth application.</li>

            <li>I find that of the daily wear eyeliners I&#x27;ve tried, this has the best staying power yet.  </li>
            <li>I am going to put it in the freezer and see how much more manageable the placement of the line will be.  </li>
            <li>Great eyeliner , my fav so far!</li>
            <li>Goes on so smooth, I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>I love how it glides on smooth and will not tug on your eyelid.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to manipulate when putting on, but then stays on all day/night.</li>
            <li>blends so easily.</li>
            <li>this pencil is best (in my opinion/experience) for those looking for a thicker, less precise line of long-lasting, saturated color.</li>
            <li>Tried it today for the 1st time, it is a bit softer in consistency than what I was hoping for but is does go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>rarely (if ever!)</li>
            <li>Gorgeous, deeply pigmented, goes on smoothly and does not smear.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best eyeliner I have ever used, and it actually is water proof.</li>
            <li>So I have tried many waterproof eye liners, this one is by far is my favorite,  </li>
            <li>This is a great black eyeliner and it stays put all day.  </li>
            <li>REALLY!?!</li>
            <li>and my daughter was very much in like with it also</li>
            <li>knows how many different brands/pencils/eyeliner products in a year -</li>
            <li>For the first time, my eyeliner stays put the way its supposed to.</li>
            <li>Very similar to Narrs, but I like this better.</li>
            <li>It stays in place pretty well all day.</li>
            <li>Great product as well as it came earlier than expected.</li>
            <li>i bought this particular brand/formula for the first time three or four years ago and will never purchase another brand, assuming it isn&#x27;t discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>using the whole thing.</li>
            <li>i rarely reapply, unless i&#x27;ve itched my eye and smudged it near the tear</li>
            <li>Mission accomplished.</li>
            <li>And the black isn&#x27;t all that intense against my lovely brown skin.</li>
            <li>i have &#x27;normal&#x27; skin though, so</li>
            <li>On second thought... this IS an effective pencil for the winter, but my city&#x27;s summer humidity wrestled this liner down to the ground!</li>
            <li>i usually end up applying more, lol.&lt;br</li>
            <li>much to my mother&#x27;s chagrin, i have worn black eyeliner pretty much every day of my life since i was about 16 years old.</li>
            <li>So far every time I sharpen this the tip breaks off</li>
            <li>The pencil is semi soft and the product glides on to the eyes well.</li>
            <li>This eye liner goes on nicely (better than Urban Decay) but it smears within a few hours.</li>
            <li>not sure how it would hold up on &#x27;oily&#x27; skin - probably not as well, just like most other cosmetic products.</li>
            <li>, if that) pencils a year... but to be honest i&#x27;m not sure because i usually buy it not on amazon.</li>
            <li>&quot; does NOT mean \\&quot;oil proof!\\&quot;  If the skin around your eyes is oily (and oily is by far preferable to dry), the BADgal liner is just another black pencil.  </li>
            <li>the color black is a bit too much, and the price of it is a little bit too high.</li>

            <li> much to my mother&#x27;s chagrin, i have worn black eyeliner pretty much every day of my life since i was about 16 years old. in the 10 years before using Benefit eyeliner, i never settled on one product and would go through god knows how many different brands/pencils/eyeliner products in a year - rarely (if ever!) using the whole thing. i bought this particular brand/formula for the first time three or four years ago and will never purchase another brand, assuming it isn&#x27;t discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;even though I&#x27;ve been using eyeliner for (umm) 13+ years, i am not super-skilled at application, so take what i am saying with a grain of salt. i am NOT a professional in any manner - just a random consumer. having said that, i think this probably isn&#x27;t the best eyeliner if you are wanting something precise, like a cat eye, and i may not even recommend it for the top lid at all - i use it only under my waterline. this pencil is best (in my opinion/experience) for those looking for a thicker, less precise line of long-lasting, saturated color. or, as my mom likes to say, raccoon eyes :P it is perfect for smudging, and the tool on the other end works perfectly for this purpose. after applying the liner, you have like 5-10 seconds before it &#x27;dries&#x27; to smudge it. you can still do it after it&#x27;s dried, but it tugs at your under eye skin. i usually end up applying more, lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;through the years i have gone through hundreds of eyeliners, liquid, pencil, marker-ish, you name it- NOTHING has lasted as long as this eyeliner. i have &#x27;normal&#x27; skin though, so not sure how it would hold up on &#x27;oily&#x27; skin - probably not as well, just like most other cosmetic products. i rarely reapply, unless i&#x27;ve itched my eye and smudged it near the tear duct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as mentioned, i use this basically every day, and probably go through 1.5 (ETA to change from 2.5 per year to about 1.5, if that) pencils a year... but to be honest i&#x27;m not sure because i usually buy it not on amazon. next time i purchase it i&#x27;ll try to remember to update this review with how long one pencil lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$20 is a lot for a pencil, but i am more than satisfied with the product and would probably pay even more. photo is of after 13 hours of wear at school (not the gym, outside, etc)urchase it i&#x27;ll try to remember to update this review with how long one pencil lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$20 is a lot for a pencil, but i am more than satisfied with the product and would probably pay even more. photo is of after 13 hours of wear at school (not the gym, outside, etc)</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;ve finally learned my lesson.  All the glowing recommendations in the world won&#x27;t replace the fact that you need to try products out in a brick and mortar before getting fooled by hype.  \\&quot;Waterproof\\&quot; does NOT mean \\&quot;oil proof!\\&quot;  If the skin around your eyes is oily (and oily is by far preferable to dry), the BADgal liner is just another black pencil.  It&#x27;s out of my cosmetics bag and into the reject pile for this one.  NO STAYING POWER.  And the black isn&#x27;t all that intense against my lovely brown skin. Benefit, if you&#x27;re going for a velvety-deep black, then go for it!  Not your best work.  So disappointed!  On second thought... this IS an effective pencil for the winter, but my city&#x27;s summer humidity wrestled this liner down to the ground!</li>
            <li> the color black is a bit too much, and the price of it is a little bit too high. Recommend to buy some other brands may be cheaper.</li>
            <li> I was searching for an eyeliner that wouldn&#x27;t come off or smudge or make my eyes water because of my contacts. The search is over. This is a great black eyeliner and it stays put all day.  Mission accomplished.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous, deeply pigmented, goes on smoothly and does not smear. I had been searching for a long-lasting eyeliner and this is it!</li>
            <li> I used loreal eye liner and it always gave me racoon eyes.  Drove me crazy.  For the first time, my eyeliner stays put the way its supposed to.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best eyeliner I have ever used, and it actually is water proof. Goes on so smooth, I absolutely love it.  It&#x27;s the only eyeliner I will buy now.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how to put into words how happy I am with this product. It&#x27;s easy to manipulate when putting on, but then stays on all day/night. It&#x27;s a nice texture and smooth application.</li>
            <li> I really loved this eye liner it went on perfectly and my daughter was very much in like with it also</li>
            <li> not great. As soon as you have to sharpen it, the pencil is done. It is extremely hard to sharpen since it keeps breaking. Not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> Excellent liner. Been using it for years now. Doesn&#x27;t smudge at all and never have to re touch all day</li>
            <li> I have a hell of a time finding eyeliner that lasts most of the day without smudging. I spend a ton on trying to find it, and this... is great! I&#x27;ll buy this again. Very similar to Narrs, but I like this better.</li>
            <li> REALLY!?! $29.95 for the \\&quot;espresso\\&quot; color pencil but the black pencil is $16.95 and then you&#x27;ll add shipping and tax.  WTF!  OR I could drive over to Macys and get the espresso pencil for $20.00.  Hopefully, no one will be stupid enough to think this is in any way a reasonable purchase.</li>
            <li> this is the best brand of eyeliner ever. i can&#x27;t believe anything else even sells. it&#x27;s thick and creamy. waterproof. blends so easily.</li>
            <li> Great eyeliner , my fav so far!</li>
            <li> It would have been nice if this came with a pencil sharpener. I can&#x27;t seem to find one that works well with this. So far every time I sharpen this the tip breaks off and I can never get a sturdy point.</li>
            <li> I like this- but im looking for something that lasts all day- this needs to be reapplied- however i like the color.</li>
            <li> Commodity not good is not working well</li>
            <li> Best eyeliner ever. Will never use another!</li>
            <li> This eye liner goes on nicely (better than Urban Decay) but it smears within a few hours. disappointing for this price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a competitive dancer, so I practice (and sweat) a lot. I find that of the daily wear eyeliners I&#x27;ve tried, this has the best staying power yet.  Is it still as flawless at the end of the day as when first applied?  No, but I&#x27;d love to find the eye pencil that does that!  For now I&#x27;m very happy with this one.</li>
            <li> Tried it today for the 1st time, it is a bit softer in consistency than what I was hoping for but is does go on smoothly. I am going to put it in the freezer and see how much more manageable the placement of the line will be.  I will post more soon once I go swimming with it on, and I will go underwater!</li>
            <li> Great product as well as it came earlier than expected. Def give 5 stars</li>
            <li> Really good but not as waterproof as I would like!!! Still, it lasts a while and is really BLACK! The pencil is semi soft and the product glides on to the eyes well.</li>
            <li> So I have tried many waterproof eye liners, this one is by far is my favorite,  I love how it glides on smooth and will not tug on your eyelid. In addition to being very easy to apply, the waterproof factor is pretty good.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an eyeliner that could be smudged to give the smokey eye appearance. This product does just that. It stays in place pretty well all day. I am lazy about taking off makeup at night (I only wear eyeliner about 5 times a month) and in the morning I get the raccoon eyes.. but that is to be expected. I would not want to put something on that would take harsh chemicals to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again.</li>
