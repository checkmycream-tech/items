    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>color turned out perfect magenta and stayed in my hair for over three months before I decided to change style.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s awesome and though it fades, if you bleach your hair before dying it</li>
            <li>Truly a great product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used SFX for years and it continues to remain the best vegetable-based dye out there.</li>
            <li>their dye has been discontinued because it is the best quality for alternative color hair dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This color is beautiful!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, these dyes are awesome</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, these dyes are awesome</li>
            <li>LOVE!!!!</li>
            <li>VERY bright and holds well on bleached hair.</li>
            <li>Gorgeous color!</li>
            <li>, color aside, this is the best brightly colored hair dye that I have used.  </li>
            <li>On my unbleached brown hair, it turned my hair a beautiful purple color.</li>
            <li>Just absolutley beautiful.</li>
            <li>It looks so amazingly beautiful.</li>
            <li>Simply beautiful.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve always had great results.</li>
            <li>Great color.</li>
            <li>Great product</li>
            <li>The dyes are great for mixing and creating custom colors.  </li>
            <li>Special Effects just might be the best semi-permanent dye on the market and Virgin Rose is just beautiful.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a bright colored purple, like the color shown in the picture.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, really good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone looking for a gorgeous pinky color.</li>
            <li>and I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>a bright magenta meets purple kind of a color.</li>
            <li>dye is very potent and will stain *</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this color!</li>
            <li>and it is still super bright!</li>
            <li>Your hair will look amazing.  </li>
            <li>While I would not recommend the product, I would absolutely recommend doing business with PLG as their customer service is excellent.</li>
            <li>specifically Virgin Rose -</li>
            <li>Everything you own will be this color.</li>
            <li>Kind of a magenta.</li>
            <li>The colour is so vibrant and looks awesome in the sun!</li>
            <li>The color is very bright when it comes on at first.</li>
            <li>This time I bought Virgin Rose, which is a new color for me, and it came out wonderful!</li>
            <li>I switched to this after using Cleo Rose by Manic Panic, which is a great color but fades too quickly and gets brassy.</li>
            <li>Virgin Rose is BY FAR the best out there of what I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot.  </li>
            <li>The color isnt really purple, its more like &amp;#34;fuscia&amp;#34;, but besides that, it is a wonderful hair color.</li>
            <li>i am super happy with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have been using it now many time and always get good responds ,people love it</li>
            <li>Albeit a very nice pink that looks great has faded nicely along the way.</li>
            <li>It looked very good, and we were able to try some temporary color over the blonde, which she liked.  </li>
            <li>I love this color and will buy again.</li>
            <li>I never bleached my light/medium brown hair before applying and still got wonderful results with deep color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it would be more purple ish</li>
            <li>is certainly potent.</li>
            <li>Okah, So I love this color.</li>
            <li>I put it in more time</li>
            <li>However, I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got more on my pillowcase than in my hair.</li>
            <li>I have gotten so many compliments on it.</li>
            <li>MY FAVORITE.</li>
            <li>this might be more prevalent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s magic on ink/dye stains on counter tops.  </li>
            <li>I still think it&#x27;s better than MP.</li>
            <li>I love the color though-</li>
            <li>I really love special effects, and this hair color works amazingly every time I use it.  </li>
            <li>should also mention - I&#x27;ve been using Special Effects Virgin Rose almost exclusively for 2 years now.</li>
            <li>I love special effects!</li>
            <li>I love Special Effects dye!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more reddish than purple, so if you&#x27;re wanting a strong purple color go with another dye.</li>
            <li>This comes out a fuchsia color at first and eventually fades into an awesome bright pink.</li>
            <li>Just tried Virgin Rose for the first time, and I love it.</li>
            <li>This starts out purple but it fades into an amazing hot pink, which makes me love it all the more!!!</li>
            <li>I had to resort to buying it online for 13 dollars, not bad!</li>
            <li>I have had it in my hair for a month and its still going strong.</li>
            <li>I have used this color along with Special Effects Fish Bowl, both work lovely.</li>
            <li>I have been using Special Effects for many years</li>
            <li>I LOVE special effects.</li>
            <li>and then I decided to add Vampire Red by Manic Panic and it came out soooo beautiful.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a nearly-permanent dark fuchsia/magenta color, this is your best bet.</li>
            <li>Special Effects is by far the best vibrant color demi permanent dye I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>In fact, in my opinion it looks BETTER after about a weeks worth of washes.</li>
            <li>It does bleed, but recently my stylist started locking the color with Pravana&#x27;s KeraGlaze, and the bleed has been reduced a great deal.</li>
            <li>It is a very intense and bright color that&#x27;s absolutely beautiul.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>I applied it full strength to bleached hair, left it on for about 90 minutes, and it came out looking great.</li>
            <li>color is electrically bright and barely faded at all during the 5 weeks</li>
            <li>Totally recommend this color if you are looking for a kind of magenta color!</li>
            <li>I am pretty pleased with this dye brand and will keep using it.</li>
            <li>would like it if the purple stayed vivid for longer than it does, but overall I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Compared to other brands I&#x27;ve tried, I feel the most confident with SFX in knowing I will get nice, even coverage.  </li>
            <li>freshly dyed, but keeps developing into a pretty awesome shade of pink as it fades, I&#x27;ve had my hair dyed for months now</li>
            <li>Since I found Special Effects -</li>
            <li>I was told that Special Effects lasts longer than Manic Panic, but it did seem to fade a bit after one wash.</li>
            <li>I googled, and eventually came up with Special Effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>To be honest, I&#x27;ve had more success with drugstore products (Splat) that cost about the same.</li>
            <li>I have been reading such good reviews about this product i just had to try it for myself.</li>
            <li>The dye itself is not only a gorgeous color</li>
            <li>the dye comes off of tile and porcelain pretty easily, but i have a plastic tub/shower</li>
            <li>As someone whose hair doesn&#x27;t take dye very well, I&#x27;m happy to say that several weeks have passed and the dye still looks pretty nice, even though it seems a bit more orange now that the blonder parts of my bleached (originally black) hair are showing more.</li>
            <li>This dye is seriously the best I&#x27;ve EVER used, and I dye my hair ALOT.</li>
            <li>I will most definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended, and super fun :)</li>
            <li>This was the first time I or my sister had dyed our hair, but this worked wonders for us!</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful color, starts out a purple/pink and washes up to a vibrant Pink.  </li>
            <li>I shudder to think what kind of toxic stuff they make those things out of, but a Magic Eraser plus a little elbow grease will rub out most of those stains completely.  </li>
            <li>After drying and re-adding it, it came out bright even for out of the shower wet</li>
            <li>No shampoo, no conditioning, just one dip in fresh water 2 days after dying it, and it almost all came</li>
            <li>/&gt;But the color is way worth it.</li>
            <li>The dye is strong but I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s particularly harmful at all.</li>
            <li>I have gotten more compliments from strangers (more reliable than friends, I&#x27;ve found) on this color blend than any other shade I&#x27;ve done.</li>
            <li>Second tip: Mr. Clean Magic Erasers.  </li>
            <li>This dye fades very evenly, in terms of retaining its original color.</li>
            <li>It turns the water bright pink the first time I shower, but after that it doesn&#x27;t bleed on pillows or clothing or anything.</li>
            <li>There is some fading, but it fades to a hot pink that is gorgeous (rather than the brassy orange-y color one might get with something like Manic Panic).</li>
            <li>really vibrant and a great inbetween shade of hot pink and purple.</li>
            <li>They only have Raw (which is as effective as finger paints), which is a super bummer since SE is obviously the more superior hair dye...</li>
            <li>Just be certain that this is the color you want!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for long lasting bright color give special effects a shot.</li>
            <li>Long lasting and great color.</li>
            <li>exactly the color</li>
            <li>then I was suppose too, it was pretty</li>
            <li>it&#x27;ll be more (recommended 1/2 a bottle for short hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it hasn&#x27;t faded much at all!</li>
            <li>First tip:</li>
            <li>However, you&#x27;re making a long-term committment and you could end up with more than you bargained for to try to change the shade later on.</li>
            <li>Like many other reviewers, I am impressed with its staying-power, and it is true that a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>I used this dye mixed in a 1:2 ratio to SFX Wildflower and it turned out a brilliant purple with a slightly magenta cast.</li>
            <li>We chose Special Effects after reading many reviews on this and other brands.</li>
            <li>I love Special Effects dye and will never purchase any other brand of dye after using this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i just love the color and have gotten such a positive response from almost EVERYONE--</li>
            <li>My hair feels so soft and looks super shiny right after dying too--</li>
            <li>My hair feels so soft and looks super shiny right after dying too--</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice purpley/pink, and fades to a pretty intense neon pink.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended, and super fun :)uld recommend testing the eraser on a small area first because, depending on the type of surface, sometimes the eraser can clean &amp;#</li>
            <li>It will hold better on bleached hair, and I also make sure to use high-quality (Tigi BedHead, the one in the red bottle is the best) shampoo and conditioner (and only use shampoo 2-3 times/week), and rinse in cold water.</li>
            <li>sure to use a toner and get as much orange out as possible, of course).</li>
            <li>I am completely sold on the Special Effects brand.  </li>
            <li>I really love purple hair, but I mix in a pink shade, such as virgin rose, with the purple so that after the blue tones in the purple fade I will be left with a nice pink-y</li>
            <li>I have tried other dyes and kept all the rest of my routine the same, and I experienced severe fading.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very vibrant color that hasn&#x27;t faded.  </li>
            <li>Very vibrant.</li>
            <li>This dye came promptly and in easy to open packaging.</li>
            <li>I first dye my hair, the purple is very vivid and gets lots of compliments -- people really notice it.  </li>
            <li>However, it came out as a bright pink (which actually makes sense with \\&quot;rose\\&quot; in the name, but hey the picture looked</li>
            <li>We tried bleaching her hair beforehand but the bleached we used was too gentle and had no visible effect.  </li>
            <li>As it fades the reddish tones are sticking around more, as is to be expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not noticed that one fades much faster than another</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re gonna do whole head</li>
            <li>I prefer it over manic panic or ion color brilliance because it lasts so much longer, but if this doesn&#x27;t work for you give them a shot.</li>
            <li>It is more of a maroonish pink.</li>
            <li>We stripped the blonde bits and applied about 2/3 of the bottle of Virgin Rose, then left it on for 35 minutes before washing.  </li>
            <li>a few weeks and lots of washing/conditioning later, we decided to go for a permanent color and found this one, Virgin Rose Special Effects.  </li>
            <li>On my bleached hair it does fade to hot pink after a month or so, but on my niece&#x27;s mousy brown it turns a darkish pink that looks really good as well.</li>
            <li>This hair dye DOES bleed more than any other hair dye I have used (and I&#x27;ve used a lot), but it also fades a lot slower.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin, so my scalp gets oily super fast and not cleaning my hair daily isn&#x27;t an option.</li>
            <li>Make sure the hair is pre-lightened (if you have naturally dark hair).</li>
            <li>My hair is a dirty-blonde (more on the dark side since I&#x27;ve gotten older)</li>
            <li>so after about 20 seconds when I added and then rinsed before drying one of my strands, it was already dyed more vibrant than any other brand I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s decent.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t even have to bleach my hair to get vibrant results for any of the colors.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t used it in years, but since I&#x27;m trying to grow my hair out and avoid harsh dyes or bleach, I decided to go back to the bright colors.</li>
            <li>If you have a particularly stubborn stain, then go for a bathroom cleanser with bleach--</li>
            <li>If you have a particularly stubborn stain, then go for a bathroom cleanser with bleach--</li>
            <li>have naturally darkish-blonde hair, and my stylist decided we&#x27;d better strip out the parts of it that were going to be dyed pink.  </li>
            <li>Under sunlight her hair looks a very vivid red-based purple.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended, as always.</li>
            <li>At this point, since I have been doing this for so long, I will admit that my strands are so completely saturated with this dye that I don&#x27;t really get much fading; someone just starting out might experience more fade than I do.</li>
            <li>I mixed it with a tiny bit of blue freak and it turned into this amazing pinkish purple.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I suggest not letting your hair get wet while wearing light colored clothing.</li>
            <li>Definitely need to bleach your hair first to get the true results of the dye, but that should be obvious.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and thick so it doesn&#x27;t drip and slide off your hair when applying it.  </li>
            <li>: i wash my hair with dish soap to get rid of all the oil, then dry it all the way with a dryer on high heat to open up the hair, then leave the dye on for only 25 minutes, and my hair is an amazing color.</li>
            <li>Not that this WON&#x27;T leave dye on your towels, but it was only the first few washes that had the most dye wash off.  </li>
            <li>That gave us a better result, with a brighter pink hue, but still not the purple we were looking for and that others described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, 2 days later</li>
            <li>When I first started, I tried several different brands of dye (on fully bleached hair; my natural color is medium/dark brown) but all faded pretty fast.</li>
            <li>Without the KeraGlaze, my fingertips would be stained pink for two weeks simply from touching my hair (not to mention my pillows, my bathtub, etc.,</li>
            <li>even conservative people who don&#x27;t like wild colors and dyed hair in general just think the color is pretty and suits me.</li>
            <li>I would compare this color to Manic Panic&#x27;s hot hot pink.</li>
            <li>As a professional hairdresser, i highly recommend this brand of hair color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been dying my hair shades of pink for over 10 years and Special Effects</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used three colors (vintage rose, pimpin purple, blue velvet) and they hardly fade and fade very evenly.</li>
            <li>a light blonde, graduating to her natural color, but with blonde streaks around her face and here and there all over.  </li>
            <li>As the color first started to fade, it actually began to look brighter.</li>
            <li>(I would recommend testing the eraser on a small area first because, depending on the type of surface, sometimes the eraser can clean &amp;#</li>
            <li>a neon pink color at first (think highlighter pink), and then turned into a more soft, still hot pink color.</li>
            <li>I was upset it wasn&#x27;t purple, in anyway, but the pink is very very pretty.</li>
            <li>With Special Effects, it lasts until I get dark roots and need to go in for a touch-</li>
            <li>Last much longer than Manic Panic…</li>
            <li>you want a dye that will come out completely (like for kids or a short-term change), this is NOT the product for you.</li>
            <li>The color has lasted really well in my hair for several weeks now.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve washed my hair  10 times since I applied the color</li>
            <li>Just spray it directly on the stain and wipe off.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;i am only deducting a star because it washes out too fast.</li>
            <li>We definitely used too much dye--I had excess dye transferring off of my hair onto my brush, my fingers, my pillowcase, etc.</li>
            <li>I first forgot to dry my hair before adding the dye (as listed in the directions)</li>
            <li>Some areas ended up canary yellow, some were peach, and there were shades of pink from cotton candy to the original hot pink.  </li>
            <li>Her hair is pretty short and we only used about 1/10 of the bottle.</li>
            <li>will forever recommend this brand to anyone wanting a semi-perm of vibrant colors, especially if they don&#x27;t want to bleach their hair.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s high maintenance - because keeping a color like this is definitely high-maintenance.</li>
            <li>After using a semi-permanent dye from Manic Panic, I went on the hunt for a permanent hot pink dye.  </li>
            <li>Bleached my hair, followed the instruction, and it came out hot pink!</li>
            <li>and I find it in major salon/hair stores.</li>
            <li>I absolutely would have given this 5 stars if the color had been what I expected.  </li>
            <li>I was rinsing my hair for the first time after applying the dye, I spent a long time in the shower rinsing my head until the water ran clear.</li>
            <li>Over about a week of daily hair-washing, it fades to hot pink.  </li>
            <li>As far as fading goes, on my hair I&#x27;ve found that blue shades fade fairly quickly on my hair but pink shades seem to last a long time.  </li>
            <li>Lasts at least 4 weeks true color then fades to vibrant pink which lasts for another 4 to 6 weeks.</li>
            <li>It starts off as a deep dark pinkish purple but fades over time to almost the Special Effects Cupcake Pink.</li>
            <li>use purple too at the same time and this two really compliment each other</li>
            <li>processing time given on the bottle was extremely short), so we did a patch test on a small portion of her blonde ends, leaving it on for a full hour.  </li>
            <li>I was my hair everyday with hot water</li>
            <li>but I have fine hair, so I&#x27;m guessing if you have very thick hair</li>
            <li>My only suggestion to keep the color as long as possible is to use an all natural cleansing conditioner (wen $30</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> color turned out perfect magenta and stayed in my hair for over three months before I decided to change style.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome and though it fades, if you bleach your hair before dying it</li>
            <li> Truly a great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used SFX for years and it continues to remain the best vegetable-based dye out there.</li>
            <li> their dye has been discontinued because it is the best quality for alternative color hair dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This color is beautiful!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, these dyes are awesome</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, these dyes are awesome</li>
            <li> LOVE!!!!</li>
            <li> VERY bright and holds well on bleached hair.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous color!</li>
            <li> , color aside, this is the best brightly colored hair dye that I have used.  </li>
            <li> On my unbleached brown hair, it turned my hair a beautiful purple color.</li>
            <li> Just absolutley beautiful.</li>
            <li> It looks so amazingly beautiful.</li>
            <li> Simply beautiful.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve always had great results.</li>
            <li> Great color.</li>
            <li> Great product</li>
            <li> The dyes are great for mixing and creating custom colors.  </li>
            <li> Special Effects just might be the best semi-permanent dye on the market and Virgin Rose is just beautiful.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a bright colored purple, like the color shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, really good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone looking for a gorgeous pinky color.</li>
            <li> and I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> a bright magenta meets purple kind of a color.</li>
            <li> dye is very potent and will stain *</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this color!</li>
            <li> and it is still super bright!</li>
            <li> Your hair will look amazing.  </li>
            <li> While I would not recommend the product, I would absolutely recommend doing business with PLG as their customer service is excellent.</li>
            <li> specifically Virgin Rose -</li>
            <li> Everything you own will be this color.</li>
            <li> Kind of a magenta.</li>
            <li> The colour is so vibrant and looks awesome in the sun!</li>
            <li> The color is very bright when it comes on at first.</li>
            <li> This time I bought Virgin Rose, which is a new color for me, and it came out wonderful!</li>
            <li> I switched to this after using Cleo Rose by Manic Panic, which is a great color but fades too quickly and gets brassy.</li>
            <li> Virgin Rose is BY FAR the best out there of what I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot.  </li>
            <li> The color isnt really purple, its more like &amp;#34;fuscia&amp;#34;, but besides that, it is a wonderful hair color.</li>
            <li> i am super happy with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have been using it now many time and always get good responds ,people love it</li>
            <li> Albeit a very nice pink that looks great has faded nicely along the way.</li>
            <li> It looked very good, and we were able to try some temporary color over the blonde, which she liked.  </li>
            <li> I love this color and will buy again.</li>
            <li> I never bleached my light/medium brown hair before applying and still got wonderful results with deep color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it would be more purple ish</li>
            <li> is certainly potent.</li>
            <li> Okah, So I love this color.</li>
            <li> I put it in more time</li>
            <li> However, I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got more on my pillowcase than in my hair.</li>
            <li> I have gotten so many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> MY FAVORITE.</li>
            <li> this might be more prevalent.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s magic on ink/dye stains on counter tops.  </li>
            <li> I still think it&#x27;s better than MP.</li>
            <li> I love the color though-</li>
            <li> I really love special effects, and this hair color works amazingly every time I use it.  </li>
            <li> should also mention - I&#x27;ve been using Special Effects Virgin Rose almost exclusively for 2 years now.</li>
            <li> I love special effects!</li>
            <li> I love Special Effects dye!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more reddish than purple, so if you&#x27;re wanting a strong purple color go with another dye.</li>
            <li> This comes out a fuchsia color at first and eventually fades into an awesome bright pink.</li>
            <li> Just tried Virgin Rose for the first time, and I love it.</li>
            <li> This starts out purple but it fades into an amazing hot pink, which makes me love it all the more!!!</li>
            <li> I had to resort to buying it online for 13 dollars, not bad!</li>
            <li> I have had it in my hair for a month and its still going strong.</li>
            <li> I have used this color along with Special Effects Fish Bowl, both work lovely.</li>
            <li> I have been using Special Effects for many years</li>
            <li> I LOVE special effects.</li>
            <li> and then I decided to add Vampire Red by Manic Panic and it came out soooo beautiful.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a nearly-permanent dark fuchsia/magenta color, this is your best bet.</li>
            <li> Special Effects is by far the best vibrant color demi permanent dye I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> In fact, in my opinion it looks BETTER after about a weeks worth of washes.</li>
            <li> It does bleed, but recently my stylist started locking the color with Pravana&#x27;s KeraGlaze, and the bleed has been reduced a great deal.</li>
            <li> It is a very intense and bright color that&#x27;s absolutely beautiul.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> I applied it full strength to bleached hair, left it on for about 90 minutes, and it came out looking great.</li>
            <li> color is electrically bright and barely faded at all during the 5 weeks</li>
            <li> Totally recommend this color if you are looking for a kind of magenta color!</li>
            <li> I am pretty pleased with this dye brand and will keep using it.</li>
            <li> would like it if the purple stayed vivid for longer than it does, but overall I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Compared to other brands I&#x27;ve tried, I feel the most confident with SFX in knowing I will get nice, even coverage.  </li>
            <li> freshly dyed, but keeps developing into a pretty awesome shade of pink as it fades, I&#x27;ve had my hair dyed for months now</li>
            <li> Since I found Special Effects -</li>
            <li> I was told that Special Effects lasts longer than Manic Panic, but it did seem to fade a bit after one wash.</li>
            <li> I googled, and eventually came up with Special Effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> To be honest, I&#x27;ve had more success with drugstore products (Splat) that cost about the same.</li>
            <li> I have been reading such good reviews about this product i just had to try it for myself.</li>
            <li> The dye itself is not only a gorgeous color</li>
            <li> the dye comes off of tile and porcelain pretty easily, but i have a plastic tub/shower</li>
            <li> As someone whose hair doesn&#x27;t take dye very well, I&#x27;m happy to say that several weeks have passed and the dye still looks pretty nice, even though it seems a bit more orange now that the blonder parts of my bleached (originally black) hair are showing more.</li>
            <li> This dye is seriously the best I&#x27;ve EVER used, and I dye my hair ALOT.</li>
            <li> I will most definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended, and super fun :)</li>
            <li> This was the first time I or my sister had dyed our hair, but this worked wonders for us!</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful color, starts out a purple/pink and washes up to a vibrant Pink.  </li>
            <li> I shudder to think what kind of toxic stuff they make those things out of, but a Magic Eraser plus a little elbow grease will rub out most of those stains completely.  </li>
            <li> After drying and re-adding it, it came out bright even for out of the shower wet</li>
            <li> No shampoo, no conditioning, just one dip in fresh water 2 days after dying it, and it almost all came</li>
            <li> /&gt;But the color is way worth it.</li>
            <li> The dye is strong but I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s particularly harmful at all.</li>
            <li> I have gotten more compliments from strangers (more reliable than friends, I&#x27;ve found) on this color blend than any other shade I&#x27;ve done.</li>
            <li> Second tip: Mr. Clean Magic Erasers.  </li>
            <li> This dye fades very evenly, in terms of retaining its original color.</li>
            <li> It turns the water bright pink the first time I shower, but after that it doesn&#x27;t bleed on pillows or clothing or anything.</li>
            <li> There is some fading, but it fades to a hot pink that is gorgeous (rather than the brassy orange-y color one might get with something like Manic Panic).</li>
            <li> really vibrant and a great inbetween shade of hot pink and purple.</li>
            <li> They only have Raw (which is as effective as finger paints), which is a super bummer since SE is obviously the more superior hair dye...</li>
            <li> Just be certain that this is the color you want!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for long lasting bright color give special effects a shot.</li>
            <li> Long lasting and great color.</li>
            <li> exactly the color</li>
            <li> then I was suppose too, it was pretty</li>
            <li> it&#x27;ll be more (recommended 1/2 a bottle for short hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it hasn&#x27;t faded much at all!</li>
            <li> First tip:</li>
            <li> However, you&#x27;re making a long-term committment and you could end up with more than you bargained for to try to change the shade later on.</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers, I am impressed with its staying-power, and it is true that a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I used this dye mixed in a 1:2 ratio to SFX Wildflower and it turned out a brilliant purple with a slightly magenta cast.</li>
            <li> We chose Special Effects after reading many reviews on this and other brands.</li>
            <li> I love Special Effects dye and will never purchase any other brand of dye after using this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i just love the color and have gotten such a positive response from almost EVERYONE--</li>
            <li> My hair feels so soft and looks super shiny right after dying too--</li>
            <li> My hair feels so soft and looks super shiny right after dying too--</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice purpley/pink, and fades to a pretty intense neon pink.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended, and super fun :)uld recommend testing the eraser on a small area first because, depending on the type of surface, sometimes the eraser can clean &amp;#</li>
            <li> It will hold better on bleached hair, and I also make sure to use high-quality (Tigi BedHead, the one in the red bottle is the best) shampoo and conditioner (and only use shampoo 2-3 times/week), and rinse in cold water.</li>
            <li> sure to use a toner and get as much orange out as possible, of course).</li>
            <li> I am completely sold on the Special Effects brand.  </li>
            <li> I really love purple hair, but I mix in a pink shade, such as virgin rose, with the purple so that after the blue tones in the purple fade I will be left with a nice pink-y</li>
            <li> I have tried other dyes and kept all the rest of my routine the same, and I experienced severe fading.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very vibrant color that hasn&#x27;t faded.  </li>
            <li> Very vibrant.</li>
            <li> This dye came promptly and in easy to open packaging.</li>
            <li> I first dye my hair, the purple is very vivid and gets lots of compliments -- people really notice it.  </li>
            <li> However, it came out as a bright pink (which actually makes sense with \\&quot;rose\\&quot; in the name, but hey the picture looked</li>
            <li> We tried bleaching her hair beforehand but the bleached we used was too gentle and had no visible effect.  </li>
            <li> As it fades the reddish tones are sticking around more, as is to be expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not noticed that one fades much faster than another</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re gonna do whole head</li>
            <li> I prefer it over manic panic or ion color brilliance because it lasts so much longer, but if this doesn&#x27;t work for you give them a shot.</li>
            <li> It is more of a maroonish pink.</li>
            <li> We stripped the blonde bits and applied about 2/3 of the bottle of Virgin Rose, then left it on for 35 minutes before washing.  </li>
            <li> a few weeks and lots of washing/conditioning later, we decided to go for a permanent color and found this one, Virgin Rose Special Effects.  </li>
            <li> On my bleached hair it does fade to hot pink after a month or so, but on my niece&#x27;s mousy brown it turns a darkish pink that looks really good as well.</li>
            <li> This hair dye DOES bleed more than any other hair dye I have used (and I&#x27;ve used a lot), but it also fades a lot slower.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, so my scalp gets oily super fast and not cleaning my hair daily isn&#x27;t an option.</li>
            <li> Make sure the hair is pre-lightened (if you have naturally dark hair).</li>
            <li> My hair is a dirty-blonde (more on the dark side since I&#x27;ve gotten older)</li>
            <li> so after about 20 seconds when I added and then rinsed before drying one of my strands, it was already dyed more vibrant than any other brand I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s decent.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t even have to bleach my hair to get vibrant results for any of the colors.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t used it in years, but since I&#x27;m trying to grow my hair out and avoid harsh dyes or bleach, I decided to go back to the bright colors.</li>
            <li> If you have a particularly stubborn stain, then go for a bathroom cleanser with bleach--</li>
            <li> If you have a particularly stubborn stain, then go for a bathroom cleanser with bleach--</li>
            <li> have naturally darkish-blonde hair, and my stylist decided we&#x27;d better strip out the parts of it that were going to be dyed pink.  </li>
            <li> Under sunlight her hair looks a very vivid red-based purple.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended, as always.</li>
            <li> At this point, since I have been doing this for so long, I will admit that my strands are so completely saturated with this dye that I don&#x27;t really get much fading; someone just starting out might experience more fade than I do.</li>
            <li> I mixed it with a tiny bit of blue freak and it turned into this amazing pinkish purple.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I suggest not letting your hair get wet while wearing light colored clothing.</li>
            <li> Definitely need to bleach your hair first to get the true results of the dye, but that should be obvious.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and thick so it doesn&#x27;t drip and slide off your hair when applying it.  </li>
            <li> : i wash my hair with dish soap to get rid of all the oil, then dry it all the way with a dryer on high heat to open up the hair, then leave the dye on for only 25 minutes, and my hair is an amazing color.</li>
            <li> Not that this WON&#x27;T leave dye on your towels, but it was only the first few washes that had the most dye wash off.  </li>
            <li> That gave us a better result, with a brighter pink hue, but still not the purple we were looking for and that others described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, 2 days later</li>
            <li> When I first started, I tried several different brands of dye (on fully bleached hair; my natural color is medium/dark brown) but all faded pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Without the KeraGlaze, my fingertips would be stained pink for two weeks simply from touching my hair (not to mention my pillows, my bathtub, etc.,</li>
            <li> even conservative people who don&#x27;t like wild colors and dyed hair in general just think the color is pretty and suits me.</li>
            <li> I would compare this color to Manic Panic&#x27;s hot hot pink.</li>
            <li> As a professional hairdresser, i highly recommend this brand of hair color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my hair shades of pink for over 10 years and Special Effects</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used three colors (vintage rose, pimpin purple, blue velvet) and they hardly fade and fade very evenly.</li>
            <li> a light blonde, graduating to her natural color, but with blonde streaks around her face and here and there all over.  </li>
            <li> As the color first started to fade, it actually began to look brighter.</li>
            <li> (I would recommend testing the eraser on a small area first because, depending on the type of surface, sometimes the eraser can clean &amp;#</li>
            <li> a neon pink color at first (think highlighter pink), and then turned into a more soft, still hot pink color.</li>
            <li> I was upset it wasn&#x27;t purple, in anyway, but the pink is very very pretty.</li>
            <li> With Special Effects, it lasts until I get dark roots and need to go in for a touch-</li>
            <li> Last much longer than Manic Panic…</li>
            <li> you want a dye that will come out completely (like for kids or a short-term change), this is NOT the product for you.</li>
            <li> The color has lasted really well in my hair for several weeks now.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve washed my hair  10 times since I applied the color</li>
            <li> Just spray it directly on the stain and wipe off.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i am only deducting a star because it washes out too fast.</li>
            <li> We definitely used too much dye--I had excess dye transferring off of my hair onto my brush, my fingers, my pillowcase, etc.</li>
            <li> I first forgot to dry my hair before adding the dye (as listed in the directions)</li>
            <li> Some areas ended up canary yellow, some were peach, and there were shades of pink from cotton candy to the original hot pink.  </li>
            <li> Her hair is pretty short and we only used about 1/10 of the bottle.</li>
            <li> will forever recommend this brand to anyone wanting a semi-perm of vibrant colors, especially if they don&#x27;t want to bleach their hair.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s high maintenance - because keeping a color like this is definitely high-maintenance.</li>
            <li> After using a semi-permanent dye from Manic Panic, I went on the hunt for a permanent hot pink dye.  </li>
            <li> Bleached my hair, followed the instruction, and it came out hot pink!</li>
            <li> and I find it in major salon/hair stores.</li>
            <li> I absolutely would have given this 5 stars if the color had been what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I was rinsing my hair for the first time after applying the dye, I spent a long time in the shower rinsing my head until the water ran clear.</li>
            <li> Over about a week of daily hair-washing, it fades to hot pink.  </li>
            <li> As far as fading goes, on my hair I&#x27;ve found that blue shades fade fairly quickly on my hair but pink shades seem to last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Lasts at least 4 weeks true color then fades to vibrant pink which lasts for another 4 to 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> It starts off as a deep dark pinkish purple but fades over time to almost the Special Effects Cupcake Pink.</li>
            <li> use purple too at the same time and this two really compliment each other</li>
            <li> processing time given on the bottle was extremely short), so we did a patch test on a small portion of her blonde ends, leaving it on for a full hour.  </li>
            <li> I was my hair everyday with hot water</li>
            <li> but I have fine hair, so I&#x27;m guessing if you have very thick hair</li>
            <li> My only suggestion to keep the color as long as possible is to use an all natural cleansing conditioner (wen $30</li>
            <li> There is very little staining of the tub as long as you keep water flowing over the spots where the color hits when you first wash it out.</li>
            <li> This is the only brand of dye that last a long time.</li>
            <li> so 13 or 14 dollars will last you a LONG time if this is relative to your hair style.</li>
            <li> 11 year old has always wanted to have purple/pink hair, but she has long dark brown hair.  </li>
            <li> I got out the stains completely after trying a few different methods.  </li>
            <li> Holy crap, these really are magic.  </li>
            <li> I have washed it every other day for two weeks now and it has barely faded.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE Aug 26, 2013:  I complained to the vendor, Penny Lane Gifts, through Amazon, and received a very prompt refund of the purchase price.  </li>
            <li> few days later, after washing it once and seeing virtually all of this color go down the drain, I thought that perhaps it wasn&#x27;t on long enough to completely process (the 15 - 20 mins</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s hair is different, but my hair just soaks up this color-- almost too much, I usually dilute it with mixer or conditioner a little to get a more subtle color.  </li>
            <li> The color is very vibrant (and very messy!)</li>
            <li> We carefully followed all the instructions on the bottle (wash, no conditioner, dry) and left it in 20 minutes, rinsed it out, and found only an insipid, slight pinkening of her blonde</li>
            <li> and it is still VERY pink, the only reason I need to touch up is for roots.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m so sad that I can barely ever find this brand in stores; I started using it when I was 14 and shopped at Hot Topic, but now they don&#x27;t sell it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these colors in for three weeks so far with very little fading</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t bleach beforehand, but even with my naturally dark brown hair this product gives a magenta highlight that especially stands out in the sun.</li>
            <li> They also pretty continuously leave behind dye on my towels.  </li>
            <li> This \\&quot;semi-permanent\\&quot; hair dye does not last even a week, and I could not recommend it less, which I would do if Amazon would permit zero stars on a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had my hair blue previously, stripped that out</li>
            <li> and it left a strange green color.  </li>
            <li> Annoying to see that it went up a dollar in a week, but I absolutely LOVE this brand of semi-perm hair dye!</li>
            <li> I only dyed the under side of my hair, which comes to a little past my shoulders, and I barely used any dye,</li>
            <li> It stained my tub, brush, pillows, even the straightening iron is still pink.</li>
            <li> That color only lasted a few days, until she swam in a pool and all traces were</li>
            <li> My pillows are totally pink now because of it.  </li>
            <li> I have been dying my hair all-over pink for 2 1/2 years now.</li>
            <li> you want a truly pink color I recommend &amp;#34;Atomic Pink&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Cupcake Pink&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it only lasted a week&amp;#34;-DON&#x27;T WASH YOUR HAIR EVERYDAY.</li>
            <li> but you will have pink hair for quite some time.</li>
            <li> I figure since I spent the time applying it</li>
            <li> * if you aren&#x27;t careful.  </li>
            <li> And the other parts of my hair that I bleached over are still pinkish.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other colors I have used wash out in one to two weeks and fade.  </li>
            <li> Every other brand washed out in days.  </li>
            <li> I had 25 minutes of bleaching to try to get the pink out, and it ended up looking like a My Little Pony tie-dye hell-scape.  </li>
            <li> I stained up my white sink and counter tops pretty badly, but don&#x27;t panic if that happens.  </li>
            <li> It starts out as a dark fuchsia color.</li>
            <li> I think this may be helping with avoiding the trouble other people had with the dye rubbing off on other objects.</li>
            <li> Then the pink gradually gets paler over a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It never even started to fade.&lt;br /&gt;Still now, after dying my hair brown black I can still see hints of the color</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say half the bottle is plenty, and my hair is medium-long.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I could have tried another round of the bleach, but decided to just cover it all up with dark brown and save myself the damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This will help if you bleach your hair heavily before coloring also.</li>
            <li> me, I don&#x27;t have much trouble with color-bleeding on to clothes/pilllow-cases</li>
            <li> I dyed my hair at the end of April and the color is still in my hair, it faded very little.</li>
            <li> so i ended up cutting the bottle and scooping out the last of it since i couldn&#x27;t bear to let it go to waste...</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve only been washing my hair with color-safe shampoo in really cold water every 3 days and after 4 or 5 washes it gets noticably faded.</li>
            <li> While this dye does bleed like crazy for a LONG time, when you&#x27;re doing these types of colors with vegan dye you should expect it.</li>
            <li> Even washing very sparingly with cold water, this color bled like crazy and after a week</li>
            <li> down side to all of this is that I decided to get rid of the pink, and it was difficult to impossible.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick</li>
            <li> The color payoff is intense, dimensional and insanely glossy.</li>
            <li> When she came home, the small patch of hair that we had redyed was indistinguishable from the rest of the now very, very faint pinkening of the rest of her hair.  </li>
            <li> looks like we&#x27;ll be heading for an expensive salon color, as this product is obviously unable to dowhat</li>
            <li> , however, it&#x27;s not just pink--it has a cold tone to it that makes it, well,</li>
            <li> Also use cooler water and don&#x27;t slap a handful of shampoo on your hair (that&#x27;s bad for your hair</li>
            <li> at any rate, manic panic is a joke compared to this; that crap didn&#x27;t work for me AT ALL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This was the first time I or my sister had dyed our hair, but this worked wonders for us! We chose Special Effects after reading many reviews on this and other brands. The package came after only 4/5 days even with the cheapest shipping. I dyed my sister&#x27;s hair using foil and a toothbrush, along with the dye.  We tried bleaching her hair beforehand but the bleached we used was too gentle and had no visible effect.  We decided to go ahead with out the bleach.  We left it in about 17 hours.  After she washed it out, it tinted her hair reddish-purple. Under sunlight her hair looks a very vivid red-based purple.  Her hair is pretty short and we only used about 1/10 of the bottle. We&#x27;ll definitely go with this brand again!!!  Totally recommend this color if you are looking for a kind of magenta color!</li>
            <li> Last much longer than Manic Panic…</li>
            <li> I have used this color along with Special Effects Fish Bowl, both work lovely. On my bleached hair it does fade to hot pink after a month or so, but on my niece&#x27;s mousy brown it turns a darkish pink that looks really good as well. I am pretty pleased with this dye brand and will keep using it.</li>
            <li> I use this product to put just a streak of color at the front of my hair. I don&#x27;t bleach beforehand, but even with my naturally dark brown hair this product gives a magenta highlight that especially stands out in the sun. It turns the water bright pink the first time I shower, but after that it doesn&#x27;t bleed on pillows or clothing or anything. It&#x27;s more reddish than purple, so if you&#x27;re wanting a strong purple color go with another dye. I love this color and will buy again.</li>
            <li> This color never, ever, ever fades.&lt;br /&gt;I had dark brown hair (dyed) and bleached it to a dark golden blond.&lt;br /&gt;The color turned out perfect magenta and stayed in my hair for over three months before I decided to change style. It never even started to fade.&lt;br /&gt;Still now, after dying my hair brown black I can still see hints of the color were it used to be. And the other parts of my hair that I bleached over are still pinkish.&lt;br /&gt;Be caferul when dying tho... this will stain everything!! It stained my tub, brush, pillows, even the straightening iron is still pink.</li>
            <li> Special Effects just might be the best semi-permanent dye on the market and Virgin Rose is just beautiful. The color payoff is intense, dimensional and insanely glossy. I never bleached my light/medium brown hair before applying and still got wonderful results with deep color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a dye that will come out completely (like for kids or a short-term change), this is NOT the product for you. It did stain my hair permanently. Of course, this is a plus for those of us who want our color to last and last.</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;semi-permanent\\&quot; hair dye does not last even a week, and I could not recommend it less, which I would do if Amazon would permit zero stars on a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 11 year old has always wanted to have purple/pink hair, but she has long dark brown hair.  So we did an ombre lightening of her hair to make the ends (3 inches) a light blonde, graduating to her natural color, but with blonde streaks around her face and here and there all over.  It looked very good, and we were able to try some temporary color over the blonde, which she liked.  That color only lasted a few days, until she swam in a pool and all traces were removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, a few weeks and lots of washing/conditioning later, we decided to go for a permanent color and found this one, Virgin Rose Special Effects.  We carefully followed all the instructions on the bottle (wash, no conditioner, dry) and left it in 20 minutes, rinsed it out, and found only an insipid, slight pinkening of her blonde hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few days later, after washing it once and seeing virtually all of this color go down the drain, I thought that perhaps it wasn&#x27;t on long enough to completely process (the 15 - 20 mins processing time given on the bottle was extremely short), so we did a patch test on a small portion of her blonde ends, leaving it on for a full hour.  That gave us a better result, with a brighter pink hue, but still not the purple we were looking for and that others described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, 2 days later while we were thinking about whether to redye all her hair, she went kayaking on the lake and also took a brief swim.  When she came home, the small patch of hair that we had redyed was indistinguishable from the rest of the now very, very faint pinkening of the rest of her hair.  No shampoo, no conditioning, just one dip in fresh water 2 days after dying it, and it almost all came out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks like we&#x27;ll be heading for an expensive salon color, as this product is obviously unable to dowhat it promised to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE Aug 26, 2013:  I complained to the vendor, Penny Lane Gifts, through Amazon, and received a very prompt refund of the purchase price.  While I would not recommend the product, I would absolutely recommend doing business with PLG as their customer service is excellent.</li>
            <li> I dyed my hair at the end of April and the color is still in my hair, it faded very little. I didn&#x27;t think i would get the results i wanted because my hair was medium brown. I am definately going to buy this color again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my hair shades of pink for over 10 years and Special Effects Virgin Rose is BY FAR the best out there of what I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot.  It starts off as a deep dark pinkish purple but fades over time to almost the Special Effects Cupcake Pink. It&#x27;s awesome and though it fades, if you bleach your hair before dying it will last forever. I love it!</li>
            <li> I have used this product off and on for about 5 years now. I won&#x27;t use anything else. Long lasting and great color.</li>
            <li> I used this dye mixed in a 1:2 ratio to SFX Wildflower and it turned out a brilliant purple with a slightly magenta cast. As it fades the reddish tones are sticking around more, as is to be expected. and it&#x27;s sort of fuchsia now. I have gotten more compliments from strangers (more reliable than friends, I&#x27;ve found) on this color blend than any other shade I&#x27;ve done.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair color, unfortunately I think I probably got the last two bottles of it and will have to switch to Manic Panic instead.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this color! I had my hair blue previously, stripped that out and it left a strange green color.  I mixed it with a tiny bit of blue freak and it turned into this amazing pinkish purple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that the dye gets every where!  My pillows are totally pink now because of it.  Hell, even my keyboard has turned colors because I tend to play with my hair a lot.  It gets all over your fingers and on everything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the color is way worth it.</li>
            <li> This dye is seriously the best I&#x27;ve EVER used, and I dye my hair ALOT. Out of all the brands I&#x27;ve tried, this is the only one that doesn&#x27;t wash out within a week. In fact, in my opinion it looks BETTER after about a weeks worth of washes. This color turned my bleached hair a neon pink color at first (think highlighter pink), and then turned into a more soft, still hot pink color. On my unbleached brown hair, it turned my hair a beautiful purple color. I love Special Effects dye and will never purchase any other brand of dye after using this.</li>
            <li> I have been using Special Effects for many years and I am very pleased with the results. Truly a great product!</li>
            <li> Bottom line - it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it would be more purple ish but it&#x27;s definitely like a bright magenta meets purple kind of a color. It packs a punch is certainly potent. It dyes your hair exactly the color it looks like when it comes out of the bottle - and it stains fast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, really good. Just be certain that this is the color you want! The vibrancy is no joke!</li>
            <li> I absolutely would have given this 5 stars if the color had been what I expected.  I purchased \\&quot;Virgin Rose\\&quot;, which looks PURPLE in the graphic.  However, it came out as a bright pink (which actually makes sense with \\&quot;rose\\&quot; in the name, but hey the picture looked purple).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, color aside, this is the best brightly colored hair dye that I have used.  It&#x27;s nice and thick so it doesn&#x27;t drip and slide off your hair when applying it.  Other colors I have used wash out in one to two weeks and fade.  They also pretty continuously leave behind dye on my towels.  Not that this WON&#x27;T leave dye on your towels, but it was only the first few washes that had the most dye wash off.  The color has lasted really well in my hair for several weeks now.  It&#x27;s a very vibrant color that hasn&#x27;t faded.  I will definitely be on the lookout for an actual purple color (pimpin purple on order as I type this).</li>
            <li> I was looking for a bright colored purple, like the color shown in the picture. Bleached my hair, followed the instruction, and it came out hot pink! Albeit a very nice pink that looks great has faded nicely along the way. I was upset it wasn&#x27;t purple, in anyway, but the pink is very very pretty.</li>
            <li> Okah, So I love this color. 5 stars. I put it in more time then I was suppose too, it was pretty and then I decided to add Vampire Red by Manic Panic and it came out soooo beautiful. Very vibrant. Just absolutley beautiful. Comments everywhere I go about how I got this hair color. &amp;lt; 3  It came out a purple-pink with a hint of red from Manic Panic.</li>
            <li> I have been dying my hair all-over pink for 2 1/2 years now. When I first started, I tried several different brands of dye (on fully bleached hair; my natural color is medium/dark brown) but all faded pretty fast. Since I found Special Effects - specifically Virgin Rose - I have not looked back. It starts out as a dark fuchsia color. There is some fading, but it fades to a hot pink that is gorgeous (rather than the brassy orange-y color one might get with something like Manic Panic). At this point, since I have been doing this for so long, I will admit that my strands are so completely saturated with this dye that I don&#x27;t really get much fading; someone just starting out might experience more fade than I do. It does bleed, but recently my stylist started locking the color with Pravana&#x27;s KeraGlaze, and the bleed has been reduced a great deal. Without the KeraGlaze, my fingertips would be stained pink for two weeks simply from touching my hair (not to mention my pillows, my bathtub, etc., etc., etc.!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a nearly-permanent dark fuchsia/magenta color, this is your best bet. It will hold better on bleached hair, and I also make sure to use high-quality (Tigi BedHead, the one in the red bottle is the best) shampoo and conditioner (and only use shampoo 2-3 times/week), and rinse in cold water. My hair is the only thing about me that&#x27;s high maintenance - because keeping a color like this is definitely high-maintenance. However, I LOVE this product. I have tried other dyes and kept all the rest of my routine the same, and I experienced severe fading. With Special Effects, it lasts until I get dark roots and need to go in for a touch-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also mention - I&#x27;ve been using Special Effects Virgin Rose almost exclusively for 2 years now.</li>
            <li> I love special effects! This is the only brand of dye that last a long time. I used this for my tips, and the product lasted for a bit over a month before fading.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s decent. To be honest, I&#x27;ve had more success with drugstore products (Splat) that cost about the same. Even washing very sparingly with cold water, this color bled like crazy and after a week I&#x27;ve got more on my pillowcase than in my hair. Everything you own will be this color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used SFX for years and it continues to remain the best vegetable-based dye out there. Just tried Virgin Rose for the first time, and I love it. On hay-coloured medium blonde hair, this dyes a deep magenta as in the colour spot, and fades to a medium-to-bright magenta without discolouring(make sure to use a toner and get as much orange out as possible, of course). Highly recommended, as always.</li>
            <li> Special Effects is by far the best vibrant color demi permanent dye I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve used three colors (vintage rose, pimpin purple, blue velvet) and they hardly fade and fade very evenly. I&#x27;ve not noticed that one fades much faster than another and I use all three colors together. My only suggestion to keep the color as long as possible is to use an all natural cleansing conditioner (wen $30+, RenPure$8) instead of shampoo. This will help if you bleach your hair heavily before coloring also. I have very oily skin, so my scalp gets oily super fast and not cleaning my hair daily isn&#x27;t an option. I&#x27;ve had these colors in for three weeks so far with very little fading and I wash my hair with cleansing conditioner daily.</li>
            <li> Annoying to see that it went up a dollar in a week, but I absolutely LOVE this brand of semi-perm hair dye! I&#x27;ve been using it since I was about 14 and I&#x27;ve always had great results. My hair is a dirty-blonde (more on the dark side since I&#x27;ve gotten older) and I don&#x27;t even have to bleach my hair to get vibrant results for any of the colors. This time I bought Virgin Rose, which is a new color for me, and it came out wonderful! The dye is strong but I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s particularly harmful at all. I first forgot to dry my hair before adding the dye (as listed in the directions) so after about 20 seconds when I added and then rinsed before drying one of my strands, it was already dyed more vibrant than any other brand I&#x27;ve used! After drying and re-adding it, it came out bright even for out of the shower wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so sad that I can barely ever find this brand in stores; I started using it when I was 14 and shopped at Hot Topic, but now they don&#x27;t sell it. They only have Raw (which is as effective as finger paints), which is a super bummer since SE is obviously the more superior hair dye... and I find it in major salon/hair stores. I had to resort to buying it online for 13 dollars, not bad! Took about a week to arrive. I only dyed the under side of my hair, which comes to a little past my shoulders, and I barely used any dye, so 13 or 14 dollars will last you a LONG time if this is relative to your hair style. If you&#x27;re gonna do whole head it&#x27;ll be more (recommended 1/2 a bottle for short hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will forever recommend this brand to anyone wanting a semi-perm of vibrant colors, especially if they don&#x27;t want to bleach their hair.</li>
            <li> The color is very bright when it comes on at first. It is a pink-based purple, meaning that the purple is actually a lot pinker than you would think looking at the bottle. There is very little staining of the tub as long as you keep water flowing over the spots where the color hits when you first wash it out. As someone whose hair doesn&#x27;t take dye very well, I&#x27;m happy to say that several weeks have passed and the dye still looks pretty nice, even though it seems a bit more orange now that the blonder parts of my bleached (originally black) hair are showing more. This dye fades very evenly, in terms of retaining its original color. I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> While this dye does bleed like crazy for a LONG time, when you&#x27;re doing these types of colors with vegan dye you should expect it. I LOVE special effects. I hadn&#x27;t used it in years, but since I&#x27;m trying to grow my hair out and avoid harsh dyes or bleach, I decided to go back to the bright colors. This comes out a fuchsia color at first and eventually fades into an awesome bright pink. It lasted in my hair several months. I have medium blonde hair and didn&#x27;t use bleach at all beforehand. If you&#x27;re looking for long lasting bright color give special effects a shot. I prefer it over manic panic or ion color brilliance because it lasts so much longer, but if this doesn&#x27;t work for you give them a shot.</li>
            <li> I love Special Effects dye! I don&#x27;t know why but it&#x27;s a bummer their dye has been discontinued because it is the best quality for alternative color hair dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curious about the color? Well here&#x27;s a picture of me: http://s11.postimg.org/4niub87ib/photo.jpg&lt;br /&gt;I did the color just last night. My hair has been dyed beforehand with a red(for blondes) but it had faded to a copper color with my roots darkening. I imagine if my hair was blonde or lighter it would be more pink because this is pink base but truly this is more of a pinky-violet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a truly pink color I recommend &amp;#34;Atomic Pink&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Cupcake Pink&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a truly purple color I recommend &amp;#34;Purple Smoke&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Pimpin Purple&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips anyone that dyes their hair alternative colors knows:&lt;br /&gt;•&amp;#34;ugh it only lasted a week&amp;#34;-DON&#x27;T WASH YOUR HAIR EVERYDAY. Also use cooler water and don&#x27;t slap a handful of shampoo on your hair (that&#x27;s bad for your hair anyways).&lt;br /&gt;•&amp;#34;It stains everything adhsfhtrsf!&amp;#34;-Uh yeah, the purpose of dye is to DYE things. Wear something you don&#x27;t mind getting stained and same for a towel. This goes for your pillow case too because it will rub off in your sleep!! •Accidentally got some on your skin/counter/sink/floor/wall use a cotton pad/ball/or towel with rubbing alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;•Cover your carpeting/concrete in case you drip or spill.&lt;br /&gt;•To keep it from getting on your skin, rub petroleum jelly(Vaseline) on your skin.</li>
            <li> This color is beautiful! I have gotten so many compliments on it. So far I&#x27;ve washed my hair  10 times since I applied the color and it hasn&#x27;t faded much at all!</li>
            <li> The color isnt really purple, its more like &amp;#34;fuscia&amp;#34;, but besides that, it is a wonderful hair color. Make sure the hair is pre-lightened (if you have naturally dark hair). The color is very vibrant (and very messy!) I have had it in my hair for a month and its still going strong. As the color first started to fade, it actually began to look brighter. As a professional hairdresser, i highly recommend this brand of hair color.</li>
            <li> I have been reading such good reviews about this product i just had to try it for myself. The colour is so vibrant and looks awesome in the sun! It&#x27;s very thick so it didn&#x27;t drip at all the only thing is that i couldn&#x27;t squeeze out the last bit so i ended up cutting the bottle and scooping out the last of it since i couldn&#x27;t bear to let it go to waste... I will most definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> This dye turns my gray hair purple, no bleaching needed.  It works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first dye my hair, the purple is very vivid and gets lots of compliments -- people really notice it.  Over about a week of daily hair-washing, it fades to hot pink.  Then the pink gradually gets paler over a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like it if the purple stayed vivid for longer than it does, but overall I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> MY FAVORITE. It looks so amazingly beautiful. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone looking for a gorgeous pinky color. Simply beautiful.</li>
            <li> Great color. Lasts at least 4 weeks true color then fades to vibrant pink which lasts for another 4 to 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> So this color looks NOTHING like the purple shown in the pic. It is more of a maroonish pink. VERY bright and holds well on bleached hair. I applied it diluted in conditioner and it is still super bright! I have washed it every other day for two weeks now and it has barely faded. Great product but you will have pink hair for quite some time.</li>
            <li> I am completely sold on the Special Effects brand.  Like many other reviewers, I am impressed with its staying-power, and it is true that a little goes a long way.  Compared to other brands I&#x27;ve tried, I feel the most confident with SFX in knowing I will get nice, even coverage.  Definitely need to bleach your hair first to get the true results of the dye, but that should be obvious.  The dyes are great for mixing and creating custom colors.  Everyone&#x27;s hair is different, but my hair just soaks up this color-- almost too much, I usually dilute it with mixer or conditioner a little to get a more subtle color.  I leave it on for 2 hours-- I probably could get away with just one hour, but I figure since I spent the time applying it I might as well wait another hour to ensure I get the results I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, I don&#x27;t have much trouble with color-bleeding on to clothes/pilllow-cases but I have fine hair, so I&#x27;m guessing if you have very thick hair this might be more prevalent.  As far as fading goes, on my hair I&#x27;ve found that blue shades fade fairly quickly on my hair but pink shades seem to last a long time.  I really love purple hair, but I mix in a pink shade, such as virgin rose, with the purple so that after the blue tones in the purple fade I will be left with a nice pink-y purple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dye is very potent and will stain *everything* if you aren&#x27;t careful.  I stained up my white sink and counter tops pretty badly, but don&#x27;t panic if that happens.  I got out the stains completely after trying a few different methods.  First tip: aerosol hairspray.  It&#x27;s magic on ink/dye stains on counter tops.  Just spray it directly on the stain and wipe off.  For deeper/darker stains you may need something stronger.  Second tip: Mr. Clean Magic Erasers.  Holy crap, these really are magic.  I shudder to think what kind of toxic stuff they make those things out of, but a Magic Eraser plus a little elbow grease will rub out most of those stains completely.  (I would recommend testing the eraser on a small area first because, depending on the type of surface, sometimes the eraser can clean &amp;#34;too well&amp;#34; and take off paint or enamel.) If you have a particularly stubborn stain, then go for a bathroom cleanser with bleach-- I soak a paper towel with Clorox Mold/Mildew spray and leave it on the spot for maybe 10 minutes, and the stain just disappears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, these dyes are awesome and I get compliments on my hair all the time.  My hair feels so soft and looks super shiny right after dying too-- it&#x27;s like a deep conditioning treatment and dye all in one.  Highly recommended, and super fun :)uld recommend testing the eraser on a small area first because, depending on the type of surface, sometimes the eraser can clean &amp;#34;too well&amp;#34; and take off paint or enamel.)

            <li> this stuff is amazing--i didn&#x27;t have to bleach my medium brown hair and it is MAGENTA. i don&#x27;t know why the spot in the picture is purple, &#x27;cause this isn&#x27;t a purple dye, however, it&#x27;s not just pink--it has a cold tone to it that makes it, well, magenta. at any rate, manic panic is a joke compared to this; that crap didn&#x27;t work for me AT ALL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;how i use this: i wash my hair with dish soap to get rid of all the oil, then dry it all the way with a dryer on high heat to open up the hair, then leave the dye on for only 25 minutes, and my hair is an amazing color. i am super happy with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i am only deducting a star because it washes out too fast. i&#x27;ve only been washing my hair with color-safe shampoo in really cold water every 3 days and after 4 or 5 washes it gets noticably faded. i&#x27;ve dyed it 3 times now in a 6-week span. i&#x27;ve tried 2 different shampoos, too. yet my tub is wrecked. the dye comes off of tile and porcelain pretty easily, but i have a plastic tub/shower and it&#x27;s destroyed. i haven&#x27;t tried bleach yet, but i figure i might as well wait till i&#x27;m done with dyeing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i just love the color and have gotten such a positive response from almost EVERYONE--even conservative people who don&#x27;t like wild colors and dyed hair in general just think the color is pretty and suits me.</li>
            <li> This dye came promptly and in easy to open packaging. The dye itself is not only a gorgeous color freshly dyed, but keeps developing into a pretty awesome shade of pink as it fades, I&#x27;ve had my hair dyed for months now and it is still VERY pink, the only reason I need to touch up is for roots.</li>
            <li> I switched to this after using Cleo Rose by Manic Panic, which is a great color but fades too quickly and gets brassy. I would compare this color to Manic Panic&#x27;s hot hot pink. I was told that Special Effects lasts longer than Manic Panic, but it did seem to fade a bit after one wash. I still think it&#x27;s better than MP. I love the color though- really vibrant and a great inbetween shade of hot pink and purple. Kind of a magenta.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful color, starts out a purple/pink and washes up to a vibrant Pink.  I was my hair everyday with hot water and I still can go for a month before retouching.  Every other brand washed out in days.  LOVE!!!! The brand &amp; color.</li>
            <li> I really love special effects, and this hair color works amazingly every time I use it.  It&#x27;s a nice purpley/pink, and fades to a pretty intense neon pink.  I always get lots of compliments on it as well.</li>
            <li> This starts out purple but it fades into an amazing hot pink, which makes me love it all the more!!!</li>
            <li> have been using it now many time and always get good responds ,people love it&lt;br /&gt;I use purple too at the same time and this two really compliment each other</li>
            <li> After using a semi-permanent dye from Manic Panic, I went on the hunt for a permanent hot pink dye.  I googled, and eventually came up with Special Effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally darkish-blonde hair, and my stylist decided we&#x27;d better strip out the parts of it that were going to be dyed pink.  We stripped the blonde bits and applied about 2/3 of the bottle of Virgin Rose, then left it on for 35 minutes before washing.  We definitely used too much dye--I had excess dye transferring off of my hair onto my brush, my fingers, my pillowcase, etc. for almost two weeks.  I&#x27;d say half the bottle is plenty, and my hair is medium-long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is electrically bright and barely faded at all during the 5 weeks I kept it on.  I had a few spots at the ends that were turning pinkish-orange, but they weren&#x27;t very noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The down side to all of this is that I decided to get rid of the pink, and it was difficult to impossible.  I had 25 minutes of bleaching to try to get the pink out, and it ended up looking like a My Little Pony tie-dye hell-scape.  Some areas ended up canary yellow, some were peach, and there were shades of pink from cotton candy to the original hot pink.  I could have tried another round of the bleach, but decided to just cover it all up with dark brown and save myself the damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moral of the story is that this dye flat-out WORKS.  Your hair will look amazing.  However, you&#x27;re making a long-term committment and you could end up with more than you bargained for to try to change the shade later on.</li>
            <li> I applied it full strength to bleached hair, left it on for about 90 minutes, and it came out looking great. It is a very intense and bright color that&#x27;s absolutely beautiul.&lt;br /&gt;When I was rinsing my hair for the first time after applying the dye, I spent a long time in the shower rinsing my head until the water ran clear. I think this may be helping with avoiding the trouble other people had with the dye rubbing off on other objects.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous color! This hair dye DOES bleed more than any other hair dye I have used (and I&#x27;ve used a lot), but it also fades a lot slower. I suggest not letting your hair get wet while wearing light colored clothing.</li>
