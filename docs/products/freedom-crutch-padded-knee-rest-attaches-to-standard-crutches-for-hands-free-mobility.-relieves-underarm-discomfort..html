            <li>Great job guys!</li>
            <li>Excellent customer service!</li>
            <li>Very happy</li>
            <li>With that additional stability, it&#x27;s been very good to</li>
            <li>Functionality wise, it rocks!</li>
            <li>it would be great if someone came up with a knee rest that attached to the crutch to take the pressure off the underarms.  </li>
            <li>These guys did it and they did a great job of it.  </li>
            <li>but once I did it was great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about 5&#x27;5&amp;#34; and it works great for me.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>and I am in good shape.  </li>
            <li>As soon as I attached to my good crutch I saw the flaw in the design.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very glad I bought this.</li>
            <li>Better to get a scooter!  </li>
            <li>very comfortable, good quality delivered on time and as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely the best!</li>
            <li>I have recommended this product to others, including my PT who liked it as well.</li>
            <li>You need some kind of padding on the edges in order not to scratch the cabinets if you get too close, or scratch your car getting the crutch in and out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really nice to have that</li>
            <li>The innovation is truly amazing in that by having a kneeling platform to help navigate while using crutches is most helpful.</li>
            <li>the price, I would have liked to have seen better knee padding.</li>
            <li>the more I liked it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame because this product is a great idea and works reasonably well.</li>
            <li>and it is a much better value, despite costing twice.</li>
            <li>I would love to see the edges covered or rounded.</li>
            <li>it seems that it tilted out at the top</li>
            <li>im working on putting a bar  across the crutch and a screw and bolt thro the top hole to pull it closer to the crutch.</li>
            <li>This having been said, I feel much more confident using this product that without it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Would have given this 5 five stars, if I could have been able to make it work as hoped for.  </li>
            <li>I do think the padding could be much better.</li>
            <li>if you use one crutch, therefore you will go through more crutch tips.</li>
            <li>It also wears out the top of the  boot if you use it quite a bit.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that I got it in advance of my surgery so that I&#x27;ll have time to play with it a little!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought about buying some youth crutches in my size (nevermind the fact that I&#x27;m 33), but paying for more crutches on top of the Freedom Crutch was getting pricey.</li>
            <li>I doubt most people would be graceful on this from the get</li>
            <li>It also would have been nice if this was available for Prime shipping.</li>
            <li>I think this would handle better since it would not be extended</li>
            <li>So make sure you know that it may not work in all scenarios.  </li>
            <li>This Knee rest worked as advertised but needed more padding.</li>
            <li>and it feels much better now.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this.</li>
            <li>I will probably go buy some foam from a craft store or maybe some gel knee pads to make it more comfortable at some</li>
            <li>Perhaps many might find the padding adequate., but I like it better now.</li>
            <li>I can easily balance on it to do makeup, laundry, cooking, etc.  </li>
            <li>Arrived very quick.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s not an easy task without using both arms.</li>
            <li>Over all this unit attached easily, and was well made and durable.</li>
            <li>The Freedom pad works as advertised and is a strong, sturdy device.  </li>
            <li>I like the knee rest, but had to modify the crutches so it will fit.  </li>
            <li>didnt fit the crutch i have</li>
            <li>I used two crutches to start and graduated to using just the Freedom Crutch for one hand free walking.  </li>
            <li>I loved the idea of helping vets by purchasing this product, and I wanted to have more mobility (like the ability to go downstairs) than with my knee scooter during a recent break.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to use just one crutch right away, it took some practice.</li>
            <li>so I am not suppose to be gripping with my right hand</li>
            <li>I looked at many alternatives for my non-load bearing walking requirements after ankle surgery, and this was a very simple and effective approach.  </li>
            <li>Freedom Crutch refunded my money in full and I returned the knee rest to them.  </li>
            <li>This item  - although priced MORE than the wheel chair we bought - has worked very well for a family member with a foot and lower leg in a cast.</li>
            <li>If you switch between low shoes like sandals or taller soled shoes like sneakers on your good foot, you may need to adjust the shelf.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve carried a full glass of water without spilling it now.</li>
            <li>/&gt;And if you are experiencing ANY pain under your arms while using crutches, you are either using them improperly or they don&#x27;t fit right.  </li>
            <li>lucky</li>
            <li>I was going give in and  try to drill a couple of new sets of holes in the crutches, but decided to try one more place--where I found a brand (SunMark) that worked for me.</li>
            <li>The design was OK, and it was easy enough to install on my crutch.</li>
            <li>I also used a steerable knee walker for most of my around the house movement, but for the times I went out, down stairs, on rough surfaces, this was the best solution for me.</li>
            <li>It is a simple straight forward design, well made, and in my opinion the safest and best knee crutch alternative because it is so easy to engage and disengage from your knee, while you have all the stability of a crutch and don&#x27;t have the danger of it being strapped to your body as some other knee crutch products do.  </li>
            <li>I now am not afraid of the stairs.  </li>
            <li>But once I got it, I immediately decided it was absolutely worth the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it out of the house, while on both crutches only 4 times, and have mostly been using inside the house and primarily on one crutch.  </li>
            <li>Two crutches were not cutting</li>
            <li>nice option to have, in addition to standard crutch.</li>
            <li>If you are short, be sure the crutches are the right fit</li>
            <li>My PT replaced it, but he didn&#x27;t put it on right</li>
            <li>use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that could be better - it&#x27;s made of sheet metal, and the edges, while not sharp, can still scrape car interiors and wood.</li>
            <li>Better for me to use with 2 crutches for balance.&lt;br /&gt;It is heavy duty, and easy to add to cruch!</li>
            <li>After a few weeks I was able to walk, do light housework, go grocery shopping, and carry light items with one crutch.</li>
            <li>As I live in a duplex this was a huge issue.</li>
            <li>I Still could not stabilize myself to use safely; but I have not given up on this design, as it may be a matter of my being overweight and the weakness in my arms and hands, is not helping as I just had surgery on my right hand, and its the left ankle that had the surgery</li>
            <li>/&gt;This arrived very fast.</li>
            <li>My husband duck-taped a four inch foam pad on top of it for comfort and that helps immensely.  </li>
            <li>but overall it will serve its purpose better than a walker which I would have to hop.  </li>
            <li>only negatives I can think of are:&lt;br /&gt;The knee pad itself could probably use a bit more cushioning.</li>
            <li>Again, not entirely the fault of the knee rest, but either the boot or the knee rest needs to be improved in this area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, ingenious.</li>
            <li>Works great, especially if standing for long periods.  </li>
            <li>After my first week on crutches, my hands felt bruised</li>
            <li>My hands are getting a much needed break!</li>
            <li>I used it for 6 weeks after first suffering for 4 weeks using a walker while I was non-weight bearing after ankle surgery.</li>
            <li>I used it when needed to provide some relief for my arm/wrists in supporting my body weight.  </li>
            <li>Very helpful!</li>
            <li>Whether the person will be able to use just one crutch remains to be seen - but having the knee rest does facilitate going about personal matters much easier and safer.</li>
            <li>We are not sorry at all about having this added to the list of homecare health appliances; an expenditure smartly made.</li>
            <li>The ability to use just one crutch and have the other hand free is fantastic.</li>
            <li>But I just didn&#x27;t find it easy enough to use with my cast.</li>
            <li>Ok for younger folk--not so much for those somewhat older...</li>
            <li>When I finally succeeded in getting them attached in a barely adequate fashion the metal knee rest gradually and steadily bent under my weight quickly making it unusable.  </li>
            <li>This has been a really helpful item for me while recovering from foot surgery.  </li>
            <li>The lock washers bite into aluminum crutches too much, preventing adjustment without a tool.</li>
            <li>I really like it...</li>
            <li>Because of this the knee rest flexed too much for a stable feeling.  </li>
            <li>some worked very well.  </li>
            <li>This add-on makes using the crutches so much easier.  </li>
            <li>Give yourself several days of use and adjust it as needed until you find what is comfortable and learn to walk with stability.</li>
            <li>Works very well, but is a bit overpriced for what it is.</li>
            <li>but now it works very well</li>
            <li>Looking right now to find the most heavy duty crutch tip I can find.</li>
            <li>I immediately attached it to the other crutch and resigned to use one crutch until able to walk again in 5 days.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m glad I spent the money to purchase this item, even better that it stated it was Veteran designed and made.</li>
            <li>but even then they&#x27;d likely use a wheelchair or specially adapted walker.</li>
            <li>I have to wear the boot and it rubs against the padding and the padding is starting to show wear after 3 weeks, but I am also more active than most according to my physical therapist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>More so now that the price has gone down.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re going to need to learn to balance safely at this odd angle.</li>
            <li>You do need to have some decent balance and build up some strength in that arm and the weight bearing leg to walk for any length of time.</li>
            <li>I ended up paying extra for shipping to get this in a few days which was fairly pricey.</li>
            <li>The price is high for what it</li>
            <li>However, I think the price is a bit high.</li>
            <li>When resting my knee on the padded knee rest, the top of the boot rubs against the padding, and can turn the little wheel that lets the air out of the boot.</li>
            <li>I felt just as unbalanced walking around my apartment as I did with just the crutches, so I decided it wasn&#x27;t worth the money for the couple weeks left before I could go into a boot.</li>
            <li>I recommend taking stairs with both crutches like you normally would without using the shelf.</li>
            <li>My plan is to find an easy way to tether my other crutch to the outside of the one with the Freedom Crutch installed, so I always have it with me and can easy switch from one handed Freedom Crutch to regular crutches whenever needed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am 5&#x27;5&amp;#34; and this meant that only two holes right together would hold it.  </li>
            <li>Installation WOULD have been simple if I were taller and/or had been given the right size crutches by my doctor.</li>
            <li>Maybe at some point I&#x27;ll master that, but right now I can&#x27;t figure out how to balance myself well enough to do that safely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had to drill new holes in the crutches in order for it to stabilize.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Some things to keep in mind for a new user:&lt;br /&gt; 1)</li>
            <li>I had to add a third screw set to the knee rest at the top for stability, and since I already had the knee rest up as high as it would go, I used a flat bar with screw holes at the back to brace the screw against the two arms of the crutch.</li>
            <li>Would only be better if it could fold it down when not needed.</li>
            <li>The kind of strap-on knee crutches that advertise that you can use two hands while walking; while, I can see that it can be done, are in my opinion much more dangerous and far more expensive.</li>
            <li>The rubber pad outgasses quite a bit - enough to smell up a whole room.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m a tall, big guy, and the knee rest was flexing a bit too much when I put my weight to it.</li>
            <li>a 62 yr old woman who could do this.</li>
            <li>My whole body was constantly sore.</li>
            <li>I had to adjust it a few times to get it at a comfortable height</li>
            <li>Seems like it should be easier to use once on, then it really turned out to be given the simple design, (according to photo and description).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As far as improvements needed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The iWalk seemed like a potential option, but was twice as much as this in cost and looked like the leg shelf was longer.</li>
            <li>I recommend picking what size sole shoe you&#x27;re gonna wear the whole time and sticking with that</li>
            <li>so hopefully it will not crack completely.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used crutches off and on for nearly twenty years</li>
            <li>and I wouldn&#x27;t go near this thing.</li>
            <li>I used a 4 inch thick soft sponge that really made the knee rest comfortable.  </li>
            <li>The Freedom Crutch is a far safer product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exhausting to be up walking for a couple hours, which I would not be able to do at all without this device,  but it can be done thanks to this knee</li>
            <li>I actually have a small hole in the top of my boot after 3 weeks of using it.</li>
            <li>and it would sit too high and not enough to attach to the crutch.  </li>
            <li>I spent the first two days using both crutches before I started practicing with one.</li>
            <li>If your hands/arms/back hurt using your crutches normally, you will feel instant relief in those areas using this!</li>
            <li>Overall, it is a very helpful item, with extra padding on it.</li>
            <li>It definitely made using crutches much better than without, for someone who could not put any weight down on the floor ,due to a major ankle break.</li>
            <li>That little bit of discomfort is definitely worth it to me.</li>
            <li>Also, the price is way too high for such a simple item.  </li>
            <li>Those are my only complains so far.</li>
            <li>There is a little bit of a learning curve on adjusting this to the right height and using it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Compared to the other options, I felt that the price was right and the product simple enough to use.  </li>
            <li>Even after asking my height (60&amp;#34;), I was given crutches that only adjusted down to 62&amp;#34; on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li>The first few days I added something else to help but after, I guess my knee got use to it</li>
            <li>This particular item was the most disappointing.  </li>
            <li>This is a neat addition to my crutches, and it really helps me maneuver with stability in tight areas.</li>
            <li>The Freedom Crutch allowed me to walk using the knee on my bad leg to support my weight immediately ending the stress and pain in my hip and good ankle.  </li>
            <li>The walker required me to hop every step causing stress and pain in my good ankle and to the hip opposite the bad ankle.  </li>

            <li> I like the knee rest, but had to modify the crutches so it will fit.  </li>
            <li> didnt fit the crutch i have</li>
            <li> I used two crutches to start and graduated to using just the Freedom Crutch for one hand free walking.  </li>
            <li> I loved the idea of helping vets by purchasing this product, and I wanted to have more mobility (like the ability to go downstairs) than with my knee scooter during a recent break.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to use just one crutch right away, it took some practice.</li>
            <li> so I am not suppose to be gripping with my right hand</li>
            <li> I looked at many alternatives for my non-load bearing walking requirements after ankle surgery, and this was a very simple and effective approach.  </li>
            <li> Freedom Crutch refunded my money in full and I returned the knee rest to them.  </li>
            <li> This item  - although priced MORE than the wheel chair we bought - has worked very well for a family member with a foot and lower leg in a cast.</li>
            <li> If you switch between low shoes like sandals or taller soled shoes like sneakers on your good foot, you may need to adjust the shelf.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve carried a full glass of water without spilling it now.</li>
            <li> /&gt;And if you are experiencing ANY pain under your arms while using crutches, you are either using them improperly or they don&#x27;t fit right.  </li>
            <li> lucky</li>
            <li> I was going give in and  try to drill a couple of new sets of holes in the crutches, but decided to try one more place--where I found a brand (SunMark) that worked for me.</li>
            <li> The design was OK, and it was easy enough to install on my crutch.</li>
            <li> I also used a steerable knee walker for most of my around the house movement, but for the times I went out, down stairs, on rough surfaces, this was the best solution for me.</li>
            <li> It is a simple straight forward design, well made, and in my opinion the safest and best knee crutch alternative because it is so easy to engage and disengage from your knee, while you have all the stability of a crutch and don&#x27;t have the danger of it being strapped to your body as some other knee crutch products do.  </li>
            <li> I now am not afraid of the stairs.  </li>
            <li> But once I got it, I immediately decided it was absolutely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it out of the house, while on both crutches only 4 times, and have mostly been using inside the house and primarily on one crutch.  </li>
            <li> Two crutches were not cutting</li>
            <li> nice option to have, in addition to standard crutch.</li>
            <li> If you are short, be sure the crutches are the right fit</li>
            <li> My PT replaced it, but he didn&#x27;t put it on right</li>
            <li> use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that could be better - it&#x27;s made of sheet metal, and the edges, while not sharp, can still scrape car interiors and wood.</li>
            <li> Better for me to use with 2 crutches for balance.&lt;br /&gt;It is heavy duty, and easy to add to cruch!</li>
            <li> After a few weeks I was able to walk, do light housework, go grocery shopping, and carry light items with one crutch.</li>
            <li> As I live in a duplex this was a huge issue.</li>
            <li> I Still could not stabilize myself to use safely; but I have not given up on this design, as it may be a matter of my being overweight and the weakness in my arms and hands, is not helping as I just had surgery on my right hand, and its the left ankle that had the surgery</li>
            <li> /&gt;This arrived very fast.</li>
            <li> My husband duck-taped a four inch foam pad on top of it for comfort and that helps immensely.  </li>
            <li> but overall it will serve its purpose better than a walker which I would have to hop.  </li>
            <li> only negatives I can think of are:&lt;br /&gt;The knee pad itself could probably use a bit more cushioning.</li>
            <li> Again, not entirely the fault of the knee rest, but either the boot or the knee rest needs to be improved in this area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, ingenious.</li>
            <li> Works great, especially if standing for long periods.  </li>
            <li> After my first week on crutches, my hands felt bruised</li>
            <li> My hands are getting a much needed break!</li>
            <li> I used it for 6 weeks after first suffering for 4 weeks using a walker while I was non-weight bearing after ankle surgery.</li>
            <li> I used it when needed to provide some relief for my arm/wrists in supporting my body weight.  </li>
            <li> Very helpful!</li>
            <li> Whether the person will be able to use just one crutch remains to be seen - but having the knee rest does facilitate going about personal matters much easier and safer.</li>
            <li> We are not sorry at all about having this added to the list of homecare health appliances; an expenditure smartly made.</li>
            <li> The ability to use just one crutch and have the other hand free is fantastic.</li>
            <li> But I just didn&#x27;t find it easy enough to use with my cast.</li>
            <li> Ok for younger folk--not so much for those somewhat older...</li>
            <li> When I finally succeeded in getting them attached in a barely adequate fashion the metal knee rest gradually and steadily bent under my weight quickly making it unusable.  </li>
            <li> This has been a really helpful item for me while recovering from foot surgery.  </li>
            <li> The lock washers bite into aluminum crutches too much, preventing adjustment without a tool.</li>
            <li> I really like it...</li>
            <li> Because of this the knee rest flexed too much for a stable feeling.  </li>
            <li> some worked very well.  </li>
            <li> This add-on makes using the crutches so much easier.  </li>
            <li> Give yourself several days of use and adjust it as needed until you find what is comfortable and learn to walk with stability.</li>
            <li> Works very well, but is a bit overpriced for what it is.</li>
            <li> but now it works very well</li>
            <li> Looking right now to find the most heavy duty crutch tip I can find.</li>
            <li> I immediately attached it to the other crutch and resigned to use one crutch until able to walk again in 5 days.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m glad I spent the money to purchase this item, even better that it stated it was Veteran designed and made.</li>
            <li> but even then they&#x27;d likely use a wheelchair or specially adapted walker.</li>
            <li> I have to wear the boot and it rubs against the padding and the padding is starting to show wear after 3 weeks, but I am also more active than most according to my physical therapist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> More so now that the price has gone down.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re going to need to learn to balance safely at this odd angle.</li>
            <li> You do need to have some decent balance and build up some strength in that arm and the weight bearing leg to walk for any length of time.</li>
            <li> I ended up paying extra for shipping to get this in a few days which was fairly pricey.</li>
            <li> The price is high for what it</li>
            <li> However, I think the price is a bit high.</li>
            <li> When resting my knee on the padded knee rest, the top of the boot rubs against the padding, and can turn the little wheel that lets the air out of the boot.</li>
            <li> I felt just as unbalanced walking around my apartment as I did with just the crutches, so I decided it wasn&#x27;t worth the money for the couple weeks left before I could go into a boot.</li>
            <li> I recommend taking stairs with both crutches like you normally would without using the shelf.</li>
            <li> My plan is to find an easy way to tether my other crutch to the outside of the one with the Freedom Crutch installed, so I always have it with me and can easy switch from one handed Freedom Crutch to regular crutches whenever needed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am 5&#x27;5&amp;#34; and this meant that only two holes right together would hold it.  </li>
            <li> Installation WOULD have been simple if I were taller and/or had been given the right size crutches by my doctor.</li>
            <li> Maybe at some point I&#x27;ll master that, but right now I can&#x27;t figure out how to balance myself well enough to do that safely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to drill new holes in the crutches in order for it to stabilize.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Some things to keep in mind for a new user:&lt;br /&gt; 1)</li>
            <li> I had to add a third screw set to the knee rest at the top for stability, and since I already had the knee rest up as high as it would go, I used a flat bar with screw holes at the back to brace the screw against the two arms of the crutch.</li>
            <li> Would only be better if it could fold it down when not needed.</li>
            <li> The kind of strap-on knee crutches that advertise that you can use two hands while walking; while, I can see that it can be done, are in my opinion much more dangerous and far more expensive.</li>
            <li> The rubber pad outgasses quite a bit - enough to smell up a whole room.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m a tall, big guy, and the knee rest was flexing a bit too much when I put my weight to it.</li>
            <li> a 62 yr old woman who could do this.</li>
            <li> My whole body was constantly sore.</li>
            <li> I had to adjust it a few times to get it at a comfortable height</li>
            <li> Seems like it should be easier to use once on, then it really turned out to be given the simple design, (according to photo and description).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As far as improvements needed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The iWalk seemed like a potential option, but was twice as much as this in cost and looked like the leg shelf was longer.</li>
            <li> I recommend picking what size sole shoe you&#x27;re gonna wear the whole time and sticking with that</li>
            <li> so hopefully it will not crack completely.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used crutches off and on for nearly twenty years</li>
            <li> and I wouldn&#x27;t go near this thing.</li>
            <li> I used a 4 inch thick soft sponge that really made the knee rest comfortable.  </li>
            <li> The Freedom Crutch is a far safer product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exhausting to be up walking for a couple hours, which I would not be able to do at all without this device,  but it can be done thanks to this knee</li>
            <li> I actually have a small hole in the top of my boot after 3 weeks of using it.</li>
            <li> and it would sit too high and not enough to attach to the crutch.  </li>
            <li> I spent the first two days using both crutches before I started practicing with one.</li>
            <li> If your hands/arms/back hurt using your crutches normally, you will feel instant relief in those areas using this!</li>
            <li> Overall, it is a very helpful item, with extra padding on it.</li>
            <li> It definitely made using crutches much better than without, for someone who could not put any weight down on the floor ,due to a major ankle break.</li>
            <li> That little bit of discomfort is definitely worth it to me.</li>
            <li> Also, the price is way too high for such a simple item.  </li>
            <li> Those are my only complains so far.</li>
            <li> There is a little bit of a learning curve on adjusting this to the right height and using it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Compared to the other options, I felt that the price was right and the product simple enough to use.  </li>
            <li> Even after asking my height (60&amp;#34;), I was given crutches that only adjusted down to 62&amp;#34; on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li> The first few days I added something else to help but after, I guess my knee got use to it</li>
            <li> This particular item was the most disappointing.  </li>
            <li> This is a neat addition to my crutches, and it really helps me maneuver with stability in tight areas.</li>
            <li> The Freedom Crutch allowed me to walk using the knee on my bad leg to support my weight immediately ending the stress and pain in my hip and good ankle.  </li>
            <li> The walker required me to hop every step causing stress and pain in my good ankle and to the hip opposite the bad ankle.  </li>
            <li> For a person using a crutch with a broken ankle who cannot put any weight at all on the foot, it is well worth the price!</li>
            <li> This will take a little practice to use properly--but probably less that some of the other devises out there since it&#x27;s based on using the old-fashioned crutches that we&#x27;re all familiar with</li>
            <li> This causes the bolts to jam as they tighten, because the bolts are slightly thicker near their head.</li>
            <li> A minor issue is that it ought to have flat washers for both ends of the bolts rather than one lock washer per bolt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a short person and my boot comes half way up my calf, there looked like there would be a painful overlap where the top of my boot would be on the leg</li>
            <li> You can even carry a drink if you move very slowly and very</li>
            <li> Not only is it vastly overpriced--for a simple piece of metal with a thin pad and two</li>
            <li> It just did  not work as well as I had expected.</li>
            <li> Another minor issue is this device caused my crutches to squeak, no matter how tight the bolts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a hands-free (peg leg) crutch</li>
            <li> However the padding is pretty useless on it.  </li>
            <li> I give it 5 stars for functionality, but 3 stars due to needing some improvements.</li>
            <li> One other thing I noticed was that I have two sets of crutches, one for 5&#x27;2&amp;#34;-5&#x27;10&amp;#34; and 5&#x27;9&amp;#34;-6&#x27;4&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Not many people with a temporary need for crutches can develop the balance and stability to walk on one leg with the other propped in such a manner as this device does.</li>
            <li> For that price they can make the edges less sharp.</li>
            <li> It is a bit over priced but still sells for less than other alternatives.</li>
            <li> Hard simply to use crutches, never mind adding this equipment to them.  </li>
            <li> 6 weeks without putting your foot down is hard enough.</li>
            <li> Works as described, too bad my cheap crutches snapped.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this can actually be used while on one crutch for any extended(longer than a few days)</li>
            <li> The most annoying thing about it for me are the metal edges.</li>
            <li> Use your other crutch with this for a while until you get your balanced figure out!</li>
            <li> If you buy the Freedom Crutch and find the knee rest a little on the hard side and abrasive to your bear knee, what I did was a simple and inexpensive fix.  </li>
            <li> I was not able to stabilize myself on the single crutch with my knee on the brace.  </li>
            <li> One thing I noticed was that the edges are very sharp and would damage anything it touched if you happened to brush against it.  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;It has enabled me to be less of a burden on my family, and given me some independence I wouldn&#x27;t otherwise have.</li>
            <li> Than after adding a couple of thigh straps to hold my leg/knee tight to the rest and crutch frame I tried again.  </li>
            <li> I have to say that at first I was not impressed as it was hard to work with, this took some time to get used to</li>
            <li> Seems like it needs to be offset a little.</li>
            <li> And I did put a few scratches on the furniture with the screws that stick</li>
            <li> did have some trouble finding crutches that it would work with.  </li>
            <li> and I was having trouble holding myself up correctly with them.</li>
            <li> The padding is hard, and not real comfortable.</li>
            <li> For using it over long periods of time, it can be uncomfortable due to pressure from the cast or boot on the leg.  </li>
            <li> I figure if it gets too bad at some point, I can switch back and forth between regular crutching and Freedom Crutching to let whichever part of me is sore get to rest.</li>
            <li> had replaced onto that hard pad.</li>
            <li> The odor isn&#x27;t bad when it&#x27;s inactive, only when you&#x27;re using it and for a few hours after.</li>
            <li> That being said, the knee/shin area where you rest your leg is going to get tender, at least until you get used to it and/or improve the padding.</li>
            <li> Perhaps an upholstered block of memory foam or at least a thicker foam pad than it came with.</li>
            <li> Then my foot slips down and is uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Both of which could lead to serious and irreparable damage.</li>
            <li> I had never used crutches before and for the first two weeks I was completely miserable.</li>
            <li> The fact that the platform is quite small and VERY hard made it impossible for me.</li>
            <li> The padding on the knee rest isn&#x27;t very thick, you&#x27;re going to need to beef up your padding!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The washers make it difficult to unscrew the wing nuts without a tool after being in place for a while.</li>
            <li> Each time your knee comes down on it, it pumps out sickening headache.</li>
            <li> but it borders on dangerous to the user.  </li>
            <li> In a desperate attempt to make things easier I went to google and stumbled on this knee rest.</li>
            <li> I applied a couple layers of Duct Tape on the edges to mitigate that, they should be reviewing this as it could be dangerous to my 9 mo/old child if I would not have done this.  </li>
            <li> It appears to be awkward and unsafe.</li>
            <li> My height and my crutch and the location of the holes on the Rest were almost impossible to line up.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that bad.</li>
            <li> I hate putting my knee which ive</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This has been a really helpful item for me while recovering from foot surgery.  I can easily balance on it to do makeup, laundry, cooking, etc.  However the padding is pretty useless on it.  My husband duck-taped a four inch foam pad on top of it for comfort and that helps immensely.  For using it over long periods of time, it can be uncomfortable due to pressure from the cast or boot on the leg.  Also, the price is way too high for such a simple item.  This knee rest fitted on my regular crutches with no issue there are plenty of holes for screwing it in.  However, I actually have this on my Mobilegs crutches and that was a problem because it didn&#x27;t have enough holes in it.  Hubby had drill extra holes and add fasteners.  I am very short so this may no be an issue for anyone taller.  Overall, it is a very helpful item, with extra padding on it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best! If one ever has a condition where you cannot put weight on your foot BUY this product. I would suggest a knee pad.</li>
            <li> The rubber pad outgasses quite a bit - enough to smell up a whole room. Each time your knee comes down on it, it pumps out sickening headache. It smells like neoprene. The odor isn&#x27;t bad when it&#x27;s inactive, only when you&#x27;re using it and for a few hours after. The smell is a deal killer. It&#x27;s that bad. It&#x27;s a shame because this product is a great idea and works reasonably well. The ability to use just one crutch and have the other hand free is fantastic. You can even carry a drink if you move very slowly and very carefully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The overall quality is not in line with the price. A minor issue is that it ought to have flat washers for both ends of the bolts rather than one lock washer per bolt. The holes are just barely big enough for the bolts, presumably to minimize play. This causes the bolts to jam as they tighten, because the bolts are slightly thicker near their head. The lock washers bite into aluminum crutches too much, preventing adjustment without a tool. Another minor issue is this device caused my crutches to squeak, no matter how tight the bolts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a hands-free (peg leg) crutch and it is a much better value, despite costing twice.</li>
            <li> This is a neat addition to my crutches, and it really helps me maneuver with stability in tight areas. However, I&#x27;m a tall, big guy, and the knee rest was flexing a bit too much when I put my weight to it. I had to add a third screw set to the knee rest at the top for stability, and since I already had the knee rest up as high as it would go, I used a flat bar with screw holes at the back to brace the screw against the two arms of the crutch. With that additional stability, it&#x27;s been very good to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that could be better - it&#x27;s made of sheet metal, and the edges, while not sharp, can still scrape car interiors and wood. I would love to see the edges covered or rounded. I have considered lining mine with gaffer tape to avoid damaging things.</li>
            <li> Works as described, too bad my cheap crutches snapped.</li>
            <li> The last time I was on crutches I thought to myself...it would be great if someone came up with a knee rest that attached to the crutch to take the pressure off the underarms.  These guys did it and they did a great job of it.  I really like it...it does everything they say it does.  Great job guys!</li>
            <li> I got it hoping I wouldn&#x27;t have to redrill holes but I did. lucky im a 62 yr old woman who could do this. not everyone can. it seems that it tilted out at the top and im worried it will pull on the 2 screws holding it on.  im working on putting a bar  across the crutch and a screw and bolt thro the top hole to pull it closer to the crutch. it also needs to come with a pad cover. I hate putting my knee which ive had replaced onto that hard pad. but overall it will serve its purpose better than a walker which I would have to hop.  .picture a 200 lb woman hopping . no way your crutch will make it easier to get around. 6 weeks without putting your foot down is hard enough. looking to make this work for me.</li>
            <li> I like the knee rest, but had to modify the crutches so it will fit.  I am 5&#x27;5&amp;#34; and this meant that only two holes right together would hold it.  Because of this the knee rest flexed too much for a stable feeling.  I had to drill new holes in the crutches in order for it to stabilize.  I also had to make a pad because after a while the surface of the knee rest hurt my knee.  This having been said, I feel much more confident using this product that without it.  I now am not afraid of the stairs.  As I live in a duplex this was a huge issue. I have recommended this product to others, including my PT who liked it as well.</li>
            <li> I am 6&#x27;2&#x27;&#x27; tall and weigh 215 lbs and I am in good shape.  I got a foot operation and had to stay off one foot for 2 months. I progressively tried five of the basic implements advertised by Amazon to help me deal with the inconvenience--some worked very well.  This particular item was the most disappointing.  Not only is it vastly overpriced--for a simple piece of metal with a thin pad and two screws-- but it borders on dangerous to the user.  My height and my crutch and the location of the holes on the Rest were almost impossible to line up.  When I finally succeeded in getting them attached in a barely adequate fashion the metal knee rest gradually and steadily bent under my weight quickly making it unusable.  This design may have some utility for the claimed purpose  but it needs a lot of basic engineering work.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Freedom Crutch Knee Rest back in February. I slipped on ice and suffered multiple fractures and a torn ligament in my ankle so I was non weight bearing. I had never used crutches before and for the first two weeks I was completely miserable. I just could not get the hang of it. My whole body was constantly sore. In a desperate attempt to make things easier I went to google and stumbled on this knee rest. I ordered it and it arrived a couple of days later. I had to adjust it a few times to get it at a comfortable height but once I did it was great. I wasn&#x27;t able to use just one crutch right away, it took some practice. I spent the first two days using both crutches before I started practicing with one. by the fourth day I had it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negatives I can think of are:&lt;br /&gt;The knee pad itself could probably use a bit more cushioning. The first few days I added something else to help but after, I guess my knee got use to it and it stopped bothering me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The washers make it difficult to unscrew the wing nuts without a tool after being in place for a while. And I did put a few scratches on the furniture with the screws that stick out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw another review that mentioned something about an odor. My pad had no smell at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I recommend it to anyone who has to deal with crutches. I was reluctant because of the price. When I got it it was $99. But once I got it, I immediately decided it was absolutely worth the price. More so now that the price has gone down.</li>
            <li> Seems like it should be easier to use once on, then it really turned out to be given the simple design, (according to photo and description).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;still I was not able to stabilize myself on the single crutch with my knee on the brace.  I even tried it with the second crutch, and I was still to unstable.  Than after adding a couple of thigh straps to hold my leg/knee tight to the rest and crutch frame I tried again.  I Still could not stabilize myself to use safely; but I have not given up on this design, as it may be a matter of my being overweight and the weakness in my arms and hands, is not helping as I just had surgery on my right hand, and its the left ankle that had the surgery so I am not suppose to be gripping with my right hand yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would have given this 5 five stars, if I could have been able to make it work as hoped for.  I am keeping this, and will continue to explore ways to make it usable with some additional tinkering as my strength and grip return.</li>
            <li> I give it 5 stars for functionality, but 3 stars due to needing some improvements. Functionality wise, it rocks! I&#x27;m about 5&#x27;5&amp;#34; and it works great for me.  It does take some getting used to, but you can get to where you can walk with 1 crutch without putting any weight on that foot. You do need to have some decent balance and build up some strength in that arm and the weight bearing leg to walk for any length of time. After a few weeks I was able to walk, do light housework, go grocery shopping, and carry light items with one crutch. It&#x27;s exhausting to be up walking for a couple hours, which I would not be able to do at all without this device,  but it can be done thanks to this knee rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  As far as improvements needed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  The price is high for what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I do think the padding could be much better. I have to wear the boot and it rubs against the padding and the padding is starting to show wear after 3 weeks, but I am also more active than most according to my physical therapist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. You put  all of your weight on that crutch tip if you use one crutch, therefore you will go through more crutch tips. I went through a tip in 3 weeks. Looking right now to find the most heavy duty crutch tip I can find. My PT replaced it, but he didn&#x27;t put it on right and it blew in one day. This may have nothing to do with the crutch pad, just throwing that out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The most annoying thing about it for me are the metal edges. For that price they can make the edges less sharp. You need some kind of padding on the edges in order not to scratch the cabinets if you get too close, or scratch your car getting the crutch in and out. Or scratching anything you may run into with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. When resting my knee on the padded knee rest, the top of the boot rubs against the padding, and can turn the little wheel that lets the air out of the boot. Then my foot slips down and is uncomfortable. It also wears out the top of the  boot if you use it quite a bit. I actually have a small hole in the top of my boot after 3 weeks of using it. Again, not entirely the fault of the knee rest, but either the boot or the knee rest needs to be improved in this area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, ingenious. Absolutely love it.&lt;br /&gt;It has enabled me to be less of a burden on my family, and given me some independence I wouldn&#x27;t otherwise have.</li>
            <li> Works great, especially if standing for long periods.  If you are short, be sure the crutches are the right fit so you can attach the leg rest.</li>
            <li> This will take a little practice to use properly--but probably less that some of the other devises out there since it&#x27;s based on using the old-fashioned crutches that we&#x27;re all familiar with. I&#x27;m glad that I got it in advance of my surgery so that I&#x27;ll have time to play with it a little!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have some trouble finding crutches that it would work with.  Because I am short, once I&#x27;d adjusted the crutches for my (lack of) height there were no open holes left! I was going give in and  try to drill a couple of new sets of holes in the crutches, but decided to try one more place--where I found a brand (SunMark) that worked for me. This is probably a very individual thing though...so shop around. That being said, I&#x27;d still buy the Freedom Crutch--or recommend it to anyone. I think that I&#x27;ll get a lot of use out of it.</li>
            <li> The design was OK, and it was easy enough to install on my crutch. I loved the idea of helping vets by purchasing this product, and I wanted to have more mobility (like the ability to go downstairs) than with my knee scooter during a recent break. But I just didn&#x27;t find it easy enough to use with my cast. I felt just as unbalanced walking around my apartment as I did with just the crutches, so I decided it wasn&#x27;t worth the money for the couple weeks left before I could go into a boot. I felt safer on the knee scooter.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use crutches, I&#x27;m just not coordinated enough. This didn&#x27;t help. The fact that the platform is quite small and VERY hard made it impossible for me. I returned it.</li>
            <li> **Update** Freedom Crutch refunded my money in full and I returned the knee rest to them.  Excellent customer service!**  I have been using this product for 16 days and today my crutch broke.  I followed the install and use instructions that came with it and watched the video.  I&#x27;ve used it out of the house, while on both crutches only 4 times, and have mostly been using inside the house and primarily on one crutch.  This morning, while on the one crutch with the Freedom Crutch attached, my crutch broke, bending underneath the plate.  I immediately attached it to the other crutch and resigned to use one crutch until able to walk again in 5 days.  As soon as I attached to my good crutch I saw the flaw in the design.  When walking on one crutch using the Freedom Crutch, the crutch is parallel to the body, this causes the crutch to bow out in an arch, thus putting a lot of pressure at the weakest point of the crutch. I&#x27;m not sure if this can actually be used while on one crutch for any extended(longer than a few days) length of time without the crutch breaking.</li>
            <li> very comfortable, good quality delivered on time and as advertised.  Very happy</li>
            <li> The Freedom pad works as advertised and is a strong, sturdy device.  It is a bit over priced but still sells for less than other alternatives.</li>
            <li> Ok for younger folk--not so much for those somewhat older... Hard simply to use crutches, never mind adding this equipment to them.  Better to get a scooter!  (You can get one that you rest your shin on and it works great!)&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;m 5&#x27;4&amp;#34; and the lowest position it can be in on the crutch wasn&#x27;t low enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;Had to return it.</li>
            <li> didnt fit the crutch i have</li>
            <li> This add-on makes using the crutches so much easier.  It was delivered on time, and was well made.  I presume that each one is made as an order comes in,  and I appreciate the work that goes into it.  However, I think the price is a bit high.</li>
            <li> This item  - although priced MORE than the wheel chair we bought - has worked very well for a family member with a foot and lower leg in a cast. The innovation is truly amazing in that by having a kneeling platform to help navigate while using crutches is most helpful. Whether the person will be able to use just one crutch remains to be seen - but having the knee rest does facilitate going about personal matters much easier and safer. We are not sorry at all about having this added to the list of homecare health appliances; an expenditure smartly made. However, I do think that when comparing the wheel chair we bought to this item, one does come away with the feeling that it is not only the knee rest that is padded - so is the price.</li>
            <li> It just did  not work as well as I had expected.</li>
            <li> After my first week on crutches, my hands felt bruised and I was having trouble holding myself up correctly with them. My arms hurt, my shoulders hurt, my back hurt....I felt like I got hit by a bus! I Not to mention  crutches make you almost helpless. You can&#x27;t go get yourself a glass of water and carry it. Same with fixing yourself a plate of food and trying to figure out how to get it to the table. I looked into getting a knee scooter, but with steps going into my house in both the front and back, and stairs to the only bathroom in the house, not to mention a gravel parking lot at work, there just wasn&#x27;t enough areas for me to use it on to justify the expense. The iWalk seemed like a potential option, but was twice as much as this in cost and looked like the leg shelf was longer. I&#x27;m a short person and my boot comes half way up my calf, there looked like there would be a painful overlap where the top of my boot would be on the leg shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This arrived very fast. Installation WOULD have been simple if I were taller and/or had been given the right size crutches by my doctor. Even after asking my height (60&amp;#34;), I was given crutches that only adjusted down to 62&amp;#34; on the lowest setting. This meant I had no open holes to install the bolts for the Freedom Crutch. I thought about buying some youth crutches in my size (nevermind the fact that I&#x27;m 33), but paying for more crutches on top of the Freedom Crutch was getting pricey. I opted to drill extra holes in my existing crutches and that worked out great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some things to keep in mind for a new user:&lt;br /&gt; 1) Use your other crutch with this for a while until you get your balanced figure out! The knee shelf sits inward from the point of contact on the ground with the crutches. You&#x27;re going to need to learn to balance safely at this odd angle. I recommend taking stairs with both crutches like you normally would without using the shelf. Maybe at some point I&#x27;ll master that, but right now I can&#x27;t figure out how to balance myself well enough to do that safely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) There is a little bit of a learning curve on adjusting this to the right height and using it. If you switch between low shoes like sandals or taller soled shoes like sneakers on your good foot, you may need to adjust the shelf. I recommend picking what size sole shoe you&#x27;re gonna wear the whole time and sticking with that once you get the shelf adjusted right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) The padding on the knee rest isn&#x27;t very thick, you&#x27;re going to need to beef up your padding! I&#x27;ve only had it for two days now, currently improvising with a dish towel and one of my husbands work knee pads. I will probably go buy some foam from a craft store or maybe some gel knee pads to make it more comfortable at some point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) If your hands/arms/back hurt using your crutches normally, you will feel instant relief in those areas using this! You really only need to use your hands to lift up the crutch to move it forward, not to lift your bodyweight on anymore. My hands are getting a much needed break! That being said, the knee/shin area where you rest your leg is going to get tender, at least until you get used to it and/or improve the padding. That little bit of discomfort is definitely worth it to me. I figure if it gets too bad at some point, I can switch back and forth between regular crutching and Freedom Crutching to let whichever part of me is sore get to rest. It&#x27;s really nice to have that option!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) You can use this one handed once you get the hang of it. I&#x27;ve carried a full glass of water without spilling it now. It takes practice. Give yourself several days of use and adjust it as needed until you find what is comfortable and learn to walk with stability. I doubt most people would be graceful on this from the get go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very glad I bought this. I have at least a few more weeks of no weight bearing activity left on my foot and I wasn&#x27;t going to survive with standard crutches alone. My plan is to find an easy way to tether my other crutch to the outside of the one with the Freedom Crutch installed, so I always have it with me and can easy switch from one handed Freedom Crutch to regular crutches whenever needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I would have liked to have seen better knee padding. Perhaps an upholstered block of memory foam or at least a thicker foam pad than it came with. It also would have been nice if this was available for Prime shipping. For someone with an injury, waiting an extra week for some for relief to arrive is excruciating. I ended up paying extra for shipping to get this in a few days which was fairly pricey. Those are my only complains so far. Great product.</li>
            <li> Works very well, but is a bit overpriced for what it is. For a person using a crutch with a broken ankle who cannot put any weight at all on the foot, it is well worth the price!</li>
            <li> The padding is hard, and not real comfortable. Could get some sores with extended use. Could add cush to it but shouldnt have to for the price. Seems like it needs to be offset a little. Could make it possible to adjust an offset with some different hole locations. Better for me to use with 2 crutches for balance.&lt;br /&gt;It is heavy duty, and easy to add to cruch! Arrived very quick.</li>
            <li> Ordered as I suffered a Lisfranc Injury to my left foot.  Two crutches were not cutting so I found this tool along with another knee walker.  I have to say that at first I was not impressed as it was hard to work with, this took some time to get used to but now it works very well and I can around with it.  One thing I noticed was that the edges are very sharp and would damage anything it touched if you happened to brush against it.  I applied a couple layers of Duct Tape on the edges to mitigate that, they should be reviewing this as it could be dangerous to my 9 mo/old child if I would not have done this.  One other thing I noticed was that I have two sets of crutches, one for 5&#x27;2&amp;#34;-5&#x27;10&amp;#34; and 5&#x27;9&amp;#34;-6&#x27;4&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;ve been using the smaller set as I&#x27;m in the 5&#x27;9&amp;#34; range and they are extended out which leaves room to install the freedom crutch but it puts a lot of stress on it.  I did notice that the aluminum is cracked on one side of the tube already so hopefully it will not crack completely.  On the larger crutches (I borrowed) I think this would handle better since it would not be extended but since it not extended there are no holes (unless I drilled them) to attach.  That and it would sit too high and not enough to attach to the crutch.  So make sure you know that it may not work in all scenarios.  Overall, I&#x27;m glad I spent the money to purchase this item, even better that it stated it was Veteran designed and made.</li>
            <li> nice option to have, in addition to standard crutch.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product and, in fact, would not even consider it. It appears to be awkward and unsafe. I&#x27;ve used crutches off and on for nearly twenty years and I wouldn&#x27;t go near this thing. It seems to me it would throw off your balance while walking, and without another crutch to stabilize you. I&#x27;ve often used only one crutch but as an aide, not as a means of walking. While using this device you still have to hop on one leg to get anywhere and that&#x27;s not an easy task without using both arms. People do that out of necessity if they have injured both an arm and a leg but even then they&#x27;d likely use a wheelchair or specially adapted walker. Not many people with a temporary need for crutches can develop the balance and stability to walk on one leg with the other propped in such a manner as this device does. Not in the time it would take for a temporary injury to heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if you are experiencing ANY pain under your arms while using crutches, you are either using them improperly or they don&#x27;t fit right.  Both of which could lead to serious and irreparable damage.</li>
            <li> This Knee rest worked as advertised but needed more padding. I added 1/2&amp;#34; of neoprene and it feels much better now.Over all this unit attached easily, and was well made and durable. Perhaps many might find the padding adequate., but I like it better now. It definitely made using crutches much better than without, for someone who could not put any weight down on the floor ,due to a major ankle break. I can&#x27;t imagine going two months on crutches without this knee rest.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this. Great product.  Fairly low price.  I used it for 6 weeks after first suffering for 4 weeks using a walker while I was non-weight bearing after ankle surgery. The walker required me to hop every step causing stress and pain in my good ankle and to the hip opposite the bad ankle.  The Freedom Crutch allowed me to walk using the knee on my bad leg to support my weight immediately ending the stress and pain in my hip and good ankle.  I had to add extra padding to the knee rest, but that was not a problem.  I used a 4 inch thick soft sponge that really made the knee rest comfortable.  If you buy the Freedom Crutch and find the knee rest a little on the hard side and abrasive to your bear knee, what I did was a simple and inexpensive fix.  The longer I used the Freedom Crutch the more I liked it and I became proficient in getting around.  It is a simple straight forward design, well made, and in my opinion the safest and best knee crutch alternative because it is so easy to engage and disengage from your knee, while you have all the stability of a crutch and don&#x27;t have the danger of it being strapped to your body as some other knee crutch products do.  The Freedom Crutch is a far safer product.  I used two crutches to start and graduated to using just the Freedom Crutch for one hand free walking.  The kind of strap-on knee crutches that advertise that you can use two hands while walking; while, I can see that it can be done, are in my opinion much more dangerous and far more expensive.</li>
            <li> I looked at many alternatives for my non-load bearing walking requirements after ankle surgery, and this was a very simple and effective approach.  I used it when needed to provide some relief for my arm/wrists in supporting my body weight.  I am over 250 lbs and found that it worked well for me, for the intermittent use I needed it for.&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the other options, I felt that the price was right and the product simple enough to use.  I also used a steerable knee walker for most of my around the house movement, but for the times I went out, down stairs, on rough surfaces, this was the best solution for me.</li>
            <li> Very helpful! Rap. When doing stairs an around the house.  Have showed it all our friends!  Would only be better if it could fold it down when not needed.</li>
