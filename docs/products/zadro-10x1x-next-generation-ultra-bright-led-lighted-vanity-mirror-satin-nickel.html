            <li>that was just as good as this one..</li>
            <li>Good lighting and magnification for make-up.  </li>
            <li>She loved it, but it broke after a year.</li>
            <li>This mirror is a good height</li>
            <li>The magnification is good.</li>
            <li>My family liked the lighted mirror as it is bright but the lights started not working after a couple of months.</li>
            <li>I love this mirror!</li>
            <li>Great looking mirror...arrived with the light not working.</li>
            <li>Its not as bright as it said it would be, and i must use a goose neck lamp to suplement the light so that i can use the mirror.</li>
            <li>I loved the mirror until the light went out.</li>
            <li>but it does have a quality issue with the LED switch, very cheap switch</li>
            <li>Very stylish and clean appearance.</li>
            <li>so I was concerned the mirror might be damaged, but it seems to be ok.</li>
            <li>Sure helps bring everything into focus.</li>
            <li>The 10X magnification reveals even the tiniest skin imperfections, which I can now confidently conceal.</li>
            <li>Surely whomever shipped  </li>
            <li>The light on this mirror went out before I had had it a year!</li>
            <li>It really is super bright, stylish, and the white light is just wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Magnification is great and the light is soft and uniform.</li>
            <li>Purchased this in March of 2013, worked fine until about a month ago when it started buzzing every time I turned it on.</li>
            <li>The light will not come on anymore.</li>
            <li>This mirror worked well until light stopped working.</li>
            <li>The light stopped working January 26, 2014.</li>
            <li>So now I will buy another, but a cheap one.</li>
            <li>the look, the magnification and the light.  </li>
            <li>I did not want a fluorescent mirror because fluorescent light does not show true color.  </li>
            <li>light Flickered from the first time I turned it on.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is my hopes that you will replace my vanity mirror, that I purchased after reading on your site that the bulbs do not need replacing, and that they last a &amp;#34;lifetime.&amp;#34; I certainly did not expect them to last a lifetime, even 5 years would have been great...</li>
            <li>First I ordered replacement bulbs, ha ha.</li>
            <li>the light bulb goes dim</li>
            <li>Imagine my surprise when this make-up mirror arrived and it was exactly what they said.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be back if mine breaks as many of the&lt;br /&gt;reviews</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing what I had been missing with my makeup application</li>
            <li>tne product is just what i wanted and i can see really well.</li>
            <li>The box was really torn up</li>
            <li>The LED light does not hurt my eyes or leave an after-image like regular bulbs did.</li>
            <li>then you couldn&#x27;t see your whole face.</li>
            <li>AMAZON- READ THESE 1-STAR REVIEWS!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;lifetime&amp;#34; light lasted only 3 months for us.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this make-up mirror.  </li>
            <li>respond and let me know if you will back up your guarantee written as this would be the right thing to do.</li>
            <li>Live and learn.</li>
            <li>Then last week, October 1st, it buzzed and light went out never to come back on.</li>
            <li>When I asked what they could do about it she said talk to the retailer (Amazon) and let them know they probably have old stock.</li>
            <li>The switch just burned out and cannot be fixed.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and heavy enough to stand alone without movement.</li>
            <li>I loved this mirror, and other friends of mine have this and have not experienced this problem.&lt;br /&gt;Please</li>
            <li>Reviews were mixed, but so far I&lt;br /&gt;like</li>
            <li>I loved (past tense)</li>
            <li>The only negative that I would report is if you barely touch it the light goes off.</li>
            <li>When I called Zadro and spoke to a woman in customer service she quickly said it was the ballast circuitry, as though these were common problems.</li>

            <li> Guarntee  from Zadro is only a 90 day limited warranty.</li>
            <li> Bought a very similar one at Bed Bath and Beyond for $120 minus the 20% coupon, so $96.  </li>
            <li> The magnified side is a little aggeravating, as you have to move your face around a little to get a clear view, but it is so magnified, you see everything!!</li>
            <li> is only on for less than 30 minutes!</li>
            <li> The magnified side is frightening at first.</li>
            <li> and I had tried other LED make-up mirrors</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what to say yet except the subject line.  </li>
            <li> Not bright enough!</li>
            <li> Not bright enough and returned it.</li>
            <li> but they were not bright enough.  </li>
            <li> Well everyone I know will be informed how bad this item really is.</li>
            <li> Disappointed that this mirror was functional for such a short period of time.  </li>
            <li> You will waste your money on this mirror!</li>
            <li> I have purchased 2 of these mirrors in the past two years.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed that this mirror has already quit getting bright:-(.</li>
            <li> Just not worth being stupid a 3rd time.</li>
            <li> Amazon, you&#x27;re not much better if you allow this defective product to continue being sold, and deny return requests for those items that advertise falsely.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed for such an expensive mirror.</li>
            <li> Amazon should stop offering this product, it makes for bad customer service for them.</li>
            <li> Bad customer service and unreliable product...</li>
            <li> and it went out in Feb:(</li>
            <li> I hate having to pay for their defective product.</li>
            <li> Zadro is bad!  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Bought a very similar one at Bed Bath and Beyond for $120 minus the 20% coupon, so $96.  Works great and just what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/store/product/zadro-10x-1x-super-bright-luxury-vanity-mirror/1040056845</li>
            <li> Bought this mirror for make up but just switched to contact lenses &amp; have found it invaluable for inserting them. It&#x27;s amazing what I had been missing with my makeup application</li>
            <li> tne product is just what i wanted and i can see really well. The box was really torn up so I was concerned the mirror might be damaged, but it seems to be ok.</li>
            <li> Sure helps bring everything into focus.</li>
            <li> Durable and functional. Easy to use and heavy enough to stand alone without movement. The magnified side is frightening at first.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed that this mirror has already quit getting bright:-(. It has never left the bedroom dresser doesn&#x27;t even get used daily and when used is only on for less than 30 minutes!</li>
            <li> Not bright enough! Returned.</li>
            <li> The magnified side is a little aggeravating, as you have to move your face around a little to get a clear view, but it is so magnified, you see everything!! lol The LED is so bright! Love it!!</li>
            <li> Really bright, good quality mirror.</li>
            <li> I loved (past tense) this mirror!! The on/off switch was always a bit problematic.  The switch stopped working altogether 9 months after I bought it.  Disappointed that this mirror was functional for such a short period of time.  I would NOT recommend buying it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mirror February 13, 2013 and now it stopped working! The light will not come on anymore. I will never purchase this brand again! Buyer beware! You will waste your money on this mirror!</li>
            <li> Very good. The only negative that I would report is if you barely touch it the light goes off.</li>
            <li> This mirror worked well until light stopped working. Supposedly LED bulb never would need to be replaced. I purchased September 21, 2013. The light stopped working January 26, 2014. Only four months later.&lt;br /&gt;For the price, not acceptable. Amazon, what will you do to rectify this problem.</li>
            <li> I have purchased 2 of these mirrors in the past two years. When they work, they are awesome. But then it goes off and stays off. First I ordered replacement bulbs, ha ha. My electrician said it was the ballast. Just not worth being stupid a 3rd time. Still looking for a replacement.</li>
            <li> My wife likes the mirror but it does have a quality issue with the LED switch, very cheap switch, I had to repair the switch myself after only 2 months of use.</li>
            <li> Amazing product: Don&#x27;t know how I got along without one all these years! The LED light does not hurt my eyes or leave an after-image like regular bulbs did. The 10X magnification reveals even the tiniest skin imperfections, which I can now confidently conceal. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Purchased this in March of 2013, worked fine until about a month ago when it started buzzing every time I turned it on. Then last week, October 1st, it buzzed and light went out never to come back on. For the price this is unacceptable. Guarntee  from Zadro is only a 90 day limited warranty. Well everyone I know will be informed how bad this item really is. Amazon should stop offering this product, it makes for bad customer service for them.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror! Great light and perfect magnification. I researched mirrors and decided on this one, just perfect for me!</li>
            <li> light Flickered from the first time I turned it on.  Surely whomever shipped  this knew it was defective, Just didnt appreciate the hassle of several hours chhosing one, combing the net then having to repack and return.&lt;br /&gt;like looking for the holy grail....locating a make up mirroe that has bright lite And magnified.</li>
            <li> Its not as bright as it said it would be, and i must use a goose neck lamp to suplement the light so that i can use the mirror. I purchased one for 50 bucks at Sally&#x27;s that was just as good as this one.. I should have just kept that one. Live and learn. I will only buy books from amazon from now on.</li>
            <li> My family liked the lighted mirror as it is bright but the lights started not working after a couple of months. Very disappointed for such an expensive mirror. I called their customer service number to initiate a product return. I have to pay for shipping, pay an additional $10 for \\&quot;processing\\&quot; and was told the return will take about 4 weeks. I hate having to pay for their defective product. 1 Star.</li>
            <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is my hopes that you will replace my vanity mirror, that I purchased after reading on your site that the bulbs do not need replacing, and that they last a &amp;#34;lifetime.&amp;#34; I certainly did not expect them to last a lifetime, even 5 years would have been great...but after 4 1/2 months, this is unacceptable. I loved this mirror, and other friends of mine have this and have not experienced this problem.&lt;br /&gt;Please respond and let me know if you will back up your guarantee written as this would be the right thing to do.</li>
            <li> wILL NEVER ORDER ZADRO AGAIN  LIGHTS BURNED OUT AND REPLACEMENT BULBS I ORDERED DIDNT TAKE CARE OF PROBLEM  I WAS A SAP AND ORDERED ANOTHER LED MIRROR  SAME THING HAPPENED!! NEVER ZADRO AGAIN</li>
            <li> Wife loves this mirror. Magnification is great and the light is soft and uniform. Eye&#x27;s and brows are no problem for her. Very stylish and clean appearance.</li>
            <li> Had to get within 1\\&quot; of the mirror to see your face then you couldn&#x27;t see your whole face. Had to put my glasses on to see anything. Point of mirrow was to see putting my make up on without my glasses.&lt;br /&gt; Ugh.</li>
            <li> This mirror was a great buy.  I can see to put my makeup on without my glasses on the 10X side.  And the lighting is perfect.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful mirror.  Looks great and works great.  Good lighting and magnification for make-up.  I like that you can detach and store the plug.</li>
            <li> I have ordered 4 of these mirrors with the same result.....the light bulb goes dim and I cannot use the product anymore.</li>
            <li> Excellent Makeup Mirror.....especially for those individuals that have &amp;#34;Over 50 Eyes&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> Great looking mirror...arrived with the light not working. When I called Zadro and spoke to a woman in customer service she quickly said it was the ballast circuitry, as though these were common problems. When I asked what they could do about it she said talk to the retailer (Amazon) and let them know they probably have old stock. Isn&#x27;t that her job? I don&#x27;t work for Zadro...and now I will never buy anything from their company. Bad customer service and unreliable product...if I could give zero stars I would.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife. She loved it, but it broke after a year. The switch just burned out and cannot be fixed. So now I will buy another, but a cheap one.</li>
            <li> Not bright enough and returned it.</li>
            <li> The light on this mirror went out before I had had it a year!</li>
            <li> AMAZON- READ THESE 1-STAR REVIEWS!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;lifetime&amp;#34; light lasted only 3 months for us.  Zadro is bad!  Amazon, you&#x27;re not much better if you allow this defective product to continue being sold, and deny return requests for those items that advertise falsely.</li>
            <li> Best lighted magnification mirror I have ever used!</li>
            <li> My previous make-up mirror was around 40 years old.  It was time to replace the mirror and I had tried other LED make-up mirrors but they were not bright enough.  I did not want a fluorescent mirror because fluorescent light does not show true color.  Imagine my surprise when this make-up mirror arrived and it was exactly what they said.  It really is super bright, stylish, and the white light is just wonderful.  I had to get use to the 10X magnification mirror but once you get use to it, it becomes indispensable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this make-up mirror.  It really is great!!</li>
            <li> This mirror is a good height so I don&#x27;t have to bend over putting my makeup on. The magnification is good. And the lighting is excellent.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what to say yet except the subject line.  Reviews were mixed, but so far I&lt;br /&gt;like the look, the magnification and the light.  I&#x27;ll be back if mine breaks as many of the&lt;br /&gt;reviews said theirs did...</li>
            <li> I loved the mirror until the light went out. I purchased it in Nov and it went out in Feb:(</li>
