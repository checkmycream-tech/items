            <li>I also love that the scent lasts all day.</li>
            <li>okay maybe like 10.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite scent.  </li>
            <li>I buy this cologne for my husband and we both love how it smells.</li>
            <li>I have received a lot of compliments, what I like most is you don&#x27;t smell me two days before I get there and three weeks after I leave.</li>
            <li>I think this is one of my favorite colognes.</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>It seemed to me that this bottle didn&#x27;t have as potent a smell as the aboved mentioned bottles that I had bought.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure if this was the cologne spray...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking about ordering 2 or 3 at a time just to make sure I have it for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend gets tons of attention when he wears this, and its my favorite cologne on him.</li>

            <li>Product got here fast &amp; like always smells fantastic!!!</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s very unique and it works for both genders.</li>
            <li>It smells very clean.</li>
            <li>I loved this when I first smelled it.  </li>
            <li>No one scent really slaps you in the face, it just makes a generally pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>But then, it is a really nice and particular scent (kind of like a fresher Code)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, refreshing, and by no means an overpowering scent.  </li>
            <li>Fresh and warm.</li>
            <li>I had purchased this product in a store, which I liked very much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s manages to be fresh, clean, and yet still sophisticated, not too many scents can pull that</li>
            <li>I love it as well.lasts a long time and is a very nice</li>
            <li>I went online and saw that Amazon had great prices for MUCH bigger bottles, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think that they eitehr filled it with water or its</li>
            <li>The smell wore out fast!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great scent and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>First, I want to say that Play is my favorite cologne.  </li>
            <li>fresh (ha!)</li>
            <li>Quality and unique odor and bottle.</li>
            <li>smell is true to the smell from the store.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>quick delivery and as advertised.</li>
            <li>Now, he can&#x27;t leave the house without a quick spray</li>
            <li>In the box was a nice card &amp; a promo Chapstick which was super cool, will definitely buy from here again</li>
            <li>and I can say that it is my new favorite smell.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast as usual and smells great!</li>
            <li>only better!</li>
            <li>honestly it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>But the next day, my shirt does smell nice.  </li>
            <li>I find too many men&#x27;s scents to be far too musky</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance, it&#x27;s a fresh masculine citrus fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Definitely non offensive, doesn&#x27;t seem to project very far which is good for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good smelling cologne and definitely worth a few compliments.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It does not last more than an hour...</li>
            <li>As with any cologne you will want to wear a sample of it first.  </li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>, so you don&#x27;t need too much (First bottle lasted me over a year)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>BECAUSE IT SMELLS SO GOOD, but thanks to Amazon, I can now buy it for way less and not have to go to the mall...</li>
            <li>It works incredibly well with my body chemistry, and will smell a little different on each person because it&#x27;s so</li>
            <li>I bought this product off amazon recently, and I dont know if its me or not, but it doesnt seem as strong as I remembered, so now I&#x27;m spraying it twice on the chest.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very well balanced.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d really have to spray it on to overpower anyone with this.</li>
            <li>I bought this cologne because I like it but really because my wife insisted after sampling it at the store.</li>
            <li>I myself was really going for the Intense version.  </li>
            <li>Why I say sometime is that I can&#x27;t really catch this cologne.</li>
            <li>and I have to spray a lot on to have it stick with me throughout the whole day, but others may prefer this.</li>
            <li>The aroma is light, lasting all day.</li>
            <li>My bottle is filled with a liquid that just doesn&#x27;t seem to last.</li>
            <li>The pump works really well for this scent, though it does put quite a bit of solution in one squirt.</li>
            <li>It came in a retail sealed package, is a genuine bottle, and is the proper / geniuine scent.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say what it smells like, all i know is that i can&#x27;t stop inhaling it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t spray too much</li>
            <li>cologne is much lighter and softer than the in store version.</li>
            <li>It smells natural, but distinct.</li>
            <li>The real deal.</li>
            <li>really.</li>
            <li>Fast transaction.</li>
            <li>would definitely recommend this cologne if you are looking for something light and refreshing that won&#x27;t bother other people.  </li>
            <li>I will NEVER buy another cologne as long as this is available.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money go to the store and buy the real stuff!</li>
            <li>Hands down this is my favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>Bold, yet calming at the same time.</li>
            <li>A sample from the store allowed for a vibrant scent.</li>
            <li>on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Make me want to cuddle with my husband a little longer. :)</li>
            <li>It really drives them wild</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s manly, fresh, calming, invigorating, and intresting all at the same time.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is exactly what I was looking for as my spring/summer daily wearer.</li>
            <li>I bought this one for my adult son for Christmas because he couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the exact same product.</li>
            <li>I went to Macys to try test what the exact same one there</li>
            <li>Nothing but compliments thus far!</li>
            <li>Its clean, yet slightly musky.</li>
            <li>it was the same case with &#x27;Givenchy Play intense&#x27;...</li>
            <li>Im 32 years old and have been wearing this product for about 4 years now.</li>
            <li>But this is the actual cologne spray, and it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li>Good for casual encounters.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>The stuff that came in this bottle did not smell at all like what was left in my old bottle.  </li>
            <li>It has such a masculine smell.</li>
            <li>I wish it were socially acceptable for a woman to wear men&#x27;s fragrances.</li>
            <li>I found this scent first at Macy&#x27;s and then found it here on Amazon for almost 50% less!</li>
            <li>I get lots of compliments when wearing this, it is distinctively subtle and clean.</li>

            <li> I went online and saw that Amazon had great prices for MUCH bigger bottles, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think that they eitehr filled it with water or its</li>
            <li> The smell wore out fast!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great scent and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> First, I want to say that Play is my favorite cologne.  </li>
            <li> fresh (ha!)</li>
            <li> Quality and unique odor and bottle.</li>
            <li> smell is true to the smell from the store.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> quick delivery and as advertised.</li>
            <li> Now, he can&#x27;t leave the house without a quick spray</li>
            <li> In the box was a nice card &amp; a promo Chapstick which was super cool, will definitely buy from here again</li>
            <li> and I can say that it is my new favorite smell.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast as usual and smells great!</li>
            <li> only better!</li>
            <li> honestly it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> But the next day, my shirt does smell nice.  </li>
            <li> I find too many men&#x27;s scents to be far too musky</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance, it&#x27;s a fresh masculine citrus fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Definitely non offensive, doesn&#x27;t seem to project very far which is good for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good smelling cologne and definitely worth a few compliments.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It does not last more than an hour...</li>
            <li> As with any cologne you will want to wear a sample of it first.  </li>
            <li> He absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> , so you don&#x27;t need too much (First bottle lasted me over a year)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> BECAUSE IT SMELLS SO GOOD, but thanks to Amazon, I can now buy it for way less and not have to go to the mall...</li>
            <li> It works incredibly well with my body chemistry, and will smell a little different on each person because it&#x27;s so</li>
            <li> I bought this product off amazon recently, and I dont know if its me or not, but it doesnt seem as strong as I remembered, so now I&#x27;m spraying it twice on the chest.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very well balanced.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d really have to spray it on to overpower anyone with this.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne because I like it but really because my wife insisted after sampling it at the store.</li>
            <li> I myself was really going for the Intense version.  </li>
            <li> Why I say sometime is that I can&#x27;t really catch this cologne.</li>
            <li> and I have to spray a lot on to have it stick with me throughout the whole day, but others may prefer this.</li>
            <li> The aroma is light, lasting all day.</li>
            <li> My bottle is filled with a liquid that just doesn&#x27;t seem to last.</li>
            <li> The pump works really well for this scent, though it does put quite a bit of solution in one squirt.</li>
            <li> It came in a retail sealed package, is a genuine bottle, and is the proper / geniuine scent.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say what it smells like, all i know is that i can&#x27;t stop inhaling it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t spray too much</li>
            <li> cologne is much lighter and softer than the in store version.</li>
            <li> It smells natural, but distinct.</li>
            <li> The real deal.</li>
            <li> really.</li>
            <li> Fast transaction.</li>
            <li> would definitely recommend this cologne if you are looking for something light and refreshing that won&#x27;t bother other people.  </li>
            <li> I will NEVER buy another cologne as long as this is available.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money go to the store and buy the real stuff!</li>
            <li> Hands down this is my favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> Bold, yet calming at the same time.</li>
            <li> A sample from the store allowed for a vibrant scent.</li>
            <li> on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Make me want to cuddle with my husband a little longer. :)</li>
            <li> It really drives them wild</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s manly, fresh, calming, invigorating, and intresting all at the same time.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is exactly what I was looking for as my spring/summer daily wearer.</li>
            <li> I bought this one for my adult son for Christmas because he couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the exact same product.</li>
            <li> I went to Macys to try test what the exact same one there</li>
            <li> Nothing but compliments thus far!</li>
            <li> Its clean, yet slightly musky.</li>
            <li> it was the same case with &#x27;Givenchy Play intense&#x27;...</li>
            <li> Im 32 years old and have been wearing this product for about 4 years now.</li>
            <li> But this is the actual cologne spray, and it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li> Good for casual encounters.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> The stuff that came in this bottle did not smell at all like what was left in my old bottle.  </li>
            <li> It has such a masculine smell.</li>
            <li> I wish it were socially acceptable for a woman to wear men&#x27;s fragrances.</li>
            <li> I found this scent first at Macy&#x27;s and then found it here on Amazon for almost 50% less!</li>
            <li> I get lots of compliments when wearing this, it is distinctively subtle and clean.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a bad thing, but just be careful you don&#x27;t squirt too much as you can very easily over-saturate yourself /</li>
            <li> It lasts all day, and if you&#x27;re one that recycles your outside layer for more than one wear, or you get too close to your dirty clothes, you&#x27;ll note that you can still smell it days later.</li>
            <li> that is sometimes long lasting.</li>
            <li> Im looking forward to seeing how long it will last throughout the day.</li>
            <li> 2 spritzes last all day long even after working up a sweat!</li>
            <li> Even came earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> final gripe is that it doesn&#x27;t last too long, usually about an hour or two.</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of this years ago at a department store for at least twice as much if not more...</li>
            <li> Every other cologne I&#x27;ve ever had, two to three sprays</li>
            <li> and then they get hit by the other sent.</li>
            <li> concerned mine was a fake because of these discrepancies, but after comparison to a store sample and packaging I&#x27;m reassured that it&#x27;s real.</li>
            <li> I am very discerning when it comes to buying cologne because the stuff is so expensive.</li>
            <li> cologne though and not worth any sort of honorable mention.</li>
            <li> One of my 2 son&#x27;s favorites [other being Aqua Di Gio]!</li>
            <li> Compared it to my other bottle which I had bought from JCP!</li>
            <li> Everyones tastes are different and i don&#x27;t mean tasting this stuff…</li>
            <li> It seems to fade off after a couple of hours, but sometimes, you can still smell it after half a day, depending on weather.</li>
            <li> Half the price of anywhere I&#x27;ve seen it in a store</li>
            <li> I received this cologne as a gift previously and purchased it again after I used up the gift bottle.</li>
            <li> I spray 3 times and it fades in less than an hour....</li>
            <li> have had this for a few months</li>
            <li> $55 wasted.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that it&#x27;s a little weak</li>
            <li> The Perfume Spot better refund me the money because I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The picture is not accurate!</li>
            <li> Very harsh.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned 4 colognes in the past and they all lasted me at least 5-7 hours through out the day</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to put it into words.</li>
            <li> taste never goes out of style and the price is hard to beat.</li>
            <li> Gamble on it if you want, but I&#x27;m afraid I will have to smell my next bottle before I purchase.</li>
            <li> make your coworkers hate you for squirting too much</li>
            <li> This is a serious ripoff...</li>
            <li> Looking from the other reviews, not all of them are bad.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very subtle and even my friends with sensitivities to fragrances aren&#x27;t bothered by</li>
            <li> Fake bottle fake cologne!</li>
            <li> that crazy price</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how you know it&#x27;s fake!</li>
            <li> I paid 60 bucks for the 3.3Ounce Givenchy Play and this is either a defective item or fake!</li>
            <li> I have never had cologne go bad.  </li>
            <li> I was so disappointed that I didn&#x27;t read the comments before buying this so called perfume!</li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The picture for this product is inaccurate and that needs to be changed given the constant fear of fakes accompanying buying cologne online.The real, current bottle does not have the play arrow above &amp;#34;PLAY&amp;#34; and the box doesn&#x27;t have any of the arrows either.  I was concerned mine was a fake because of these discrepancies, but after comparison to a store sample and packaging I&#x27;m reassured that it&#x27;s real. This fragrance is exactly what I was looking for as my spring/summer daily wearer. Fresh and warm. It opens up with citrus and then you smell the Amyris wood middle a couple hours later. That&#x27;s the scent that stays with you most as it dries out. It&#x27;s very well balanced. No one scent really slaps you in the face, it just makes a generally pleasant smell. Definitely non offensive, doesn&#x27;t seem to project very far which is good for me. You&#x27;d really have to spray it on to overpower anyone with this. I&#x27;ve only had it a short time so I&#x27;ll try to update as I work my way through the seasons and the bottle.</li>
            <li> After buying this cologne sex for me is like an ocean. I&#x27;m drowning in it.</li>
            <li> Awesome item, quick delivery</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne because I like it but really because my wife insisted after sampling it at the store. I myself was really going for the Intense version.  But then, it is a really nice and particular scent (kind of like a fresher Code) that is sometimes long lasting. Why I say sometime is that I can&#x27;t really catch this cologne. It seems to fade off after a couple of hours, but sometimes, you can still smell it after half a day, depending on weather. I thing that it is best when it&#x27;s hot.  You can go for it as you will like it no doubt.  I like Gicenchy colognes, and still think Pour Homme is THE BEST.</li>
            <li> Pricing &amp; shipping were resonable &amp; the merchant sent in a timely manner. No problems and would use again.</li>
            <li> I found this scent first at Macy&#x27;s and then found it here on Amazon for almost 50% less! It&#x27;s a great scent and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas, he loves it and I love it on him, love the bottle!</li>
            <li> I bought this one for my adult son for Christmas because he couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere! Imagine his surprise after he ripped off the Christmas paper and saw his favorite! The look was priceless!!!</li>
            <li> Half the price of anywhere I&#x27;ve seen it in a store and it&#x27;s the exact same product. Love the smell as it&#x27;s a more &amp;#34;playful&amp;#34; smell. It doesn&#x27;t smell like it came out of a bottle shaped like a battleship or car.</li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant and light. Great for a summer night out. Only complaint is that it&#x27;s a little weak and I have to spray a lot on to have it stick with me throughout the whole day, but others may prefer this.</li>
            <li> One of my 2 son&#x27;s favorites [other being Aqua Di Gio]! Says it drives the girls crazy:)Not too fruity, perfumey or overpowering. 2 spritzes last all day long even after working up a sweat!</li>
            <li> Horrible! Compared it to my other bottle which I had bought from JCP! Everything was different! Fake bottle fake cologne! Smell does not last 30 minutes! The box does not have the play buttons on it! That&#x27;s how you know it&#x27;s fake! The picture is not accurate! Do not waste your money go to the store and buy the real stuff!</li>
            <li> I had purchased this product in a store, which I liked very much. The aroma is light, lasting all day. But when I purchased it online here, the experience is different. It does not last more than an hour... Good product but somehow is not working well when purchased online.... it was the same case with &#x27;Givenchy Play intense&#x27;... feels much better when purchases in store.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my bf who id s cologne addict. He loves it,practically makes out with himself cuz he says he smells so good. I love it as well.lasts a long time and is a very nice smell.not musky.kind of like a warm powdered sugar once it settles with his skin.hope he asks for it again when he runs out.im sure he will.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance...</li>
            <li> My bottle is filled with a liquid that just doesn&#x27;t seem to last. Every other cologne I&#x27;ve ever had, two to three sprays and you&#x27;re good to go all day. This thing, I&#x27;m going six or seven sprays and it&#x27;s still gone by mid-day. Did I get a bum bottle?</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this online as there are always the nay-sayers that say, \\&quot;This smell doesn&#x27;t last.\\&quot; \\&quot;This is definitely the aftershave put into the spray bottle.\\&quot; \\&quot;Ect\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had this for a few months and I can say that it is my new favorite smell. I had done some shopping in the local Sephora and found their prices for smelly alcohol water to be a bit unfathomable. I went online and saw that Amazon had great prices for MUCH bigger bottles, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This smell is true to the smell from the store. It lasts all day, and if you&#x27;re one that recycles your outside layer for more than one wear, or you get too close to your dirty clothes, you&#x27;ll note that you can still smell it days later. The pump works really well for this scent, though it does put quite a bit of solution in one squirt. I find that with this one I only need 1 - 3 squirts where my former product (LaCoste) took about 4 - 5 to get the same amount of fragrance and liquid dispensed. This isn&#x27;t a bad thing, but just be careful you don&#x27;t squirt too much as you can very easily over-saturate yourself / make your coworkers hate you for squirting too much on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product. It came in a retail sealed package, is a genuine bottle, and is the proper / geniuine scent. I do recommend going to Sephora / Perfumania though to try it out to see if you like it.</li>
            <li> Great price for a very high end fragrance. Gift for husband.   I bought a bottle of this years ago at a department store for at least twice as much if not more...honestly it&#x27;s worth that crazy price BECAUSE IT SMELLS SO GOOD, but thanks to Amazon, I can now buy it for way less and not have to go to the mall...yay!</li>
            <li> This cologne makes my fiance smell amazing. He gets compliments on it all the time.</li>
            <li> First, I want to say that Play is my favorite cologne.  This review is not for Play, but for whatever they sent me.  The stuff that came in this bottle did not smell at all like what was left in my old bottle.  I don&#x27;t know if their warehouse is not climate controlled?  I have never had cologne go bad.  It smells like a -lemon citrus-?  Very harsh.  But the next day, my shirt does smell nice.  Looking from the other reviews, not all of them are bad.  Gamble on it if you want, but I&#x27;m afraid I will have to smell my next bottle before I purchase.</li>
            <li> Great product, quick delivery. My husband loves it and I do too</li>
            <li> My son loves this cologne.  I got double the size for cheaper price than I got it at Ulta!  Thank you AMAZON!!</li>
            <li> The smell wore out fast!!!</li>
            <li> was exactly what i asked for, the bottle is the perfect size to last for quite some time, great product</li>
            <li> I received this cologne as a gift previously and purchased it again after I used up the gift bottle. It has a refreshing fragrance without being over whelming. Get compliments many times...</li>
            <li> As with any cologne you will want to wear a sample of it first.  Everyones tastes are different and i don&#x27;t mean tasting this stuff… :)&lt;br /&gt;Great scent and an always important fact is the ladies love it!!</li>
            <li> This is my favourite cologne. I have been using it since it was in it&#x27;s promotional stages and I think it&#x27;s the best out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t use it though... I don&#x27;t want everyone smelling like me.</li>
            <li> I get lots of compliments when wearing this, it is distinctively subtle and clean.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best spray for men on the market! I love it. Make me want to cuddle with my husband a little longer. :)</li>
            <li> Great cologne! My husband loves it and smells great! Prompt delivery!</li>
            <li> This is the best cologne i have ever smelled! I just got a bottle from Dillards. I am very discerning when it comes to buying cologne because the stuff is so expensive. I literally went around the counter at Dillard&#x27;s and smelled over 30 different colognes. Yes they were some others that were nice but i kept coming back to this one. It&#x27;s manly, fresh, calming, invigorating, and intresting all at the same time. It&#x27;s hard to put it into words. Bold, yet calming at the same time. I can&#x27;t really say what it smells like, all i know is that i can&#x27;t stop inhaling it. It is that good.!!! It&#x27;s not really a leathery old man smell, and its not flowery either. Its clean, yet slightly musky. You will just want to keep smelling it. There could be some type  of drug in it to get you hooked. JJK!!! Im looking forward to seeing how long it will last throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I paid 60 bucks for the 3.3Ounce Givenchy Play and this is either a defective item or fake! I spray 3 times and it fades in less than an hour....I went to Macys to try test what the exact same one there and it was a lot stronger in smell compared to what I got from Perfumespot and it also lasted me 5-6hrs. This is a serious ripoff...I asked The Perfume Spot about my issue and they just told me everyone has different body chemistry blah blah blah...I&#x27;ve owned 4 colognes in the past and they all lasted me at least 5-7 hours through out the day and you can smell it on your shirt/jacket at the end of the day. The Perfume Spot better refund me the money because I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Im not going to write a book about a cologne. So im going to say it smells good.my bf loves it. Don&#x27;t spray too much it can be over over powering.cute bottle.</li>
            <li> Hands down this is my favorite cologne. Great product. The scent lasts throughout the day.</li>
            <li> quick delivery and as advertised. perfect!</li>
            <li> Buy it in the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cologne is much lighter and softer than the in store version. A sample from the store allowed for a vibrant scent. This one doesn&#x27;t smell at all. I think that they eitehr filled it with water or its a fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, can&#x27;t return to amazon b/c it&#x27;s a hazardous liquid. $55 wasted.</li>
            <li> Product was as described, very happy with seller</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how to describe cologne scents but I will say this one has been my fav for a couple of years. It is so sexy! I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. I think you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite smelling cologne.</li>
            <li> Perfect. My fiancé loves this. It&#x27;s the only scent he&#x27;ll wear. Great price!</li>
            <li> I loved this when I first smelled it.  It&#x27;s manages to be fresh, clean, and yet still sophisticated, not too many scents can pull that off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that it works for men and women.  I find too many men&#x27;s scents to be far too musky but as said, this is so refreshingly...fresh (ha!) that it&#x27;s very unique and it works for both genders.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good smelling cologne and definitely worth a few compliments.&lt;br /&gt;I would only peg this as a &amp;#34;decent&amp;#34; cologne though and not worth any sort of honorable mention. Good for casual encounters.&lt;br /&gt;My final gripe is that it doesn&#x27;t last too long, usually about an hour or two.</li>
            <li> Every man needs a bottle of this. It is the best cologne for men... several different people I know wear it and always get compliments (even from strangers). It smells very clean.</li>
            <li> I love this smell! It has such a masculine smell.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance, it&#x27;s a fresh masculine citrus fragrance.  Most people are amazed when I tell them what it is.  I also love that the scent lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast as usual and smells great!</li>
            <li> Im 32 years old and have been wearing this product for about 4 years now. I spray this once on my chest and then I also use Versace blue on my neck. The mix between the two sends girls over the edge. They smell one...and then they get hit by the other sent. I cant tell you how many times I&#x27;ve had a girl tell me how great I smell while I&#x27;m taking her clothes off.... okay maybe like 10. I bought this product off amazon recently, and I dont know if its me or not, but it doesnt seem as strong as I remembered, so now I&#x27;m spraying it twice on the chest.</li>
            <li> I brought this cologne as a gift for my son. He absolutely loves it! It smells so good I plan to buy a bottle for my hubbie.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent.  It smells natural, but distinct.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed that I didn&#x27;t read the comments before buying this so called perfume!</li>
            <li> Good deal for quality product</li>
            <li> I get comments all the time about this one. Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> This may be the best smelling men&#x27;s cologne I&#x27;ve ever smelled in my life. It&#x27;s absolutely addictive to keep smelling. I can&#x27;t get enough. I wish it were socially acceptable for a woman to wear men&#x27;s fragrances. I would totally wear this 24/7!</li>
            <li> Great smelling cologne.</li>
            <li> Nothing but compliments thus far!</li>
            <li> I buy this cologne for my husband and we both love how it smells. The bottle is also nice and sits well on the vanity.</li>
            <li> The real deal. Good size and price for the size.</li>
            <li> I have received a lot of compliments, what I like most is you don&#x27;t smell me two days before I get there and three weeks after I leave.</li>
            <li> Givenchy play is one of the best cologne I have ever smell!!</li>
            <li> I think this is one of my favorite colognes. Smells great every time and I love it</li>
            <li> Packaging was very good. Product was as advertised. Quality and unique odor and bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this cologne before from department stores and loved it. It seemed to me that this bottle didn&#x27;t have as potent a smell as the aboved mentioned bottles that I had bought.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure if this was the cologne spray...the pic looked like aftershave. But this is the actual cologne spray, and it&#x27;s the real deal. Great price and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been overly attractive, but the girls I know give me lingering hugs and tell me I smell amazing when I wear this cologne. I will NEVER buy another cologne as long as this is available. I&#x27;m thinking about ordering 2 or 3 at a time just to make sure I have it for an extended period of time. It works incredibly well with my body chemistry, and will smell a little different on each person because it&#x27;s so reactive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instant self-esteem boost&lt;br /&gt;Increased attention&lt;br /&gt;Powerful, so you don&#x27;t need too much (First bottle lasted me over a year)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None really. It&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing! I bought this for my boyfiend and he was very pleased. Now, he can&#x27;t leave the house without a quick spray</li>
            <li> Just as adveryizes and a great size. Even came earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Fast transaction. I smelled this on a friend and loved it.  My boyfriend gets tons of attention when he wears this, and its my favorite cologne on him. Win/win!</li>
            <li> only better! 100% of the time, it works every time! go to a department store and sample it, then save yourself (and your wallet) the headache and buy it here!</li>
            <li> Product got here fast &amp; like always smells fantastic!!! In the box was a nice card &amp; a promo Chapstick which was super cool, will definitely buy from here again</li>
            <li> Smells great. Better price than the dept stores!</li>
            <li> Excelente perfume, se puede usar de diario, muy suave y fresco, recibi el producto en el tiempo estimado, lo recomiendo.</li>
            <li> Heterosexual women seems to be in love with this cologne. It really drives them wild and I receive nothing but compliments when I&#x27;m wearing Play.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cologne since I discovered it last year.  I&#x27;ve received many complements on it from friends and coworkers and colleagues.  It&#x27;s light, refreshing, and by no means an overpowering scent.  It smells great and it lasts the whole day for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this cologne if you are looking for something light and refreshing that won&#x27;t bother other people.  It&#x27;s very subtle and even my friends with sensitivities to fragrances aren&#x27;t bothered by it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good taste never goes out of style and the price is hard to beat.</li>
