            <li>It has a light feel, and it absorbs very easily into the skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is pretty good.</li>
            <li>I like this moisturizing lotion - it is light and not greasy - it has a pleasant light fragrance that is not annoying just lightly there as you use the lotion.  </li>
            <li>I liked the light, creamy texture and the light</li>
            <li>and I disclose this always, because I value my reviews and most important my readers.</li>

            <li>Nice to see so many natural ingredients.</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s important to me.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy reviewing products</li>
            <li>/&gt;\\&quot;Vitamin C is one of the most powerful antioxidants in skin care.</li>
            <li>However, since the Yalmeh lotion does not have any SPF ingredients, I used an additional light moisturizer with sunscreen in order to protect my skin from the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a tube of Yalmeh</li>
            <li>Great facial product.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how good my skin felt.</li>
            <li>I always read user reviews when I am making purchases, and most times they lead me in the right direction.</li>
            <li>I love Yalmeh products because they come in beautiful small packages that can fit in your purse so easily - allowing you to use them anywhere.  </li>
            <li>This is my new favorite Vitamin C product period!</li>
            <li>This lotion is worth buying it!</li>
            <li>Yalmeh is one of the brands that I gravitate towards when it comes to skin care and anti aging, as their products have never disappointed me.</li>
            <li>I intend to buy more of their products and make it my whole skin care regime!  </li>
            <li>great lotion that helps with dry skin and aging skin as we all will have someday - give it a try</li>
            <li>I was hoping to find a great lotion for my dry skin this winter</li>
            <li>The scent is very nice – floral to my nose – and refreshing, but perhaps could be just a tad more subtle.</li>
            <li>If up don&#x27;t like it you can return it for a full refund</li>
            <li>I love this product and would absolutely recommend it to my friends and family.</li>
            <li>Overall though the product does what it promises and is a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>First, it acts as an antioxidant to prevent the formation of free radicals which cause damage to your skin.</li>
            <li>This product comes in a tube which allows you to easily dispense as much as you need.  </li>
            <li>Not to mention, I love how it is not tested on animals and contains Vitamin C, which is an excellent plus for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I  have only been using this product almost a week, and can tell small differences in how my skin feels.  </li>
            <li>Smells amazing and absorbs quickly and deeply into my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and not irritating...</li>
            <li>My face looks noticeably different since I used this amazing vitamin C lotion.</li>
            <li>I received a smaller version of this product in exchange for my honest unbiased opinion of the product.</li>
            <li>So, Yalmeh products contain SAFE, ALL NATURAL INGREDIENTS.</li>
            <li>Just know that it is not offensive at all or overly powerful.</li>
            <li>you found my review fun and/or informative, please let me know.  </li>
            <li>I like the size &amp; the fact that it is in a squeeze tube which prevents oxidation exposure &amp; keeps it fresh longer.</li>
            <li>I received a complimentary product to test.</li>
            <li>The lotion itself is not heavy and smells clean and fresh and it leaves your face feeling smooth and refreshed without a greasy residue.  </li>
            <li>I love how it illuminates my eye area, as I tend to have very light dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Besides that,  the lotion is very high-quality and great for everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Honestly it just smelled like a plain lotion with a light hint of perfume flowers.</li>
            <li>The lotion itself is white in color and very light weight.</li>
            <li>Sent me this cream for testing purposes and for a review on my blog and this is very highly recommended from me!</li>
            <li>While most of the creams I&#x27;ve tried have smelled like Aloe, this one smells quite differently.</li>
            <li>Personally I need a bit more in the way of a moisturizer, but I would wear this under my BB cream during the day - no problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The most recent one is the Yalmeh Glorify Vitamin C Moisturizing Lotion.  </li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li>and I love them equally.  </li>
            <li>What I like most about YALMEH Glorify Vitamin C Moisturizing Lotion Net,</li>
            <li>I can help my skin heal a bit and become more youthful at the same time.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft, smooth and makes my makeup go on so much smoother and easier.  </li>
            <li>Hope there’s enough in there to really give me a sense of how well it works. :)</li>
            <li>I have been with Amazon for many years and this is the first time that a company has thought of me ,long after I purchased the face cream they still want to know if every thing is alright</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using \\&quot;Yalmeh\\&quot; day/night cream pretty much exclusively to moisturize for some months now, and I do really like it!</li>
            <li>I would probably use this more in the summer as my skin is extremely dry in the winter</li>
            <li>It absorbed quickly into my skin and left it feeling super soft.</li>
            <li>As a moisturizer, don&#x27;t expect much but pretty decent.</li>
            <li>The Yalmeh Vitamin C Lotion is great for everyday use and for keeping your skin moisturized throughout the entire day.</li>
            <li>I really like this product for my skin.</li>
            <li>The lotion is very creamy.</li>
            <li>There really isn’t a smell to it.</li>
            <li>the mood my face is in on a given day determines how much I should use, and as often as not, I guess</li>
            <li>/&gt;\\&quot;Yalmeh\\&quot; continues to be my primary source for such products.</li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>Glides on, absorbs way fast and keeps my face supple and hydrated for 12 hours or more with absolutely no stickiness or greasy feel whatsoever!</li>
            <li>I have reviewed several different products by Yalmeh in the past year, and have been very happy with each of them.</li>
            <li>True, I&#x27;ve \\&quot;strayed\\&quot; occasionally, and there are 2 or 3 products not from \\&quot;Yalmeh\\</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a good, everyday use, moisturizing lotion then look no further!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and have not had any problem at all!</li>
            <li>My skin is in better condition than it was a few months ago because I have really been taking care of it and make sure to use moisturizer everyday.</li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend you to add Vitamin C in your beauty routine.</li>
            <li>I read reviews on Yalmeh other products where people received free items, and I&#x27;ve never gotten anything which doesn&#x27;t make me feel appreciated with my dedication.</li>
            <li>and I need a little bit more protection from the elements.  </li>
            <li>and I really like the smell and the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>This is completely worth the price, and I think if you are a female, you need this.</li>
            <li>Despite the fact that the one I was sent for review was a smaller tube of about 15 grams, I consider this  lotion to have all the right combination of antioxidants that protects and prevents the formation of free radicals that is primarily due to the exposure of the sun which causes dark spots, discoloration, wrinkles and fine lines.</li>
            <li>primary active ingredient in this product is, of course, vitamin C.</li>
            <li>It has a nice subtle scent and you don&#x27;t need to squeeze out a lot to use it for your face.</li>
            <li>The lotion is really lightweight so it absorbs really easily &amp; completely into the skin and leaves it feeling soft and hydrated and not at all greasy.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs fast with no strange feel to the skin.  </li>
            <li>It is a great cream for all skin types and will last you a long time as a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Vitamin C Moisturizing Lotion contains all natural ingredients, no toxic chemicals or cancer causing additives - no mineral oil, sulfates or alcohol, propylene glycol or paraben.</li>
            <li>Granted, it&#x27;s a moisturizer, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to leave my skin feeling silky soft.</li>
            <li>It has a soft calming scent.</li>
            <li>It is NEVER to early to start taking care of your skin.</li>
            <li>ALL NATURAL  no mineral oil, sulfates or alcohol, propylene glycol or paraben.</li>
            <li>Antioxidants and vitamin c come together to help reduce acne and the early signs of aging when used just once a day - and let me say that &amp;</li>
            <li>I have the whole regimen for my facial treatment</li>
            <li>I apply the Yalmeh Syrum first, wait for it to dry, then apply the moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It is quickly absorbed by my skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue like some other lotions that leave a greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have such problems with this new lotion however!</li>
            <li>Last but not least, vitamin C helps to stimulate the production of collagen, which helps your skin look fuller and</li>
            <li>I have dry skin, moisturizes very well and improves complexion.</li>
            <li>No other compensation was received for this review.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin, and use this pretty liberally on my entire face and neck, and it moisturizes my dry areas without making my oily areas greasy.</li>
            <li>post-breakout red marks by improving skin&#x27;s natural healing response</li>
            <li>so I have been trying to just apply what is left over to top of my hands at the very least.  </li>
            <li>YALMEH Glorify Vitamin C Moisturizing Lotion Net, 15g ☆Face Cream☆ is a nicely scented cream that comes in a small tube with a tiny opening to remind you that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>The bottles are small but you really get your moneys worth out of the products - this one is 1.7 oz in a bottle that is less than half the size of a normal 1 oz bottle.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> It has a light feel, and it absorbs very easily into the skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is pretty good.</li>
            <li> I like this moisturizing lotion - it is light and not greasy - it has a pleasant light fragrance that is not annoying just lightly there as you use the lotion.  </li>
            <li> I liked the light, creamy texture and the light</li>

            <li> /&gt;\\&quot;Vitamin C is one of the most powerful antioxidants in skin care.</li>
            <li> However, since the Yalmeh lotion does not have any SPF ingredients, I used an additional light moisturizer with sunscreen in order to protect my skin from the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a tube of Yalmeh</li>
            <li> Great facial product.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how good my skin felt.</li>
            <li> I always read user reviews when I am making purchases, and most times they lead me in the right direction.</li>
            <li> I love Yalmeh products because they come in beautiful small packages that can fit in your purse so easily - allowing you to use them anywhere.  </li>
            <li> This is my new favorite Vitamin C product period!</li>
            <li> This lotion is worth buying it!</li>
            <li> Yalmeh is one of the brands that I gravitate towards when it comes to skin care and anti aging, as their products have never disappointed me.</li>
            <li> I intend to buy more of their products and make it my whole skin care regime!  </li>
            <li> great lotion that helps with dry skin and aging skin as we all will have someday - give it a try</li>
            <li> I was hoping to find a great lotion for my dry skin this winter</li>
            <li> The scent is very nice – floral to my nose – and refreshing, but perhaps could be just a tad more subtle.</li>
            <li> If up don&#x27;t like it you can return it for a full refund</li>
            <li> I love this product and would absolutely recommend it to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> Overall though the product does what it promises and is a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> First, it acts as an antioxidant to prevent the formation of free radicals which cause damage to your skin.</li>
            <li> This product comes in a tube which allows you to easily dispense as much as you need.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention, I love how it is not tested on animals and contains Vitamin C, which is an excellent plus for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I  have only been using this product almost a week, and can tell small differences in how my skin feels.  </li>
            <li> Smells amazing and absorbs quickly and deeply into my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and not irritating...</li>
            <li> My face looks noticeably different since I used this amazing vitamin C lotion.</li>
            <li> I received a smaller version of this product in exchange for my honest unbiased opinion of the product.</li>
            <li> So, Yalmeh products contain SAFE, ALL NATURAL INGREDIENTS.</li>
            <li> Just know that it is not offensive at all or overly powerful.</li>
            <li> you found my review fun and/or informative, please let me know.  </li>
            <li> I like the size &amp; the fact that it is in a squeeze tube which prevents oxidation exposure &amp; keeps it fresh longer.</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary product to test.</li>
            <li> The lotion itself is not heavy and smells clean and fresh and it leaves your face feeling smooth and refreshed without a greasy residue.  </li>
            <li> I love how it illuminates my eye area, as I tend to have very light dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Besides that,  the lotion is very high-quality and great for everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Honestly it just smelled like a plain lotion with a light hint of perfume flowers.</li>
            <li> The lotion itself is white in color and very light weight.</li>
            <li> Sent me this cream for testing purposes and for a review on my blog and this is very highly recommended from me!</li>
            <li> While most of the creams I&#x27;ve tried have smelled like Aloe, this one smells quite differently.</li>
            <li> Personally I need a bit more in the way of a moisturizer, but I would wear this under my BB cream during the day - no problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The most recent one is the Yalmeh Glorify Vitamin C Moisturizing Lotion.  </li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li> and I love them equally.  </li>
            <li> What I like most about YALMEH Glorify Vitamin C Moisturizing Lotion Net,</li>
            <li> I can help my skin heal a bit and become more youthful at the same time.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft, smooth and makes my makeup go on so much smoother and easier.  </li>
            <li> Hope there’s enough in there to really give me a sense of how well it works. :)</li>
            <li> I have been with Amazon for many years and this is the first time that a company has thought of me ,long after I purchased the face cream they still want to know if every thing is alright</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using \\&quot;Yalmeh\\&quot; day/night cream pretty much exclusively to moisturize for some months now, and I do really like it!</li>
            <li> I would probably use this more in the summer as my skin is extremely dry in the winter</li>
            <li> It absorbed quickly into my skin and left it feeling super soft.</li>
            <li> As a moisturizer, don&#x27;t expect much but pretty decent.</li>
            <li> The Yalmeh Vitamin C Lotion is great for everyday use and for keeping your skin moisturized throughout the entire day.</li>
            <li> I really like this product for my skin.</li>
            <li> The lotion is very creamy.</li>
            <li> There really isn’t a smell to it.</li>
            <li> the mood my face is in on a given day determines how much I should use, and as often as not, I guess</li>
            <li> /&gt;\\&quot;Yalmeh\\&quot; continues to be my primary source for such products.</li>
            <li> and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li> Glides on, absorbs way fast and keeps my face supple and hydrated for 12 hours or more with absolutely no stickiness or greasy feel whatsoever!</li>
            <li> I have reviewed several different products by Yalmeh in the past year, and have been very happy with each of them.</li>
            <li> True, I&#x27;ve \\&quot;strayed\\&quot; occasionally, and there are 2 or 3 products not from \\&quot;Yalmeh\\</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a good, everyday use, moisturizing lotion then look no further!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and have not had any problem at all!</li>
            <li> My skin is in better condition than it was a few months ago because I have really been taking care of it and make sure to use moisturizer everyday.</li>
            <li> highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend you to add Vitamin C in your beauty routine.</li>
            <li> I read reviews on Yalmeh other products where people received free items, and I&#x27;ve never gotten anything which doesn&#x27;t make me feel appreciated with my dedication.</li>
            <li> and I need a little bit more protection from the elements.  </li>
            <li> and I really like the smell and the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> This is completely worth the price, and I think if you are a female, you need this.</li>
            <li> Despite the fact that the one I was sent for review was a smaller tube of about 15 grams, I consider this  lotion to have all the right combination of antioxidants that protects and prevents the formation of free radicals that is primarily due to the exposure of the sun which causes dark spots, discoloration, wrinkles and fine lines.</li>
            <li> primary active ingredient in this product is, of course, vitamin C.</li>
            <li> It has a nice subtle scent and you don&#x27;t need to squeeze out a lot to use it for your face.</li>
            <li> The lotion is really lightweight so it absorbs really easily &amp; completely into the skin and leaves it feeling soft and hydrated and not at all greasy.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs fast with no strange feel to the skin.  </li>
            <li> It is a great cream for all skin types and will last you a long time as a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C Moisturizing Lotion contains all natural ingredients, no toxic chemicals or cancer causing additives - no mineral oil, sulfates or alcohol, propylene glycol or paraben.</li>
            <li> Granted, it&#x27;s a moisturizer, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to leave my skin feeling silky soft.</li>
            <li> It has a soft calming scent.</li>
            <li> It is NEVER to early to start taking care of your skin.</li>
            <li> ALL NATURAL  no mineral oil, sulfates or alcohol, propylene glycol or paraben.</li>
            <li> Antioxidants and vitamin c come together to help reduce acne and the early signs of aging when used just once a day - and let me say that &amp;</li>
            <li> I have the whole regimen for my facial treatment</li>
            <li> I apply the Yalmeh Syrum first, wait for it to dry, then apply the moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It is quickly absorbed by my skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue like some other lotions that leave a greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have such problems with this new lotion however!</li>
            <li> Last but not least, vitamin C helps to stimulate the production of collagen, which helps your skin look fuller and</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, moisturizes very well and improves complexion.</li>
            <li> No other compensation was received for this review.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, and use this pretty liberally on my entire face and neck, and it moisturizes my dry areas without making my oily areas greasy.</li>
            <li> post-breakout red marks by improving skin&#x27;s natural healing response</li>
            <li> so I have been trying to just apply what is left over to top of my hands at the very least.  </li>
            <li> YALMEH Glorify Vitamin C Moisturizing Lotion Net, 15g ☆Face Cream☆ is a nicely scented cream that comes in a small tube with a tiny opening to remind you that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The bottles are small but you really get your moneys worth out of the products - this one is 1.7 oz in a bottle that is less than half the size of a normal 1 oz bottle.  </li>
            <li> First off, they sent me a very small sample size tube sans the pretty little box!  </li>
            <li> It helps slow down the aging process by preventing free radical damage.</li>
            <li> I think that the 15ml is way too small for an everday use cream because it is going to become used up really quick even though you only need a little bit to apply to your entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You do not need much and that means that for just $17.95 this will last you at least a couple months when used once a day.  </li>
            <li> which are really bad due to smoking for 20 years-and my brown spots which are many due to sunbathing in the hot Florida sun as a teenager.  </li>
            <li> like that it contains all natural ingredients, including jojoba oil, aloe vera, safflower oil and green tea.</li>
            <li> It don&#x27;t take long for it to be worked in to the skin.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> It does seem to quiet down after 5-10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The other day, I was at a bingo game with my 34 year old daughter, and she was introducing me to some of the women there, they were so surprised to find out</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> That to me is very important, because if it smells bad, I&#x27;m not putting it on.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell horrible, but to me it doesn&#x27;t smell great either.  </li>
            <li> In the winter you can only see a few of my freckles but in the summer look out because they all come out of hiding.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I used both this and the eye cream with high hopes but was not happy with results, and smells like coppertone  sunscreen.</li>
            <li> not a good moisturizer for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Reduce the appearance of brown spots and other types of sun damage</li>
            <li> Vitamin c moisturizing lotion came in a small 0.5ml yellow orange tube.</li>
            <li> some of the pigmentation left behind by breakouts and possibly sun exposure.</li>
            <li> As I have aged I have learned to apply a moisturizer with SPF of 15 to protect my delicate face and until recently that is all I did to protect my face if I wasn&#x27;t going to be on the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only negative thing -</li>
            <li> A small bit goes a long</li>
            <li> It pairs well with my other skin products and helps even out my skin tone a little.</li>
            <li> It is helping my wrinkles become less noticeable-</li>
            <li> so what do you have to lose but a few wrinkles and spots.</li>
            <li> Every few days I combine this with Alba self tanner for a bit of a glow.</li>
            <li> Glorify Vitamin C Moisturizing Lotion contains a variety of plant-based ingredients including: aloe vera, jojoba oil, safflower oil and green tea.</li>
            <li> I applied this lotion around my eyes where my eyes tend to look a bit titchy and dried these days. .</li>
            <li> Then after a couple weeks I only saw my skin looking worse.</li>
            <li> I can’t say that I have noticed a vast difference in my skin, but it didn’t cause any bad reactions or irritation and treated my skin kindly - double</li>
            <li> No more embarrassing ashy skin.</li>
            <li> usual</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult for anybody to compete with such a combo!</li>
            <li> even at 42, it&#x27;s not to late to start taking g care of your skin either!</li>
            <li> However, one thing that disappointed me was the fact that the picture shows that the bottle is 1.7fl and 50ml, however, the actual cream is 0.5fl/15ml.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still cold so get your moisturizing lotion today.</li>
            <li> I am really bad about being neglectful of my hands (even though I have loads of hand products)</li>
    </ol>

Hope there’s enough in there to really give me a sense of how well it works. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it contains all natural ingredients, including jojoba oil, aloe vera, safflower oil and green tea. There are no toxic chemicals, sulfates, alcohol, propylene glycol or parabens, and their products are never tested on animals – plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion applies nice and smooth and does not leave my skin feeling greasy or oily. It’s a very light moisturizer and it absorbs quickly into my skin. The scent is very nice – floral to my nose – and refreshing, but perhaps could be just a tad more subtle. It does seem to quiet down after 5-10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this moisturizer for about 2 weeks during the day under my BB cream and at night after applying my toner and serum. I can’t say that I have noticed a vast difference in my skin, but it didn’t cause any bad reactions or irritation and treated my skin kindly - double plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is pretty good. Personally I need a bit more in the way of a moisturizer, but I would wear this under my BB cream during the day - no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I received this product in exchange for an honest review.*&lt;br /&gt;If you found my review fun and/or informative, please let me know.

            <li> Smells amazing and absorbs quickly and deeply into my skin. Great product!</li>
            <li> Nice moisturizer.  I did notice my skin looked healthier.  I didn&#x27;t order again.  Only because I wanted to try Boots.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! It has a nice subtle scent and you don&#x27;t need to squeeze out a lot to use it for your face.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  In fact, have ordered more than once, even got some for my BFF for her birthday!</li>
            <li> I received this moisturizer to try.  This product comes in a tube which allows you to easily dispense as much as you need.  I use the size of about a  pea for my face &amp; neck.  The lotion itself is white in color and very light weight. It absorbs quickly.  I am pleased with this product as it hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin at all.  I would probably use this more in the summer as my skin is extremely dry in the winter and I need a little bit more protection from the elements.  The one thing I would change is the smell.  I&#x27;m not a fan of it. It doesn&#x27;t smell horrible, but to me it doesn&#x27;t smell great either.  Overall though the product does what it promises and is a good moisturizer.  My skin is in better condition than it was a few months ago because I have really been taking care of it and make sure to use moisturizer everyday. #sponsored  For more product reviews visit my blog at www.surveysbystephanie.tumblr.com</li>
            <li> One of the best creams I used so far. I have dry skin, moisturizes very well and improves complexion. only negative thing - it&#x27;s a bit pricey for the size. would buy again.</li>
            <li> Seems healthy for the skin but I could not stand the smell of it.</li>
            <li> Nice to see so many natural ingredients. I alternate this with a Vit.C cream. I like the size &amp; the fact that it is in a squeeze tube which prevents oxidation exposure &amp; keeps it fresh longer.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. I have combination skin, and use this pretty liberally on my entire face and neck, and it moisturizes my dry areas without making my oily areas greasy. Every few days I combine this with Alba self tanner for a bit of a glow. Also, I love that this is cruelty free.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite Vitamin C product period! Yalmeh. Sent me this cream for testing purposes and for a review on my blog and this is very highly recommended from me! I will purchase nothing but this Vitamin C Cream. First, it smells amazing! That to me is very important, because if it smells bad, I&#x27;m not putting it on. This Glorify Vitamin C Cream has brightened my eyes, has reduced my brown age spots I have on my face and have had for about 7 years now and they are almost gone! This is completely worth the price, and I think if you are a female, you need this. It is NEVER to early to start taking care of your skin. I wish I would be started taking care of my skin in my 20&#x27;s and not in my 40&#x27;s but even at 42, it&#x27;s not to late to start taking g care of your skin either! Have a Merry Christmas!</li>
            <li> I have been loving all the products that Yalmeh has sent me to test out and review for them!  The most recent one is the Yalmeh Glorify Vitamin C Moisturizing Lotion.  If you follow my blog then you already know that I think Vitamin C is a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;holy grail&amp;#34; product to have in your skincare routine.  That&#x27;s what makes the Yalmeh Glorify Vitamin C Moisturizing Lotion a perfect addition!  It does so many great things for the skin like helps lighten spots, discoloration, refines skin texture and reduces wrinkle formation as well as existing wrinkles!&lt;br /&gt;As usual, I always apply my serums, oils, creams &amp; lotions to my face, neck, decollete and even my shoulders.  I have also been using this on my hands as well!  I am really bad about being neglectful of my hands (even though I have loads of hand products), I just always forget so I have been trying to just apply what is left over to top of my hands at the very least.  The lotion is really lightweight so it absorbs really easily &amp; completely into the skin and leaves it feeling soft and hydrated and not at all greasy.  It also wears really nice under makeup!</li>
            <li> Smells great. I really like this product for my skin. ALL NATURAL  no mineral oil, sulfates or alcohol, propylene glycol or paraben. Makes me feel a lot better about putting this on my face. I have not had any problems with oily skin or clogged pores or break outs. Vitamin C is great for the skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Vitamin C is one of the most powerful antioxidants in skin care. It helps slow down the aging process by preventing free radical damage. Long-term topical use has been clinically shown to regenerate collagen and improve the appearance of wrinkles. Vitamin C also lightens pigmentation and brightens over all skin tone. Therefore, it is used in a lot of anti-aging and whitening products (especially in Asia), as well as fade creams.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;When incorporated into your daily skincare lineup, well-formulated products containing vitamin C can provide a range of benefits that keep your skin younger-looking, longer! See what C can do:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reduce the appearance of brown spots and other types of sun damage&lt;br /&gt;Helps boost healthy collagen production (hello, firmer skin!)&lt;br /&gt;Reduce inflammation and irritation, both of which cause a cascade of damage&lt;br /&gt;Fade post-breakout red marks by improving skin&#x27;s natural healing response&lt;br /&gt;Increase the effectiveness of your sunscreens and boosts your skins defense against UV exposure (Dermatological Surgery, 2008 &amp; Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology, 2012 &amp; The Journal of Clinical and Aesthetic Dermatology, 2010).\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I love this product because it evened out my complexion and it got rid of some of the pigmentation left behind by breakouts and possibly sun exposure. I didn’t really take the best care of my skin when I was in my teens, so I am trying to make up for it by using the best products that works for me and my problematic skin. Yalmeh is one of the brands that I gravitate towards when it comes to skin care and anti aging, as their products have never disappointed me. I love this moisturizing lotion and I absolutely love this brand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
            <li> I love Yalmeh products because they come in beautiful small packages that can fit in your purse so easily - allowing you to use them anywhere.  The bottles are small but you really get your moneys worth out of the products - this one is 1.7 oz in a bottle that is less than half the size of a normal 1 oz bottle.  I have tried several Yalmeh products including their eye creams, and I must say their products are of the highest quality and truly do what they claim.  Antioxidants and vitamin c come together to help reduce acne and the early signs of aging when used just once a day - and let me say that &amp;#34;a dab will do ya&amp;#34; for this!  You do not need much and that means that for just $17.95 this will last you at least a couple months when used once a day.  The lotion itself is not heavy and smells clean and fresh and it leaves your face feeling smooth and refreshed without a greasy residue.  This product is also mostly for use around the eye area but it can also be applied to the rest of your face.  And like all Yalmeh products it comes with a 90 day money back guarantee and their products do not contain parabens, sulfates or alcohol.  They are also never tested on animals.  I received a complimentary product to test.</li>
            <li> Awesome cream... and smells so good. I have very dry skin and this cream is really really good for hydration</li>
            <li> The Yalmeh Glorify Vitamin c moisturizing lotion came in a small 0.5ml yellow orange tube. It fit perfect in my makeup bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After taking off the nice silver cap I used some. The lotion is very creamy. It don&#x27;t take long for it to be worked in to the skin. There really isn’t a smell to it. Honestly it just smelled like a plain lotion with a light hint of perfume flowers. A small bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion helped a lot were my nose was peeling and flaking. Like it does all the time in the winter. I used it for about a week and had friends ask what I was using that my face looked great. They had no clue I was even using anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone wants a nice creamy easy to spread lotion for the face this is the perfect moisturizing lotion. It&#x27;s made in the USA and not tested on animals which makes it even better. It&#x27;s still cold so get your moisturizing lotion today.</li>
            <li> I have been with Amazon for many years and this is the first time that a company has thought of me ,long after I purchased the face cream they still want to know if every thing is alright and if there are any problems.This cream smells so good and is fabulous!!I will order this from this company again!</li>
            <li> My most favorite lotion ever!! My face looks and feels amazing!!</li>
            <li> This lotion is very moisturizing and smells great!</li>
            <li> I started using Yalmeh skin care products while ago and I&#x27;m a fan of this brand. it&#x27;s probably another great product from them which I&#x27;m going to try.</li>
            <li> I have recently become of fan of this product line..... and I LOVE all of their products...</li>
            <li> Works great and smells great. Its real light does not leave your face all greasy.</li>
            <li> Another winner!  I have the whole regimen for my facial treatment and I love them equally.  My skin has never looked or felt better.  I just have one issue.  I read reviews on Yalmeh other products where people received free items, and I&#x27;ve never gotten anything which doesn&#x27;t make me feel appreciated with my dedication.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion... The smell is great!!! I&#x27;m big on smelling good lol.  My face seems like it just drinks up this lotion.  I was hoping to find a great lotion for my dry skin this winter and I did.  Great product..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using \\&quot;Yalmeh\\&quot; day/night cream pretty much exclusively to moisturize for some months now, and I do really like it! The problem though, (for me!), is that I often don&#x27;t apply the ideal amount. Seems like atmospheric conditions and the mood my face is in on a given day determines how much I should use, and as often as not, I guess wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t have such problems with this new lotion however! Glides on, absorbs way fast and keeps my face supple and hydrated for 12 hours or more with absolutely no stickiness or greasy feel whatsoever! So when I don&#x27;t have the time/patience to work with the cream, (which I still use often!), I can just throw on some lotion and run out the door!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Yalmeh\\&quot; continues to be my primary source for such products. True, I&#x27;ve \\&quot;strayed\\&quot; occasionally, and there are 2 or 3 products not from \\&quot;Yalmeh\\&quot; that I use \\&quot;instead of \\&quot; or \\&quot;a,s well as\\&quot; at any given time for no par,ticular reason , but \\&quot;Yalmeh\\&quot; remains my \\&quot;baseline. They strive to maintain the highest quality products at a competitive price coupled with unequalled customer service. It&#x27;s difficult for anybody to compete with such a combo!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a good, everyday use, moisturizing lotion then look no further! The Yalmeh Vitamin C Lotion is great for everyday use and for keeping your skin moisturized throughout the entire day. It has a great smell and is easy to apply. It is quickly absorbed by my skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue like some other lotions that leave a greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of quality and usefulness, this product is flawless. However, one thing that disappointed me was the fact that the picture shows that the bottle is 1.7fl and 50ml, however, the actual cream is 0.5fl/15ml. I think that the 15ml is way too small for an everday use cream because it is going to become used up really quick even though you only need a little bit to apply to your entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides that,  the lotion is very high-quality and great for everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product in exchange for an honest, unbiased review</li>
            <li> I have reviewed several different products by Yalmeh in the past year, and have been very happy with each of them. This product is called the Glorify Vitamin C Moisturizing Lotion. It is designed to be applied on the face, neck and around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The primary active ingredient in this product is, of course, vitamin C. The “sunshine vitamin” packs a wallop in terms of skin care. It does a lot of things to help protect, nourish and rebuild your precious skin. First, it acts as an antioxidant to prevent the formation of free radicals which cause damage to your skin. Next, it also acts to lighten age spots and skin discoloration. Last but not least, vitamin C helps to stimulate the production of collagen, which helps your skin look fuller and plumper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yalmeh Glorify Vitamin C Moisturizing Lotion contains a variety of plant-based ingredients including: aloe vera, jojoba oil, safflower oil and green tea. It has a light feel, and it absorbs very easily into the skin. I did not notice any irritation at all when using this product. I liked the light, creamy texture and the light scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You could use the Yalmeh Glorify Vitamin C Moisturizing Lotion as either a day or night time moisturizer. For me, I used it as a daytime moisturizer, since I use a retinol moisturizer at night. However, since the Yalmeh lotion does not have any SPF ingredients, I used an additional light moisturizer with sunscreen in order to protect my skin from the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a tube of Yalmeh Glorify Vitamin C Moisturizing Lotion for the purposes of review. All opinions expressed are my own. No other compensation was received for this review.</li>
            <li> Great facial product. I received this for being part of their VIP club and I really like the smell and the natural ingredients. My face looks noticeably different since I used this amazing vitamin C lotion. highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I like this anti-wrinkle cream because Vitamin C is effective to combat and prevent wrinkles. I highly recommend you to add Vitamin C in your beauty routine. I have dry skin so I use a vitamin c serum and Yalmeh Glorify Vitamin C Moisturizing every morning before foundation and in the evening after cleaning my face.  It is helping my wrinkles become less noticeable-which are really bad due to smoking for 20 years-and my brown spots which are many due to sunbathing in the hot Florida sun as a teenager.  I intend to buy more of their products and make it my whole skin care regime!  This is a great product and inexpensive so try it, you will love it!</li>
            <li> YALMEH Glorify Vitamin C Moisturizing Lotion Net, 15g ☆Face Cream☆ is a nicely scented cream that comes in a small tube with a tiny opening to remind you that a little goes a long way. What I like most about YALMEH Glorify Vitamin C Moisturizing Lotion Net, 15g ☆Face Cream☆ is that it protects against Antioxidants as well as refining your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this mainly to fade sun spots or in my case to give my fair complexion a boost after years of not always wearing sunscreen when I should have. In the winter you can only see a few of my freckles but in the summer look out because they all come out of hiding. As I have aged I have learned to apply a moisturizer with SPF of 15 to protect my delicate face and until recently that is all I did to protect my face if I wasn&#x27;t going to be on the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now with  YALMEH Glorify Vitamin C Moisturizing Lotion Net, 15g ☆Face Cream☆ I can help my skin heal a bit and become more youthful at the same time. I received this as part of a promotion to facilitate a honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I applied this lotion around my eyes where my eyes tend to look a bit titchy and dried these days. . Despite the fact that the one I was sent for review was a smaller tube of about 15 grams, I consider this  lotion to have all the right combination of antioxidants that protects and prevents the formation of free radicals that is primarily due to the exposure of the sun which causes dark spots, discoloration, wrinkles and fine lines. This lotion gives your skin a moisturized look and feel.and its incredible ngredients that ALSO STIMULATES THE PRODUCTION OF COLLAGEN which keeps the face nice and plumpy and volumized with youthfulness. This cream is great for all people with all diffrent skin types and I highly recommend it smells great and works just as great!!!!!.</li>
            <li> I am still on my first tube and think it is helping the wrinkles, especially the small ones.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any differences after 2 weeks but will keep using it and update my review. I&#x27;m not a big fan of the smell either. As a moisturizer, don&#x27;t expect much but pretty decent.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and feel of this moisturizer. It pairs well with my other skin products and helps even out my skin tone a little. For the price, it&#x27;s a no brainer!</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any change. I&#x27;ll try it one more month. Maybe I need a miracle. Peg</li>
            <li> I use this along with Yalmeh&#x27;s serum. I&#x27;ve been able to see a great difference in my face and am loving this product. It smells good and leaves my skin feeling and looking amazing.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer!  After applying to my face, neck and chest, I&#x27;ve added the remaining to the tops of my hands.  The age spots on my hands are diminishing!  The other day, I was at a bingo game with my 34 year old daughter, and she was introducing me to some of the women there, they were so surprised to find out I was her mom!  I was smiling ear to ear!  Yalmeh is a great product.  I apply the Yalmeh Syrum first, wait for it to dry, then apply the moisturizer.  I have very sensitive skin, and have not had any problem at all!</li>
            <li> Truly made my skin look better. Love it!</li>
            <li> not a good moisturizer for sensitive skin.  My face was burning after just two days of using it.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel amazing. Love it!</li>
            <li> This made my skin really soft and supple, i was given this to review, and i was happy with the results it gave me.</li>
            <li> Not impressed. After a couple days I thought maybe this stuff works! Then after a couple weeks I only saw my skin looking worse. I used both this and the eye cream with high hopes but was not happy with results, and smells like coppertone  sunscreen.</li>
