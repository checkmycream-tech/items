            <li>and it detangles my hair really good!</li>
            <li>In any case,  with today&#x27;s products, my kinky hair is finally beautiful without heat and straightening products.</li>
            <li>This works great for my hair.</li>
            <li>Great comb for getting out tangles</li>
            <li>Probably would work great hanging it up at the gym as well, but I haven&#x27;t tried that yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say whether the Argan Oil does anything or not, but the comb itself is great.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see a difference and didn&#x27;t expect too lol.</li>

            <li>It worked great on my ironed hair too.</li>
            <li>Instead I received some sort of brush like item, but it works great for after the shower.  </li>
            <li>This works great to detangle my rats nests.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s very smooth feeling and detangles wonderfully.</li>

            <li>I loved this comb.</li>
            <li>A good comb.</li>
            <li>it took to keep it good looking.  </li>
            <li>To me this comb is good for a horse&#x27;s tail.</li>
            <li>Even good quality combs tend to shred it.  </li>
            <li>good for tangly hair.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>It arrived on time and in good condition.  </li>
            <li>This is the best detangler comb I have ever used , and it makes your hair feel so smooth after you comb it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good comb nonetheless.</li>
            <li>Loved it.</li>
            <li>After swimming I persuaded my friend who has afro hair to try it, she was hesitant because she thought she would break it, but that wasn&#x27;t the case she also loved it and ordered herself one.</li>
            <li>good product-</li>
            <li>It is perfect for quick touch ups.</li>
            <li>Price is very fair for a durable, smooth comb.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I took the time to find an appropriate comb/brush.</li>
            <li>Although it didn&#x27;t work for me, I&#x27;m sure this would work great for those with shorter hair.</li>
            <li>Perfect for curly hair and right out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love this comb!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>LOVE it!</li>
            <li>I love this comb!  </li>
            <li>Glad I bought this one!</li>
            <li>I stumbled on this product and am I glad?!</li>
            <li>Great comb, easy to detangle with.</li>
            <li>So smooth would be great for children.</li>
            <li>Great way to keep her hair smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how it just glides through my hair.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for my biracial daughter&#x27;s very curly hair.</li>
            <li>It is nice for her to use.</li>
            <li>This wide-toothed comb is nice for curly hair.</li>
            <li>Gets out tangles nicely.</li>
            <li>Nice, sturdy, quality comb.</li>
            <li>Nice and durable.</li>
            <li>To be honest it kind of looks like a dog brush with rubber bristles and a handle.</li>
            <li>I used it when I was detangling my hair with water, and it glides through my hair easily and it feels good on the scalp.</li>
            <li>so there are no snags and if it is plastic, it needs to have a degree of flexibility suitable for the hair type.</li>
            <li>Either way, I would recommend this item- great for detangling right out of the shower.</li>
            <li>Works great, thanks!</li>
            <li>Pretty happy with this comb-</li>
            <li>I want the fine tooth one, too!  </li>
            <li>It is very smooth and glides through my hair with ease.</li>
            <li>Very smooth feel.  </li>
            <li>It is very smooth and does not tug hair at all.</li>
            <li>Received very quickly and packed nicely.</li>
            <li>but it feels nice to the touch in your hand, and the teeth are strong and sturdy.</li>
            <li>Huge comb!  </li>
            <li>Um, okay, I&#x27;ll bite.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I love this comb, it doesn&#x27;t break off in my hair nor does my hair break it.</li>
            <li>I really love this comb....</li>
            <li>I have two sizes, but this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I ordered 2 my daughters love it and uses this comb every day.</li>
            <li>I bought this comb to use after I wash my hair and love it.</li>
            <li>We all love them.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have time to sit and comb my hair for more than five minutes like I used to.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not sure about the Argan Oil.  </li>
            <li>Really love this comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>grateful to Amazon, and especially to all the people who take the time to write reviews, for opening up the wonderful world of Cricket products to me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it a week and love it.</li>
            <li>LOVE.</li>
            <li>t  just really love it.  </li>
            <li>I heard that some people just comb with their fingers, but this is so much better.</li>
            <li>I have more hair than I had before.</li>
            <li>my hair seems already seperated for the most part.</li>
            <li>I bought two for me, and four more for friends.  </li>
            <li>A good comb will have good even teeth spacing, ideally be seamless</li>
            <li>Really works great</li>
            <li>It works well, as advertised, doesn&#x27;t yank your hair or tear it like most combs.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel shiny and smooth!</li>
            <li>Whatever it is I love it.  </li>
            <li>Comb is smooth and the teeth of the comb is a nice width.</li>
            <li>I love this comb.  </li>
            <li>For traveling, I will still take my Ouidad comb since the size is more manageable.</li>
            <li>Love using this instead of a hair brush.  </li>
            <li>cause I fell in love with it, I take it with me everywhere</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it helped with the conditioning of my hair, but I love the way it felt going through my hair and</li>
            <li>They were excellent in communicating with me about the delay--which was very brief.  </li>
            <li>Really love this comb.</li>
            <li>I love this comb.</li>
            <li>This comb is Ok .</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t any better at detangling than a comb that isn&#x27;t called the detangler.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for detangling curly hair and is very durable.</li>
            <li>I liked the Cricket comb so much I purchased the corresponding pick and am loving the lift it gives my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best big free comb I&#x27;ve ever gotten in my life.</li>
            <li>Used this for the first time yesterday and was very surprised how great it worked!</li>
            <li>Perfect for combing through wet hair.</li>
            <li>Perfect comb for detangling matted, wet hair.  </li>
            <li>So far I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li>So even though I have curly hair, I think it works good for both curly and straight hair.</li>
            <li>As far as combs go this one is very nice.</li>
            <li>not bad!</li>
            <li>The hole in the handle makes it easy to hang in the shower.</li>
            <li>Easy to hold on to with my aging hands.  </li>
            <li>I also like the length of the handle, making it easy to grip the comb in the shower, even with conditioner on my hand.  </li>
            <li>but it is easy to comb my hair out.</li>
            <li>Easy to hold too.</li>
            <li>I would&#x27;ve easily paid twice the price for a product of this value.</li>
            <li>it glides easily through my hair and is well-made.</li>
            <li>Good Price and high quality.</li>
            <li>But either way, I&#x27;m fine with it.  </li>
            <li>I have shorter fine hair</li>
            <li>I have longer than shoulder length, fine hair, but I have a lot of hair.</li>
            <li>However, I have fine hair-</li>
            <li>It is a great wide tooth comb that is quite strong and doesn&#x27;t seem to be able to break easily.</li>
            <li>which is great for us, but this is not a comb for short, fine hair.</li>
            <li>This comb is HUGE..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a HUGE comb ....</li>
            <li>The teeth have nice rounded ends which massage my scalp gently but are not abrasive.</li>
            <li>This fit the bill</li>
            <li>I bought this because it&#x27;s infused with smoothing oils, and because of the great reviews it got on amazon, but I have to say my experience was different.</li>
            <li>The teeth are smooth so it doesn&#x27;t tear the hair.  </li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t snag my hair (unlike the cheap things available in the drug stores).  </li>
            <li>Overall quite happy.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t even say it is smooth between the teeth.  </li>
            <li>It glides so smooth through my hair and leaves my hair</li>
            <li>You will love it just as much as I do for sure.</li>
            <li>This comb is long, but the handle is nice and ergonomic - fits nicely in the palm of your hand and is easy to hold.</li>
            <li>I just used this comb for the first time yesterday after I washed my hair and this baby works!!</li>
            <li>This is a very large comb, but I love it.</li>
            <li>The comb itself is super smooth and overall a great quality.</li>
            <li>But believe you&#x27;re being charged more for the &#x27;Argan oil&#x27; claim, which I&#x27;ve seen no evidence if there being any sign of (I use Argan Oil on my hair in it&#x27;s pure form...very easy to spot).</li>
            <li>I have silver grey hair that tends to curl at the ends, and my wife bought a sterling holder that just slips over the elastic, and it looks great.  </li>
            <li>Great comb for long hair.</li>
            <li>This comb really is super smooth.</li>
            <li>Its great for curly, unruly, dry and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>nothing special.</li>
            <li>so I looked right away!</li>
            <li>Very large and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>A little too big but the best comb I have ever own</li>
            <li>Works great on my hair when wet .</li>
            <li>No Tangles and the wide tooth is great.</li>
            <li>really like the openings at the end of the handle and the top of the comb</li>
            <li>Boy was it worth it, really smooth and the ends of the comb do not hurt your scalp at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a good detangling comb that won&#x27;t pull my hair out, and detangle without tons of breakage - I have enough of that.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really speak on the oil infused plastic, but maybe once I use it more I can state it.  </li>
            <li>I kept noticing lots of damage and really wasn&#x27;t sure where it was coming from.</li>
            <li>it was just super affordable.  </li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t really have a problem with hair dullness but it gets out the knots and leaves my hair smooth and tangle free</li>
            <li>It has a nice thick handle with makes it easy and comfortable to hold, and it glides through my hair very smoothly.  </li>
            <li>To be fair, I did experience minor breakage</li>
            <li>I recommend this comb for any other person that is going through their own natural hair journey and needs a good comb to detangle, that can minimize breakage.</li>
            <li>After having a baby, my hair is very brittle and falls out easily.</li>
            <li>This comb is gentle on my hair, makes it easy to comb and does not pull out my hair.  </li>
            <li>easy to use and really very practical</li>
            <li>The day this arrived I found it but actually like this one better!</li>
            <li>The best comb for thick, curly hair!</li>
            <li>It is very sturdy too!!</li>
            <li>and I just want to say I love it so far!  </li>
            <li>NOW IM PRETTY AGAIN!</li>
            <li>This one is nice and wide, so it easily detangles my hair without pressure.</li>
            <li>I have very thick hair, and this comb does a wonderful job of detangling after showering.  </li>
            <li>I really do not know about the infusement of oils, but its a very easy comb!</li>
            <li>have very curly but fine hair which is a right nuisance after washing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really nice comb and the size is much bigger than shown on picture.</li>
            <li>since my relaxed part is more sensitive</li>
            <li>love it to detangle my naturally curly hair after adding leave in conditioner</li>
            <li>This comb is able to take out any tangled hair and it doesn&#x27;t break or pull on my hair since it&#x27;s seamless.</li>
            <li>Worth the price, I recommend it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll be able to use it as my hair grows out on my natural journey.</li>
            <li>RIGHT NOW AN A AIRPLANE CRASHED INTO MY BAGELS</li>
            <li>Whether the comb&#x27;s magical oil properties are at work, or if it&#x27;s just that I&#x27;m grooming myself with a comb that works through my thick, fine hair better than one&#x27;s</li>
            <li>This is a very large comb.</li>
            <li>This a very large comb or rake as it is sometimes called.</li>
            <li>This comb is most definitely sturdy and worth the money</li>
            <li>They are VERY gentle on the hair.  </li>
            <li>However, the comb is very gentle and I just recommend patience when dealing with your hair.</li>
            <li>This is the greatest comb for my hair which gets extremely tangled when wet.</li>
            <li>This comb is really large and fun to hold.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for my daughters hair which is very thick and curly!</li>
            <li>No breakage and her curls look gorgeous combed with this comb and a little detangler.</li>
            <li>so this wide tooth comb is perfect, plus it doesn&#x27;t tug my hair needless to say I love it!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this comb to anyone of any hair type because it is a true beauty benefit.</li>
            <li>Great little de-tangling comb that makes it safe to brush wet hair without fear of breakage.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel overly big in my hand, and I was able to comb through my hair in no time.</li>
            <li>This is the first comb I purchase that does my hair any justice, it is sturdy and does not pull on my hair when combing.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy how soft and shiny it leaves when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty.  </li>
            <li>I use this brush before I use my Denman brush, which really bring out my coils!</li>
            <li>Great product even for my very short hair even though it is meant for long hair.  </li>
            <li>but it really works!  </li>
            <li>Very upset!</li>
            <li>My daughter took the first one.</li>
            <li>This comb is great for thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li>but I mostly seen only shedded hair when I used this comb for the first time and since I haven&#x27;t combed my hair in over a year</li>
            <li>Great comb for my thick hair..</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time and I can count the strands of hair that came out.</li>
            <li>It never feels as though too much is being pulled right out of my scalp to the point of balding?</li>
            <li>I even tested the comb on my hands, to make sure it wasn&#x27;t rough and the comb is very smooth and has no rough edges, so there is nothing that can grab and break your hair.</li>
            <li>you can see very slight seams if you tilt the comb sideways to look at it in bright</li>
            <li>Will probably never use any other kind now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice comb I purchased to detangle my daughter&#x27;s extremely curly hair.</li>
            <li>It it pretty and feels very smooth and glides through my crispy dry hair like silk.  </li>
            <li>It runs smoothly through our hair, and has no sharp edges.  </li>
            <li>I must say that this comb makes de-tangling much faster and much easier!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s okay since I have long hair.</li>
            <li>As for the issue of the oils in the comb, I can not speak on  whether this formula contributes to the better results I get from this comb, but it does not appear to hurt my dry, brittle hair.  </li>
            <li>I needed a big comb that glides thru easily without pulling and breaking my hair.</li>
            <li>but i think it might work better on dry hair.</li>
            <li>so I hang it on a hook next to my dresser where I can grab it easily.</li>
            <li>It is made of good quality and seems like it will last a long while.  </li>
            <li>This comb is awesome, it glides through my hair seamlessly and when there is a snag I feel it and am able to finger detangle it as oppose to some other combs that will make it worse.</li>
            <li>It is also large and sturdy.</li>
            <li>It is a large comb, but again, that&#x27;s why it works for me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite large.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that this is large.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had long hair my entire life and this is the most comfortable detangler comb I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Works great with wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li>Great for wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li>This comb is smooth as silk and works easily through my few tangles.  </li>
            <li>These combs are large and have real presence.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really see the benefit of having argan oil added to the plastizers ....</li>
            <li>I really like this comb.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Love this wide tooth comb.</li>
            <li>It really helps detangle my hair.</li>
            <li>I really like this comb.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t care much about it being infused with oils, so I don&#x27;t really have an opinion on that.</li>
            <li>and it detangles gently when I&#x27;m conditioning or blow drying.</li>
            <li>comb has made my relationship with my hair so much easier.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really a miracle comb.</li>
            <li>What with plastic being porous it might be that a bit of it comes through into hair, but it doesn&#x27;t really seem like it.  </li>
            <li>Start from the very bottom and gently work your way up.  </li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t hurt her as much even though it takes a bit longer to comb.</li>
            <li>I use it so much that the writing on it is no longer there.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a big comb, and I got it free with something.  </li>
            <li>and this comb really helps with that.</li>
            <li>and then i dont really have to detangle when out of the shower...</li>
            <li>Very well made too.</li>
            <li>Very well built comb and really does make a difference</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s what I really needed.</li>
            <li>and it really does seem to get through my hair easier.  </li>
            <li>It really does help detangle hair.  </li>
            <li>The comb is very sturdy.</li>
            <li>It really does detangle your hair, which they said it was for longer hair, and I have medium length hair and it works well for me.</li>
            <li>really like the way it glides through my hair without pulling or making it frizzy.  </li>
            <li>When the product arrived, it included a couple of free gifts and a coupon for $$ off a future purchase.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know much about this stuff, but my gf loves the brush.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I have so much shed hair the size of a golf ball that has come out.  </li>
            <li>I have long straight but damaged (from too much color treatments) Asian hair, and I get huge knots really easily.</li>
            <li>Awesome comb to comb through long hair dry or wet</li>
            <li>My favorite wide tooth comb!</li>
            <li>nice buy, especially for think long hair.</li>
            <li>I am currently in a transition from relaxed to natural and this makes my detangling process easy...</li>
            <li>I much preferred my previous comb that had more rounded edges and a hook on the end</li>
            <li>It is very smooth around the edges which causes less snags during detangling.</li>
            <li>if your natural, I uses it all the time for my kinds who has natural curly hair , it is  detangle free comb for curly hair and natural hair.</li>
            <li>It is possible that the comb itself may be constructed well enough to allow good detangling but this is not necessarily anything to do with the oil infusion.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s probably even better is that, just because your hair isn&#x27;t being torn, it does end up smoother and healthier, and a lot less falls out  </li>
            <li>My older sister is now using it on her hair, and I can never find it because she is always using it.</li>
            <li>Its pretty big So be aware of that.</li>
            <li>I purchased this comb because it was seamless and didn&#x27;t really mind too much that it was infused with oils.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit larger than I expected, but that&#x27;s my own fault for not checking the size.  </li>
            <li>Other reviewers said it was seamless and very smooth between the teeth.  </li>
            <li>I see why these were highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this comb.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this comb.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this comb for curly hair.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>you have highly textured hair that breaks when you comb it</li>
            <li>I think it would work better if the teeth were a little slimmer.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a GREAT detangler for thin and think hair!  </li>
            <li>The Cricket Ultra Smooth wide tooth comb has helped me as I undergo the process of rebuilding my damaged hair.  </li>
            <li>I have natural curly hair and this comb has made life so much easier for me.</li>
            <li>It is also more durable and can take a few falls to the floor.</li>
            <li>I love Cricket combs, but the oils does not last long in these or any I have bought.</li>
            <li>Gets through my somewhat thick hair nicely.</li>
            <li>The comb will out live me.</li>
            <li>- I buy a new one every four months or so.</li>
            <li>The hugeness of it, and large spaces between teeth, mean your hair doesn&#x27;t get ripped up as with most</li>
            <li>We both have thick hair and this is a great detangler when wet combing our hair.</li>
            <li>It has a smooth feel overall, handles well, and makes short work of after shower tangles.</li>
            <li>It is so useful for those of us who want to go natural and have very coarse hair.</li>
            <li>The holder has Celtic designs and is very masculine.  </li>
            <li>She said it works so much better than a traditional brush due to less breakage and it gets her tangles out easily and pain-free.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was sure what to expect when it said that it was &amp;#34;infused&amp;#34; I&#x27;m still not sure</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty darned massive.</li>
            <li>This comb is actually pretty big</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what the benefit of the argan oil is; maybe it&#x27;s to reduce static electricity imparted to my hair (if that&#x27;s it, it works).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how much better it is than the stuff you can get at Sally&#x27;s, but I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time last night</li>
            <li>only Con is the lettering rubbed off the first time I washed it...</li>
            <li>Great for long thick hair!</li>
            <li>Its huge and not very smooth.</li>
            <li>easy to get tangles out and blow dry without the regular brushes.</li>
            <li>The two others are the &amp;#34;Cricket Ultra Clean UC130&amp;#34; One of those lives in my purse and the other one has holes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d go through a cheap comb about once a month because my hair would break the tines off, leaving about half of them intact.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell if its actually infused with all the stuff it says, but I needed a new comb for detangling after the shower and this was priced well</li>
            <li>i.e super low levels, nothing that would actually constitute a coating of oil).</li>
            <li>I it large enough to use in and out of the shower, since it does not pull on the hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s seamless as well, so it doesn&#x27;t get caught in her hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft plastic</li>
            <li>As far as argan infused....</li>
            <li>I bought this one to replace my old one.</li>
            <li>It is seamless and so snags....</li>
            <li>This comb is durable and soft when running through my rug.</li>
            <li>But the whole &amp;#34;Infused with argan oil&amp;#34; thing is totally BS.</li>
            <li>my daughter has really curly hair, still relatively short</li>
            <li>im 3c/4a natural if that helps</li>
            <li>Not too close together or too far apart.</li>
            <li>De tangles my natural hair without any snags.</li>
            <li>I bought this hoping it was seamless.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by the size of this comb.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>have very dense and tick hair and still this comb is way too big for what it is needed.</li>
            <li>So far, I seen a reduction of frizz in my hair since I used it.</li>
            <li>There is a hole at the end of the handle, but it is not big enough to do anything useful.</li>
            <li>It is nice sturdy plastic, but unfortunately, the seams are the main thing I wanted to avoid.</li>
            <li>The plastic is very smooth, thick and feels sturdy, with a slight weight in the hand when you hold it, but it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, just weighs more than a normal comb.</li>
            <li>This comb has made wearing a ponytail possible, and I highly recommend it,</li>
            <li>It is very gentle on wet hair for de-tangling.</li>
            <li>smoothly, with very little pull.  </li>
            <li>fantastic job, wet or dry.</li>
            <li>The teeth are wide apart and smooths wet hair easily.</li>
            <li>They are apparently located near the Jersey shore and were disrupted by Hurricane Sandy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit ridiculously large, but it doesn&#x27;t pull your hair and even combs through dry curls too, without making my hair too frizzy.</li>
            <li>Not sure how much the fact that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;infused&amp;#34; really matters or does anything to tame frizz, but it&#x27;s works well on my curly and easily tangled</li>
            <li>I can certainly say that from a materials science perspective that it is possible that if you rub your hair against any plastic comb, it may be possible for plastic from that comb to be found in trace amounts (</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it will last at least 20 years.</li>
            <li>Also there are no sharp edges on this comb, so it won&#x27;t damage your scalp.</li>
            <li>A tip for de-tangling wet hair, especially those with a sensitive scalp is to start at the bottom and de-tangle a little bit at a time, towards the top.</li>
            <li>I guess if I were being really picky, I&#x27;d like for there to be a few more teeth so the spaces in between were a little smaller.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a large wide tooth comb this is it.</li>
            <li>This comb is large, wide tooth, and it&#x27;s sturdy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d almost given up on ever having long hair simply because it was too much of a pain to detangle with the comb and brush</li>
            <li>I take care of my hair a lot and my last comb broke since it was already old.</li>
            <li>I was surprised however at how big the teeth are !  </li>
            <li>i have used it on wet hair and their hasnt been too much breakage</li>
            <li>I bought a travel sized conair one from target but the length was frustrating since I had to take more brush strokes, also the teeth of the comb were still too close together</li>
            <li>I really like this comb and would recommend it to other&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I was a little irritated at first</li>
            <li>My hair is long and thick and tangles easily.</li>
            <li>im not sure about that part but its worth its $</li>
            <li>You still have to be careful if you have thick long hair (which is what I have) to comb in sections and the lower ends first, before you go up a few more inches until you finally reach the top, but this comb just avoids any unnecessary tangling and pulling.  </li>
            <li>Since I have learned how to shampoo and add conditioner with a broad tooth comb always combing back from the forehead to the tip ends of the hair, rinsing in like manner, then drying with a towel from front to back.  </li>
            <li>I have Kinky coily hair with heat damaged ends (half of my hair is straight)</li>
            <li>My daughter has super thick hair</li>
            <li>The length is about mid back, and I see no reason to cut it yet since it curls down my back and is very distinctive.  </li>
            <li>I have very long thick wavy hair and live in a cold climate during the winter where there is a lot of static in my hair after washing it but this comb keeps the static way down.</li>

            <li> Probably would work great hanging it up at the gym as well, but I haven&#x27;t tried that yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say whether the Argan Oil does anything or not, but the comb itself is great.  </li>

            <li> BUT, more importantly, I am impressed with the company.  </li>
            <li> The best comb for fine hair that tangles.</li>
            <li> This is a good detangling comb.</li>
            <li> It is a good comb.</li>
            <li> I loved this comb.</li>
            <li> A good comb.</li>
            <li> it took to keep it good looking.  </li>
            <li> To me this comb is good for a horse&#x27;s tail.</li>
            <li> Even good quality combs tend to shred it.  </li>
            <li> good for tangly hair.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and in good condition.  </li>
            <li> This is the best detangler comb I have ever used , and it makes your hair feel so smooth after you comb it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good comb nonetheless.</li>
            <li> Loved it.</li>
            <li> After swimming I persuaded my friend who has afro hair to try it, she was hesitant because she thought she would break it, but that wasn&#x27;t the case she also loved it and ordered herself one.</li>
            <li> good product-</li>
            <li> It is perfect for quick touch ups.</li>
            <li> Price is very fair for a durable, smooth comb.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I took the time to find an appropriate comb/brush.</li>
            <li> Although it didn&#x27;t work for me, I&#x27;m sure this would work great for those with shorter hair.</li>
            <li> Perfect for curly hair and right out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this comb!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I love this comb!  </li>
            <li> Glad I bought this one!</li>
            <li> I stumbled on this product and am I glad?!</li>
            <li> Great comb, easy to detangle with.</li>
            <li> So smooth would be great for children.</li>
            <li> Great way to keep her hair smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how it just glides through my hair.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for my biracial daughter&#x27;s very curly hair.</li>
            <li> It is nice for her to use.</li>
            <li> This wide-toothed comb is nice for curly hair.</li>
            <li> Gets out tangles nicely.</li>
            <li> Nice, sturdy, quality comb.</li>
            <li> Nice and durable.</li>
            <li> To be honest it kind of looks like a dog brush with rubber bristles and a handle.</li>
            <li> I used it when I was detangling my hair with water, and it glides through my hair easily and it feels good on the scalp.</li>
            <li> so there are no snags and if it is plastic, it needs to have a degree of flexibility suitable for the hair type.</li>
            <li> Either way, I would recommend this item- great for detangling right out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Works great, thanks!</li>
            <li> Pretty happy with this comb-</li>
            <li> I want the fine tooth one, too!  </li>
            <li> It is very smooth and glides through my hair with ease.</li>
            <li> Very smooth feel.  </li>
            <li> It is very smooth and does not tug hair at all.</li>
            <li> Received very quickly and packed nicely.</li>
            <li> but it feels nice to the touch in your hand, and the teeth are strong and sturdy.</li>
            <li> Huge comb!  </li>
            <li> Um, okay, I&#x27;ll bite.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I love this comb, it doesn&#x27;t break off in my hair nor does my hair break it.</li>
            <li> I really love this comb....</li>
            <li> I have two sizes, but this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I ordered 2 my daughters love it and uses this comb every day.</li>
            <li> I bought this comb to use after I wash my hair and love it.</li>
            <li> We all love them.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have time to sit and comb my hair for more than five minutes like I used to.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not sure about the Argan Oil.  </li>
            <li> Really love this comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> grateful to Amazon, and especially to all the people who take the time to write reviews, for opening up the wonderful world of Cricket products to me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it a week and love it.</li>
            <li> LOVE.</li>
            <li> t  just really love it.  </li>
            <li> I heard that some people just comb with their fingers, but this is so much better.</li>
            <li> I have more hair than I had before.</li>
            <li> my hair seems already seperated for the most part.</li>
            <li> I bought two for me, and four more for friends.  </li>
            <li> A good comb will have good even teeth spacing, ideally be seamless</li>
            <li> Really works great</li>
            <li> It works well, as advertised, doesn&#x27;t yank your hair or tear it like most combs.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel shiny and smooth!</li>
            <li> Whatever it is I love it.  </li>
            <li> Comb is smooth and the teeth of the comb is a nice width.</li>
            <li> I love this comb.  </li>
            <li> For traveling, I will still take my Ouidad comb since the size is more manageable.</li>
            <li> Love using this instead of a hair brush.  </li>
            <li> cause I fell in love with it, I take it with me everywhere</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it helped with the conditioning of my hair, but I love the way it felt going through my hair and</li>
            <li> They were excellent in communicating with me about the delay--which was very brief.  </li>
            <li> Really love this comb.</li>
            <li> I love this comb.</li>
            <li> This comb is Ok .</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t any better at detangling than a comb that isn&#x27;t called the detangler.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for detangling curly hair and is very durable.</li>
            <li> I liked the Cricket comb so much I purchased the corresponding pick and am loving the lift it gives my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best big free comb I&#x27;ve ever gotten in my life.</li>
            <li> Used this for the first time yesterday and was very surprised how great it worked!</li>
            <li> Perfect for combing through wet hair.</li>
            <li> Perfect comb for detangling matted, wet hair.  </li>
            <li> So far I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> So even though I have curly hair, I think it works good for both curly and straight hair.</li>
            <li> As far as combs go this one is very nice.</li>
            <li> not bad!</li>
            <li> The hole in the handle makes it easy to hang in the shower.</li>
            <li> Easy to hold on to with my aging hands.  </li>
            <li> I also like the length of the handle, making it easy to grip the comb in the shower, even with conditioner on my hand.  </li>
            <li> but it is easy to comb my hair out.</li>
            <li> Easy to hold too.</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve easily paid twice the price for a product of this value.</li>
            <li> it glides easily through my hair and is well-made.</li>
            <li> Good Price and high quality.</li>
            <li> But either way, I&#x27;m fine with it.  </li>
            <li> I have shorter fine hair</li>
            <li> I have longer than shoulder length, fine hair, but I have a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> However, I have fine hair-</li>
            <li> It is a great wide tooth comb that is quite strong and doesn&#x27;t seem to be able to break easily.</li>
            <li> which is great for us, but this is not a comb for short, fine hair.</li>
            <li> This comb is HUGE..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a HUGE comb ....</li>
            <li> The teeth have nice rounded ends which massage my scalp gently but are not abrasive.</li>
            <li> This fit the bill</li>
            <li> I bought this because it&#x27;s infused with smoothing oils, and because of the great reviews it got on amazon, but I have to say my experience was different.</li>
            <li> The teeth are smooth so it doesn&#x27;t tear the hair.  </li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t snag my hair (unlike the cheap things available in the drug stores).  </li>
            <li> Overall quite happy.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t even say it is smooth between the teeth.  </li>
            <li> It glides so smooth through my hair and leaves my hair</li>
            <li> You will love it just as much as I do for sure.</li>
            <li> This comb is long, but the handle is nice and ergonomic - fits nicely in the palm of your hand and is easy to hold.</li>
            <li> I just used this comb for the first time yesterday after I washed my hair and this baby works!!</li>
            <li> This is a very large comb, but I love it.</li>
            <li> The comb itself is super smooth and overall a great quality.</li>
            <li> But believe you&#x27;re being charged more for the &#x27;Argan oil&#x27; claim, which I&#x27;ve seen no evidence if there being any sign of (I use Argan Oil on my hair in it&#x27;s pure form...very easy to spot).</li>
            <li> I have silver grey hair that tends to curl at the ends, and my wife bought a sterling holder that just slips over the elastic, and it looks great.  </li>
            <li> Great comb for long hair.</li>
            <li> This comb really is super smooth.</li>
            <li> Its great for curly, unruly, dry and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> nothing special.</li>
            <li> so I looked right away!</li>
            <li> Very large and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> A little too big but the best comb I have ever own</li>
            <li> Works great on my hair when wet .</li>
            <li> No Tangles and the wide tooth is great.</li>
            <li> really like the openings at the end of the handle and the top of the comb</li>
            <li> Boy was it worth it, really smooth and the ends of the comb do not hurt your scalp at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good detangling comb that won&#x27;t pull my hair out, and detangle without tons of breakage - I have enough of that.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really speak on the oil infused plastic, but maybe once I use it more I can state it.  </li>
            <li> I kept noticing lots of damage and really wasn&#x27;t sure where it was coming from.</li>
            <li> it was just super affordable.  </li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t really have a problem with hair dullness but it gets out the knots and leaves my hair smooth and tangle free</li>
            <li> It has a nice thick handle with makes it easy and comfortable to hold, and it glides through my hair very smoothly.  </li>
            <li> To be fair, I did experience minor breakage</li>
            <li> I recommend this comb for any other person that is going through their own natural hair journey and needs a good comb to detangle, that can minimize breakage.</li>
            <li> After having a baby, my hair is very brittle and falls out easily.</li>
            <li> This comb is gentle on my hair, makes it easy to comb and does not pull out my hair.  </li>
            <li> easy to use and really very practical</li>
            <li> The day this arrived I found it but actually like this one better!</li>
            <li> The best comb for thick, curly hair!</li>
            <li> It is very sturdy too!!</li>
            <li> and I just want to say I love it so far!  </li>
            <li> NOW IM PRETTY AGAIN!</li>
            <li> This one is nice and wide, so it easily detangles my hair without pressure.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair, and this comb does a wonderful job of detangling after showering.  </li>
            <li> I really do not know about the infusement of oils, but its a very easy comb!</li>
            <li> have very curly but fine hair which is a right nuisance after washing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really nice comb and the size is much bigger than shown on picture.</li>
            <li> since my relaxed part is more sensitive</li>
            <li> love it to detangle my naturally curly hair after adding leave in conditioner</li>
            <li> This comb is able to take out any tangled hair and it doesn&#x27;t break or pull on my hair since it&#x27;s seamless.</li>
            <li> Worth the price, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll be able to use it as my hair grows out on my natural journey.</li>
            <li> RIGHT NOW AN A AIRPLANE CRASHED INTO MY BAGELS</li>
            <li> Whether the comb&#x27;s magical oil properties are at work, or if it&#x27;s just that I&#x27;m grooming myself with a comb that works through my thick, fine hair better than one&#x27;s</li>
            <li> This is a very large comb.</li>
            <li> This a very large comb or rake as it is sometimes called.</li>
            <li> This comb is most definitely sturdy and worth the money</li>
            <li> They are VERY gentle on the hair.  </li>
            <li> However, the comb is very gentle and I just recommend patience when dealing with your hair.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest comb for my hair which gets extremely tangled when wet.</li>
            <li> This comb is really large and fun to hold.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for my daughters hair which is very thick and curly!</li>
            <li> No breakage and her curls look gorgeous combed with this comb and a little detangler.</li>
            <li> so this wide tooth comb is perfect, plus it doesn&#x27;t tug my hair needless to say I love it!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this comb to anyone of any hair type because it is a true beauty benefit.</li>
            <li> Great little de-tangling comb that makes it safe to brush wet hair without fear of breakage.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel overly big in my hand, and I was able to comb through my hair in no time.</li>
            <li> This is the first comb I purchase that does my hair any justice, it is sturdy and does not pull on my hair when combing.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy how soft and shiny it leaves when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty.  </li>
            <li> I use this brush before I use my Denman brush, which really bring out my coils!</li>
            <li> Great product even for my very short hair even though it is meant for long hair.  </li>
            <li> but it really works!  </li>
            <li> Very upset!</li>
            <li> My daughter took the first one.</li>
            <li> This comb is great for thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> but I mostly seen only shedded hair when I used this comb for the first time and since I haven&#x27;t combed my hair in over a year</li>
            <li> Great comb for my thick hair..</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time and I can count the strands of hair that came out.</li>
            <li> It never feels as though too much is being pulled right out of my scalp to the point of balding?</li>
            <li> I even tested the comb on my hands, to make sure it wasn&#x27;t rough and the comb is very smooth and has no rough edges, so there is nothing that can grab and break your hair.</li>
            <li> you can see very slight seams if you tilt the comb sideways to look at it in bright</li>
            <li> Will probably never use any other kind now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice comb I purchased to detangle my daughter&#x27;s extremely curly hair.</li>
            <li> It it pretty and feels very smooth and glides through my crispy dry hair like silk.  </li>
            <li> It runs smoothly through our hair, and has no sharp edges.  </li>
            <li> I must say that this comb makes de-tangling much faster and much easier!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s okay since I have long hair.</li>
            <li> As for the issue of the oils in the comb, I can not speak on  whether this formula contributes to the better results I get from this comb, but it does not appear to hurt my dry, brittle hair.  </li>
            <li> I needed a big comb that glides thru easily without pulling and breaking my hair.</li>
            <li> but i think it might work better on dry hair.</li>
            <li> so I hang it on a hook next to my dresser where I can grab it easily.</li>
            <li> It is made of good quality and seems like it will last a long while.  </li>
            <li> This comb is awesome, it glides through my hair seamlessly and when there is a snag I feel it and am able to finger detangle it as oppose to some other combs that will make it worse.</li>
            <li> It is also large and sturdy.</li>
            <li> It is a large comb, but again, that&#x27;s why it works for me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite large.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that this is large.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had long hair my entire life and this is the most comfortable detangler comb I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> Works great with wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> Great for wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> This comb is smooth as silk and works easily through my few tangles.  </li>
            <li> These combs are large and have real presence.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really see the benefit of having argan oil added to the plastizers ....</li>
            <li> I really like this comb.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Love this wide tooth comb.</li>
            <li> It really helps detangle my hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this comb.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t care much about it being infused with oils, so I don&#x27;t really have an opinion on that.</li>
            <li> and it detangles gently when I&#x27;m conditioning or blow drying.</li>
            <li> comb has made my relationship with my hair so much easier.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really a miracle comb.</li>
            <li> What with plastic being porous it might be that a bit of it comes through into hair, but it doesn&#x27;t really seem like it.  </li>
            <li> Start from the very bottom and gently work your way up.  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t hurt her as much even though it takes a bit longer to comb.</li>
            <li> I use it so much that the writing on it is no longer there.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a big comb, and I got it free with something.  </li>
            <li> and this comb really helps with that.</li>
            <li> and then i dont really have to detangle when out of the shower...</li>
            <li> Very well made too.</li>
            <li> Very well built comb and really does make a difference</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s what I really needed.</li>
            <li> and it really does seem to get through my hair easier.  </li>
            <li> It really does help detangle hair.  </li>
            <li> The comb is very sturdy.</li>
            <li> It really does detangle your hair, which they said it was for longer hair, and I have medium length hair and it works well for me.</li>
            <li> really like the way it glides through my hair without pulling or making it frizzy.  </li>
            <li> When the product arrived, it included a couple of free gifts and a coupon for $$ off a future purchase.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know much about this stuff, but my gf loves the brush.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have so much shed hair the size of a golf ball that has come out.  </li>
            <li> I have long straight but damaged (from too much color treatments) Asian hair, and I get huge knots really easily.</li>
            <li> Awesome comb to comb through long hair dry or wet</li>
            <li> My favorite wide tooth comb!</li>
            <li> nice buy, especially for think long hair.</li>
            <li> I am currently in a transition from relaxed to natural and this makes my detangling process easy...</li>
            <li> I much preferred my previous comb that had more rounded edges and a hook on the end</li>
            <li> It is very smooth around the edges which causes less snags during detangling.</li>
            <li> if your natural, I uses it all the time for my kinds who has natural curly hair , it is  detangle free comb for curly hair and natural hair.</li>
            <li> It is possible that the comb itself may be constructed well enough to allow good detangling but this is not necessarily anything to do with the oil infusion.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s probably even better is that, just because your hair isn&#x27;t being torn, it does end up smoother and healthier, and a lot less falls out  </li>
            <li> My older sister is now using it on her hair, and I can never find it because she is always using it.</li>
            <li> Its pretty big So be aware of that.</li>
            <li> I purchased this comb because it was seamless and didn&#x27;t really mind too much that it was infused with oils.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit larger than I expected, but that&#x27;s my own fault for not checking the size.  </li>
            <li> Other reviewers said it was seamless and very smooth between the teeth.  </li>
            <li> I see why these were highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this comb.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this comb.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this comb for curly hair.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> you have highly textured hair that breaks when you comb it</li>
            <li> I think it would work better if the teeth were a little slimmer.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a GREAT detangler for thin and think hair!  </li>
            <li> The Cricket Ultra Smooth wide tooth comb has helped me as I undergo the process of rebuilding my damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> I have natural curly hair and this comb has made life so much easier for me.</li>
            <li> It is also more durable and can take a few falls to the floor.</li>
            <li> I love Cricket combs, but the oils does not last long in these or any I have bought.</li>
            <li> Gets through my somewhat thick hair nicely.</li>
            <li> The comb will out live me.</li>
            <li> - I buy a new one every four months or so.</li>
            <li> The hugeness of it, and large spaces between teeth, mean your hair doesn&#x27;t get ripped up as with most</li>
            <li> We both have thick hair and this is a great detangler when wet combing our hair.</li>
            <li> It has a smooth feel overall, handles well, and makes short work of after shower tangles.</li>
            <li> It is so useful for those of us who want to go natural and have very coarse hair.</li>
            <li> The holder has Celtic designs and is very masculine.  </li>
            <li> She said it works so much better than a traditional brush due to less breakage and it gets her tangles out easily and pain-free.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was sure what to expect when it said that it was &amp;#34;infused&amp;#34; I&#x27;m still not sure</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty darned massive.</li>
            <li> This comb is actually pretty big</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the benefit of the argan oil is; maybe it&#x27;s to reduce static electricity imparted to my hair (if that&#x27;s it, it works).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much better it is than the stuff you can get at Sally&#x27;s, but I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time last night</li>
            <li> only Con is the lettering rubbed off the first time I washed it...</li>
            <li> Great for long thick hair!</li>
            <li> Its huge and not very smooth.</li>
            <li> easy to get tangles out and blow dry without the regular brushes.</li>
            <li> The two others are the &amp;#34;Cricket Ultra Clean UC130&amp;#34; One of those lives in my purse and the other one has holes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d go through a cheap comb about once a month because my hair would break the tines off, leaving about half of them intact.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell if its actually infused with all the stuff it says, but I needed a new comb for detangling after the shower and this was priced well</li>
            <li> i.e super low levels, nothing that would actually constitute a coating of oil).</li>
            <li> I it large enough to use in and out of the shower, since it does not pull on the hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s seamless as well, so it doesn&#x27;t get caught in her hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft plastic</li>
            <li> As far as argan infused....</li>
            <li> I bought this one to replace my old one.</li>
            <li> It is seamless and so snags....</li>
            <li> This comb is durable and soft when running through my rug.</li>
            <li> But the whole &amp;#34;Infused with argan oil&amp;#34; thing is totally BS.</li>
            <li> my daughter has really curly hair, still relatively short</li>
            <li> im 3c/4a natural if that helps</li>
            <li> Not too close together or too far apart.</li>
            <li> De tangles my natural hair without any snags.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it was seamless.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the size of this comb.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> have very dense and tick hair and still this comb is way too big for what it is needed.</li>
            <li> So far, I seen a reduction of frizz in my hair since I used it.</li>
            <li> There is a hole at the end of the handle, but it is not big enough to do anything useful.</li>
            <li> It is nice sturdy plastic, but unfortunately, the seams are the main thing I wanted to avoid.</li>
            <li> The plastic is very smooth, thick and feels sturdy, with a slight weight in the hand when you hold it, but it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, just weighs more than a normal comb.</li>
            <li> This comb has made wearing a ponytail possible, and I highly recommend it,</li>
            <li> It is very gentle on wet hair for de-tangling.</li>
            <li> smoothly, with very little pull.  </li>
            <li> fantastic job, wet or dry.</li>
            <li> The teeth are wide apart and smooths wet hair easily.</li>
            <li> They are apparently located near the Jersey shore and were disrupted by Hurricane Sandy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit ridiculously large, but it doesn&#x27;t pull your hair and even combs through dry curls too, without making my hair too frizzy.</li>
            <li> Not sure how much the fact that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;infused&amp;#34; really matters or does anything to tame frizz, but it&#x27;s works well on my curly and easily tangled</li>
            <li> I can certainly say that from a materials science perspective that it is possible that if you rub your hair against any plastic comb, it may be possible for plastic from that comb to be found in trace amounts (</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it will last at least 20 years.</li>
            <li> Also there are no sharp edges on this comb, so it won&#x27;t damage your scalp.</li>
            <li> A tip for de-tangling wet hair, especially those with a sensitive scalp is to start at the bottom and de-tangle a little bit at a time, towards the top.</li>
            <li> I guess if I were being really picky, I&#x27;d like for there to be a few more teeth so the spaces in between were a little smaller.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a large wide tooth comb this is it.</li>
            <li> This comb is large, wide tooth, and it&#x27;s sturdy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d almost given up on ever having long hair simply because it was too much of a pain to detangle with the comb and brush</li>
            <li> I take care of my hair a lot and my last comb broke since it was already old.</li>
            <li> I was surprised however at how big the teeth are !  </li>
            <li> i have used it on wet hair and their hasnt been too much breakage</li>
            <li> I bought a travel sized conair one from target but the length was frustrating since I had to take more brush strokes, also the teeth of the comb were still too close together</li>
            <li> I really like this comb and would recommend it to other&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I was a little irritated at first</li>
            <li> My hair is long and thick and tangles easily.</li>
            <li> im not sure about that part but its worth its $</li>
            <li> You still have to be careful if you have thick long hair (which is what I have) to comb in sections and the lower ends first, before you go up a few more inches until you finally reach the top, but this comb just avoids any unnecessary tangling and pulling.  </li>
            <li> Since I have learned how to shampoo and add conditioner with a broad tooth comb always combing back from the forehead to the tip ends of the hair, rinsing in like manner, then drying with a towel from front to back.  </li>
            <li> I have Kinky coily hair with heat damaged ends (half of my hair is straight)</li>
            <li> My daughter has super thick hair</li>
            <li> The length is about mid back, and I see no reason to cut it yet since it curls down my back and is very distinctive.  </li>
            <li> I have very long thick wavy hair and live in a cold climate during the winter where there is a lot of static in my hair after washing it but this comb keeps the static way down.</li>
            <li> Although it isn&#x27;t completely &amp;#34;seamless,&amp;#34; there is a vast reduction in the seams compared to other combs-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a huge comb -- folks with small hands may have trouble getting the hang of it (literally) for the first few tries.  </li>
            <li> It is supposedly infused with argan oil, but I&#x27;m not sure if that really makes any difference since it&#x27;s plastic.</li>
            <li> I have jewish afro, curly girl type 3b hair, long.  </li>
            <li> It only has 13 teeth, and it&#x27;s about twelve feet long, so you can comb dreadlocks with it.  </li>
            <li> I hope it last as long as my others.</li>
            <li> so I believe it should last a long time</li>
            <li> She is caucasain with &amp;#34;3a&amp;#34;, long (well past shoulder length) fine but thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this comb to people who have thick, coarse curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have really long hair &amp; don&#x27;t like the breakage factor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for something like this for so long.</li>
            <li> I guess this comb is for those who have really long hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my daughttrs long tangly hair.  </li>
            <li> It definitely is not seamless however.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I would recommend this for long unruly hair when other combs have fallen short.</li>
            <li> have to dread washing my hair now as there&#x27;s no risk of my arms being ripped out of their sockets as long as I use this comb!  </li>
            <li> I have very long hair, and although it is</li>
            <li> this thing is a lot bigger than the average comb</li>
            <li> I have natural 3/4 hair and usually when I detangle my hair after shampooing &amp; conditioning</li>
            <li> I bought this after my stylist used it on my long wet hair.  </li>
            <li> but the comb is as big as half of my arm.</li>
            <li> I use this whenever I wash my hair while its still wet then again once dry.</li>
            <li> End up with a floppy mess simply because I&#x27;ve not felt up to the workout of getting all the knots undone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a little silky and shiny - just enough to notice.  </li>
            <li> Picking up a few extra, one for the house and one for the gym bag.</li>
            <li> It has wide bristol that will help with detangling but</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s convenient to use on wet hair</li>
            <li> I just bought it because of the wide teeth to minimize breakage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wide toothed comb, as advertised and it is sturdy.  </li>
            <li> told me that I need to use a comb when my hair is wet to prevent breakage</li>
            <li> Works well on my wet hair.</li>
            <li> and im rough.</li>
            <li> it is a wide tooth comb</li>
            <li> but I do like the wide spacing between the teeth.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this on wet hair yet</li>
            <li> I had minimal breakage.</li>
            <li> my hair breaks when I comb it while it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li> This is a well made detangling comb and it worked well on my wet hair.</li>
            <li> and this comb can go thru wet tangles like butter.</li>
            <li> I have thick African American hair that Cricket&#x27;s detangling brush cannot penetrate.  </li>
            <li> so will any other wide tooth comb.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very smooth, and makes detangling my hair much less painful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d advise saving some money and just buying a comb with wide spacing if you have curly hair and forget any claims about one imparting oil (not sure how this is even possible, but I fell for it as well).</li>
            <li> only issue I have is that I need to use another brush to get the less serious tangles out since this comb has such wide teeth.</li>
            <li> I am black/african-american and have thick, coily/curly natural hair, and I&#x27;ve noticed less breakage and hair loss while using this comb.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first -- Argan Oil in a comb?  </li>
            <li> I was trying to replace my other cricket comb</li>
            <li> Definitively a plus considering the other combs my hair has broke.</li>
            <li> Regardless, now it sits in the Comb graveyard drawer with the other combs that I don&#x27;t use anymore.</li>
            <li> However I bought it for the infused with oil component, however it makes no difference to my hair than my other diet anglers .</li>
            <li> This comb helps me detangle my hair with minimal breakage and hair lose!</li>
            <li> how I didn&#x27;t hear those \\&quot;snap\\&quot; sounds that you tend to hear with other combs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it actually makes my hair shinier</li>
            <li> I can see now there are other options.  </li>
            <li> i have to be very careful so that i dont experience breakage</li>
            <li> I know that seems weird, but I live in a small house with very little storage space, so I have to hang things on my walls and they&#x27;re very visible.</li>
            <li> This comb does not pull half my hair out like some other combs</li>
            <li> Sometimes I&#x27;m tempted to use conditioner just to avoid the pulling and tugging, but it&#x27;s never worth it as my hair doesn&#x27;t like conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Sounds silly but really makes a difference.  </li>
            <li> I have the opposite problem as my hair is thick and breaks combs.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever find a comb that would go through my thick, coarse hair, but this one did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now, and none of the bristles have broken off yet (a new record for me and combs).</li>
            <li> Makes hairdo time much less of a battle.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if its my hair - i previously had stopped all combing and brushing to keep my curls intact.  </li>
            <li> My detangling time has now been cut in half.</li>
            <li> Using it also results in less hair breakage and less hair getting yanked</li>
            <li> I had a Conair comb for less than a year and the combs broke in my hair trying to get the knots out.</li>
            <li> I shed less hair and detangle in 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed less snagging and less consequent breakage as a result.</li>
            <li> I  have less hair loss  which works for me.  </li>
            <li> If you like a HUGE comb then you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The teeth are not good enough to use on your hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this comb to detangle my long thick hair after washing and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have that long of hair, but my hair is thick.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair</li>
            <li> Both my daughter and i have long thick hair</li>
            <li> No frizz anymore in the little ones hair.  </li>
            <li> Comb is a little on the pricey side</li>
            <li> I bought two one for me and my little girl.  </li>
            <li> WHAT I EXPECTED, NOPE !!!</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is really messy.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, I don&#x27;t know why I did.</li>
            <li> , I have trouble with tangles.  </li>
            <li> Just few strokes and it perfects the unruly hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have had this for a few months now and use it everyday.</li>
            <li> But this one is my everyday comb.</li>
            <li> Detangles my type 4C thick hair with minimal to no breakage.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally thin and straight but it does knot a lot since it&#x27;s thin.</li>
            <li> I have long thick course hair and when I wash it my hair tangles a lot!</li>
            <li> I have derriere-length and very thick hair, and the reason it&#x27;s so long and thick is because I never brush it.  </li>
            <li> My wife wanted me to grow a ponytail, and not having any experience with this, I was shocked to discover how much time and effort</li>
            <li> Sorry, I wanted to believe in it and save myself an extra step in putting product on my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about it being oil infused or whatever.</li>
            <li> Not sure about the Argan oil</li>
            <li> Still not sure about the oil(s).</li>
            <li> Im not sure how the oil infusion worked.</li>
            <li> Not sure the supposed oil&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
            <li> I recommend it to any one with long hair thick or thin!</li>
            <li> Duh.</li>
            <li> Thick and sturdy plastic construction.</li>
            <li> gave this to my niece with thick curly hair...</li>
            <li> It is a relatively thick and sturdy plastic comb and the loop on the end is convenient for hanging it up and leaving it in the shower.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair and it&#x27;s thick</li>
            <li> The size of the comb did not matter once I began to use it to detangle my thick 3c/4a hair.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to the Aragon Oil, Olive Oil and Keratin; but it&#x27;s a thick sturdy comb for my thick sturdy kinky curly hair.</li>
            <li> , I know some breakage will be unavoidable as I go through my thick curly hair that tends to tangle.</li>
            <li> If you have hair as thick as a horse&#x27;s tail than this would work.</li>
            <li> I have hair down to my hips, so maybe it doesn&#x27;t work well for long hair, but I was very disappointed that it actually made the tangling worse, and did not seem to add any shine to my hair.</li>
            <li> When i used this in the shower to detangle, my hair got super frizzy, like horrible frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally very thick, curly red hair that is very difficult to manage.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> I mean this comb just glides through my hair like silk almost!</li>
            <li> my hair shaft  is thin.  </li>
            <li> This comb was recommended by a friend with thin hair who always had a lot of tangling after washing.</li>
            <li> This product became an everyday staple for my crazy curly hair.</li>
            <li> I take one star off because I think the &amp;#34;argan oïl infused&amp;#34; thing is useless.</li>
            <li> anyone with matted, difficult hair:  remember to comb from the *ends,*  </li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the quality of the comb itself.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical</li>
            <li> Wanted a small comb for my grandma&#x27;s Christmas gift. :(  </li>
            <li> It would be difficult to bring alone for travel</li>
            <li> False advertising!  </li>
            <li> I thought this would probably be just like any other comb, but WRONG !!!</li>
            <li> I hate this comb.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Perfect for my biracial daughter&#x27;s very curly hair. Makes hairdo time much less of a battle. This comb is HUGE..which is great for us, but this is not a comb for short, fine hair. It&#x27;s seamless as well, so it doesn&#x27;t get caught in her hair.</li>
            <li> This is a good detangling comb. Looks like it is made to last. I take one star off because I think the &amp;#34;argan oïl infused&amp;#34; thing is useless. It is a good comb. Mine has a seam, but it is buffed out and my hair are not caught in it.</li>
            <li> I use it for detangling my hair with my conditioner. Works great on my hair when wet . Definitely gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I loved this comb. It is best of the combs i purchased till now.  My hair is long and thick and tangles easily. This works great for my hair.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter uses this comb. It is nice for her to use. We don&#x27;t have the fights that we used to have for combing her hair.</li>
            <li> I have a big curly fro and when I take my braids out I need something sturdy to handle e disaster that is my hair ... This comb is most definitely sturdy and worth the money</li>
            <li> A good comb. Works well. Thick and sturdy plastic construction.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really nice comb and the size is much bigger than shown on picture. Love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a HUGE comb ....don&#x27;t really see the benefit of having argan oil added to the plastizers ....it&#x27;s best used for those who do brave the ordeal of wet-combing.  I have really long hair &amp; don&#x27;t like the breakage factor.</li>
            <li> After having a baby, my hair is very brittle and falls out easily. This comb really is super smooth. Perfect for combing through wet hair. Price is very fair for a durable, smooth comb.</li>
            <li> Great comb for getting out tangles</li>
            <li> I purchased this comb to detangle my long thick hair after washing and it gets the job done. It detangles my hair without breakage.  Works great with wet or dry hair. I will never use another detangling comb.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first -- Argan Oil in a comb?  For under four bucks?  Um, okay, I&#x27;ll bite.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  It&#x27;s a huge comb -- folks with small hands may have trouble getting the hang of it (literally) for the first few tries.  But as I have a humongous paw of a hand, it wasn&#x27;t a problem for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the openings at the end of the handle and the top of the comb; they&#x27;re great for hanging the comb from a hook in your bathroom!  Probably would work great hanging it up at the gym as well, but I haven&#x27;t tried that yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the best part?  My hair does seem a bit shinier now that I&#x27;m using it.  In fact, I leave it in the car so I can take care of flyaways on the go.  Whether the comb&#x27;s magical oil properties are at work, or if it&#x27;s just that I&#x27;m grooming myself with a comb that works through my thick, fine hair better than one&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used before is the question.  But either way, I&#x27;m fine with it.  Picking up a few extra, one for the house and one for the gym bag.</li>
            <li> I really like this comb.  I can&#x27;t say whether the Argan Oil does anything or not, but the comb itself is great.  It is made of good quality and seems like it will last a long while.  My favorite wide tooth comb!</li>
            <li> Love this comb! I was trying to replace my other cricket comb that I thought I had lost. The day this arrived I found it but actually like this one better! I was sure what to expect when it said that it was &amp;#34;infused&amp;#34; I&#x27;m still not sure but it&#x27;s a GREAT detangler for thin and think hair!  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The best comb for thick, curly hair!</li>
            <li> Love this wide tooth comb. Great for long thick hair!</li>
            <li> I love this comb, it doesn&#x27;t break off in my hair nor does my hair break it. Definitively a plus considering the other combs my hair has broke. Also does not hurt my scalp, no breaking all around.</li>
            <li> It has wide bristol that will help with detangling but so will any other wide tooth comb. I dunno about all the Argan Oil business, I don&#x27;t see any differences.</li>
            <li> The Cricket Ultra Smooth wide tooth comb has helped me as I undergo the process of rebuilding my damaged hair.  This comb is gentle on my hair, makes it easy to comb and does not pull out my hair.  As for the issue of the oils in the comb, I can not speak on  whether this formula contributes to the better results I get from this comb, but it does not appear to hurt my dry, brittle hair.  I liked the Cricket comb so much I purchased the corresponding pick and am loving the lift it gives my hair.</li>
            <li> Its huge and not very smooth. wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> I really love this comb....I have two sizes, but this is my favorite.  It it pretty and feels very smooth and glides through my crispy dry hair like silk.  Buy one!</li>
            <li> This comb is awesome. It really helps detangle my hair. It&#x27;s soft plastic so it does not hurt my scalp. I ordered 2 my daughters love it and uses this comb every day.</li>
            <li> This wide-toothed comb is nice for curly hair. But believe you&#x27;re being charged more for the &#x27;Argan oil&#x27; claim, which I&#x27;ve seen no evidence if there being any sign of (I use Argan Oil on my hair in it&#x27;s pure form...very easy to spot). I&#x27;d advise saving some money and just buying a comb with wide spacing if you have curly hair and forget any claims about one imparting oil (not sure how this is even possible, but I fell for it as well). Sorry, I wanted to believe in it and save myself an extra step in putting product on my hair. But it wasn&#x27;t to be.</li>
            <li> I have jewish afro, curly girl type 3b hair, long.  When i used this in the shower to detangle, my hair got super frizzy, like horrible frizzy.  don&#x27;t know if its my hair - i previously had stopped all combing and brushing to keep my curls intact.  This comb isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> Great comb, easy to detangle with. As far as argan infused....I don&#x27;t see a difference and didn&#x27;t expect too lol.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I took the time to find an appropriate comb/brush.</li>
            <li> I really like this comb. Although it isn&#x27;t completely &amp;#34;seamless,&amp;#34; there is a vast reduction in the seams compared to other combs- you can see very slight seams if you tilt the comb sideways to look at it in bright light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t care much about it being infused with oils, so I don&#x27;t really have an opinion on that. There is no detectable smell from the comb. The plastic is very smooth, thick and feels sturdy, with a slight weight in the hand when you hold it, but it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, just weighs more than a normal comb. This comb is long, but the handle is nice and ergonomic - fits nicely in the palm of your hand and is easy to hold. The teeth have nice rounded ends which massage my scalp gently but are not abrasive. I think it&#x27;s convenient to use on wet hair and it detangles gently when I&#x27;m conditioning or blow drying. I am black/african-american and have thick, coily/curly natural hair, and I&#x27;ve noticed less breakage and hair loss while using this comb. I&#x27;m buying a second one for a family member.</li>
            <li> I bought this comb to use after I wash my hair and love it. I needed a big comb that glides thru easily without pulling and breaking my hair. This fit the bill and I am very happy that I bought it.</li>
            <li> Very large and easy to handle. Gets out tangles nicely. No complaints about it, though I should have probably checked the size when ordering - it&#x27;s pretty darned massive.</li>
            <li> I have natural curly hair and this comb has made life so much easier for me. It is very smooth and glides through my hair with ease. My detangling time has now been cut in half. Also there are no sharp edges on this comb, so it won&#x27;t damage your scalp. It is also large and sturdy. All in all a great comb.</li>
            <li> I gave three of these combs to my granddaughters, and kept one for myself.  We all love them.  After detangling hair, it keeps hair shiny.  No frizz anymore in the little ones hair.  For the price, you can&#x27;t beat them.</li>
            <li> I see why these were highly recommended.  They are VERY gentle on the hair.  You still have to be careful if you have thick long hair (which is what I have) to comb in sections and the lower ends first, before you go up a few more inches until you finally reach the top, but this comb just avoids any unnecessary tangling and pulling.  Recommend.</li>
            <li> This comb is ENORMOUS.  I have shorter fine hair and so this doesn&#x27;t work for me.  I guess it is for thicker hair (which says it on the packaging), but I didn&#x27;t see this written in the description for it online.  Maybe I missed it.  Regardless, now it sits in the Comb graveyard drawer with the other combs that I don&#x27;t use anymore.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it&#x27;s infused with smoothing oils, and because of the great reviews it got on amazon, but I have to say my experience was different. I have hair down to my hips, so maybe it doesn&#x27;t work well for long hair, but I was very disappointed that it actually made the tangling worse, and did not seem to add any shine to my hair. Although it didn&#x27;t work for me, I&#x27;m sure this would work great for those with shorter hair.</li>
            <li> I have very long thick wavy hair and live in a cold climate during the winter where there is a lot of static in my hair after washing it but this comb keeps the static way down. I highly recommend this comb.</li>
            <li> It goes through my kinky, coily hair with ease. I&#x27;m not sure about it being oil infused or whatever. I just bought it because of the wide teeth to minimize breakage.</li>
            <li> I have naturally very thick, curly red hair that is very difficult to manage. I&#x27;d almost given up on ever having long hair simply because it was too much of a pain to detangle with the comb and brush I was using. I&#x27;d go through a cheap comb about once a month because my hair would break the tines off, leaving about half of them intact.&lt;br /&gt;This comb has made my relationship with my hair so much easier. I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now, and none of the bristles have broken off yet (a new record for me and combs). It&#x27;s very smooth, and makes detangling my hair much less painful. Using it also results in less hair breakage and less hair getting yanked out.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this comb.</li>
            <li> I have long thick course hair and when I wash it my hair tangles a lot! This comb does not pull half my hair out like some other combs have it&#x27;s the best one I have ever tried! I recommend it to any one with long hair thick or thin! I sometimes comb my hair out in the shower to get the tangles out and it detangles my hair really good!</li>
            <li> My wife wanted me to grow a ponytail, and not having any experience with this, I was shocked to discover how much time and effort it took to keep it good looking.  After it got longer, shampooing became a pain even with conditioners.  Since I have learned how to shampoo and add conditioner with a broad tooth comb always combing back from the forehead to the tip ends of the hair, rinsing in like manner, then drying with a towel from front to back.  Then, I use the Cricket to detangle the ends.  This comb is smooth as silk and works easily through my few tangles.  In the mornings, I look like the scarecrow in the Wizard of Oz, but in just a few strokes, my hair is ready to be tied into the ponytail.  I have silver grey hair that tends to curl at the ends, and my wife bought a sterling holder that just slips over the elastic, and it looks great.  The holder has Celtic designs and is very masculine.  The length is about mid back, and I see no reason to cut it yet since it curls down my back and is very distinctive.  This comb has made wearing a ponytail possible, and I highly recommend it,</li>
            <li> hlps with detangling my kinky hair. it&#x27;s really a miracle comb. I love it! easy to use and really very practical</li>
            <li> If you like a HUGE comb then you wont be disappointed. To me this comb is good for a horse&#x27;s tail.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have that long of hair, but my hair is thick. I just used this comb for the first time yesterday after I washed my hair and this baby works!! It doesn&#x27;t feel overly big in my hand, and I was able to comb through my hair in no time.</li>
            <li> gave this to my niece with thick curly hair...excellent</li>
            <li> This will work well for my hair.  I have thick African American hair that Cricket&#x27;s detangling brush cannot penetrate.  This comb does the job perfectly.  I don&#x27;t know about the oil infused part.  I don&#x27;t have time to sit and comb my hair for more than five minutes like I used to.  So, I don&#x27;t see how a couple of strokes can leave anything on it.  In any case,  with today&#x27;s products, my kinky hair is finally beautiful without heat and straightening products.</li>
            <li> Perfect comb for detangling matted, wet hair.  The hugeness of it, and large spaces between teeth, mean your hair doesn&#x27;t get ripped up as with most combs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very curly but fine hair which is a right nuisance after washing.  Even good quality combs tend to shred it.  Sometimes I&#x27;m tempted to use conditioner just to avoid the pulling and tugging, but it&#x27;s never worth it as my hair doesn&#x27;t like conditioner.  End up with a floppy mess simply because I&#x27;ve not felt up to the workout of getting all the knots undone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t have to dread washing my hair now as there&#x27;s no risk of my arms being ripped out of their sockets as long as I use this comb!  Will probably never use any other kind now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure about the Argan Oil.  What with plastic being porous it might be that a bit of it comes through into hair, but it doesn&#x27;t really seem like it.  What&#x27;s probably even better is that, just because your hair isn&#x27;t being torn, it does end up smoother and healthier, and a lot less falls out  Really love this comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone with matted, difficult hair:  remember to comb from the *ends,*  the bottom part of the tangles.  Don&#x27;t just dive in anywhere.  Start from the very bottom and gently work your way up.  Sounds silly but really makes a difference.  (Thank goodness for Mum and all her wonderful tips!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very grateful to Amazon, and especially to all the people who take the time to write reviews, for opening up the wonderful world of Cricket products to me.  Didn&#x27;t know about them before but won&#x27;t be without them now!</li>
            <li> This is the first comb I purchase that does my hair any justice, it is sturdy and does not pull on my hair when combing. I recommend for anyone with curly, unruly hair. Excellent!</li>
            <li> I had a Conair comb for less than a year and the combs broke in my hair trying to get the knots out. CRAZY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bought this one to replace my old one. I&#x27;ve had it a week and love it. I have longer than shoulder length, fine hair, but I have a lot of hair. lol. It works great for my hair and gets the tangles out without ripping my scalp off. LOVE.</li>
            <li> My wife convinced me she needs to stop using a traditional brush and needed to switch to a &amp;#34;wide tooth comb&amp;#34; for her curly hair. She is caucasain with &amp;#34;3a&amp;#34;, long (well past shoulder length) fine but thick curly hair. She said it works so much better than a traditional brush due to less breakage and it gets her tangles out easily and pain-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The infused argan oil makes it feel sleeker but doesn&#x27;t feel oily or give off an oily residue onto your fingers. It just helps the comb glide through hair. I highly recommend this comb for curly hair.</li>
            <li> good for tangly hair. My daughter&#x27;s hair is really messy. This doesn&#x27;t hurt her as much even though it takes a bit longer to comb. LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Nice, sturdy, quality comb. I keep it in the shower and it has held up well. Gets through my somewhat thick hair nicely.</li>
            <li> Love this comb!!! It is perfect for my daughters hair which is very thick and curly! I&#x27;ve been searching for something like this for so long. It is very sturdy too!!</li>
            <li> Works well for combing hair out after shampooing.  Helps make it an easier and quicker job to get hair combed out after shampooing.</li>
            <li> It is seamless and so snags.... I really do not know about the infusement of oils, but its a very easy comb!</li>
            <li> t  just really love it.  my hair shaft  is thin.  but, I have a lot of it.  I really enjoy how soft and shiny it leaves when I&#x27;m done. it was just super affordable.  I will return again if ever I may need to.</li>
            <li> This brush is my companion. I use it so much that the writing on it is no longer there. My older sister is now using it on her hair, and I can never find it because she is always using it. I heard that some people just comb with their fingers, but this is so much better. I shed less hair and detangle in 2-3 minutes. Before when I used to use my square paddle brush it would take me 15-20 minutes and cause balls of hair to break off. I have more hair than I had before. It is also more durable and can take a few falls to the floor. My hair has been known to break a comb or three, but not this one. This baby is holding up.</li>
            <li> This comb was recommended by a friend with thin hair who always had a lot of tangling after washing. I have the opposite problem as my hair is thick and breaks combs. This comb is durable and soft when running through my rug. It never feels as though too much is being pulled right out of my scalp to the point of balding? I highly recommend this comb to anyone of any hair type because it is a true beauty benefit.</li>
            <li> No Tangles and the wide tooth is great. Good Price and high quality. So smooth would be great for children.</li>
            <li> Not sure about the Argan oil but this product is great! Nice and durable. I&#x27;m sure it will last at least 20 years.</li>
            <li> This is a big comb.  It only has 13 teeth, and it&#x27;s about twelve feet long, so you can comb dreadlocks with it.  I&#x27;m exaggerating.  But it&#x27;s a big comb, and I got it free with something.  It&#x27;s the best big free comb I&#x27;ve ever gotten in my life.</li>
            <li> Comb is a little on the pricey side but I decided to buy it anyway based on the reviews. Boy was it worth it, really smooth and the ends of the comb do not hurt your scalp at all. I am currently in a transition from relaxed to natural and this makes my detangling process easy...since my relaxed part is more sensitive i have to be very careful so that i dont experience breakage and this comb really helps with that. When in the shower I detangle once and twist and then i dont really have to detangle when out of the shower...my hair seems already seperated for the most part.</li>
            <li> not bad! like it. easy to get tangles out and blow dry without the regular brushes.Infused with argan oil? im not sure about that part but its worth its $</li>
            <li> My mom is a big fan of Argan oil so I thought this would be perfect for her. Great way to keep her hair smooth.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever find a comb that would go through my thick, coarse hair, but this one did.</li>
            <li> Works great, thanks! I Would definitely recommend this. Very well made too. Received very quickly and packed nicely. great product.</li>
            <li> I love Cricket combs, but the oils does not last long in these or any I have bought. But the combs are washable and the teeth last quite awhile. I just got this, so we shall see. I hope it last as long as my others.</li>
            <li> Awesome comb to comb through long hair dry or wet it gets the knots out. Infused with oils to prevent frizzies.</li>
            <li> I use this in the shower to evenly distribute my conditioner and get the tangles out of my hair. I have curly hair so I never comb or brush AFTER the shower. The comb itself is super smooth and overall a great quality.</li>
            <li> Its pretty big So be aware of that. As a comb.. its a comb.. Does what it has to do. But the whole &amp;#34;Infused with argan oil&amp;#34; thing is totally BS. Don&#x27;t waste your money, I don&#x27;t know why I did.</li>
            <li> This comb is big.  The hole in the handle makes it easy to hang in the shower. The teeth are smooth so it doesn&#x27;t tear the hair.  It&#x27;s pretty.  Easy to hold on to with my aging hands.  I bought two for me, and four more for friends.  The comb will out live me.</li>
            <li> Glides through hair well. It&#x27;s a bit ridiculously large, but it doesn&#x27;t pull your hair and even combs through dry curls too, without making my hair too frizzy.</li>
            <li> Great feel to this comb...I bought it for my son, now I might have to buy one for myself!  It runs smoothly through our hair, and has no sharp edges.  Great deal, too!</li>
            <li> I purchased this comb because it was seamless and didn&#x27;t really mind too much that it was infused with oils. I must say that this comb makes de-tangling much faster and much easier! The combs just glides through my hair when I have my de-tangling co-wash conditioner in my hair. I use this brush before I use my Denman brush, which really bring out my coils! Great buy!</li>
            <li> Nice comb I purchased to detangle my daughter&#x27;s extremely curly hair. Worked well and the tangles come undone! Good product.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and in good condition.  Great product even for my very short hair even though it is meant for long hair.  Very happy.</li>
            <li> I bought myself 2 of these, one for each bathroom.  I have very long hair, and although it is&lt;br /&gt;fine, I have trouble with tangles.  This is the best comb I have ever seen.  It goes through my&lt;br /&gt;hair smoothly, with very little pull.  I would definitely recommend this comb to everyone, it does&lt;br /&gt;a fantastic job, wet or dry.</li>
            <li> This is the best detangler comb I have ever used , and it makes your hair feel so smooth after you comb it. You will love it just as much as I do for sure.</li>
            <li> too big. I guess this comb is for those who have really long hair.</li>
            <li> my daughter has really curly hair, still relatively short but this is a great upgrade from the comb we were using. No breakage and her curls look gorgeous combed with this comb and a little detangler.</li>
            <li> Very well built comb and really does make a difference</li>
            <li> Perfect for curly hair and right out of the shower.  Glides through hair without causing damage.</li>
            <li> Great comb for long hair. Works well.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and so I&#x27;ve been looking for a comb that will help with tangles and will last without the teeth breaking off.  This is perfect.  I don&#x27;t know what material it&#x27;s made of but it feels nice to the touch in your hand, and the teeth are strong and sturdy.</li>
            <li> Great little de-tangling comb that makes it safe to brush wet hair without fear of breakage. It is supposedly infused with argan oil, but I&#x27;m not sure if that really makes any difference since it&#x27;s plastic. It is a relatively thick and sturdy plastic comb and the loop on the end is convenient for hanging it up and leaving it in the shower. A tip for de-tangling wet hair, especially those with a sensitive scalp is to start at the bottom and de-tangle a little bit at a time, towards the top. This works for brushing your hair too.</li>
            <li> A little too big but the best comb I have ever own</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair, and this comb does a wonderful job of detangling after showering.  I wish I had found it sooner!</li>
            <li> love it to detangle my naturally curly hair after adding leave in conditioner</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wide toothed comb, as advertised and it is sturdy.  I much preferred my previous comb that had more rounded edges and a hook on the end so I could hang it over the shower head.  This one has to sit on the wall in the shower.  There is a hole at the end of the handle, but it is not big enough to do anything useful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had long hair my entire life and this is the most comfortable detangler comb I&#x27;ve ever used.  It has a nice thick handle with makes it easy and comfortable to hold, and it glides through my hair very smoothly.  Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the quality of the comb itself. but the comb is as big as half of my arm. Literally. Perhaps I should have known, but I wish it had been mentioned in the product description. I was looking for a regular sized comb.</li>
            <li> Used this for the first time yesterday and was very surprised how great it worked! Got tangles out without pulling out my hair like the pick does. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This comb is awesome, it glides through my hair seamlessly and when there is a snag I feel it and am able to finger detangle it as oppose to some other combs that will make it worse. For those of you reading this that are fellow naturalista&#x27;s although I don&#x27;t believe in hair typing if had to I&#x27;d say my hair overall is 4b w/ some 4a at the nape of my neck and this product works great in it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this comb because it doesn&#x27;t have seams and that&#x27;s what I really needed. I take care of my hair a lot and my last comb broke since it was already old. This is just a simple comb... yes it may be infused with the Argan oil but it doesn&#x27;t do anything because it&#x27;s a plastic comb. There is no evidence that I have found to substantiate that an oil infused comb would actually release oil while detangling. I can certainly say that from a materials science perspective that it is possible that if you rub your hair against any plastic comb, it may be possible for plastic from that comb to be found in trace amounts (i.e super low levels, nothing that would actually constitute a coating of oil). So if you need Argan oil, buy it at your nearest beauty supply. It is possible that the comb itself may be constructed well enough to allow good detangling but this is not necessarily anything to do with the oil infusion. A good comb will have good even teeth spacing, ideally be seamless so there are no snags and if it is plastic, it needs to have a degree of flexibility suitable for the hair type. This comb is actually pretty big but it&#x27;s okay since I have long hair. My hair is naturally thin and straight but it does knot a lot since it&#x27;s thin. This comb is able to take out any tangled hair and it doesn&#x27;t break or pull on my hair since it&#x27;s seamless. It&#x27;s a good comb nonetheless.</li>
            <li> I have derriere-length and very thick hair, and the reason it&#x27;s so long and thick is because I never brush it.  I use only a wide-toothed comb.  This is the best I&#x27;ve found and I&#x27;ve used it for several years now.  It is well polished so it doesn&#x27;t snag my hair (unlike the cheap things available in the drug stores).  The handle works well for me; I&#x27;ve got arthritis and carpel tunnel syndrome, meaning numbness, in my hands, but I can grip this and it doesn&#x27;t pull out of my hands.  It is a large comb, but again, that&#x27;s why it works for me.  I&#x27;m not sure what the benefit of the argan oil is; maybe it&#x27;s to reduce static electricity imparted to my hair (if that&#x27;s it, it works).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m growing out my hair and my hair dresser told me that I need to use a comb when my hair is wet to prevent breakage so I looked right away! I have a lot of hair and it&#x27;s thick so this wide tooth comb is perfect, plus it doesn&#x27;t tug my hair needless to say I love it!</li>
            <li> I have long straight but damaged (from too much color treatments) Asian hair, and I get huge knots really easily. I&#x27;ve been looking for a good detangling comb that won&#x27;t pull my hair out, and detangle without tons of breakage - I have enough of that. I bought a travel sized conair one from target but the length was frustrating since I had to take more brush strokes, also the teeth of the comb were still too close together and I felt like I was still breaking / pulling my hair. This one is nice and wide, so it easily detangles my hair without pressure. I&#x27;m not sure how much better it is than the stuff you can get at Sally&#x27;s, but I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I have is that I need to use another brush to get the less serious tangles out since this comb has such wide teeth.</li>
            <li> Used this in my 4a type hair and it works wonderfully. I&#x27;ve noticed less snagging and less consequent breakage as a result. Worth the price, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a great comb for detangling</li>
            <li> I it large enough to use in and out of the shower, since it does not pull on the hair.  I also like the length of the handle, making it easy to grip the comb in the shower, even with conditioner on my hand.  I really like this comb and would recommend it to other&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a comb nothing special.</li>
            <li> Best hair comb if your natural, I uses it all the time for my kinds who has natural curly hair , it is  detangle free comb for curly hair and natural hair. My kids doesn&#x27;t cry at all when I use this comb in there hair, best comb ever</li>
            <li> Great detangler for my African-American hair</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the Cricket Detangler comb and I just want to say I love it so far!  I used it for the first time last night and I have to admit I thought it would of been a smaller comb.  The size of the comb did not matter once I began to use it to detangle my thick 3c/4a hair.  The tangles just melted away after just one use.  I can&#x27;t really speak on the oil infused plastic, but maybe once I use it more I can state it.  I highly recommend this comb to people who have thick, coarse curly hair.</li>
            <li> Great comb!  I was a bit skeptical but it really works!  My daughter has super thick hair so this is great!</li>
            <li> Best comb I ever used. Gets knots out without ripping my hair.  Very smooth feel.  Sturdy.  Bought 3 of them. Home. Gym. Travel.</li>
            <li> Loved it. Its great for curly, unruly, dry and frizzy hair. Just few strokes and it perfects the unruly hair.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend. It worked great on my ironed hair too. So even though I have curly hair, I think it works good for both curly and straight hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my daughttrs long tangly hair.  Doesn&#x27;t help the  issue at all.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Really works great - I buy a new one every four months or so.</li>
            <li> Huge comb!  False advertising!  Very upset! Wanted a small comb for my grandma&#x27;s Christmas gift. :(  She won&#x27;t want this</li>
            <li> It works well, as advertised, doesn&#x27;t yank your hair or tear it like most combs.  I was surprised however at how big the teeth are !  I think it would work better if the teeth were a little slimmer.  I do like the spacing of the teeth.  Overall quite happy.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel shiny and smooth!</li>
            <li> Works well on my wet hair. I don&#x27;t know that I notice any oil in it but it is easy to comb my hair out.</li>
            <li> i have used it on wet hair and their hasnt been too much breakage and im rough. it is a wide tooth comb but i think it might work better on dry hair. im 3c/4a natural if that helps</li>
            <li> I love this comb!  I can&#x27;t really tell if its actually infused with all the stuff it says, but I needed a new comb for detangling after the shower and this was priced well and it really does seem to get through my hair easier.  I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a very large comb. I haven&#x27;t noticed a big difference from the infused oils but I do like the wide spacing between the teeth. I haven&#x27;t used this on wet hair yet but I&#x27;m looking forward to doing so.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive a comb. Instead I received some sort of brush like item, but it works great for after the shower.  Whatever it is I love it.  To be honest it kind of looks like a dog brush with rubber bristles and a handle.</li>
            <li> As far as combs go this one is very nice. It&#x27;s quite large. It&#x27;s very smooth feeling and detangles wonderfully. This is one of the best combs I&#x27;ve had and I would definitely get another.</li>
            <li> Comb is smooth and the teeth of the comb is a nice width. Not too close together or too far apart. Would recommend it</li>
            <li> It is a great wide tooth comb that is quite strong and doesn&#x27;t seem to be able to break easily. De tangles my natural hair without any snags. However I bought it for the infused with oil component, however it makes no difference to my hair than my other diet anglers . Benefits are not noticeable at all</li>
            <li> NOT AT ALL WHAT I EXPECTED, NOPE !!!</li>
            <li> I thought this would probably be just like any other comb, but WRONG !!! It really does help detangle hair.  And it&#x27;s very nice looking. Easy to hold too. A very good value!!!</li>
            <li> I love this comb.  I bought two one for me and my little girl.  We both have thick hair and this is a great detangler when wet combing our hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I get any oil from this comb or not, but, it combs without snagging my hair, which is why I bought it.  It has a smooth feel overall, handles well, and makes short work of after shower tangles.</li>
            <li> will order another comb. My daughter took the first one.</li>
            <li> Went on Amazon to order some Argan Oil and came across this.  It&#x27;s amazing how it just glides through my hair.  After swimming I persuaded my friend who has afro hair to try it, she was hesitant because she thought she would break it, but that wasn&#x27;t the case she also loved it and ordered herself one.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly hair. This works great to detangle my rats nests.</li>
            <li> I like the big size and it&#x27;s great for tangled hair. Makes combing my granddaughters hair easier. Still not sure about the oil(s).</li>
            <li> This product became an everyday staple for my crazy curly hair. Detangling power and no loss of curl pattern. I would&#x27;ve easily paid twice the price for a product of this value.</li>
            <li> It is so useful for those of us who want to go natural and have very coarse hair. The comb is very sturdy. Hence, expect it to last!</li>
            <li> I use this whenever I wash my hair while its still wet then again once dry. I had minimal breakage. Glad I bought this one!</li>
            <li> I stumbled on this product and am I glad?! I bought 2 combs of different sizes. What a great idea to infuse Argan oil into the comb. Great product guys.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to the Aragon Oil, Olive Oil and Keratin; but it&#x27;s a thick sturdy comb for my thick sturdy kinky curly hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality comb. I have had this for a few months now and use it everyday. It&#x27;s excellent quality, feels sturdy and untangles well. Not sure how much the fact that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;infused&amp;#34; really matters or does anything to tame frizz, but it&#x27;s works well on my curly and easily tangled hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for long unruly hair when other combs have fallen short.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it was seamless. Other reviewers said it was seamless and very smooth between the teeth.  It definitely is not seamless however.  I wouldn&#x27;t even say it is smooth between the teeth.  It is nice sturdy plastic, but unfortunately, the seams are the main thing I wanted to avoid.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a large wide tooth comb this is it. Keep in mind that this is large. For traveling, I will still take my Ouidad comb since the size is more manageable. But this one is my everyday comb.</li>
            <li> nice buy, especially for think long hair. I alson find that this comb detangles well without pulling on your hair.</li>
            <li> Love using this instead of a hair brush.  The comb is really big but it looks lovely.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the size of this comb.&lt;br /&gt;I have very dense and tick hair and still this comb is way too big for what it is needed.</li>
            <li> I hate this comb. The teeth are not good enough to use on your hair. It does not have argan oil at all.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest comb for my hair which gets extremely tangled when wet. It gets out tangles without pulling out my hair.</li>
            <li> Great detangler! The teeth are wide apart and smooths wet hair easily. I always use a detangler spray so I don&#x27;t know how this works alone but I think the argan oil infused in the comb will aid in any existing tangles in the hair. I like the handle on the comb but it is slightly larger than I prefer. It would be difficult to bring alone for travel but it does it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> This comb is wonderful. It really does detangle your hair, which they said it was for longer hair, and I have medium length hair and it works well for me. A great buy.</li>
            <li> I have Kinky coily hair with heat damaged ends (half of my hair is straight) my hair breaks when I comb it while it&#x27;s wet. This comb helps me detangle my hair with minimal breakage and hair lose! I mean this comb just glides through my hair like silk almost! it&#x27;s must for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only Con is the lettering rubbed off the first time I washed it...(I washed it before I used it and I used shampoo to wash it) I was a little irritated at first but once i used the comb I didn&#x27;t care about that cause I fell in love with it, I take it with me everywhere and now I can&#x27;t find it so i&#x27;m on here ordering another one...yeah it&#x27;s that good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have highly textured hair that breaks when you comb it you owe it to yourself to try this comb.</li>
            <li> I am sending this one back.  It is big enough to comb a horse mane.</li>
            <li> Never seen such a big comb.  A men&#x27;s haircare website recommended this comb - I did an impulse-buy, failing to read the description (and reviews) and instead going solely off the picture and men&#x27;s haircare website&#x27;s recommendation.  It&#x27;s 10 inches! this aint a men&#x27;s pocket comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon&#x27;s return policy is top-notch.</li>
            <li> This comb is great for thick, curly hair. I used it when I was detangling my hair with water, and it glides through my hair easily and it feels good on the scalp. I even tested the comb on my hands, to make sure it wasn&#x27;t rough and the comb is very smooth and has no rough edges, so there is nothing that can grab and break your hair. So far, I seen a reduction of frizz in my hair since I used it. I don&#x27;t know if it helped with the conditioning of my hair, but I love the way it felt going through my hair and how I didn&#x27;t hear those \\&quot;snap\\&quot; sounds that you tend to hear with other combs. I used to finger detangle but I couldn&#x27;t never get rid of all the shedded hairs that tended to tangle in my hair and create tiny knots. This comb is large, wide tooth, and it&#x27;s sturdy so I believe it should last a long time and I&#x27;ll be able to use it as my hair grows out on my natural journey. I recommend this comb for any other person that is going through their own natural hair journey and needs a good comb to detangle, that can minimize breakage. To be fair, I did experience minor breakage but I mostly seen only shedded hair when I used this comb for the first time and since I haven&#x27;t combed my hair in over a year, I know some breakage will be unavoidable as I go through my thick curly hair that tends to tangle. However, the comb is very gentle and I just recommend patience when dealing with your hair. In addition, I was surprised how big this comb was, it was built to really go through thick hair.</li>
            <li> Great comb for my thick hair.. really like the way it glides through my hair without pulling or making it frizzy.  BUT, more importantly, I am impressed with the company.  They are apparently located near the Jersey shore and were disrupted by Hurricane Sandy. They were excellent in communicating with me about the delay--which was very brief.  When the product arrived, it included a couple of free gifts and a coupon for $$ off a future purchase.  VERY IMPRESSED.</li>
            <li> Great comb! It is very smooth around the edges which causes less snags during detangling.</li>
            <li> This is a well made detangling comb and it worked well on my wet hair. Im not sure how the oil infusion worked. It smells and feels like a regular comb. At any rate I&#x27;m happy with it. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I bought this after my stylist used it on my long wet hair.  I use it in the shower to apply conditioner.  It is very smooth and does not tug hair at all.</li>
            <li> this thing is a lot bigger than the average comb but it works great. I&#x27;m not sure if it actually makes my hair shinier cause i don&#x27;t really have a problem with hair dullness but it gets out the knots and leaves my hair smooth and tangle free</li>
            <li> The best comb for fine hair that tangles.</li>
            <li> Really love this comb. Both my daughter and i have long thick hair and this comb can go thru wet tangles like butter.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know much about this stuff, but my gf loves the brush.</li>
            <li> I love this comb. It glides so smooth through my hair and leaves my hair a little silky and shiny - just enough to notice.  It is perfect for quick touch ups.</li>
            <li> This comb is Ok . It isn&#x27;t any better at detangling than a comb that isn&#x27;t called the detangler. Not sure the supposed oil&lt;br /&gt;on it does anything.</li>
            <li> I have been using this comb for several weeks. It&#x27;s great. Thank You. bk</li>
            <li> rounded tips, does not hurt scalp- good product-</li>
            <li> Great for after you shampoo and condition you hair.  I  have less hair loss  which works for me.  great for parting hair for braiding.</li>
            <li> This is a very large comb, but I love it. It&#x27;s great for detangling curly hair and is very durable. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Detangles my type 4C thick hair with minimal to no breakage. Can&#x27;t tell if argan oil is present or not, but i don&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li> Comb too big. If you have hair as thick as a horse&#x27;s tail than this would work. I cant even brush my hair with it.</li>
            <li> I have natural 3/4 hair and usually when I detangle my hair after shampooing &amp; conditioning I have so much shed hair the size of a golf ball that has come out.  I used this for the first time and I can count the strands of hair that came out. I hope this wasn&#x27;t a fluke. If it wasn&#x27;t and I get the same results then this comb is a definite godsend!!!</li>
            <li> THIS HAIR COMB SAVED MY LIFE. I WAS USING CAPS ONE DAY LIKE RIGHT NOW AN A AIRPLANE CRASHED INTO MY BAGELS AN THEY WERE ALL LAUNCHED INTO MY HAIR!&lt;br /&gt;BUT THIS COMB GOT ALL THE BAGELS OUT OF MY HAIR AN NOW IM PRETTY AGAIN!</li>
            <li> I have 3 of these combs now. This one hangs on a hook in my bathroom. The two others are the &amp;#34;Cricket Ultra Clean UC130&amp;#34; One of those lives in my purse and the other one has holes so I hang it on a hook next to my dresser where I can grab it easily. These combs are large and have real presence. I know that seems weird, but I live in a small house with very little storage space, so I have to hang things on my walls and they&#x27;re very visible. These combs are like art.</li>
            <li> This is a massive comb. The picture is deceiving. As a male, this is not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Pretty happy with this comb- it glides easily through my hair and is well-made. I guess if I were being really picky, I&#x27;d like for there to be a few more teeth so the spaces in between were a little smaller. However, I have fine hair- people with thicker/curly hair would probably say this is the perfect size. Either way, I would recommend this item- great for detangling right out of the shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit larger than I expected, but that&#x27;s my own fault for not checking the size.  I can see now there are other options.  So far I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This is awesome.  I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it smooths without leaving your hair feeling greasy.  I want the fine tooth one, too!  Great for wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> This comb is really large and fun to hold. And yes, it is great at detangling. However, it DOES have seams, and after using it for 3 months, it has ruined my hair. I kept noticing lots of damage and really wasn&#x27;t sure where it was coming from. Duh. It was this darn comb. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This a very large comb or rake as it is sometimes called. It is very gentle on wet hair for de-tangling. Infused with oils and keratin it feels great. This is not a comb to carry with you but rather keep by the sink or shower to use at home.</li>
