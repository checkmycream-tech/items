            <li>The cream smells great and is easily absorbed into hair.</li>
            <li>It is definitely more cost effective to purchase thorough Amazon.</li>
            <li>I wish I liked the fragrance more.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t require much more than a nickel sized amount.</li>

            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This makes it just better.</li>
            <li>Helps keep my hair smooth while blow drying!</li>
            <li>My favorite hair product-</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li>but this is so much better because it has heat protectant too...</li>
            <li>because it did work for me...and my ends looks really healthy now :)</li>
            <li>this one does it all and more..</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s just me, someone else may love it.</li>
            <li>It protects it from the heat and keeps it healthy.</li>
            <li>Great for curly hair in the high humidity that we have in the south.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>I use a full pump (sometimes more) and my hair is always softer and even holds curls or waves even better with this in.</li>
            <li>We have tried so many products and by far this is the best when she wants to keep her curly look.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for fine hair because it&#x27;s not heavy.</li>
            <li>It can easily turn frizzy if humidity goes up, but not with this Redken</li>
            <li>Also, I don&#x27;t like the strong perfumey fragrance, although it dissipates somewhat with blow drying.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, but not my favorite.</li>
            <li>Only the first time when I used this product was really great!</li>
            <li>Read all the great reviews and expected to love it.  </li>
            <li>This product helps hair stay smooth for days.</li>
            <li>My hair stays smooth and no frizz.</li>
            <li>The result is smooth and silky hair.</li>
            <li>I tried it when I got a free sample with Redken shampoo.</li>
            <li>If you use shampoo, their All Soft is good as well.</li>
            <li>I use it to put smooth any fly aways once I dry my hair</li>
            <li>Its worth a try!</li>
            <li>I originally bought it at Hair Cuttery for about $20.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for dry, curly, rather untamed hair.  </li>
            <li>I have decent hair, but it is very fine.</li>
            <li>I got a full size version of this in a beauty sampler, over a year ago.</li>
            <li>like to give my hair a break from blow drying, and with this, NO frizz, just a nice natural wave my hair has.</li>
            <li>Love this product works well on my hair seller had fast shipping....</li>
            <li>Wish I hadn&#x27;t purchased for my super curly &amp; course hair.</li>
            <li>I would like it more only if it smelled better.  </li>
            <li>I use Biotin and have many shorter flyaway hairs from new hair growth.  </li>
            <li>Started using on a regular basis and love it!</li>
            <li>and my hair was always softest right after my appointments.</li>
            <li>Great for when you want straight hair, but a bit heavy for&lt;br /&gt;overall</li>
            <li>I use Wen, and that plus a dime sized amount of this, every other day, is my magic formula for frizz free hair.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have pretty wavy hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li>Not heavy or oily and a sweet fresh scent.</li>
            <li>I blow dry my hair with a round brush and this product makes my hair smooth and soft and it smells good!</li>
            <li>Seems to do a great job protecting my fragile hair but doesn&#x27;t weigh it down too much.</li>
            <li>Maybe it works well on coarse or ethnic hair but DO NOT use it on fine hair</li>
            <li>It smells good, and the trick is to blow dry it in or use a flat iron.</li>
            <li>This product works very well to protect hair from the heat of a blowdryer or straightener.</li>
            <li>If you have straight hair,  this is NOT for you.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely smooths and locks as promised.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for the curly, frizzied hair folk!  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li>I used this product several times and it did not make my frizzy hair smooth or sleek.  </li>
            <li>You can however put too much in.</li>
            <li>It really smooths the hair.</li>
            <li>Like 06 Straight Out.</li>
            <li>This product really helps with hair that is acceptable to kinking and droop in humid conditions.  </li>
            <li>It does not stop me from having to use a straight iron but it is quicker to do my hair.</li>
            <li>It is the only product that keeps my hair frizz free and not a bush</li>
            <li>She really likes this product and has already recommended it to others.</li>
            <li>I can never find a product that really works and</li>
            <li>Have to give a try before you really know.</li>
            <li>I have very frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>Do not throw away the tiny cap, handy to put back for when you have to travel.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;d still have to run a flat iron after to get sleek smooth straight hair)...</li>
            <li>and it offers protection against heat from blow dryers and other styling tools, but also works great in the absence of heat.</li>
            <li>other products I like better.</li>
            <li>Same for the shampoo and conditioner of this variety, it will not make your hair feel soft and smooth,  but it will certainly straighten your hair.  </li>
            <li>Just a small amount saturates my hair evenly, and leaves my hair so soft, smooth, frizz free and straight.</li>
            <li>I air dry and get to enjoy my curls.</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair very soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>This makes my hair feel very soft!</li>
            <li>But no,  it doesn&#x27;t feel smooth (unlike to other redken oil product I used before - the gold one), kinda grainy too.  </li>
            <li>I live in Florida</li>
            <li>Try the Gold Redken &#x27;All Soft&#x27; if you have straight hair and want a soft natural touch to your hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I didn&#x27;t get the same result afterwards like first time.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and the smooth lock doesn&#x27;t weigh down my curls.</li>
            <li>so the humidity is hard to battle, but this has done a better job than anything else.</li>
            <li>I bought this thinking that it would give me soft conditioned locks.  </li>
            <li>I have a type 2b/2c curly hair...and its really long..reaches just above my spine..</li>
            <li>after using john frieda for nearly 3 years..</li>
            <li>My stylist first used this cream in my hair each time I&#x27;d go in before she&#x27;d blow dry</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m finished, with the exception of a couple of cowlick spots, I really don&#x27;t need to use a flat iron to &amp;#34;manage&amp;#34; my hair into place.</li>
            <li>From time to time, I would come across reviews about individuals that would comment on how they would no longer need to use a flat iron since a blow dryer and that particular product alone would make their hair soft and pin-straight.</li>
            <li>This makes my thick, frizzy, wavy , hair slimy smooth...</li>
            <li>My hair gets dry and no more smooth feeling.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have lots of straight hair with some crazy cowllicks, some gray and some not, so mixed textures:)</li>
            <li>If you have coarse, wiry, or flyaway hair, this is a creamy smoother that is applied while hair is wet to calm things down.  </li>

            <li> But no,  it doesn&#x27;t feel smooth (unlike to other redken oil product I used before - the gold one), kinda grainy too.  </li>
            <li> I live in Florida</li>
            <li> Try the Gold Redken &#x27;All Soft&#x27; if you have straight hair and want a soft natural touch to your hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I didn&#x27;t get the same result afterwards like first time.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and the smooth lock doesn&#x27;t weigh down my curls.</li>
            <li> so the humidity is hard to battle, but this has done a better job than anything else.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking that it would give me soft conditioned locks.  </li>
            <li> I have a type 2b/2c curly hair...and its really long..reaches just above my spine..</li>
            <li> after using john frieda for nearly 3 years..</li>
            <li> My stylist first used this cream in my hair each time I&#x27;d go in before she&#x27;d blow dry</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m finished, with the exception of a couple of cowlick spots, I really don&#x27;t need to use a flat iron to &amp;#34;manage&amp;#34; my hair into place.</li>
            <li> From time to time, I would come across reviews about individuals that would comment on how they would no longer need to use a flat iron since a blow dryer and that particular product alone would make their hair soft and pin-straight.</li>
            <li> This makes my thick, frizzy, wavy , hair slimy smooth...</li>
            <li> My hair gets dry and no more smooth feeling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have lots of straight hair with some crazy cowllicks, some gray and some not, so mixed textures:)</li>
            <li> If you have coarse, wiry, or flyaway hair, this is a creamy smoother that is applied while hair is wet to calm things down.  </li>
            <li> After shampooing, take small sections of hair and smooth conditioner down from root to tip.</li>
            <li> at first i only tried a little on my hair...and only on the ends since my ends are really dry and brittle because of coloring and flat ironing....</li>
            <li> I use this to tame frizz after straightening and it works very well.</li>
            <li> and i flat ironed it...and it worked it....</li>
            <li> I no longer need to use a flat iron.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very long - this stuff actually works.  </li>
            <li> With little product my hair gets easier to brush and feels incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> Just a little really smooths down my hair.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my hair from the frizzies all year long.</li>
            <li> , it is far too heavy.</li>
            <li> This stay sleek leave-in cream is the product I&#x27;ve been waiting for for so long.</li>
            <li> I use a very minimal amount and actually put it on my hair when it&#x27;s dry go figure.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps if one used heat to dry hair, it would make hair straighter.  </li>
            <li> This cream has taken my blow dry time from 35 minutes to 17 minutes.</li>
            <li> I wrap it in a towel for about an hour then hand dry to get the rest of the wetness out.</li>
            <li> Let it air dry.</li>
            <li> I have dry and unruly hair</li>
            <li> , I apply this to damp hair blow dry, finish with some oil and hair spray.</li>
            <li> Then I section dry with a round brush, and when it used to take multiple passes on each section, with this product it only takes one or two.</li>
            <li> Hairdressers usually don&#x27;t like how difficult my hair is, but after using this for a month, my hairdresser remarked how much more manageable my hair is.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, I have the worst kind of hair texture, thick, coarse, frizzy and curly but not the pretty spiral curls.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it lasts for three washes like it says, but it does last a little while.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 9 year old biracial daughter with hard to care for hair.</li>
            <li> I just use enough to cover my thumb nail and then work it through my towel dried hair before styling.  </li>
            <li> but after few days i decided to really put a lot of this product into my thick curly hair...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it doesnt&#x27; smell bad, just wish it had more of that conditioner smell to it. - got it on time and undamaged container so all is right...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes my very thick, wavy long hair manageable and soft for days after I use it and styling is a breeze with minimal frizz.</li>
            <li> This calms those hairs down and makes it easier to blow dry.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product but only use a small amount at a time.</li>
            <li> a small portion is enough and i recommend to use it every 2 washes.</li>
            <li> It makes my thin hair soft and brings out the waves without being heavy, making my hair look greasy, or leading to buildup over time (I only use it on the ends, though).</li>
            <li> other product has ever worked so well.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, coarse &amp; dry &amp; it smoothed down the frizziness.</li>
            <li> I have naturally coarse thick poofy wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Weighs hair down and feels greasy in hair.</li>
            <li> so this product calms the hair down and still allows the curl to thrive.</li>
            <li> i never really though any product could tame the frizz...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a problem like a few other reviewers stated of it making hair too greasy or sticky or anything.</li>
            <li> You do not need a lot, even with thick, long hair.</li>
            <li> It was heavy and left my shiny hair looking dull and flat ...and did not even tame the frizz!!!</li>
            <li> The humidity usually destroys my straightened or curly style but redken sleek prevents that.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday!</li>
            <li> My wife bought this after receiving a small sample with another purchase.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what it is about this product.</li>
            <li> I have difficult medium to long curly hair that I wear blown out.</li>
            <li> I mean very little.</li>
            <li> Use a very small amount.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick and wavy hair</li>
            <li> Sorry didn&#x27;t like at all.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re thinking this is expensive, it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I hated this Leave</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Let me tell you, I have the worst kind of hair texture, thick, coarse, frizzy and curly but not the pretty spiral curls. I def wanted to review this. It is wonderful for my type of hair. Doesn&#x27;t require much more than a nickel sized amount. I have an A-frame bob. I get compliments now. The humidity usually destroys my straightened or curly style but redken sleek prevents that. I have the redken anti snap and I didn&#x27;t feel that did anything for me as with most expensive products I purchase. Now I&#x27;m finished looking. Its worth a try!</li>
            <li> This product works very well to protect hair from the heat of a blowdryer or straightener. The cream smells great and is easily absorbed into hair. My hair feels healthier, softer, and fuller when I use this product before styling.</li>
            <li> My stylist first used this cream in my hair each time I&#x27;d go in before she&#x27;d blow dry and my hair was always softest right after my appointments. I decided to give it a try despite it&#x27;s steep cost and I&#x27;m so glad I did. It&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my very thick, wavy long hair manageable and soft for days after I use it and styling is a breeze with minimal frizz. I haven&#x27;t had a problem like a few other reviewers stated of it making hair too greasy or sticky or anything. I use a full pump (sometimes more) and my hair is always softer and even holds curls or waves even better with this in. I love it!</li>
            <li> If you have straight hair,  this is NOT for you.  I bought this thinking that it would give me soft conditioned locks.  But no,  it doesn&#x27;t feel smooth (unlike to other redken oil product I used before - the gold one), kinda grainy too.  Same for the shampoo and conditioner of this variety, it will not make your hair feel soft and smooth,  but it will certainly straighten your hair.  Try the Gold Redken &#x27;All Soft&#x27; if you have straight hair and want a soft natural touch to your hair.</li>
            <li> This is the product that my hair stylist used and I really love it.  It is definitely more cost effective to purchase thorough Amazon.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!  Absolutely smooths and locks as promised. Highly recommended for the curly, frizzied hair folk!  Smells good also!</li>
            <li> This is a great leave in conditioner. My hair is thick, coarse &amp; dry &amp; it smoothed down the frizziness. I would recommend this product but only use a small amount at a time. You do not need a lot, even with thick, long hair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use too much. I mean very little. Makes hair greasy.</li>
            <li> Ever since i found this leave in cream, I never want to go to anything else again! But I will have to say i mix this with water into my head and works great!</li>
            <li> I use this everyday! This is like my 15th bottle. It keeps my hair from the frizzies all year long. It leaves my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Only the first time when I used this product was really great! My hair got sleek and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;However, I didn&#x27;t get the same result afterwards like first time. My hair gets dry and no more smooth feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe, it just not for me.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for dry, curly, rather untamed hair.  Just a little really smooths down my hair.  Some reviews talk about this as a straightening product. I have not found the product to straighten my hair.  Perhaps if one used heat to dry hair, it would make hair straighter.  I air dry and get to enjoy my curls.</li>
            <li> The Smooth Lock line of Redken is the best smoothing system I have tried. I would be lost without them!</li>
            <li> I used this product several times and it did not make my frizzy hair smooth or sleek.  Also, I don&#x27;t like the strong perfumey fragrance, although it dissipates somewhat with blow drying.  Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have decent hair, but it is very fine. This makes it just better. It smells good, and the trick is to blow dry it in or use a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many hair products for years and this one is the best ever. Makes your hair amazing! Will buy it again and again. A +++</li>
            <li> This product is great for smoothing out my curls for a weekend. it also helps relax my curl after the straightening when I wash it. Seems to do a great job protecting my fragile hair but doesn&#x27;t weigh it down too much. You can however put too much in. I will definitely buy your again.</li>
            <li> I had tried it before and liked it! Leaves your hair very soft and shiny! It&#x27;s a good leave in product!</li>
            <li> It really smooths the hair. With little product my hair gets easier to brush and feels incredibly soft. One of the best I know.</li>
            <li> Great for when you want straight hair, but a bit heavy for&lt;br /&gt;overall smoothing.  I dont think I would buy it again as there&lt;br /&gt;are other products I like better. Like 06 Straight Out.</li>
            <li> Excellent product before ironing the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Just a small portion is enough and i recommend to use it every 2 washes.</li>
            <li> Smells good. I leave it in overnight as recommended by my hair dresser. Do not throw away the tiny cap, handy to put back for when you have to travel.</li>
            <li> Smells AMAZING!! Helps keep my hair smooth while blow drying!</li>
            <li> This product really helps with hair that is acceptable to kinking and droop in humid conditions.  I just use enough to cover my thumb nail and then work it through my towel dried hair before styling.  It gives my hair great texture for 2 -3 days!</li>
            <li> This product helps hair stay smooth for days. It lasts up to three washes like it says. I have pretty wavy hair. It does not stop me from having to use a straight iron but it is quicker to do my hair. My hair stays smooth and no frizz.</li>
            <li> I use this leave-in cream like leave-in conditioner every day. It makes my thin hair soft and brings out the waves without being heavy, making my hair look greasy, or leading to buildup over time (I only use it on the ends, though). It smells really good and it offers protection against heat from blow dryers and other styling tools, but also works great in the absence of heat. I have promoted this product to my friends a la Ron Popeil. It&#x27;s really great!</li>
            <li> I have difficult medium to long curly hair that I wear blown out. This cream has taken my blow dry time from 35 minutes to 17 minutes. I&#x27;m ridiculously happy. I was my hair, then put this product in. I wrap it in a towel for about an hour then hand dry to get the rest of the wetness out. Then I section dry with a round brush, and when it used to take multiple passes on each section, with this product it only takes one or two. Buy it. Hairdressers usually don&#x27;t like how difficult my hair is, but after using this for a month, my hairdresser remarked how much more manageable my hair is. Can&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the delivery! (: Everything&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair product- I have very thick and wavy hair and it is the only product that I can use without having to use heat to make my hair l</li>
            <li> Weighs hair down and feels greasy in hair.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product. I originally bought it at Hair Cuttery for about $20. It is the only product that keeps my hair frizz free and not a bush so i can have those beautiful Farah Fawcett feathers and as beautiful lock of moisturized  and sleek hair. Bravo!</li>
            <li> I have a type 2b/2c curly hair...and its really long..reaches just above my spine..im if asian indian origin if that helps....so i bought this product from ulta..for i think 13$ ..at first i only tried a little on my hair...and only on the ends since my ends are really dry and brittle because of coloring and flat ironing....and it dint work......but after few days i decided to really put a lot of this product into my thick curly hair...and i flat ironed it...and it worked it....my hair is smooth..and no frizz ...after using john frieda for nearly 3 years..i never really though any product could tame the frizz...but this is so much better because it has heat protectant too...get it...because it did work for me...and my ends looks really healthy now :)</li>
            <li> I hated this Leave In Cream for my hair. It was heavy and left my shiny hair looking dull and flat ...and did not even tame the frizz!!! Maybe it works well on coarse or ethnic hair but DO NOT use it on fine hair, it is far too heavy.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this after receiving a small sample with another purchase.  She really likes this product and has already recommended it to others.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, can&#x27;t live without it.  Improves my hair like nothing else.</li>
            <li> This product is great! I have naturally curly hair and the smooth lock doesn&#x27;t weigh down my curls. I am delighted that my hairdresser had this product on hand and I was able to use it! I am a happy, repeat customer.</li>
            <li> This makes my thick, frizzy, wavy , hair slimy smooth...I can never find a product that really works and this one does it all and more..I will repurchase.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair feel very soft! I live in Florida so the humidity is hard to battle, but this has done a better job than anything else. I wouldn&#x27;t say it lasts for three washes like it says, but it does last a little while.</li>
            <li> Read all the great reviews and expected to love it.  In the end, I didn&#x27;t like the course feeling it added to my hair and could not tell any difference in the control.  Wish I hadn&#x27;t purchased for my super curly &amp; course hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 9 year old biracial daughter with hard to care for hair. We have tried so many products and by far this is the best when she wants to keep her curly look. It definitely helps keep her hair from going too pouffy. After shampooing, take small sections of hair and smooth conditioner down from root to tip. Let it air dry.</li>
            <li> I had used this product from a salon.  I am just as happy with this product and the quick shipping!!  I am even happier with this price.</li>
            <li> Sorry didn&#x27;t like at all. Going back to DHC. That&#x27;s just me, someone else may love it. Have to give a try before you really know. Wish I could have a sample before buying.</li>
            <li> Great product to use since I straighten my hair.  It protects it from the heat and keeps it healthy. Use a very small amount.  Heard about it from my hairdresser.</li>
            <li> It smells very good. on-time delivery.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re thinking this is expensive, it isn&#x27;t. I got a full size version of this in a beauty sampler, over a year ago. I am still using it. All you need is a dime size amount for short hair. Use it after cleansing/conditioning and your hair is damp, not soaking wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to give my hair a break from blow drying, and with this, NO frizz, just a nice natural wave my hair has. It can easily turn frizzy if humidity goes up, but not with this Redken cream.&lt;br /&gt;No other product has ever worked so well. If you use shampoo, their All Soft is good as well. I use Wen, and that plus a dime sized amount of this, every other day, is my magic formula for frizz free hair.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser gave me a sample to use.  I blow dry my hair with a round brush and this product makes my hair smooth and soft and it smells good!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Used for a summer beach wedding and it worked great. Started using on a regular basis and love it! Great for curly hair in the high humidity that we have in the south.</li>
            <li> good product - I use a very minimal amount and actually put it on my hair when it&#x27;s dry go figure.  I use it to put smooth any fly aways once I dry my hair - I have a lot of hair and it&#x27;s very long - this stuff actually works.  I would like it more only if it smelled better.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it doesnt&#x27; smell bad, just wish it had more of that conditioner smell to it. - got it on time and undamaged container so all is right...</li>
            <li> Works great to straighten hair. Remember it only works with heat.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this product! It totally works on my frizzy  hair. The result is smooth and silky hair. I recommend it to anyone who has the same problem with hair being frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have dry and unruly hair so this product calms the hair down and still allows the curl to thrive.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Bought it on a whim at Ulta and haven&#x27;t found it anywhere except Amazon now... This is a great product for fine hair because it&#x27;s not heavy. I have layers in my hair and sometimes they look fuzzy, I apply this to damp hair blow dry, finish with some oil and hair spray. It&#x27;s great. Redken if you&#x27;re reading this, please don&#x27;t discontinue this product~</li>
            <li> Not sure what it is about this product. I tried it when I got a free sample with Redken shampoo. I have lots of straight hair with some crazy cowllicks, some gray and some not, so mixed textures:) But this stuff works and makes blow drying easier. When I&#x27;m finished, with the exception of a couple of cowlick spots, I really don&#x27;t need to use a flat iron to &amp;#34;manage&amp;#34; my hair into place.</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot! I love it!</li>
            <li> I like the product, it works.  I wish I liked the fragrance more.  It&#x27;s not bad, but not my favorite.</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy hair. This product does help,it isn&#x27;t a chemical  straightener but it does  take a lot of the frizz out of my hair</li>
            <li> This product is incredible! From time to time, I would come across reviews about individuals that would comment on how they would no longer need to use a flat iron since a blow dryer and that particular product alone would make their hair soft and pin-straight. I&#x27;d become envious as I have never found a product for me to get such results (I&#x27;d still have to run a flat iron after to get sleek smooth straight hair)... Until now. This stay sleek leave-in cream is the product I&#x27;ve been waiting for for so long. I have naturally coarse thick poofy wavy hair. Just a small amount saturates my hair evenly, and leaves my hair so soft, smooth, frizz free and straight. I no longer need to use a flat iron. Will definitely keep backup bottles incase this product ever gets discontinued. Mileage may vary...</li>
            <li> If you have coarse, wiry, or flyaway hair, this is a creamy smoother that is applied while hair is wet to calm things down.  I use Biotin and have many shorter flyaway hairs from new hair growth.  This calms those hairs down and makes it easier to blow dry.  It has a medium texture.  Not heavy or oily and a sweet fresh scent.</li>
            <li> the result is amazng...</li>
            <li> Ah-maaaa-zing!  I use this to tame frizz after straightening and it works very well.</li>
            <li> Love this product works well on my hair seller had fast shipping....</li>
