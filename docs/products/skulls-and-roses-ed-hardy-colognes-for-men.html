            <li>Fast shipping, item as described, and has a great scent.</li>
            <li>Love this cologne on my husband</li>
            <li>I went out on a limb purchasing this for my husband for Fathers Day &amp; wasn&#x27;t sure if he would even like it.</li>
            <li>I would say this is in my top 5 list with Drakkar Noir.  </li>
            <li>Overall great buy!</li>
            <li>I love when my husband wears it and the smell lingers for hours.</li>
            <li>Girls love the smell of this one the most.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the quick turn around on placing my order and receiving it.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, cool bottle</li>
            <li>The bottle I unique!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s delightful for work, formal evenings out, date nights, and it truly is nearly indistinguishable from Skulls and Roses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sprayed one on each wrist and asked my wife to smell each, with a blow and a breath of fresh air between - can you tell any difference?</li>
            <li>Smells fresh and sexy!~</li>
            <li>It smells great &amp; so far the fragrance has lasted almost all day.</li>
            <li>Bottle was way cool!</li>
            <li>I liked it so much, I bought two more.  </li>
            <li>The scent is more of a clean smell that lasts for a couple hours, I&#x27;ve noticed that it does tend to disappear after a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>Smells clean, love it lots of compliments.  </li>
            <li>The ladies like it , and the guys too , not too strong either.</li>
            <li>Not too strong.</li>
            <li>The scent is not too strong.  </li>
            <li>Given how much I like both fragrances, it isn&#x27;t really a matter of whether this one is good - it is!</li>
            <li>It was delivered on time and the product was packaged securely.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more than worth the money.</li>
            <li>It is so much cheaper on here then anywhere else too!!!</li>
            <li>Such a sexy man smell - my favorite cologne for my husband!</li>
            <li>Smells great, lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>This cologne has a very nice smell that lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m interested in any fragrance that smells great, and some of my favorites are the Fujiyama and Issey Miyake lines - not necessarily</li>
            <li>Though it doesn&#x27;t change the fragrance, the bottle looks really cool.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and fast service</li>
            <li>He loves it too and just loves the bottle as it is cool.</li>
            <li>It will be a cool paperweight after the cologne is gone.</li>
            <li>They smelled so good, that our waitress at a local steakhouse asked what they were wearing.</li>
            <li>Overall a good purchase.</li>
            <li>I love the whole packaging of the cologne.</li>
            <li>The bottle is pretty cool but who buys the cologne for the bottle?!</li>
            <li>Smells great, compared to original at a physical store and this is the real deal.</li>
            <li>it smells so clean and fresh</li>
            <li>I like this smell very much!</li>
            <li>i first smelled the cologne, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was a huge fan, but after a few days of wearing this cologne I&#x27;ve determined it&#x27;s now in my top 2 favorite colognes.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and would purchase again, especially at such a great price.</li>
            <li>Brand new condition, love the smell of fragrance.</li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s a great deal, almost half the price that it is in the store.</li>
            <li>The package arrived in excellent condition, when it was supposed to, and the packaging and scent was exactly as it was in the more expensive store.  </li>
            <li>This particular scent is pretty nice, I&#x27;ve owned Ed Hardys Luck and Love edt, which I have to admit I actually prefer over this one</li>
            <li>By far my favorite cologne now along with villan , hearts and daggers and versace dreamer</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t too strong or too weak, it&#x27;s great and it lasts for hours on clothing.</li>
            <li>great small and a really fun dispenser.</li>
            <li>Smooth sweet but masculine scent</li>
            <li>Initially it is hard to open the top of the skull to expose the sprayer, but its all good!  </li>
            <li>if it smells good or not, women don&#x27;t come near enough for me to ask how it smells on</li>
            <li>Ed Hardy fragrances are strong, bold, and lasting.  </li>
            <li>that first one is stronger.\\</li>
            <li>Fast ship!</li>
            <li>They also included samples of other products and coupons to order more!</li>
            <li>and I would definitely pay more if this deal didn&#x27;t exist .</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It smells like Curve but much stronger which is what I like!</li>
            <li>Not only does it have a fresh scent, but the bottle looks really cool!</li>
            <li>The cologne itself smells very masculine and bold.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the combination of both that lingers all day or one more than the other, but we are happy with it.</li>
            <li>I have a pretty large collection, a wardrobe over 300 fragrances ranging from dollar store knock-offs to pretty much every fragrance from Creed, Amouage and Montale.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant but decided to try this fragrance based on all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>for the ladies, my hairdresser: my co workers; massage therapist; wife and daughters ALL have made positive comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seller also included a free sample and a 15% off coupon for my next purchase.</li>
            <li>Has a very earthy smell.</li>
            <li>The price was very generous for the quality of the brand.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>I really like the way this product smells on my husband.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s masculine and fresh and has lighter tones than one would expect given the packaging.</li>
            <li>it came in the mail fast</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>More than I expected..</li>
            <li>Lightning fast shipping.</li>
            <li>(i don&#x27;t notice it much while wearing it anymore).  </li>
            <li>absolutely be buying this product again.  </li>
            <li>The skull bottle is nice and it is not cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>Society is tremendously nice, a very fresh, soapy scent, not at all sweet and only slightly powdery, with terrific silage and longevity.</li>
            <li>bottle is really cool, and the rose (which is cheesy) snaps right off, in case you&#x27;re wondering.</li>
            <li>I bought my first Skulls and Roses bottle a few years ago and it immediately became my favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cologne</li>
            <li>my nose, the Ed Hardy might add just the barest hint of tobacco, a tiny smidgen of fresh but musky vegetation.</li>
            <li>Definitely the real thing and not fake stuff.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I have never received so many complements before and i am truly shocked on how good I smell to others especially the ladies!  </li>
            <li>(Very similar spell to Abercrombie and Fitch&#x27;s &amp;#34;Fierce&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li>Its very mild, and i have had a few compliments on it.</li>
            <li>My favorite used to be Polo Black, but I like trying different fragerances.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like bold, simply use a lesser amount, maybe even a dot of it.  </li>
            <li>so i was surprised to see it for this price.</li>
            <li>I gave it to him early &amp; after checking it out he was happier than a kid in a candy store.</li>
            <li>But when i take my shirt off at night, i do really smell this manly scent that obviously lasts all</li>
            <li>Bought this directly from amazon for 39 bucks for the 3.4 OZ size.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely buy it again, reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this fragrance, purchased through a local mall in the kit with after shave and a small bottle.</li>
            <li>This item is what I expected after I first noticed someone else using it.  </li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t want to throw the skull away when it&#x27;s empty, it&#x27;s very decorative.  </li>
            <li>Its also one of the few colognes I have found that seems to last on me throughout a full day.</li>
            <li>previously paid 70$ for this exact bottle.</li>
            <li>This cologne was ordered for my grandson, 14 years old, after seeing the spray in a more expensive store.  </li>
            <li>This was a gift for my little brother (14) and he seemed pretty stoked.</li>

            <li> and I love all of them.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping, item as described, and has a great scent.</li>
            <li> Love this cologne on my husband</li>
            <li> I went out on a limb purchasing this for my husband for Fathers Day &amp; wasn&#x27;t sure if he would even like it.</li>
            <li> I would say this is in my top 5 list with Drakkar Noir.  </li>
            <li> Overall great buy!</li>
            <li> I love when my husband wears it and the smell lingers for hours.</li>
            <li> Girls love the smell of this one the most.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the quick turn around on placing my order and receiving it.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, cool bottle</li>
            <li> The bottle I unique!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s delightful for work, formal evenings out, date nights, and it truly is nearly indistinguishable from Skulls and Roses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sprayed one on each wrist and asked my wife to smell each, with a blow and a breath of fresh air between - can you tell any difference?</li>
            <li> Smells fresh and sexy!~</li>
            <li> It smells great &amp; so far the fragrance has lasted almost all day.</li>
            <li> Bottle was way cool!</li>
            <li> I liked it so much, I bought two more.  </li>
            <li> The scent is more of a clean smell that lasts for a couple hours, I&#x27;ve noticed that it does tend to disappear after a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> Smells clean, love it lots of compliments.  </li>
            <li> The ladies like it , and the guys too , not too strong either.</li>
            <li> Not too strong.</li>
            <li> The scent is not too strong.  </li>
            <li> Given how much I like both fragrances, it isn&#x27;t really a matter of whether this one is good - it is!</li>
            <li> It was delivered on time and the product was packaged securely.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more than worth the money.</li>
            <li> It is so much cheaper on here then anywhere else too!!!</li>
            <li> Such a sexy man smell - my favorite cologne for my husband!</li>
            <li> Smells great, lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> This cologne has a very nice smell that lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m interested in any fragrance that smells great, and some of my favorites are the Fujiyama and Issey Miyake lines - not necessarily</li>
            <li> Though it doesn&#x27;t change the fragrance, the bottle looks really cool.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and fast service</li>
            <li> He loves it too and just loves the bottle as it is cool.</li>
            <li> It will be a cool paperweight after the cologne is gone.</li>
            <li> They smelled so good, that our waitress at a local steakhouse asked what they were wearing.</li>
            <li> Overall a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I love the whole packaging of the cologne.</li>
            <li> The bottle is pretty cool but who buys the cologne for the bottle?!</li>
            <li> Smells great, compared to original at a physical store and this is the real deal.</li>
            <li> it smells so clean and fresh</li>
            <li> I like this smell very much!</li>
            <li> i first smelled the cologne, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was a huge fan, but after a few days of wearing this cologne I&#x27;ve determined it&#x27;s now in my top 2 favorite colognes.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and would purchase again, especially at such a great price.</li>
            <li> Brand new condition, love the smell of fragrance.</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s a great deal, almost half the price that it is in the store.</li>
            <li> The package arrived in excellent condition, when it was supposed to, and the packaging and scent was exactly as it was in the more expensive store.  </li>
            <li> This particular scent is pretty nice, I&#x27;ve owned Ed Hardys Luck and Love edt, which I have to admit I actually prefer over this one</li>
            <li> By far my favorite cologne now along with villan , hearts and daggers and versace dreamer</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t too strong or too weak, it&#x27;s great and it lasts for hours on clothing.</li>
            <li> great small and a really fun dispenser.</li>
            <li> Smooth sweet but masculine scent</li>
            <li> Initially it is hard to open the top of the skull to expose the sprayer, but its all good!  </li>
            <li> if it smells good or not, women don&#x27;t come near enough for me to ask how it smells on</li>
            <li> Ed Hardy fragrances are strong, bold, and lasting.  </li>
            <li> that first one is stronger.\\</li>
            <li> Fast ship!</li>
            <li> They also included samples of other products and coupons to order more!</li>
            <li> and I would definitely pay more if this deal didn&#x27;t exist .</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> It smells like Curve but much stronger which is what I like!</li>
            <li> Not only does it have a fresh scent, but the bottle looks really cool!</li>
            <li> The cologne itself smells very masculine and bold.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the combination of both that lingers all day or one more than the other, but we are happy with it.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty large collection, a wardrobe over 300 fragrances ranging from dollar store knock-offs to pretty much every fragrance from Creed, Amouage and Montale.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant but decided to try this fragrance based on all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> for the ladies, my hairdresser: my co workers; massage therapist; wife and daughters ALL have made positive comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seller also included a free sample and a 15% off coupon for my next purchase.</li>
            <li> Has a very earthy smell.</li>
            <li> The price was very generous for the quality of the brand.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this product smells on my husband.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s masculine and fresh and has lighter tones than one would expect given the packaging.</li>
            <li> it came in the mail fast</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> More than I expected..</li>
            <li> Lightning fast shipping.</li>
            <li> (i don&#x27;t notice it much while wearing it anymore).  </li>
            <li> absolutely be buying this product again.  </li>
            <li> The skull bottle is nice and it is not cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> Society is tremendously nice, a very fresh, soapy scent, not at all sweet and only slightly powdery, with terrific silage and longevity.</li>
            <li> bottle is really cool, and the rose (which is cheesy) snaps right off, in case you&#x27;re wondering.</li>
            <li> I bought my first Skulls and Roses bottle a few years ago and it immediately became my favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cologne</li>
            <li> my nose, the Ed Hardy might add just the barest hint of tobacco, a tiny smidgen of fresh but musky vegetation.</li>
            <li> Definitely the real thing and not fake stuff.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I have never received so many complements before and i am truly shocked on how good I smell to others especially the ladies!  </li>
            <li> (Very similar spell to Abercrombie and Fitch&#x27;s &amp;#34;Fierce&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li> Its very mild, and i have had a few compliments on it.</li>
            <li> My favorite used to be Polo Black, but I like trying different fragerances.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like bold, simply use a lesser amount, maybe even a dot of it.  </li>
            <li> so i was surprised to see it for this price.</li>
            <li> I gave it to him early &amp; after checking it out he was happier than a kid in a candy store.</li>
            <li> But when i take my shirt off at night, i do really smell this manly scent that obviously lasts all</li>
            <li> Bought this directly from amazon for 39 bucks for the 3.4 OZ size.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely buy it again, reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this fragrance, purchased through a local mall in the kit with after shave and a small bottle.</li>
            <li> This item is what I expected after I first noticed someone else using it.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t want to throw the skull away when it&#x27;s empty, it&#x27;s very decorative.  </li>
            <li> Its also one of the few colognes I have found that seems to last on me throughout a full day.</li>
            <li> previously paid 70$ for this exact bottle.</li>
            <li> This cologne was ordered for my grandson, 14 years old, after seeing the spray in a more expensive store.  </li>
            <li> This was a gift for my little brother (14) and he seemed pretty stoked.</li>
            <li> It is not to strong, very subtle.  </li>
            <li> does not last long and some have written it is similar to Abercrombie Fierce...</li>
            <li> Long lasting.</li>
            <li> Doesnt last long</li>
            <li> I ordered this and received it 2 days later, as expected with Prime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent lingers for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> it is unlike any other cologne on the market.  </li>
            <li> Got this due to the skull thingie that it comes in.</li>
            <li> Arrived at sooner date than expected!</li>
            <li> Also it is half the price compared to buying at Peebles.  </li>
            <li> WANT FULL REFUND WAS NOT GOOD QUALITY POOR QUALITY !</li>
            <li> Then it dried down</li>
            <li> WAS NOT A GOOD PRODUCT TO.PURCHASE DOESN&#x27;T STAY ON LONG</li>
            <li> Half the price compared to what I would pay in store!</li>
            <li> I wear it everyday, it stays a while on the skin!</li>
            <li> I bought a bunch of these as gifts for the men in our household this past Christmas.</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed, but overall this product was inexpensive and quality.</li>
            <li> My husband received a sample in the store and as soon as he tired it on I purchased it online.</li>
            <li> At the store its so expensive</li>
            <li> The sprayer seems to be a permanent part of the skull, so it would be slightly difficult to aim the spray I think.</li>
            <li> Ive had really expensive cologne too from burberry, versace, polo.</li>
            <li> Ill pass on this one!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>

The bottle is pretty cool but who buys the cologne for the bottle?! The scent is more of a clean smell that lasts for a couple hours, I&#x27;ve noticed that it does tend to disappear after a couple of hours. It&#x27;s not over powering and is pleasant :)</li>

            <li> Smells nice, cool bottle</li>
            <li> My friend loved the fragrance &amp; bottle design, to whom I gifted this perfume. Well done!</li>
            <li> Great scent and I unique packaging.  This is my favorite scent on the market.  I wear it every day and always get compliments.</li>
            <li> My wife says that it smells amazing!  The scent lingers for a very long time.  Also it is half the price compared to buying at Peebles.  Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> I like this smell very much! I will buy it again!</li>
            <li> This cologne was ordered for my grandson, 14 years old, after seeing the spray in a more expensive store.  The package arrived in excellent condition, when it was supposed to, and the packaging and scent was exactly as it was in the more expensive store.  He was quite pleased with it</li>
            <li> I have a pretty large collection, a wardrobe over 300 fragrances ranging from dollar store knock-offs to pretty much every fragrance from Creed, Amouage and Montale. I&#x27;m interested in any fragrance that smells great, and some of my favorites are the Fujiyama and Issey Miyake lines - not necessarily just the $300 bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very nice, very enjoyable fragrance, but virtually indistinguishable from a frag that costs 1/3 of the price: Society. Society is tremendously nice, a very fresh, soapy scent, not at all sweet and only slightly powdery, with terrific silage and longevity. It&#x27;s delightful for work, formal evenings out, date nights, and it truly is nearly indistinguishable from Skulls and Roses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sprayed one on each wrist and asked my wife to smell each, with a blow and a breath of fresh air between - can you tell any difference? She says, that one is stronger. The Ed Hardy. But they smell the same. Then it dried down and she says on the next sniff, \\&quot;No, that first one is stronger.\\&quot; Do they smell any different? No, not really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my nose, the Ed Hardy might add just the barest hint of tobacco, a tiny smidgen of fresh but musky vegetation. It could just as well be my imagination as reality. Smell it once, and they&#x27;re identical. Smell it again, there could be a hint of tobacco... or is there?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All told, the Ed Hardy is 100ml of Society for Men in a nifty, if a bit daft, skull-shaped bottle. For my money, I&#x27;ll have the Society, and when that bottle is done, I will replace it - it has definitely earned a permanent place in my wardrobe. The Ed Hardy IS nice, so I&#x27;m not warning you off. Just suggesting alternatives. Given how much I like both fragrances, it isn&#x27;t really a matter of whether this one is good - it is! It&#x27;s whether you want to pay for the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, enjoy!</li>
            <li> This is actually my favorite cologne. My favorite used to be Polo Black, but I like trying different fragerances. I tried Ed Hardy Skulls and Roses because Ed Hardy fragerances are absolutely superb. So I knew this one would smell great. I&#x27;ll go to the store and people will compliment me and ask me what cologne I have on and I tell them.</li>
            <li> Loved it bought for someone and love the smell on him plus he like skulls sp we both got what we wanted</li>
            <li> I really like the way this product smells on my husband. I look forward to buying more for him for anniversary, valentines, Christmas, and his birthday gifts.</li>
            <li> One of the best cologne that I ever own before!!!!</li>
            <li> Good. Can not be any better get up and check it out on the way home. I know u would.</li>
            <li> This item is what I expected after I first noticed someone else using it.  Very happy.  Thank you. I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Just like most all Ed Hardy fragrances, it smells great. Get compliments all the time on how great this product smells.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my little brother (14) and he seemed pretty stoked.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my dad for christmas after I overheard him raving about it. It has a nice manly smell. Not too strong.</li>
            <li> does not last long and some have written it is similar to Abercrombie Fierce...IT IS NOT EVEN CLOSE!  Ill pass on this one!</li>
            <li> Smells really nice like sweet flower, really really nice, I will buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;the bottle is beautiful nice size</li>
            <li> I received exactly what I ordered at an incredible price.</li>
            <li> Great gift set!!! Fast ship!&amp;</li>
            <li> Love the smell and fast service</li>
            <li> Such a sexy man smell - my favorite cologne for my husband!</li>
            <li> I would, and am going to buy it again</li>
            <li> i bought this for my boyfriend! I love this and he does too! It is so much cheaper on here then anywhere else too!!!</li>
            <li> Half the price compared to what I would pay in store! Great skull shaped bottle and the rose is easily detached if you&#x27;d rather not have it there. Great smell - not too strong so you don&#x27;t smell like you fell in the bottle and everyone asks my boyfriend what he&#x27;s cologne he&#x27;s wearing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great my husband loved it !!!!</li>
            <li> This is the product I wanted, and I am pleased with that, but the packaging it came in was scratched and ripped. Since it was a gift I was a bit disappointed, but overall this product was inexpensive and quality.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this fragrance for a year now-- great small and a really fun dispenser. Eventually the flower will leave the skulls mouth :)</li>
            <li> Great price, great scent</li>
            <li> Very nice, rather unique fragrance. Long lasting. Can be worn day or night. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Brand new condition, love the smell of fragrance. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Love the design, love the product.</li>
            <li> Smooth sweet but masculine scent</li>
            <li> bought it as a gift for my boyfriend. At the store its so expensive so i was surprised to see it for this price. it got here the day it said it would be here. I love the smell of this and my boyfriend loves it too I&#x27;m extremely happy with my purchase and i would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> Good value for the price</li>
            <li> Great item for the $$$$</li>
            <li> Gift for my husband, he loves it, i love it.</li>
            <li> So glad I got this for my fianc√©.  Smells great!  He loves it too and just loves the bottle as it is cool.</li>

            <li> Smells clean, love it lots of compliments.  Arrived on time and was packaged nice.  Love it and will buy more.</li>
            <li> This is a good smelling cologne. It came fast too and was a great price. They also included samples of other products and coupons to order more! I will be usign my coupon soon!</li>
            <li> The person who I gave the item loved it, good value for the money pay for it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering on buying one for my self</li>
            <li> Nice smell.Would like to wear while drilling Christina&#x27;s Pie Hole.</li>
            <li> Love the scent of this and so does my wife. Will be ordering more when I&#x27;m close to running out. Smells awsome</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this fragrance, purchased through a local mall in the kit with after shave and a small bottle. I wear it everyday, it stays a while on the skin!</li>
            <li> I order this one for my husband and order me the womens we love it  and was also a good buy .</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for Valentine&#x27;s Day because had been wanting it. He loves it and he smells great! There was an issue with the shipping and it got here later than promised, but the seller was awesome and made up for the delay, even though it wasn&#x27;t their fault! I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Great price ,wonderful smell and Amazon&#x27;s fast and safe delivery is second to none! Thanks</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband for Valentines day and we both loved it!  It arrived on time for the occasion and the bottle was huge!  I highly recommend this product and would purchase again, especially at such a great price.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite cologne now along with villan , hearts and daggers and versace dreamer</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance, love the bottle</li>
            <li> fast shipping. will buy from again.</li>
            <li> I loved the scent when I tried it at the store. It&#x27;s masculine and fresh and has lighter tones than one would expect given the packaging. The only letdown is that it is eau de toilette and not parfum, which means that it doesn&#x27;t stay with you quite as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is really cool, and the rose (which is cheesy) snaps right off, in case you&#x27;re wondering. It will be a cool paperweight after the cologne is gone.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing!!! Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Smells fresh and sexy!~</li>
            <li> Smells so good and my husband loved the bottle</li>
            <li> I bought this a gift for my son and he really liked it.  I was very pleased with the quick turn around on placing my order and receiving it.</li>
            <li> I buy Ed Hardy colognes and perfumes based on quality, not trend.  Ed Hardy fragrances are strong, bold, and lasting.  If you don&#x27;t like bold, simply use a lesser amount, maybe even a dot of it.  Regardless, the blends are amazing and I love all of them.  Skulls and Roses is a masterpiece.... it is unlike any other cologne on the market.  It is seductive.</li>
            <li> Perfect,  got it for my guy for Christmas he really liked it.</li>
            <li> WAS NOT A GOOD PRODUCT TO.PURCHASE DOESN&#x27;T STAY ON LONG THROUGHOUT THE DAY SEND A RETURN LABEL TO SHIP BACK TO SENDER WANT FULL REFUND WAS NOT GOOD QUALITY POOR QUALITY !</li>
            <li> I bought a bunch of these as gifts for the men in our household this past Christmas. They smelled so good, that our waitress at a local steakhouse asked what they were wearing. We got excellent service that night! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> so great its makes girls drop their panties.seriously.buy this s*** and you will not be dissapointed.  words dont even explain</li>
            <li> Got this due to the skull thingie that it comes in. The sprayer seems to be a permanent part of the skull, so it would be slightly difficult to aim the spray I think. I have no idea if it smells good or not, women don&#x27;t come near enough for me to ask how it smells on&lt;br /&gt;me. Probably a good gift for someone who collects skull things.</li>
            <li> Got this for my boyfriend for Christmas, he absolutely loves it.&lt;br /&gt;He wears it everyday, and he told me people always say he smells so good.&lt;br /&gt;i love this! it came in the mail fast, packaging was great, when he runs out; i cant wait to buy him more! :)</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, was a gift, buying another one for my husband. And the rose addition was a nice touch.</li>
            <li> Excellent smell, really fresh, girls like it when I use it and the style of the box and the little skull jar is awesome!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, item as described, and has a great scent. Its very mild, and i have had a few compliments on it.</li>
            <li> I get compliment and women hanging on me like if i was a tree, and a bunch of monkeys. haha</li>
            <li> Great scent. Only problem is that it expires quicker than I hoped for.</li>
            <li> Love this cologne on my husband</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! previously paid 70$ for this exact bottle. Great smell, great price and it lasts quite a while!</li>
            <li> I got the product on time.  It was well-packaged inside a box.  The cologne smell nice and not over powering.  I got it for my husband and he agreed that it is a perfect cologne for summer.  The skull bottle is nice and it is not cheaply made.  Overall a good purchase.</li>
            <li> My husband received a sample in the store and as soon as he tired it on I purchased it online. It smells so good!!!</li>
            <li> My son found this at a department store, which cost way out of my budget.  Got this for his Christmas.  It was delivered on time and the product was packaged securely.  The scent is not too strong.  I would recommend this product and buyer.</li>
            <li> Smells good.  Doesnt last long</li>
            <li> Excellent!  Bottle was way cool! Guy was very happy with the smell.  Nothing else smells anything like it. Will buy again</li>
            <li> I went out on a limb purchasing this for my husband for Fathers Day &amp; wasn&#x27;t sure if he would even like it. I gave it to him early &amp; after checking it out he was happier than a kid in a candy store. It smells great &amp; so far the fragrance has lasted almost all day. I also got him the body spray that goes with this so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the combination of both that lingers all day or one more than the other, but we are happy with it. He also loves the bottle it came in &amp; I think its cute myself!</li>
            <li> My wife loves it. So do I.</li>
            <li> Smells great, compared to original at a physical store and this is the real deal.</li>
            <li> More than I expected..</li>
            <li> Awesome!  The bottle I unique!  Initially it is hard to open the top of the skull to expose the sprayer, but its all good!  I would say this is in my top 5 list with Drakkar Noir.  I recommend this cologne to all the fellas!</li>
            <li> I ordered this on a Tuesday and it arrived Thursday. Lightning fast shipping. The cologne itself smells very masculine and bold. Great cologne for the price and I would definitely pay more if this deal didn&#x27;t exist . Great addition to my collection.</li>
            <li> The best cologne I have ever worn.  My wife loves it. It is not to strong, very subtle.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Arrived at sooner date than expected! Husband loves it! Overall great buy!</li>
            <li> I ordered this and received it 2 days later, as expected with Prime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When i first smelled the cologne, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was a huge fan, but after a few days of wearing this cologne I&#x27;ve determined it&#x27;s now in my top 2 favorite colognes.  It&#x27;s not over powering, but it&#x27;s got enough of a smell to it that it will catch someones attention if they come close to you.  It also lasts quite a while.  I sprayed it on a shirt and left it for a day, came back and could still smell the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant but decided to try this fragrance based on all the positive reviews. I am glad I did!  Wow! Smells like a man should...not too &amp;#34;fruity or overpowerring. I have never received so many complements before and i am truly shocked on how good I smell to others especially the ladies!  (i don&#x27;t notice it much while wearing it anymore).  But when i take my shirt off at night, i do really smell this manly scent that obviously lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the ladies, my hairdresser: my co workers; massage therapist; wife and daughters ALL have made positive comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it, you will not regret it!</li>
            <li> Bought this directly from amazon for 39 bucks for the 3.4 OZ size.  At the mall it was like 55 for the 2.5 OZ.  Smells great, lasts a long time.  Definitely the real thing and not fake stuff. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Smells great. Speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> This cologne has a very nice smell that lasts a long time. I would definitely buy it again, reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> This cologne for men smells so yummy.  I love when my husband wears it and the smell lingers for hours.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.  Smells amazing!  (Very similar spell to Abercrombie and Fitch&#x27;s &amp;#34;Fierce&amp;#34;).  Great bottle, great packaging, great price.. .will absolutely be buying this product again.  Its also one of the few colognes I have found that seems to last on me throughout a full day.</li>
            <li> LOVE the smell!!! It&#x27;s more than worth the money. The smell isn&#x27;t too strong or too weak, it&#x27;s great and it lasts for hours on clothing.</li>
            <li> One of the best smelling colognes ive had. Ive had really expensive cologne too from burberry, versace, polo. Girls love the smell of this one the most. I highly recommend this cologne</li>
            <li> I love the whole packaging of the cologne. It smells like Curve but much stronger which is what I like! I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on how well this scent is and I didn&#x27;t receive a fake, js :)</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this!!</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite!</li>
