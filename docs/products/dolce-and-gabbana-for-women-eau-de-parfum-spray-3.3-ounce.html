            <li>but it&#x27;s not cold like &amp;#34;Light blue&amp;#34; it has a warm vanilla smell with other scents that smell awesome</li>
            <li>I just received a deluxe sample of this perfume from Sephora and was couldn&#x27;t wait to try it after having read so many positive reviews; however, I think this one will be joining my fragrance</li>
            <li>It smells a bit strong at first but after a while it develops nicely and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great counter part to the Dolce Gabbana light blue.</li>
            <li>I tend to get headaches with overpowering perfumes, but I can wear this all day and still enjoy it.  </li>
            <li>-- could definitely be a lovely scent if you have the right chemistry for it.  </li>

            <li>I know it is not the same because I haven&#x27;t had anyone comment on how good I smell...</li>

            <li>However, if they do,  everyone will smell this pretty!</li>
            <li>It was worth the purchase price.</li>
            <li>Great soft smell that last all day depending on the material you are wearing.  </li>

            <li>My daughter was absolutely sooooo excited when she opened her gift.  </li>
            <li>went ahead of the holidays and started wearing it right away.</li>
            <li>I noticed that right away.</li>
            <li>do think that this is a very feminine fragrance; sweet and powdery</li>
            <li>Sweet and sultry, naughty and nice ;)</li>
            <li>I love this smell when you 1st put it on, but it doesn&#x27;t last.</li>

            <li>I love this rich yet subtle fragrance.  </li>
            <li>or it is so old that has lost its effect.  </li>
            <li>For me who has to smell it everyday- it light and not to flowery.</li>
            <li>I got my first whiff a few weeks before Christmas, and put the tester card on my husbands desk to give him the hint.  </li>

Unfortunately for me, all I get is a strong synthetic plastic &amp;#34;my little pony&amp;#34; scent, which I believe is supposed to be the marshmallow :(.  Hanae Mori has this exact same plastic scent (for me at least) and reminds me a lot of D&amp;G.  I suspect that if you&#x27;re a fan of Hanae Mori you&#x27;ll also be a fan of D&amp;G Pour Femme.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this perfume but the fragrance lasts only for an hour or two. It does not spread at all. I am not sure it&#x27;s the problem is generally with this version of perfume, or it&#x27;s this bottle I have got online.</li>
            <li> This perfume is not what I expected. The smell doesn&#x27;t last at all. Not even 30 minutes. I am not happy with this product. I will never order it again.</li>
            <li> Delivery time was outstanding. Price was good as well. the product does not smell as strong as the original scent purchased at a department store but the value is good.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best smelling womens perfume. I have The One and I&#x27;m a lifetime fan of it so I got this for my fiance and it smells wonderful. This perfume doesn&#x27;t smash you in the face with fruityness but it&#x27;s not cold like &amp;#34;Light blue&amp;#34; it has a warm vanilla smell with other scents that smell awesome I don&#x27;t know what they are I just know I like it. I definitely recommend this perfume especially for the cold winter months.</li>
            <li> Its a copy... not good I will not buy a perfume again.worst ting I have ever buy... its like money to the trash.. tinking about unsubscribe. ... :(</li>
            <li> Not only is the perfume exactly as described, but it also came with a small tube of body lotion and a tube of body wash. Bonus!</li>
            <li> Wonderful perfume. Smells great and the product is just as described.</li>
            <li> Love it!  It has a soft sweet smell.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t the perfume I expected. During the Christmas holidays I got a scented card at Macy&#x27;s and really liked the scent of Dolce &amp; Gabbana and thought I was ordering that one but it wasn&#x27;t, Big time disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gloria Y Casas</li>
            <li> This is a very beautiful new fragrance from D&amp;G. It lasts and lasts and lasts and it seems to smell better and better as the day goes. This is the best D&amp;B product for women to date. It&#x27;s a very confident fragrance and makes me feel like the woman I am. Love it!</li>
            <li> I had a pleasant experience with buying this perfume. I smell the perfume all through out the day. It&#x27;s amazing! I highly recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li> Love this parfum and our local stores are discontinuing it. I decided to try Amazon and there it was. I will be ordering all my fragrances from Amazon. They have the fragrances and they&#x27;re cheaper. Just love it!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this rich yet subtle fragrance.  I got my first whiff a few weeks before Christmas, and put the tester card on my husbands desk to give him the hint.  Santa delivered.  This is a bold but not overpowering fragrance.  I tend to get headaches with overpowering perfumes, but I can wear this all day and still enjoy it.  Sweet and sultry, naughty and nice ;)</li>
            <li> Love this!  It smells so nice with a sweet smell.  It&#x27;s one of my favorites!  A must have!!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loved it, so I loved it.  Whatever makes her happy is good.  It was worth the purchase price.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom and she loves it! went ahead of the holidays and started wearing it right away.</li>
            <li> I saw this in a magazine and loved the scent.  However, when I purchased this and got it alt home it did smell different than what I remembered.  I still gave it a chance since you cannot return it once it is opened, and now I love it. It smells a bit strong at first but after a while it develops nicely and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> This perfume is extremely wonderful and smell so good. Feeling more feminine when I wear it. It&#x27;s worm and last for the days. I get a lot compliments when I wear it. Everyone ask about it&#x27;s name. You gotta love.</li>
            <li> I really like this scent. Smells great and is on the lighter side. It doesn&#x27;t linger all day, but still nice.</li>
            <li> I love the men&#x27;s cologne and so does she.  I got her this for a gift and she loves it.  Good price too!</li>
            <li> Great soft smell that last all day depending on the material you are wearing.  I have received several compliments when wearing this.</li>
            <li> I got this D&amp;G perfume sample when I purchased Clinique products in Nordstorm. Very sexy and sweet smell and I started to love it right away. My husband said it smells good too!</li>
            <li> I have to say that I absolutely love this scent.  I never tire of it and it is also long lasting.  The only reason I gave this product a rating of 4 instead of 5 is because the description says it is a 3.4 oz bottle; however, the bottle says it is 3.3 oz.  Regardless, it is a nice size bottle with a wonderful scent.</li>
            <li> My daughter was absolutely sooooo excited when she opened her gift.  I tried finding it in local stores at no avail.  Great it was right under my fingertips the whole time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say this has either added water to it or it is so old that has lost its effect.  If I had not thrown away the box I would have returned it.  It is exactly like water, has a very faint scent which immediately wears off after applying :(((</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed when I purchased this perfume this time. I have been wearing this fragrance for years and always get compliments on it. It can no longer be purchased in stores and I have to rely on getting it online. In the past I have been very satisfied. But my last purchase does not smell the same as previous purchases did. Even the style of the cap is different. I noticed that right away. After applying it, I noticed the smell was not the same. I was going to send it back but I had waited to open it until I had already used up what I had left in my last bottle. Sending it back would have left me without scent to wear. I know it is not the same because I haven&#x27;t had anyone comment on how good I smell...and I always got compliments before!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume, and one that can be worn every day since it is not overpowering.  I have never had as many compliments about a perfume or cologne that I have worn before as I have when I use this one!</li>
            <li> I am simply in love with that perfume.&lt;br /&gt;I never got that much comments until I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s beautiful .</li>
            <li> es dulce y suave, muy femenino, lo mande traer por que en colombia no ha llegado y estoy feliz!!!! se los super recomiendo</li>
            <li> I have received so many compliments since purchasing and wearing this perfume. I hesitate to tell anyone what kind it is as everyone will go get it. However, if they do,  everyone will smell this pretty!</li>
            <li> fragrance is great  lasts all day and is most enjoyable. would buy it again and would advise others to do so</li>
            <li> One of my favorite fragrances. It smells absolutely gorgeous, and plus, the 3.4 oz. is about $30-$40 cheaper than you&#x27;d buy at Nordstrom or Sephora... Worth it.</li>
            <li> This my wife&#x27;s favorite. For me who has to smell it everyday- it light and not to flowery. It makes her smile and I don&#x27;t get a headache from smelling it on her. It got here fast to make her day!</li>
            <li> I love the scent!  It&#x27;s a spicy warm smell.  Definitely great for a night out.  The smell reminds me of a warm vacation.  It&#x27;s a great counter part to the Dolce Gabbana light blue.</li>
