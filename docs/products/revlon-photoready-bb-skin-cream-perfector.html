    <ol>
            <li>This is the best BB cream I have ever tried!</li>

            <li>I purchased the light medium and I am very impressed with the texture and the way that it smooths into my skin.  </li>

            <li>We love it!</li>
            <li>I love this BB cream!</li>
            <li>When shades start with fair, light, etc...I always use light, but this Light/Medium shade works perfectly for my skin color.</li>
            <li>Is this kind of like benefit rebel?</li>
            <li>Went on nice and smoothe.</li>
            <li>I liked it</li>
            <li>I prefer BB creams/foundations that provide a good amount of coverage, whereas this was more like a tinted moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;2.)</li>
            <li>I liked this BB cream&#x27;s coverage.</li>
            <li>I tried this product for a couple weeks, and it leaves my face oily and the coverage is very light.</li>
            <li>It feels very light</li>
            <li>I am a 40 year old with very fair skin with freckles.</li>
            <li>Will continue using the BB cream I have been using until I find something that I feel works better.</li>
            <li>Love the consistency and color.</li>
            <li>Makes me look better than before but not made up.</li>
            <li>Lasts for over 18 hours and protect the skin from the sun :)</li>
            <li>I too like a product that is more of a matte finish.</li>
            <li>The price may be appealing, but I&#x27;d recommend trying your luck elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I have just started using this product after not being able to find the Covergirl BB Cream that I have used for years.  </li>
            <li>and I love that it is SPF 30.  </li>
            <li>Even when it&#x27;s off, my skin feels smooth!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad can get it delivered in my mailbox</li>
            <li>I already have oily skin, so I prefer moisturizers/foundations that have more of</li>
            <li>and I think I finally found to best!  </li>
            <li>I love this BB cream.</li>
            <li>My skin felt dewy for lack of a better word.</li>
            <li>This I feel of all the U.s drugstore brand&#x27;s BB cream has the most coverage.</li>
            <li>playing around for days to make this product work, I ended up mixing moisturizer into my foundation for a much better result.</li>
            <li>Hard to explain and will not satisfy you if you like full coverage, flawless, smooth, perfect skin.  </li>
            <li>I read somewhere that some people are bothered by the scent; however I cannot detect any scent at all (and I consider myself a pretty good sniffer).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was searching for a better liquid foundation that wouldn&#x27;t smear on my clothes, and this has more than fit the bill.</li>
            <li>I love that it has sun screen, and the color works perfectly for my skin down.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t provide much coverage, but nice and light on the skin.</li>
            <li>Does not go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>This BB cream evens skin tone with light coverage.</li>
            <li>Light weight coverage with a glow</li>
            <li>Here Is what I like:  smooth and not sticky, covers well, no odor, and matches my skin tone, and my skin seems to glow.</li>
            <li>: Ponds was too light in color and waxy.</li>
            <li>I have light medium.</li>
            <li>Purchased this as a light coverage alternative for spring/summer to my foundation.</li>
            <li>Covergirl smoother is far  superior for a drugstore brand.</li>
            <li>This product is really good with different types of skin.</li>
            <li>Mi have fair skin with blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>The packaging is very sleek and cute.</li>
            <li>The thing I am most suprised about is how it really makes my skin look fresh and glowing.</li>
            <li>am very pleased with this product and will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li>and I realize that not all products work the same for each person but for the price this is definitely worth trying and seeing if it works as well for you as it has for me, like I said I am very pleased</li>
            <li>Overall this is a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>Very light coverage with no heavy feeling on my face.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>This foundation is good if you have dry skin because it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It is strange because normally Revlon is the brand that has the most colors that could work on virtually anyone and the most specialized for skin types.</li>
            <li>Sits on top of the skin very obviously.</li>
            <li>Just enough color to do something to my skin that ends up looking like no make-up, but makes it much better than it looked before application.</li>
            <li>I just bought this yesterday, and I&#x27;m more than likely going to return it.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, too!</li>
            <li>Colleagues and friends all have differing opinions, so I tried several more creams to make a well-researched decision and here&#x27;s what I found</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this BB cream to anyone!</li>
            <li>and so you don&#x27;t have to use as much.</li>
            <li>it covered very well without any mask lines.</li>
            <li>Decided that creams with sunscreen make my face appear very oily.</li>
            <li>I really like the Revlon bob cream and this color</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing also.</li>
            <li>I am so glad to read other people having issues with this product separating - I thought I was out of my mind!  </li>
            <li>The color is not what I expected; even though I bought the light/medium, it has a strong orange hue.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>Highly disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li>This seems to do the trick and the days that I feel like I need more, then I put on a little concealer.</li>
            <li>At the end of the day, though Revlon&#x27;s BB cream is a little darker than my skin tone, it works best on my 44-yr-old skin which used to be extremely oily and is now totally dry.</li>
            <li>No matter how much shaking, squeezing, etc., get a squirt of oily, clear liquid, then some goop.  </li>
            <li>and it works well to cover my freckles and other flaws and still give me a smooth look.</li>
            <li>.. Had to be old!</li>
            <li>I have dry skin and without using a moisturizer, it soaks into my skin right away</li>
            <li>I do always use a pre moisturizer, I am older and my skin is getting dryer, but a younger person with normal skin, wouldn&#x27;t need to.</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical at first, but this product is great for the skin, smooths everything over, creates a nice subtle glow.</li>
            <li>it stays separated and a clear liquid pours out every time I use it.</li>
            <li>know that there is a whole \\&quot;US BB Cream vs Asian BB</li>
            <li>Although it doesn&#x27;t cover much, it seems to improve the look of my skin and provide just enough coverage plus sun screen.</li>
            <li>This must of been really old product because the ingredients where all separated and even after I shook it when I would squeeze the product out of tube it would just be oil and then the foundation..</li>
            <li>Another reviewer said it looked like nude cottage cheese, completely on point.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other ones, but this one seems to be more, without being heavy feeling, and find I don&#x27;t need to use concealer with it.</li>
            <li>However, I cover it up with Bare Minerals matte powder to combat the oiliness.</li>
            <li>Maybelline also came highly recommended and the color was spot on, but it was also dry and waxy.</li>
            <li>I guess if you used it up really quickly it might not matter to you but for me it was really such a waste of money as I was throwing away a lot of the product.</li>
            <li>but it came with 5 stars, price was reasonable compared to other bb creams - and this has spf20.  </li>
            <li>I received a sample of Stila (the super expensive stuff) in a gift bag and found it to be decent, but it didn&#x27;t really provide the blemish coverage I wanted and expected.</li>
            <li>The product just sort of sits on your skin, you really have to rub it in to make it look less obvious.</li>

            <li> The product just sort of sits on your skin, you really have to rub it in to make it look less obvious.</li>
            <li> I have been searching high and low for something to give my face coverage while at the same time not looking caked on and showing how dried out my face is.</li>
            <li> Although it doesn&#x27;t give me the complete coverage I am wanting, I have fond that I can use it with my other foundation</li>
            <li> I discovered it in a review on a website of about 20 different BB and CC creams, many of which were $30+ per tube, and decided I would give Revlon (the least expensive one) a try as I find the whole beauty supply scene to be a total racket.</li>
            <li> I am blonde with blue eye and fairly dry skin, but this does wonders!</li>
            <li> Chunky texture with clear oil pouring out making a mess.</li>
            <li> but I felt like there was no real coverage, only color.</li>
            <li> After using a different BB cream that I really liked (Dr. Jart BB Cream), I was rather disappointed in this one.&lt;br /&gt;1.)</li>
            <li> Coverage not what I hoped for - too thick going on but doesn&#x27;t really even out the color on my face.</li>
            <li> , I can only compare this with other US BB Creams and tinted moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It does leave my skin a little oily which is why I am only giving 4 stars.</li>
            <li> If I were younger I would not like this product because it is a little oily.</li>
            <li> I spent about 10 bucks.</li>
            <li> I have to vigorously shake it before every use and it still sometimes comes out partially separated and looking like skin-tone cottage cheese.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been 2 weeks, and it had seperated into an unwearable mess!</li>
            <li> and I have to mix it with other BB creams to fix it.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 60&#x27;s now, but when I was young I had the worst complexion and had to use very heavy make-up to cover all my pimples, so it has been a real psychological challenge for me to get used to wearing  something that doesn&#x27;t have that much coverage.</li>
            <li> I still have to use a foundation, but I use less of it when I use this BB cream.</li>
            <li> It feels greasy and seemed to sit in my pores vs make them less noticeable.</li>
            <li> This BB cream is a little too oily for my liking, but it also made my eyes burn for over an hour.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>

            <li> Coverage not what I hoped for - too thick going on but doesn&#x27;t really even out the color on my face. Will continue using the BB cream I have been using until I find something that I feel works better.</li>
            <li> Is this kind of like benefit rebel?</li>
            <li> Separated badly.  No matter how much shaking, squeezing, etc., get a squirt of oily, clear liquid, then some goop.  Gross.  Very disappointed in Revlon.</li>
            <li> This is the best BB cream I have ever tried! I am blonde with blue eye and fairly dry skin, but this does wonders! I would highly recommend this BB cream to anyone! My little sister uses this one too! We love it!</li>
            <li> I have been searching high and low for something to give my face coverage while at the same time not looking caked on and showing how dried out my face is. I have to say that I am very pleased with this product. Although it doesn&#x27;t give me the complete coverage I am wanting, I have fond that I can use it with my other foundation and it works well to cover my freckles and other flaws and still give me a smooth look. The thing I am most suprised about is how it really makes my skin look fresh and glowing. I am always skeptical about products claiming to do what they say so I always like to read reviews before trying things and I realize that not all products work the same for each person but for the price this is definitely worth trying and seeing if it works as well for you as it has for me, like I said I am very pleased and I will be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> My color. I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Love the consistency and color.</li>
            <li> I just got product - haven&#x27;t use it yet - but it came with 5 stars, price was reasonable compared to other bb creams - and this has spf20.  Name brand - if item is good will purchase again  -</li>
            <li> Finishing the tube because I bought it but I don&#x27;t like it at all. Does not go on smoothly. Sits on top of the skin very obviously. If you try and rub it in it pills up. Leaves shiny finish and a tacky feel. Separates and needs shaking but separates on face even after shaking. Covergirl smoother is far  superior for a drugstore brand.</li>
            <li> Just enough color to do something to my skin that ends up looking like no make-up, but makes it much better than it looked before application. Hard to explain and will not satisfy you if you like full coverage, flawless, smooth, perfect skin.  Makes me look better than before but not made up.</li>
            <li> I am so glad to read other people having issues with this product separating - I thought I was out of my mind!  Revlon CC cream also does the same thing and I called their customer service number to let them know. I guess it&#x27;s all their face products. VERY disappointed. I also cannot get it to mix, no matter how long/hard I shake the tube.</li>
            <li> This BB cream evens skin tone with light coverage. I still have to use a foundation, but I use less of it when I use this BB cream. Use a moisturizer immediately before applying this cream so it spreads easier and so you don&#x27;t have to use as much. I have dry skin and without using a moisturizer, it soaks into my skin right away and I end up using a lot of it. Overall this is a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> bad product I hate it</li>
            <li> Absolutley loved it. Went on nice and smoothe. it covered very well without any mask lines. Very light coverage with no heavy feeling on my face.Would buy again. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t provide much coverage, but nice and light on the skin.</li>
            <li> I previously used Smashbox BB cream but wanted to try a less expensive alternative. This cream provides great coverage at a great cost. It does leave my skin a little oily which is why I am only giving 4 stars. However, I cover it up with Bare Minerals matte powder to combat the oiliness.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for a couple weeks, and it leaves my face oily and the coverage is very light.</li>
            <li> This BB cream is a little too oily for my liking, but it also made my eyes burn for over an hour. I just bought this yesterday, and I&#x27;m more than likely going to return it.</li>
            <li> I am a 40 year old with very fair skin with freckles. Usually my skin runs a bit oily. I do NOT like this product. It feels greasy and seemed to sit in my pores vs make them less noticeable. Not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> This product is really good with different types of skin. It didn&#x27;t dried my skin nor made it oily. Lasts for over 18 hours and protect the skin from the sun :)</li>
            <li> Taking it back. Decided that creams with sunscreen make my face appear very oily. I am 30 with fair skin and freckles. I too like a product that is more of a matte finish. This is not the product for you if that is what you are searching for! Even with a bit of matte bronzer, I couldn&#x27;t keep my face from Shining.</li>
            <li> Really good product.  Fast delivery, too!</li>
            <li> Bought it from local store. It&#x27;s only been 2 weeks, and it had seperated into an unwearable mess! Chunky texture with clear oil pouring out making a mess. Goes on thick but does not correct discoloring well, plus leaves your skin overly oily. DON&#x27;T spend the money. The price may be appealing, but I&#x27;d recommend trying your luck elsewhere. I spent about 10 bucks. It was a bargain before I had to go and purchase another BB cream. This is not a good product.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a better liquid foundation that wouldn&#x27;t smear on my clothes, and this has more than fit the bill. I love that it has sun screen, and the color works perfectly for my skin down. Very satisfied, have been using for months. Have never noticed a weird smell as other reviewers have said.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first, but this product is great for the skin, smooths everything over, creates a nice subtle glow. I am in my late 40&#x27;s, so the wrinkles and the skin need some help nowadays, but I don&#x27;t like the overdone look.</li>
            <li> I have just started using this product after not being able to find the Covergirl BB Cream that I have used for years.  I purchased the light medium and I am very impressed with the texture and the way that it smooths into my skin.  It feels very light and I love that it is SPF 30.  I read somewhere that some people are bothered by the scent; however I cannot detect any scent at all (and I consider myself a pretty good sniffer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that there is a whole \\&quot;US BB Cream vs Asian BB Cream\\&quot; debate.  I have never tried an Asian BB cream, I can only compare this with other US BB Creams and tinted moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this product and will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly, lightly tinted, and looks great! I&#x27;m 65 and get compliments on my skin!!! Even when it&#x27;s off, my skin feels smooth!</li>
            <li> I love this BB cream! Although it doesn&#x27;t cover much, it seems to improve the look of my skin and provide just enough coverage plus sun screen. I am in my early 60&#x27;s now, but when I was young I had the worst complexion and had to use very heavy make-up to cover all my pimples, so it has been a real psychological challenge for me to get used to wearing  something that doesn&#x27;t have that much coverage. This seems to do the trick and the days that I feel like I need more, then I put on a little concealer. I have never had a problem with it separating at all so I don&#x27;t know what these people are talking about. Maybe it is the difference in temperature of our locations or the age of the product they bought. If I were younger I would not like this product because it is a little oily. I just use a translucent powder to set it and it works great!</li>
            <li> I liked it but I felt like there was no real coverage, only color.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product 3 times and each time it has separated badly that I cannot even finish the tube. Shaking it, squeezing it around doesn&#x27;t help - it stays separated and a clear liquid pours out every time I use it. I won&#x27;t be buying it again! I guess if you used it up really quickly it might not matter to you but for me it was really such a waste of money as I was throwing away a lot of the product.</li>
            <li> Light weight coverage with a glow</li>
            <li> I really like the Revlon bob cream and this color and I&#x27;m glad can get it delivered in my mailbox so I&#x27;m not out . thanks</li>
            <li> After using a different BB cream that I really liked (Dr. Jart BB Cream), I was rather disappointed in this one.&lt;br /&gt;1.) It is VERY sheer. I prefer BB creams/foundations that provide a good amount of coverage, whereas this was more like a tinted moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;2.) It tended to make my skin look shiny/greasy. I already have oily skin, so I prefer moisturizers/foundations that have more of a matte effect.&lt;br /&gt;3.) It&#x27;s really bad about separating. I have to vigorously shake it before every use and it still sometimes comes out partially separated and looking like skin-tone cottage cheese.</li>
            <li> This must of been really old product because the ingredients where all separated and even after I shook it when I would squeeze the product out of tube it would just be oil and then the foundation.. Horrible horrible.. Wasn&#x27;t anything like when I got it at the store.. Had to be old!</li>
            <li> I buy it all the time.</li>
            <li> I have been on the search to replace my mineral makeup becausevof concerns I saw on Dr. Oz.  Also,  I travel a lot and got tired of all the brushes and powders.  When I heard of BB creams on Dr. Oz I began the search and I think I finally found to best!  This product matches my skin tone perfectly. Mi have fair skin with blonde hair.  02 light medium is perfect.  Here Is what I like:  smooth and not sticky, covers well, no odor, and matches my skin tone, and my skin seems to glow.</li>
            <li> I love this BB cream. I discovered it in a review on a website of about 20 different BB and CC creams, many of which were $30+ per tube, and decided I would give Revlon (the least expensive one) a try as I find the whole beauty supply scene to be a total racket. My skin felt dewy for lack of a better word. Colleagues and friends all have differing opinions, so I tried several more creams to make a well-researched decision and here&#x27;s what I found: Ponds was too light in color and waxy. Maybelline also came highly recommended and the color was spot on, but it was also dry and waxy. I received a sample of Stila (the super expensive stuff) in a gift bag and found it to be decent, but it didn&#x27;t really provide the blemish coverage I wanted and expected. At the end of the day, though Revlon&#x27;s BB cream is a little darker than my skin tone, it works best on my 44-yr-old skin which used to be extremely oily and is now totally dry.</li>
            <li> I liked this BB cream&#x27;s coverage. I&#x27;ve used other ones, but this one seems to be more, without being heavy feeling, and find I don&#x27;t need to use concealer with it. Very moisturizing also. I do always use a pre moisturizer, I am older and my skin is getting dryer, but a younger person with normal skin, wouldn&#x27;t need to. When shades start with fair, light, etc...I always use light, but this Light/Medium shade works perfectly for my skin color. I will buy it again!</li>
            <li> This foundation is good if you have dry skin because it is very moisturizing. I feel like this is medium coverage between all of my U.s. BB creams and Asian BB creams. This I feel of all the U.s drugstore brand&#x27;s BB cream has the most coverage. The packaging is very sleek and cute. I cannot smell whatever scent people are complaining about. My only problem is the color selection there are only 3 colors; Light,Light Medium, and Medium. I have light medium. I feel like it isn&#x27;t close enough to my skin tone and I have to mix it with other BB creams to fix it. It is strange because normally Revlon is the brand that has the most colors that could work on virtually anyone and the most specialized for skin types.</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a light coverage alternative for spring/summer to my foundation. Highly disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;1) Worst offender - it does not spread. The product just sort of sits on your skin, you really have to rub it in to make it look less obvious. I&#x27;ve tried different tactics: shaking the tube, using sparingly, using liberally, mixing it with my moisturizer, etc. - same result. Another reviewer said it looked like nude cottage cheese, completely on point. Could be because of the SPF.&lt;br /&gt;2) The color is not what I expected; even though I bought the light/medium, it has a strong orange hue.&lt;br /&gt;After playing around for days to make this product work, I ended up mixing moisturizer into my foundation for a much better result. I can&#x27;t believe how terrible this product is! I hate to waste things, but I had to toss it.</li>
