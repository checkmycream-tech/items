            <li>Very quick shipment.</li>
            <li>I did not think the lavender scent would be a strong as it was.</li>
            <li>I returned this item because the lavender was so so strong</li>
            <li>I have ordered several of these over the years - they are always great products.</li>
            <li>I think the gel/plastic ones aren&#x27;t comfortable at all.</li>
            <li>It is also great that I have found such a customer oriented  and caring company in Nature Creation</li>
            <li>I am surprised at how bright it is in my room when I removed the mask in the morning.</li>
            <li>Bean filled and comfortable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it does the job, but it&#x27;s cheaply made and nothing special.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the whole process in purchasing from this company and will absolutely be ordering again.</li>
            <li>it is not overpowering, but just the right amount of scent) allow me to be calm, relax, and fall asleep easily.</li>
            <li>The weight of the filler on my eyes makes me feel more rested in the morning somehow and completely filters the light.</li>

            <li>Not only does it block light, it has a lovely lavender scent.</li>
            <li>the one in the picture was a bright lime green and the one i received was a brown and orange tropical</li>
            <li>I am already convinced of the quality and positive effects of these products.</li>
            <li>so I keep these in the freezer and ready to go.</li>
            <li>It really helps when my eyes are puffy as well.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s always ready.</li>
            <li>fabric was coarse and cheap and hideous-</li>
            <li>highly reccommend thanks</li>
            <li>I get frequent headaches, and these really help...</li>
            <li>Online it looked silk and it was a cheap cotton and not worth the money.</li>
            <li>It was actually a bit too much</li>
            <li>The description led me to believe that it was &amp;#34;cooling&amp;#34; after being in the fridge, but it&#x27;s just like putting any old sleep mask in the fridge, it&#x27;s cold for a moment and then warms up, this doesn&#x27;t have any special qualities that keep it cool like a gel lining or</li>
            <li>I love this eye mask, I have had one for years that my husband got me from Natures Creations and I use if all the time for relaxing, headaches, tired eyes, etc.</li>
            <li>the elastic is already stretched and so it is not a tight hold on my head.  </li>

            <li> I have terrible insomnia.  This mask with the lavender in it just relaxes me beyond belief.  I even travel with it.</li>
            <li> I have ordered several of these over the years - they are always great products. The lavender scent fades within 6 months but the elastic strap and fabric last about a year with daily use. These are the best sleep masks I have been able to find.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these sleeping masks. I know the most popular ones are the gel/plastic masks but I find these work much better. I get occular migraines so I keep these in the freezer and ready to go. You can flip it over when one side starts warming up. It really helps when my eyes are puffy as well. I think the gel/plastic ones aren&#x27;t comfortable at all.</li>
            <li> Lavender patch is excellent. 4stars</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it...both my husband &amp; I are very happy with them.  I get frequent headaches, and these really help...esp. when cold!</li>
            <li> I am already convinced of the quality and positive effects of these products. It is also great that I have found such a customer oriented  and caring company in Nature Creation I am very pleased with the whole process in purchasing from this company and will absolutely be ordering again. From speedy delivery to quality of product I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I love this!!! I can take this out of freezer and put it on and it immediately relieves my headache. I only wish it would stay colder longer. I will order another so I can rotate them in the freezer.</li>
            <li> I love this eye mask, I have had one for years that my husband got me from Natures Creations and I use if all the time for relaxing, headaches, tired eyes, etc. I keep it in the freezer so it&#x27;s always ready.</li>
            <li> I did not think the lavender scent would be a strong as it was. It was actually a bit too much and I had to stop using it.  I do like that you keep in the freezer. The cool weight is nice on my eyes.</li>
            <li> My daughters bought me one of these from a mall.  It wore out and I have been looking for another.  I sleep great with it on,</li>
            <li> I really love this lavender eye mask. I know that it says &amp;#34;cold only&amp;#34; but I microwave it as moist heat is what my eye doctor ordered for dry eyes. The smell is awesome and so relaxing! Nice way to start the day :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was timely as well.</li>
            <li> Great eye mask! the cooling factor and natural lavender scent (I love this scent- it is not overpowering, but just the right amount of scent) allow me to be calm, relax, and fall asleep easily. Does a great job of blocking out light- I am surprised at how bright it is in my room when I removed the mask in the morning. The only downside is that the filling is a little heavy and presses on my eyes- This feels great when I take it right out of the freezer and it is nice and cold, but in the morning it is back to room temperature and just feels heavy on my eyes. I am happy with my purchase and would recommend this to anyone who wants aromatherapy to relax.&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I was lucky and got purple (my favorite color)!  :)</li>
            <li> I love this mask! Not only does it block light, it has a lovely lavender scent. Put it in the freezer during the day, and it will ease headaches, and your eyes will feel better in the morning, and it will soften those bags under your eyes!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I looked everywhere for an eye mask to sleep with. This is perfect! Bean filled and comfortable. It isn&#x27;t all hard like other masks I&#x27;ve seen. We love it!</li>
            <li> I got lavender one I have migraines so I put in freezer and works great really nice smells great highly reccommend thanks</li>
            <li> I returned this item because the lavender was so so strong and it gave me a headache..It was a different material then it looked like online..Online it looked silk and it was a cheap cotton and not worth the money.</li>
            <li> This eye mask is wonderful. The soft scent of lavender and the comfortable fabric makes it perfect for sleep. It feels great when it&#x27;s been chilled in the freezer.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend it though, the seller delivered as promised but this product is not so good.  the elastic is already stretched and so it is not a tight hold on my head.  The mask does feel nice at first during a migraine, but is only cold for about 20 min, that&#x27;s what I kinda expected, but wish someone would make one that is comfortable AND last for at the very least a few hours.</li>
            <li> Smells nice but don&#x27;t sleep with it on. One of the lavender cut my eye</li>
            <li> OMG &#x3D; smells great and works great.  The weight of the filler on my eyes makes me feel more rested in the morning somehow and completely filters the light.</li>
            <li> I loved this eye mask. It helps me relax. Very quick shipment. Will gladly buy more of these. I would reccomended this to anyone</li>
            <li> This is a basic sleep mask. The description led me to believe that it was &amp;#34;cooling&amp;#34; after being in the fridge, but it&#x27;s just like putting any old sleep mask in the fridge, it&#x27;s cold for a moment and then warms up, this doesn&#x27;t have any special qualities that keep it cool like a gel lining or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fabric was coarse and cheap and hideous- the one in the picture was a bright lime green and the one i received was a brown and orange tropical print.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it does the job, but it&#x27;s cheaply made and nothing special.</li>
