            <li> and I&#x27;ve seen slight changes every time I order a new supply.</li>
            <li> I have long hair.  </li>
            <li> I am not entirely certain what is inside the bottle is what the packaging says on the outside.  </li>
            <li> I will not go back to using other brands.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling too dry.</li>
            <li> You only use a small amount and need to shampoo only once.............</li>
            <li> Just add a little water if it doesn&#x27;t feel like its sudsing up enough.</li>
            <li> There are definitely other products out there for less money which provide similar results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product from salons before and it smelled differently and wasn&#x27;t nearly as harsh on my hair as this is.  </li>
            <li> The book was ruined and the shampoo bottle was not full.</li>
            <li> A little suspicious OR the manufacturer has changed the formula.</li>
            <li> It is a waste of money at this point.</li>
            <li> It arrived with a narrow band that that opened and leaked all over the book.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel heavy.</li>
            <li> Smells like an old man wearing really bad aftershave</li>
            <li> The product is very expensive and seemed to give my hair less volume.  </li>
            <li> I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product.</li>

            <li> The smell is horrible! And I thought the shampoo didn&#x27;t have sulfate in it, but it does. I was very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Total cleansing yet leaves your hair soft and manageable, almost like you had used conditioner! Smells great, and lasts a long time.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pureology products for years and I&#x27;ve seen slight changes every time I order a new supply. They&#x27;ve changed the formula to something unrecognizable.  This last iteration makes my hair feel like hay when I&#x27;m washing it. It is a waste of money at this point. I have to find something else soon. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> The product is very expensive and seemed to give my hair less volume.  There are definitely other products out there for less money which provide similar results.</li>
            <li> The shampoo was not properly packaged for shipping. It arrived with a narrow band that that opened and leaked all over the book. The book was ruined and the shampoo bottle was not full.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It performs perfectly as stated on the bottle.</li>
            <li> Smells like an old man wearing really bad aftershave</li>
            <li> Excellent product for fine hair. I am a return buyer and like the ease of buying through amazon.</li>
            <li> Purology is a great product.  I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive. Fortunately, one only needs about a dime size of it to wash short hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m able to buy this at a cheaper price than at the salon. I found that this product works identical to the ones I&#x27;ve purchased locally and that it smells the same. This shampoo makes my hair smell good, increases shininess, and provides some additional volume.</li>
            <li> Just like store bought shampoos. Nothing special for the price</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling too dry.</li>
            <li> Same great quality as usual and expected.</li>
            <li> I love Pureology and was super happy to find what I needed on Amazon. It arrived fast, and was every bit of what I wanted. My hair loves it!!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo.  I have long hair.  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel heavy. Just add a little water if it doesn&#x27;t feel like its sudsing up enough.</li>
