            <li> great product.  You only need a drop and it makes a huge difference in hair that is dry due to hair color.</li>
            <li> Product is great!  Really works to help smooth the frizz, even in between shampoos.</li>
            <li> Works as described! Made hair soft an gave lots of shine. Haven&#x27;t used a product from this line that didn&#x27;t work. Will reorder again.</li>
            <li> I use only Pureology products, as I color my hair, and my stylist used this on me. I loved the feel, so I bought my own. I also bought it for my granddaughter, who has thick, wavy hair that tends to get a little bushy when it is humid. She also loved it. Don&#x27;t believe those ads on TV that say things are &amp;#34;equivalent to Pureology&amp;#34; because they are not. It is the best.</li>
            <li> A little goes A LONG way.  This product doesn&#x27;t do as well as I thought.  I seem to use too much or not enough, I haven&#x27;t seemed to get an idea yet of how much works best for my hair.</li>
            <li> It worked great.  I really liked how my hair felt soft and looked really shiny and healthy.  Would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Another product from the Pureology line that works great for my very dry, curly hair. Well worth the price. I would purchase this again</li>
            <li> Works great; nice smell, too.  Wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey.  Still, this was the cheapest place I could find it after WEEKS of checking various online and brick-and-mortar stores.  If you love Pureology, this is the place to get it.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  It adds hydration and shine to my hair without being oily!</li>
            <li> Very good product. Use a little on damp hair. This size bottle is much better than the smaller size which runs out quickly.</li>
            <li> I love Pureology products and was super excited to buy this at such a great price - it&#x27;s completely transformative to your hair. Sadly, when I recieved the product, it was cracked and had leaked everywhere despite the more than sufficient packaging material from London Mannor Beauty. I emailed the seller to let them know what happened. Not only did they send me a completely brand new bottle, they also included a ton of awesome sample products to try. The samples are amazing and now I want full-size products of each sample I tried! My skin is super sensitive and breaks out at most all products I&#x27;ve tried. Not this stuff, it&#x27;s incredible. Thank you London Mannor Beauty! Your customer service is wonderful and your free samples have changed my life!</li>
            <li> Thank you for sending the correct product. This is one of my favorite Pureology products - I love this brand.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the texture this gives my hair.  It smooths it but makes it look like oiled straw.</li>
            <li> I like that it smooths my split ends but it is easy to use to much and then my hair falls flat.  Working on finding a balance so I don&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;have to wash my hair my often.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair shinny and my color darker.</li>
            <li> This is not quite the same as the other &amp;#34;shiners&amp;#34;. It is a very fine smoothing oil. A little goes a long way. It doesn&#x27;t seem oily.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this product. I use one semi-squirt after blow drying. It keeps my thin hair looking shiny and in place. Not overly greasy if you use the right amount.</li>
            <li> Been using for 5 years. Have long heavy hair, I use this in conjunction with another product,  either Puerology Color Safe Spray,  or DHC Hair Milk,  You don&#x27;t need much.  Put it on wet hair - leaves it smooth and shining.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!  Makes hair shine and it feels like silk!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This styling smoother is really great, just like all Pureology products.  It is very easy to use and makes styling much easier.  The shine is great.</li>
            <li> Again great product and price!  I will be buying from them again!!!</li>
            <li> Love all the products.</li>
            <li> Really nice. Smooths hair but isn&#x27;t too heavy.</li>
