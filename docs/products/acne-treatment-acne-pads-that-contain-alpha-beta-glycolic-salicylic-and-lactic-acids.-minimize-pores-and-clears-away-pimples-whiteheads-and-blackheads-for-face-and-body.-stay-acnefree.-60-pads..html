            <li>This worked great to make my skin smooth as silk.</li>
            <li>I was ASTOUNDED at how amazing this worked.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Buy at your own risk.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really effective.</li>
            <li>Honestly I do recommend this product to everyone out there.</li>

            <li>It has absolutely the best features and blends in to my skin most of the time.</li>
            <li>to be honest i have mild acne, the acne that is under the skin and some blackhead, and i did not think this product worked well!!</li>
            <li>I found the BEST product ever which is Neutrogen Rapid Clear Stubborn Acne.</li>
            <li>One of the best products I have seen so far.</li>
            <li>Anything free is good right?I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>After using Best New Acne Treatment my face just kept getting better and better.  </li>
            <li>My face is not worst, i would rather keep washing my face with dettol.</li>
            <li>no matter how many products I tried.  </li>
            <li>I found most treatments to be drying to my skin.</li>
            <li>Caused more breakout didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>Wondering why there are so many glowing reviews of this product?  </li>
            <li>Glycerin is problematic for many acne prones and this contains glycerin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had acne on and off throughout my life, and found most treatments to be too damaging and drying to my skin.  </li>
            <li>Also, its not a funky smelling treatment like many of those creams that are out there, its a soothing scent associated with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaper and works a lot better.</li>
            <li>My acne is now almost all cleared up and just on time for the summer :)</li>
            <li>My back and my face have many pustules !!!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why so many people this</li>
            <li>but i am shopping around more to find a product that will get rid of everything.</li>
            <li>Just a cleanser combined with benzoyl peroxide works better.</li>
            <li>Triad a lot of creams and face masks, but this proved to be much better for me.</li>
            <li>I love this item because it doesn&#x27;t have an itchy feel after using it.</li>
            <li>It works way better than those over the counter products I&#x27;ve been buying for years</li>
            <li>glad I came across it .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had acne on and off throughout my life, and found most treatments to be too damaging and drying to my skin.</li>
            <li>Ok so I am giving ti two starts.  </li>
            <li>She has used it and is more confident than ever.</li>
            <li>Great product, it really helps me.</li>
            <li>When it seemed like things got better</li>
            <li>I am literally enjoying my refreshed and clearer skin than never before.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that my acne is gone.</li>
            <li>, I have noticed quite improvement, really I feel more secure with myself and very happy for the incredible results, I recommend this product widely.</li>
            <li>His face looks great and his skin is clear.  </li>
            <li>A very effective product which help me clear out my acne marks.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t buy nothing else other than this awesome product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;+Does not work well in shower as medicine is easily rinsed out of pad.</li>
            <li>Bought this for myself when my acne had started to get out of control, it&#x27;s almost entirely cleared up my skin could not recommend more, so inexpensive for how great it worked.</li>
            <li>Since it is a strong product, I use it three days a week.</li>
            <li>The materials used for making the cream have no ill effects for the skin and works amazingly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m  huge fan of these pads.</li>
            <li>Great acne treatment for my teenage son who prefers to use just one or two products.</li>
            <li>I honestly feel like my skin is much cleaner when I use these scrubs.</li>
            <li>I believe maybe the reviews were written by people who got it for free.</li>
            <li>I have loved it completely.</li>
            <li>The pads are super small, so I am sure they work awesome</li>
            <li>Still as an adult who has the occasional breakout, his is perfect for keeping my skin clean and acne free.  </li>
            <li>so i decided to get him acne treatment as it was getting on my nerves that he could not keep his face clean.</li>
            <li>After washing my face clean and using these pads, you can see a difference in two days.</li>
            <li>Cleared his skin up right away!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t stave off new breakouts super effectively</li>
            <li>it really helped my skin look better.  </li>
            <li>I still have a good amount of wipes left</li>
            <li>So my wife and I have been searching around for an EXTREMELY good acne product for our teen</li>
            <li>After a few weeks of him applying i can easily tell the difference and this was a great buy</li>
            <li>i tried most of their products and they all really works fast!!</li>
            <li>A lot of products just don&#x27;t work, and sometimes the products are used way too quickly..</li>
            <li>It has immediate and quick effects.</li>
            <li>Have used many many different types of wipes, including prescription antibiotic ones.</li>
            <li>This is working for my son&#x27;s mild acne.</li>
            <li>He has been using the pads morning and night and it is working on his mild acne.</li>
            <li>i received the product so quickly.</li>
            <li>I like the quick results</li>
            <li>This is a must-have product for mild acne sufferers.</li>
            <li>and you can just clean right there on the go without worrying about trying to find a sink.  </li>
            <li>After I use it I feel clean, and dirt is removed very well!</li>
            <li>Not for no secret that when you&#x27;re in high school, one of the most important things is your looks, and we all want to be attractive to others and be &#x27;&#x27; cool &#x27;&#x27; and one of the things that prevents this is acne because it is not very attractive to say ...</li>
            <li>it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>Not at all worth the money.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because the name and the packaging made me laugh, and I needed acne treatment.</li>
            <li>My skin feels fresh and my zits and blackheads have dissapeared.</li>
            <li>This is a convenient and economical way for treating acne at home or on the go.</li>
            <li>am now using the facial cleaning pads from Trader Joe&#x27;s, they contain organic extracts of tea tree oil, calendula, chamomile, witch hazel among other wonderful ingredients!</li>
            <li>, this cream not only serves great for acne on the face, but for that pesky acne that appears in the chest and back, a great treatment if you follow it correctly I promise to solve your acne, of course you have to constantly keep personal hygiene and not descuidarce in food.</li>
            <li>So and this stuff absolutely great in use easy and fest, and the main thing you can see a result after two days using it at least twice a day, when I was my face in the morning, and showering after work!</li>
            <li>i recommend buying their facial wash cleanser with 5 % benzoyl peroxide its better and worth the price that u can see and feel how clean and soft ur skin is.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin, and this has really helped me!</li>
            <li>I love going out in public again.  </li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this product!</li>
            <li>But otherwise go for a higher quality pad like the Peter Thomas Roth pads.  </li>
            <li>The rest of the ingredients are stellar.</li>
            <li>/&gt;+Stung the first time I used it</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this product!</li>
            <li>This just made me feel kind of rough.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well for my daughter.  </li>
            <li>Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li>The first day I got the pad in my eyes and it stung quite a bit, but it went away soon.</li>
            <li>Thanks guys....for your help!</li>
            <li>At first he was put off by the smell ( all acne medications smell).</li>
            <li>I tried so many over the counter products and came up short .As</li>
            <li>A really good product which removes all the dead cells and acne from the face.</li>
            <li>She said it was good, it did seem to help, but it did not clear it up completely.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, it was worth the $35 because it works and it will be enough for 60 days!</li>
            <li>Good if you have a really really small face.</li>
            <li>Now after using this beauty cream, I found identifiable results and now I’m happy with no more tension.</li>
            <li>I have acne on my skin since i was teenager, and have tried a lot of products even medicament, but nothing helped me so quickly and completely as this acne treatment.</li>
            <li>However, when I tried this product, my whole life changed.  </li>
            <li>This is because I have the problem of using too much of a lotion, but with this product and the treatment being part of a pad I no longer have that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>how much you use&lt;</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product, as it truly works!</li>
            <li>If you hope to keep your skin looking young and fresh then this is the product for you.</li>
            <li>This product is really amazing!&lt;br /&gt;After using these acne pads for 2 months</li>
            <li>worked very well for my boy.</li>
            <li>and after buying so many failed products I can&#x27;t believe that we have finally found an EXTREMELY GREAT acne treatment for our daughter.</li>
            <li>This did absolutely nothing to help with my daughters acne.  </li>
            <li>It really does work</li>
            <li>These acne pads help me so much.</li>
            <li>This product is very useful for my teenage kids with acne</li>
            <li>This stuff has worked better than any other alternatives, acne started clearing up in a couple days.</li>
            <li>It remains for the treatment of acne and is always clean from the outside environment.</li>
            <li>but you will need to use 2 or 3 at a time to clean your entire face therefore</li>
            <li>My sensitive skin didn&#x27;t react to it when I first use this item.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my teenage son who has mild acne.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend them 5stars.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I use the face wash and the face wash is just like clean and clear does the same effect.</li>
            <li>Really helped clear my skin up and prevent breakouts.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s preventing new pimples from coming.</li>
            <li>It is like i have a new skin all over my body</li>
            <li>I was born with eczema and have been prone to acne since birth; however, once I started using this, I noticed an immediate difference and my face has been clear ever since!</li>
            <li>but there&#x27;s actually an exfoliating scrub my whole family can use!</li>
            <li>This a great product that can be used everyday with very little irritation.</li>
            <li>This acne treatment is far above the other ones and it&#x27;s also more convenient because you can take it anywhere</li>
            <li>I was super excited to get this due to other reviews.</li>
            <li>Ok, so I&#x27;ve tried tons of acne products and various pads through the past couple years and these are easily the lowest quality while being the most expensive.  </li>
            <li>As a person with sensitive skin and adult acne at 63, what a relief to find a product that doesn&#x27;t sting!</li>
            <li>You would think the company would pay a little more to have someone write some actual quality reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I never thought I would have clear skin again.</li>
            <li>This is clearly a scam, which I didn&#x27;t realize until after I bought it.  </li>
            <li>I have been struggling with stubborn adult acne.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by its effectiveness, this has got rid of my acne and completely changed the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 22 years old guy, working on construction on that time, carpentry, you know all that dust and dirt.</li>
            <li>from a young age I suffered from acne, which made me feel</li>
            <li>Now with that being said I haven&#x27;t really notice any changes for better or worse.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes based on the reviews...feels like I must&#x27;ve gotten a different product than everyone else.</li>
            <li>I think it worked a little bit better than all of the other products my son tried but not enough for me to justify paying so much.</li>
            <li>It has left my skin feeling not only clean, but didn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling not only clean, but didn&#x27;t completely dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling not only clean, but didn&#x27;t completely dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks to this wonderful product, I could eradicate this annoying problem!</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s been using this product every night before going to bed for the last 3 weeks and has almost cleared up his face completely!</li>
            <li>and one week later, my face is clear.</li>
            <li>may be in future my skin clear from all acne.</li>
            <li>I am a 22 year old female.</li>
            <li>I got this for my 14 year old daughter for her back acne.</li>
            <li>no regrets.</li>
            <li>As far the seller goes, the return was prompt and I had no issues with delivery and such.</li>
            <li>Somehow, I missed it when I scanned the ingredients and more poor kiddo was breaking out like crazy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(usually dries out with most other acne products)</li>
            <li>This was much better than any other treatment I&#x27;ve tried in the past</li>
            <li>It is no different than any other acne wipe, but at a much higher price.  </li>
            <li>From my sisters with sensitive skin to my mother with aging lines, even my father uses it to clear his dry sin!</li>
            <li>Well, even that was a challenge for this boy,  but apparently using it 2 or 3 times a week was enough!  </li>
            <li>Acne is one of the most difficult problem of young (and not only) people.</li>
            <li>But this is now my everyday go to acne treatment, cleared up my skin fast without drying it out!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem harsh on my skin, and it&#x27;s pretty convenient.</li>
            <li>I was extremely hopeful based on the reviews and very excited to try it, but unfortunately after using it, my skin did not improve, my breakouts did not diminish or either show the faintest hope of healing, and I was very unsatisfied.</li>
            <li>My skin has had some blemishes due to the weather but these have helped completely !!</li>
            <li>I know this to pads acne but not long ago I was totally convinced.</li>
            <li>My daughter who is 14 yrs old has been a victim of acne skin for the last one year.</li>

            <li> I was ASTOUNDED at how amazing this worked.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Buy at your own risk.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really effective.</li>
            <li> Honestly I do recommend this product to everyone out there.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment and great product!</li>
            <li> It is an excellent product, easy to use and very practical, really I recommend it very effective, since I&#x27;m using there has been an incredible change.</li>
            <li> It has absolutely the best features and blends in to my skin most of the time.</li>
            <li> to be honest i have mild acne, the acne that is under the skin and some blackhead, and i did not think this product worked well!!</li>
            <li> I found the BEST product ever which is Neutrogen Rapid Clear Stubborn Acne.</li>
            <li> One of the best products I have seen so far.</li>
            <li> Anything free is good right?I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After using Best New Acne Treatment my face just kept getting better and better.  </li>
            <li> My face is not worst, i would rather keep washing my face with dettol.</li>
            <li> no matter how many products I tried.  </li>
            <li> I found most treatments to be drying to my skin.</li>
            <li> Caused more breakout didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Wondering why there are so many glowing reviews of this product?  </li>
            <li> Glycerin is problematic for many acne prones and this contains glycerin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne on and off throughout my life, and found most treatments to be too damaging and drying to my skin.  </li>
            <li> Also, its not a funky smelling treatment like many of those creams that are out there, its a soothing scent associated with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper and works a lot better.</li>
            <li> My acne is now almost all cleared up and just on time for the summer :)</li>
            <li> My back and my face have many pustules !!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why so many people this</li>
            <li> but i am shopping around more to find a product that will get rid of everything.</li>
            <li> Just a cleanser combined with benzoyl peroxide works better.</li>
            <li> Triad a lot of creams and face masks, but this proved to be much better for me.</li>
            <li> I love this item because it doesn&#x27;t have an itchy feel after using it.</li>
            <li> It works way better than those over the counter products I&#x27;ve been buying for years</li>
            <li> glad I came across it .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne on and off throughout my life, and found most treatments to be too damaging and drying to my skin.</li>
            <li> Ok so I am giving ti two starts.  </li>
            <li> She has used it and is more confident than ever.</li>
            <li> Great product, it really helps me.</li>
            <li> When it seemed like things got better</li>
            <li> I am literally enjoying my refreshed and clearer skin than never before.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that my acne is gone.</li>
            <li> , I have noticed quite improvement, really I feel more secure with myself and very happy for the incredible results, I recommend this product widely.</li>
            <li> His face looks great and his skin is clear.  </li>
            <li> A very effective product which help me clear out my acne marks.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy nothing else other than this awesome product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;+Does not work well in shower as medicine is easily rinsed out of pad.</li>
            <li> Bought this for myself when my acne had started to get out of control, it&#x27;s almost entirely cleared up my skin could not recommend more, so inexpensive for how great it worked.</li>
            <li> Since it is a strong product, I use it three days a week.</li>
            <li> The materials used for making the cream have no ill effects for the skin and works amazingly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m  huge fan of these pads.</li>
            <li> Great acne treatment for my teenage son who prefers to use just one or two products.</li>
            <li> I honestly feel like my skin is much cleaner when I use these scrubs.</li>
            <li> I believe maybe the reviews were written by people who got it for free.</li>
            <li> I have loved it completely.</li>
            <li> The pads are super small, so I am sure they work awesome</li>
            <li> Still as an adult who has the occasional breakout, his is perfect for keeping my skin clean and acne free.  </li>
            <li> so i decided to get him acne treatment as it was getting on my nerves that he could not keep his face clean.</li>
            <li> After washing my face clean and using these pads, you can see a difference in two days.</li>
            <li> Cleared his skin up right away!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stave off new breakouts super effectively</li>
            <li> it really helped my skin look better.  </li>
            <li> I still have a good amount of wipes left</li>
            <li> So my wife and I have been searching around for an EXTREMELY good acne product for our teen</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of him applying i can easily tell the difference and this was a great buy</li>
            <li> i tried most of their products and they all really works fast!!</li>
            <li> A lot of products just don&#x27;t work, and sometimes the products are used way too quickly..</li>
            <li> It has immediate and quick effects.</li>
            <li> Have used many many different types of wipes, including prescription antibiotic ones.</li>
            <li> This is working for my son&#x27;s mild acne.</li>
            <li> He has been using the pads morning and night and it is working on his mild acne.</li>
            <li> i received the product so quickly.</li>
            <li> I like the quick results</li>
            <li> This is a must-have product for mild acne sufferers.</li>
            <li> and you can just clean right there on the go without worrying about trying to find a sink.  </li>
            <li> After I use it I feel clean, and dirt is removed very well!</li>
            <li> Not for no secret that when you&#x27;re in high school, one of the most important things is your looks, and we all want to be attractive to others and be &#x27;&#x27; cool &#x27;&#x27; and one of the things that prevents this is acne because it is not very attractive to say ...</li>
            <li> it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> Not at all worth the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because the name and the packaging made me laugh, and I needed acne treatment.</li>
            <li> My skin feels fresh and my zits and blackheads have dissapeared.</li>
            <li> This is a convenient and economical way for treating acne at home or on the go.</li>
            <li> am now using the facial cleaning pads from Trader Joe&#x27;s, they contain organic extracts of tea tree oil, calendula, chamomile, witch hazel among other wonderful ingredients!</li>
            <li> , this cream not only serves great for acne on the face, but for that pesky acne that appears in the chest and back, a great treatment if you follow it correctly I promise to solve your acne, of course you have to constantly keep personal hygiene and not descuidarce in food.</li>
            <li> So and this stuff absolutely great in use easy and fest, and the main thing you can see a result after two days using it at least twice a day, when I was my face in the morning, and showering after work!</li>
            <li> i recommend buying their facial wash cleanser with 5 % benzoyl peroxide its better and worth the price that u can see and feel how clean and soft ur skin is.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, and this has really helped me!</li>
            <li> I love going out in public again.  </li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> But otherwise go for a higher quality pad like the Peter Thomas Roth pads.  </li>
            <li> The rest of the ingredients are stellar.</li>
            <li> /&gt;+Stung the first time I used it</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This just made me feel kind of rough.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well for my daughter.  </li>
            <li> Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li> The first day I got the pad in my eyes and it stung quite a bit, but it went away soon.</li>
            <li> Thanks guys....for your help!</li>
            <li> At first he was put off by the smell ( all acne medications smell).</li>
            <li> I tried so many over the counter products and came up short .As</li>
            <li> A really good product which removes all the dead cells and acne from the face.</li>
            <li> She said it was good, it did seem to help, but it did not clear it up completely.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, it was worth the $35 because it works and it will be enough for 60 days!</li>
            <li> Good if you have a really really small face.</li>
            <li> Now after using this beauty cream, I found identifiable results and now I’m happy with no more tension.</li>
            <li> I have acne on my skin since i was teenager, and have tried a lot of products even medicament, but nothing helped me so quickly and completely as this acne treatment.</li>
            <li> However, when I tried this product, my whole life changed.  </li>
            <li> This is because I have the problem of using too much of a lotion, but with this product and the treatment being part of a pad I no longer have that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> how much you use&lt;</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product, as it truly works!</li>
            <li> If you hope to keep your skin looking young and fresh then this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> This product is really amazing!&lt;br /&gt;After using these acne pads for 2 months</li>
            <li> worked very well for my boy.</li>
            <li> and after buying so many failed products I can&#x27;t believe that we have finally found an EXTREMELY GREAT acne treatment for our daughter.</li>
            <li> This did absolutely nothing to help with my daughters acne.  </li>
            <li> It really does work</li>
            <li> These acne pads help me so much.</li>
            <li> This product is very useful for my teenage kids with acne</li>
            <li> This stuff has worked better than any other alternatives, acne started clearing up in a couple days.</li>
            <li> It remains for the treatment of acne and is always clean from the outside environment.</li>
            <li> but you will need to use 2 or 3 at a time to clean your entire face therefore</li>
            <li> My sensitive skin didn&#x27;t react to it when I first use this item.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage son who has mild acne.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend them 5stars.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I use the face wash and the face wash is just like clean and clear does the same effect.</li>
            <li> Really helped clear my skin up and prevent breakouts.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s preventing new pimples from coming.</li>
            <li> It is like i have a new skin all over my body</li>
            <li> I was born with eczema and have been prone to acne since birth; however, once I started using this, I noticed an immediate difference and my face has been clear ever since!</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s actually an exfoliating scrub my whole family can use!</li>
            <li> This a great product that can be used everyday with very little irritation.</li>
            <li> This acne treatment is far above the other ones and it&#x27;s also more convenient because you can take it anywhere</li>
            <li> I was super excited to get this due to other reviews.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I&#x27;ve tried tons of acne products and various pads through the past couple years and these are easily the lowest quality while being the most expensive.  </li>
            <li> As a person with sensitive skin and adult acne at 63, what a relief to find a product that doesn&#x27;t sting!</li>
            <li> You would think the company would pay a little more to have someone write some actual quality reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I never thought I would have clear skin again.</li>
            <li> This is clearly a scam, which I didn&#x27;t realize until after I bought it.  </li>
            <li> I have been struggling with stubborn adult acne.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by its effectiveness, this has got rid of my acne and completely changed the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 22 years old guy, working on construction on that time, carpentry, you know all that dust and dirt.</li>
            <li> from a young age I suffered from acne, which made me feel</li>
            <li> Now with that being said I haven&#x27;t really notice any changes for better or worse.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes based on the reviews...feels like I must&#x27;ve gotten a different product than everyone else.</li>
            <li> I think it worked a little bit better than all of the other products my son tried but not enough for me to justify paying so much.</li>
            <li> It has left my skin feeling not only clean, but didn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling not only clean, but didn&#x27;t completely dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling not only clean, but didn&#x27;t completely dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> Thanks to this wonderful product, I could eradicate this annoying problem!</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been using this product every night before going to bed for the last 3 weeks and has almost cleared up his face completely!</li>
            <li> and one week later, my face is clear.</li>
            <li> may be in future my skin clear from all acne.</li>
            <li> I am a 22 year old female.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 14 year old daughter for her back acne.</li>
            <li> no regrets.</li>
            <li> As far the seller goes, the return was prompt and I had no issues with delivery and such.</li>
            <li> Somehow, I missed it when I scanned the ingredients and more poor kiddo was breaking out like crazy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (usually dries out with most other acne products)</li>
            <li> This was much better than any other treatment I&#x27;ve tried in the past</li>
            <li> It is no different than any other acne wipe, but at a much higher price.  </li>
            <li> From my sisters with sensitive skin to my mother with aging lines, even my father uses it to clear his dry sin!</li>
            <li> Well, even that was a challenge for this boy,  but apparently using it 2 or 3 times a week was enough!  </li>
            <li> Acne is one of the most difficult problem of young (and not only) people.</li>
            <li> But this is now my everyday go to acne treatment, cleared up my skin fast without drying it out!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem harsh on my skin, and it&#x27;s pretty convenient.</li>
            <li> I was extremely hopeful based on the reviews and very excited to try it, but unfortunately after using it, my skin did not improve, my breakouts did not diminish or either show the faintest hope of healing, and I was very unsatisfied.</li>
            <li> My skin has had some blemishes due to the weather but these have helped completely !!</li>
            <li> I know this to pads acne but not long ago I was totally convinced.</li>
            <li> My daughter who is 14 yrs old has been a victim of acne skin for the last one year.</li>
            <li> This cream managed to clear acne and other spots on my face within a week.</li>
            <li> I have had trouble with minor acne my whole life.</li>
            <li> I used to terrible acne, this product greatly helped me to have a clear face.</li>
            <li> The skin is not left fully dry by the product too.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this product didn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and my skin hasn&#x27;t dried out either.</li>
            <li> I have been suffering from acne for a long time now and to find out these pads</li>
            <li> Even Proactive could not clear my skin.  </li>
            <li> And my opinion is that &amp;#34;THIS IS IT&amp;#34;.. Its works amazingly...Pimples get dried up quickly .. and you can hardly see marks..</li>
            <li> I am very pale and have sensitive skin with a red undertone.</li>
            <li> It is moderately priced but compared to other products I buy in stores</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only does it get rid of their acne, but it also makes their skin look healthier and cleans all the other impurities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ProActiv Plus and several other over the counter acne washes and treatments.</li>
            <li> Since my teen I had bad acne on my face and used many products, but no results found.</li>
            <li> they were almost dry.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out face or make you peel.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this pads make my face like an alergic reaction, as soon as I clean my face with them, it starts to swell like</li>
            <li> , I no longer get my monthly breakouts around &amp;#34;that time&amp;#34; and yet, I don&#x27;t get too dry either.</li>
            <li> These are truly nothing special, and way too expensive.</li>
            <li> I have been a  sufferer of acne since teenage days and literally tried upon tried everything right from home treatments to expensive gels which cost you a fortune..</li>
            <li> I once was a victim of acne.  </li>
            <li> I spent $35 dollars for this.</li>
            <li> Also the pads were not very moist</li>
            <li> My son is one of those kids who forgets on a daily basis, so when we tried other treatments you had to use them everyday.</li>
            <li> thinking that it is a product amongst other will serve me for nothing, but I try and</li>
            <li> It was just the same as usual and can&#x27;t remove make up.</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but my son is willing to use this and it works.</li>
            <li> Some of my previous experiences with acne pads have left me disappointed with the results, however I was pleasantly surprised to have finally found such a quality product in this one.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> I was a little wary at first since I&#x27;ve never heard of this brand before, but after a friend recommended it, I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 40&#x27;s, with small pimples always hard to remove.</li>
            <li> I my skin was problematic all the time if it&#x27;s not a pimples than dark spots all over.</li>
            <li> It was hard to rid of white and black heads</li>
            <li> The pads are absurdly thin and half dried out in a brand new container.  </li>
            <li> Like a typical teenager, he can&#x27;t be bothered with washing his face for any length of time...</li>
            <li> Also, his face hasn&#x27;t dried out, as it did with other products!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much less harsh and drying than drugstore face pads and astringents.</li>
            <li> Not a miracle though and just a little costly...</li>
            <li> It even reduced my dark marks and acne scarring!</li>
            <li> Half of these reviews have sentences with completely broken English.  </li>
            <li> Clearasil is a bull sh$t in instruction that saying you need to wash your face at least 4 tims a day with it, what is not really work for me.</li>
            <li> I have been dealing with acne for a few years now.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time</li>
            <li> I have always had trouble with acne problems in my face and skin and since I have tried this it has cleared up.</li>
            <li> Four months down the line, the hormonal acne and the blackheads are no more.</li>
            <li> my skin is completely clear, I&#x27;m no longer afraid to leave my house without foundation</li>
            <li> Not sure if it worked...</li>
            <li> Use this also use the cucumber witch hazel from here in a small spray bottle to rotate and keep the oils at bay</li>
            <li> I was upset that I paid almost $40 and the jar is so small ,</li>
            <li> The pads themselves feel extremely rough on the skin, painful as I use them, especially for someone with</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to explain.</li>
            <li> This is hard to believe this</li>
            <li> She had a hard time remembering or caring to wash her face.</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter as she had really bad acne, cleared it up completely in about 2 weeks</li>
            <li> Acne sucks..</li>
            <li> When he saw that the pad was dirty and not white after using it on his face, something clicked.</li>
            <li> No more breakouts!</li>
            <li> Because of the results &amp; cost I am going to try something else less expensive.</li>
            <li> I was somewhat skeptical when ordering this for him as it is a little pricey, but they do offer a 100% guarantee, so you can return if it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It is bad enough that my skin is already oily.</li>
            <li> I started getting bad acne after going to the gym regularly</li>
            <li> I had bad acne as a teen and wish this had been around then.  </li>
            <li> the value for the price is not good.  </li>
            <li> The smell is unpleasant, and it leaves the skin with a strange sticky residue, not pleasant at all.</li>
            <li> I was too dumb to believe in this online fruad.</li>
            <li> it has a smell to it and it seemed like it made my acne worse.</li>

            <li> No cause uncomfortable feeling when used.</li>
            <li> Affiliate marketers are paying for fake reviews of this product.</li>
            <li> Blindly 5 stars</li>
            <li> I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> Very expensive but sadly has no effect on my pimples.</li>
            <li> I had these nasty blackheads by my lips that went away after using this for about a week and a half.</li>

            <li> Got this for my daughter as she had really bad acne, cleared it up completely in about 2 weeks</li>
            <li> Great health priduct. Helps with acne</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help my daughter&#x27;s skin! Way overpriced.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, and this has really helped me!</li>
            <li> Great acne product. Really helped clear my skin up and prevent breakouts. I experienced no side affects which is a plus!</li>
            <li> Seems to help! Not a miracle though and just a little costly... I have been struggling with stubborn adult acne.</li>
            <li> I was too dumb to believe in this online fruad. It didn&#x27;t work at all. what happens after pasting this s*** on your face is, you feel like you used lemon on your face. nothing else.. no changes, pimples keep coming on my face. My face is not worst, i would rather keep washing my face with dettol. I can&#x27;t believe i am this stupid. I spent $35 dollars for this.</li>
            <li> This cream managed to clear acne and other spots on my face within a week. I just applied it onto the damaged areas before sleeping and it worked a charm. Would recommend to anyone looking for a solution to skin issues.</li>
            <li> I once was a victim of acne.  It seemed as if it would never go away...no matter how many products I tried.  Even Proactive could not clear my skin.  However, when I tried this product, my whole life changed.  Within a week I could see improvement in my face.  Now, I am acne-free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m  huge fan of these pads. They are very effective in treating blemishes and removing blackheads. I use this treatment every night after I wash my face when my face has a breakout, and it is very effective in clearing up my skin.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would have clear skin again. After using Best New Acne Treatment my face just kept getting better and better.  I love going out in public again.  Thank you for making me feel like a model.</li>
            <li> I used to terrible acne, this product greatly helped me to have a clear face. 4 stars!</li>
            <li> All of acne gone! really amazing treatment.I found most treatments to be drying to my skin. It has left my skin feeling not only clean, but didn&#x27;t dry out my skin. I would absolutely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Caused more breakout didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Not sure if it worked...</li>
            <li> Ok, so I&#x27;ve tried tons of acne products and various pads through the past couple years and these are easily the lowest quality while being the most expensive.  The pads are absurdly thin and half dried out in a brand new container.  Wondering why there are so many glowing reviews of this product?  READ SOME OF THEM.  Half of these reviews have sentences with completely broken English.  You would think the company would pay a little more to have someone write some actual quality reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy at your own risk.  If you want to believe the reviews, go ahead.  But otherwise go for a higher quality pad like the Peter Thomas Roth pads.  I know... it&#x27;s PTR... but it&#x27;s still cheaper than these.</li>
            <li> I think it worked a little bit better than all of the other products my son tried but not enough for me to justify paying so much. Just too pricey</li>
            <li> Glycerin is problematic for many acne prones and this contains glycerin. Somehow, I missed it when I scanned the ingredients and more poor kiddo was breaking out like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;MOM, THESE THINGS YOU GOT ME HAVE GLYCERIN IN THEM NO WONDER I&#x27;M BREAKING OUT&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oops! The rest of the ingredients are stellar. I hope they&#x27;ll consider reformulating to remove the glycerin.</li>
            <li> This product did nothing to help with acne or anything else. Also the pads were not very moist they were almost dry. I would not buy this again!</li>
            <li> Acne sucks.. Having self confidence problems, getting weird stares at those skin flaws, and just feeling unattractive.. A lot of products just don&#x27;t work, and sometimes the products are used way too quickly.. This is because I have the problem of using too much of a lotion, but with this product and the treatment being part of a pad I no longer have that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This treatment is also good as a surface cleaner. After I use it I feel clean, and dirt is removed very well! This just shows how this is good both at cleaning out the pores and medicating your skin, as well as cleaning off the surface!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister, who I split the cost of this product and share with has a very similar reaction, and also points out how this causes no redness or drying of the skin! This is a great plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+Helps portion out how much you use&lt;br /&gt;+Really helps defeat acne&lt;br /&gt;+Cleans surface well, as well as popes&lt;br /&gt;+No redness or drying&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;+Stung the first time I used it&lt;br /&gt;+Does not work well in shower as medicine is easily rinsed out of pad. Simply use outside of shower to prevent this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product, as it truly works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne on and off throughout my life, and found most treatments to be too damaging and drying to my skin.  This product was amazing!  It left my skin feeling not only clean, but didn&#x27;t completely dry out my skin.  I absolutely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> great acne treatment product</li>
            <li> Excellent product and results</li>
            <li> i use this on my neck, shoulders and face before I go to bed and when i wake up.  sometimes even at lunch time on the weekends.  it really helped my skin look better.  I noticed results in just one week.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first. thinking that it is a product amongst other will serve me for nothing, but I try and I was surprised by its effectiveness, this has got rid of my acne and completely changed the texture of my skin. This product is perfect</li>
            <li> This product line is absolutely AMAZING! This cream gives me the peace of mind of knowing that my skin is taken care of, by simply using this product line. If you hope to keep your skin looking young and fresh then this is the product for you. Also, its not a funky smelling treatment like many of those creams that are out there, its a soothing scent associated with it.</li>
            <li> Removes dirt and oil. Doesn&#x27;t stave off new breakouts super effectively</li>
            <li> I am a 22 year old female. I don&#x27;t have BAD acne but I do have noticeable acne and always have. I was super excited to get this due to other reviews. I am very pale and have sensitive skin with a red undertone. This didn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;refreshing&amp;#34; at all. Scrubs by St. Ives is what I use to feel freshed. This just made me feel kind of rough. It&#x27;s hard to explain. As for clearing my skin.. No. I found the BEST product ever which is Neutrogen Rapid Clear Stubborn Acne. Works wonders. Please try that product before buying this. It&#x27;s cheaper and works a lot better.</li>
            <li> I am not fond of this product. I have not seen any benefits and hoped I would by now considering the price! It&#x27;s sticky, stinks, and tastes terrible if it gets too close to your lips. I bought the face wash too and have been quite disappointed! I had high hopes based on the reviews...feels like I must&#x27;ve gotten a different product than everyone else.</li>
            <li> A really good product which removes all the dead cells and acne from the face. I was told to use this product by my friend. It was a delight to use it. The smell is also awesome. It has immediate and quick effects. Very very good for those who want to see a glow on their skin. I really loved it. Blackheads are also removed using this pack.</li>
            <li> Before I used this product, I had very bad acne, it was all over my face. My mother ordered me this product and I thought it was just going to be another one of those basic products, but under 1 WEEK I started to see a difference! My acne is now almost all cleared up and just on time for the summer :)</li>
            <li> It was hard to rid of white and black heads but i am amazed after trying thses i didnt think that it was even possible but it is ! Now im telling everyone i know.</li>
            <li> I was a little wary at first since I&#x27;ve never heard of this brand before, but after a friend recommended it, I gave it a try. This acne product has been one of the best out of the dozens I&#x27;ve tried. The size of my pimples and the redness noticeably reduced in a day. I have very sensitive skin and this product didn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and my skin hasn&#x27;t dried out either. (usually dries out with most other acne products)</li>
            <li> This is hard to believe this but there&#x27;s actually an exfoliating scrub my whole family can use! From my sisters with sensitive skin to my mother with aging lines, even my father uses it to clear his dry sin! It&#x27;s a great price and lasts longer than most products we used to buy.</li>
            <li> This was much better than any other treatment I&#x27;ve tried in the past</li>
            <li> The worst product ever!!! I get ALLERGIC to it !! Very serious!!!! My back and my face have many pustules !!!! I HATE this products !! I don&#x27;t know why so many people this it is great!!!! VERY DISAPPOINTED and unhappy !!!!!</li>
            <li> to be honest i have mild acne, the acne that is under the skin and some blackhead, and i did not think this product worked well!! it has a smell to it and it seemed like it made my acne worse. I use the face wash and the face wash is just like clean and clear does the same effect. but i am shopping around more to find a product that will get rid of everything. this was a wast of money :(</li>
            <li> Have used many many different types of wipes, including prescription antibiotic ones. These are truly nothing special, and way too expensive. Just a cleanser combined with benzoyl peroxide works better.</li>
            <li> This product has no cleared my daughter&#x27;s acne. She could only use the pads once a day because they irritated her skin. Disappointed because this product was expensive and it didn&#x27;t work despite its claims.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 14 year old daughter for her back acne. She said it was good, it did seem to help, but it did not clear it up completely. I would get this product again if the price was a lot lower. Because of the results &amp; cost I am going to try something else less expensive.</li>
            <li> I know this to pads acne but not long ago I was totally convinced. It remains for the treatment of acne and is always clean from the outside environment. No cause uncomfortable feeling when used. A great product and worth the purchase!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really effective.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well for my daughter.  She uses it regularly.  She had a hard time remembering or caring to wash her face.</li>
            <li> Triad a lot of creams and face masks, but this proved to be much better for me. It works for all of my problems like acne and even pimples, so I love it!</li>
            <li> Helping my son eliminate oil and gunk from invading his pores . Its all out war! This stuff is one of our weapons. Use this also use the cucumber witch hazel from here in a small spray bottle to rotate and keep the oils at bay</li>
            <li> I have a feeling this will work I was upset that I paid almost $40 and the jar is so small ,</li>
            <li> This acne cream is the best. It has absolutely the best features and blends in to my skin most of the time. I know some people are sceptics about these products but I can recommend that it works. If you dont believe me I can post pictures. Honestly I do recommend this product to everyone out there.</li>
            <li> A very effective product which help me clear out my acne marks. I love this item because it doesn&#x27;t have an itchy feel after using it. I notice the changes in my pores. My sensitive skin didn&#x27;t react to it when I first use this item. A must try!</li>
            <li> The best way to treat acne is here. One of the best products I have seen so far. I have loved it completely. It has good ingredients which help to fight acne for our skin.</li>
            <li> one of the best creams for removing acne and having a fair and glowing skin. My skin has been glowing since the day i have applied this cream. The materials used for making the cream have no ill effects for the skin and works amazingly. I loved it.</li>
            <li> This is great for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from acne for years now and have tried hundreds of products and home remedies. But this is now my everyday go to acne treatment, cleared up my skin fast without drying it out! It even reduced my dark marks and acne scarring! Great Product!</li>
            <li> Great acne treatment for my teenage son who prefers to use just one or two products. Cleared his skin up right away!</li>
            <li> The best acne treatment out here today. don&#x27;t buy nothing else other than this awesome product.</li>
            <li> So the product works very well for someone like myself who suffer from horrible acne. It works way better than those over the counter products I&#x27;ve been buying for years glad I came across it .</li>
            <li> It is an excellent product, easy to use and very practical, really I recommend it very effective, since I&#x27;m using there has been an incredible change. I am very happy with the results</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this didn&#x27;t  bother it at all! It doesn&#x27;t dry out face or make you peel. Now with that being said I haven&#x27;t really notice any changes for better or worse. Maybe it&#x27;s preventing new pimples from coming. I have been using for about 3 weeks. I will purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping. Hope this helps 😊</li>
            <li> I have been having really bad acne but i finally found the solution. This product its great, i have seen a lot of improvement on my face.</li>
            <li> ALLERGIC, I used this product once &amp; broke out in severe hives! Amazon appears to have accepted my refund request. I will be sending it back asap! The last thing I wanted was hives on my face in addition to acne......yay me.</li>
            <li> Since my teen I had bad acne on my face and used many products, but no results found. Now after using this beauty cream, I found identifiable results and now I’m happy with no more tension. If you are worried about acne this cream is definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son who is 16 and has had bad acne this year.  He was reluctant to talk about it or motivated to do anything about it, including washing his face.  We agreed he would use it once day to wipe his face daily.  Well, even that was a challenge for this boy,  but apparently using it 2 or 3 times a week was enough!  His face looks great and his skin is clear.  This is definitely a keeper.</li>
            <li> Acne. Acne is one of the most difficult problem of young (and not only) people. Thanks to this wonderful product, I could eradicate this annoying problem! I bought two of this item and I will buy it again for my brother! Perfect products, perfect face now! Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li> So refreshing!  I didn&#x27;t need this for my face but had problem areas on my arms and legs. This worked great to make my skin smooth as silk.</li>
            <li> My daughter who is 14 yrs old has been a victim of acne skin for the last one year. This year a friend advised I buy her the acne treatment pads product. Four months down the line, the hormonal acne and the blackheads are no more. The skin is not left fully dry by the product too.Recommendable.</li>
            <li> This product was amazing! It left my skin feeling not only clean, but didn&#x27;t completely dry out my skin. I&#x27;ve had acne on and off throughout my life, and found most treatments to be too damaging and drying to my skin. I have bad skin and acne due to my work environment, I work in a kitchen as a fry cook. It is bad enough that my skin is already oily. Anyway this has surpassed my expectations! It is moderately priced but compared to other products I buy in stores it is well worth it. This product is really amazing!&lt;br /&gt;After using these acne pads for 2 months my skin is completely clear, I&#x27;m no longer afraid to leave my house without foundation</li>
            <li> worked very well for my boy. he does not keep up when washing his face so i decided to get him acne treatment as it was getting on my nerves that he could not keep his face clean. After a few weeks of him applying i can easily tell the difference and this was a great buy</li>
            <li> This product is very useful for my teenage kids with acne problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it get rid of their acne, but it also makes their skin look healthier and cleans all the other impurities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The first day I got the pad in my eyes and it stung quite a bit, but it went away soon. It doesn&#x27;t seem harsh on my skin, and it&#x27;s pretty convenient. I still have a good amount of wipes left and it&#x27;s working, so no regrets. I had these nasty blackheads by my lips that went away after using this for about a week and a half. Just don&#x27;t get it in your mouth or eyes. Blech!</li>
            <li> I honestly feel like my skin is much cleaner when I use these scrubs.</li>
            <li> did nothing for my clogged pores, i returned it</li>
            <li> Can’t believe these worked so well. I have been suffering from acne for a long time now and to find out these pads were all I needed amazes me. Definitely going to tell all my friends about this!</li>
            <li> Thought it would work for me but didn&#x27;t. Very expensive but sadly has no effect on my pimples. It was just the same as usual and can&#x27;t remove make up.</li>
            <li> These did not work as advertised.</li>
            <li> Not at all worth the money.</li>
            <li> Ok so I am giving ti two starts.  The pads are super small, so I am sure they work awesome but you will need to use 2 or 3 at a time to clean your entire face therefore the value for the price is not good.  If I still had the box and hadn&#x27;t already used two of them I would of returned them.  Good if you have a really really small face.</li>
            <li> For some moment I already give up on buying all this face cleaners, pimple reduce products, until one of my friend recommend me this stuff! I&#x27;m 22 years old guy, working on construction on that time, carpentry, you know all that dust and dirt. I my skin was problematic all the time if it&#x27;s not a pimples than dark spots all over. Clearasil is a bull sh$t in instruction that saying you need to wash your face at least 4 tims a day with it, what is not really work for me. So and this stuff absolutely great in use easy and fest, and the main thing you can see a result after two days using it at least twice a day, when I was my face in the morning, and showering after work! GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I started getting bad acne after going to the gym regularly so I was searching for a solution.  This stuff has worked better than any other alternatives, acne started clearing up in a couple days.</li>
            <li> So my wife and I have been searching around for an EXTREMELY good acne product for our teen daughter(you know how that goes) and after buying so many failed products I can&#x27;t believe that we have finally found an EXTREMELY GREAT acne treatment for our daughter. She has used it and is more confident than ever. Thanks guys....for your help!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage son who has mild acne. Like a typical teenager, he can&#x27;t be bothered with washing his face for any length of time...putting on acne medication when necessary; just can&#x27;t be bothered.  I bought this based on the glowing reviews. This is working for my son&#x27;s mild acne. At first he was put off by the smell ( all acne medications smell). When he saw that the pad was dirty and not white after using it on his face, something clicked. He has been using the pads morning and night and it is working on his mild acne. Nothing takes the place of good hygiene and face washing, but my teenager is in the &#x27;I can&#x27;t be bothered&#x27; stage. This is working for him and I am grateful that he is using it!  It is expensive, but my son is willing to use this and it works. Priceless.</li>
            <li> Great product, it really helps me.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had a pimple in weeks! great product</li>
            <li> I have had trouble with minor acne my whole life. When it seemed like things got better the acne always seemed to return. This a great product that can be used everyday with very little irritation. My skin looks and feels great. I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for an awesome acne treatment</li>
            <li> Affiliate marketers are paying for fake reviews of this product.</li>
            <li> Yes, I am happy now and I would not mind sharing my experience here. I am literally enjoying my refreshed and clearer skin than never before. It has also removed my acne scars in a very short period of time. I was looking for some reliable product make in USA and this is the perfect match for me.</li>
            <li> Title says it all...I have been a  sufferer of acne since teenage days and literally tried upon tried everything right from home treatments to expensive gels which cost you a fortune.. And my opinion is that &amp;#34;THIS IS IT&amp;#34;.. Its works amazingly...Pimples get dried up quickly .. and you can hardly see marks.. Blindly 5 stars</li>
            <li> This is the ultimate answer to people with acne</li>
            <li> Fast shipment and great product!</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED THIS FOR 3 DAYS AND ALREADY SEE A DIFFERENCE!! IM HOPING IT CONTINUES TO WORK!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 40&#x27;s, with small pimples always hard to remove. Unfortunately this pads make my face like an alergic reaction, as soon as I clean my face with them, it starts to swell like a bunch of pimples are going to break out, my face looks terrible. I just stop using them. I&#x27;m not saying it doesn&#x27; work, it&#x27;s just that maybe my face has been too irritated during all my life, that this product it&#x27;s NOT FOR ME.</li>
            <li> Great product. Great face wash, removes face acne, exfoliate face and refreshes and tones skin area.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because the name and the packaging made me laugh, and I needed acne treatment. I was ASTOUNDED at how amazing this worked. It has treated my acne so well, I no longer get my monthly breakouts around &amp;#34;that time&amp;#34; and yet, I don&#x27;t get too dry either. My skin feels fresh and my zits and blackheads have dissapeared. My dermatologist is impressed that this isn&#x27;t a peel or prescription product as well. I couldn&#x27;t be happier and will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> 3stars  are for the price ..i dont recommend buying this for $40 3 just for pads and few of products solution that u are really buying. i recommend buying their facial wash cleanser with 5 % benzoyl peroxide its better and worth the price that u can see and feel how clean and soft ur skin is. i tried most of their products and they all really works fast!! i highly recommend them 5stars.</li>
            <li> I have been dealing with acne for a few years now. I tried several products that you buy at the local stores. I saw this advertised on amazon, and read the reviews. I was blown away and ordered this product. Still being a little skeptical, I was desperate to try anything. i received the product so quickly. I just started to use it immediately, and within one day. I noticed impressive results.. ......... and one week later, my face is clear. I absolutely love this product. I use it twice a day, one pad in the morning..... and one pad at night. Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> from a young age I suffered from acne, which made me feel self-conscious&#x27;ve tried so many products that supposedly would improve my acne but have not achieved any improvement until I got this product which has been wonderful, I have noticed quite improvement, really I feel more secure with myself and very happy for the incredible results, I recommend this product widely.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better Acne Treatment system! Money well-spent</li>
            <li> My 15 year old son has had horrible acne for over a year. He&#x27;s tried X-out, ProActiv Plus and several other over the counter acne washes and treatments. He&#x27;s been using this product every night before going to bed for the last 3 weeks and has almost cleared up his face completely! Also, his face hasn&#x27;t dried out, as it did with other products! I was somewhat skeptical when ordering this for him as it is a little pricey, but they do offer a 100% guarantee, so you can return if it doesn&#x27;t work. Fortunately, it was worth the $35 because it works and it will be enough for 60 days!</li>
            <li> This is the only acne treatment product that has consistantly worked for me! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This acne treatment is far above the other ones and it&#x27;s also more convenient because you can take it anywhere and you can just clean right there on the go without worrying about trying to find a sink.  Definitely going to tell all my friends about this!</li>
            <li> This product works! After washing my face clean and using these pads, you can see a difference in two days. Remember not to rub over eyes, only use for the face. As a person with sensitive skin and adult acne at 63, what a relief to find a product that doesn&#x27;t sting! Don&#x27;t let the packaging fool you. Since it is a strong product, I use it three days a week.</li>
            <li> Great product. Works better than any product I have ever used!!! Cleared my complexion up without drying my skin.</li>
            <li> This did absolutely nothing to help with my daughters acne.  A lot of hype, but no results</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time</li>
            <li> Not for no secret that when you&#x27;re in high school, one of the most important things is your looks, and we all want to be attractive to others and be &#x27;&#x27; cool &#x27;&#x27; and one of the things that prevents this is acne because it is not very attractive to say ... and that&#x27;s where discover the solution to my problems, this cream not only serves great for acne on the face, but for that pesky acne that appears in the chest and back, a great treatment if you follow it correctly I promise to solve your acne, of course you have to constantly keep personal hygiene and not descuidarce in food. but it is an effective way to remove it and so have a good skin care.</li>
            <li> Nothing seems to do the job for my horrible acne .. I tried so many over the counter products and came up short .As I was searching online. I came across this product . I have been using it for a while now . It really does work I will continue to keep using !!!</li>
            <li> This is a convenient and economical way for treating acne at home or on the go. It treats the problem, not just the surface. This product clears refreshes and refines the your skin. It is a wonderful product for which your skin will thank you</li>
            <li> Works great, doesn&#x27;t make me peel, while taking care of the acne! -rrc</li>
            <li> This product is great for acne!</li>
            <li> I like the quick results</li>
            <li> I had bad acne as a teen and wish this had been around then.  Still as an adult who has the occasional breakout, his is perfect for keeping my skin clean and acne free.  I have combination skin, so it can be a challenge sometimes, but not with this!</li>
            <li> I was born with eczema and have been prone to acne since birth; however, once I started using this, I noticed an immediate difference and my face has been clear ever since!</li>
            <li> This is clearly a scam, which I didn&#x27;t realize until after I bought it.  It is no different than any other acne wipe, but at a much higher price.  If it was $5 I would have given it five stars, but for the price, just no.</li>
            <li> Use these pads twice a day, morning and night ! My skin has had some blemishes due to the weather but these have helped completely !!</li>
            <li> I suffer from hormonal acne, zits pop up everywhere. Since I started using this though, my face has cleared up. No more breakouts!</li>
            <li> These pads are amazing! My son is one of those kids who forgets on a daily basis, so when we tried other treatments you had to use them everyday. But with these pads, even if he forgets to wash his face with the acne wash all he has to to is wipe. He started seeing results within a week and I would totally recommend this product, especially if you&#x27;ve tried others.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this product and I loveit. By the month using this product I could feel some great results. it&#x27;s almost removed my acne but still some visible. may be in future my skin clear from all acne. I&#x27;ve finally found anything that works for me. Recomment</li>
            <li> I have acne on my skin since i was teenager, and have tried a lot of products even medicament, but nothing helped me so quickly and completely as this acne treatment. It is like i have a new skin all over my body, i can&#x60;t recognize my skin healed and regenerated.</li>
            <li> This is a must-have product for mild acne sufferers. It&#x27;s much less harsh and drying than drugstore face pads and astringents. I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> Bought this for myself when my acne had started to get out of control, it&#x27;s almost entirely cleared up my skin could not recommend more, so inexpensive for how great it worked.</li>
            <li> The pads themselves feel extremely rough on the skin, painful as I use them, especially for someone with inflamed/acne ridden skin. The smell is unpleasant, and it leaves the skin with a strange sticky residue, not pleasant at all. I was extremely hopeful based on the reviews and very excited to try it, but unfortunately after using it, my skin did not improve, my breakouts did not diminish or either show the faintest hope of healing, and I was very unsatisfied. As far the seller goes, the return was prompt and I had no issues with delivery and such. I believe maybe the reviews were written by people who got it for free. Anything free is good right?I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now using the facial cleaning pads from Trader Joe&#x27;s, they contain organic extracts of tea tree oil, calendula, chamomile, witch hazel among other wonderful ingredients! And the price? ONLY $3.99 for 60 count! Compared to $35! I&#x27;ll take the organic stuff that ACTUALLY works. MY skin has seen amazing improvement in tone, texture, and my breakouts have diminished by over 50%! I am very satisfied with my Trader Joe&#x27;s cleaning wipes! But this beauty facials celebrities secrets is in fact nothing more than an extra failed step in my acne cure hopes.</li>
            <li> These acne pads help me so much. I&#x27;m so glad that my acne is gone. I have always had trouble with acne problems in my face and skin and since I have tried this it has cleared up.</li>
            <li> Some of my previous experiences with acne pads have left me disappointed with the results, however I was pleasantly surprised to have finally found such a quality product in this one. It is now something I swear by!</li>
