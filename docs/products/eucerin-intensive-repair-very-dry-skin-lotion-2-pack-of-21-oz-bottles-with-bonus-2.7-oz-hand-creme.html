            <li>It absorbs well, there is no scent to compete with, and my skin is in the best condition it has ever been!  </li>
            <li>Excellent products and a very good price for them..</li>
            <li>This stuff is great.  </li>
            <li>This is great for sensitive skin and great for winter dryness!</li>
            <li>I have found this lotion to be the best lotion on the market at a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>So good it seems to smooth out wrinkles!! :-)</li>
            <li>This order was received with the top dispenser bent and leaking into the wrapper.</li>
            <li>The best Lotion we ever used and we have tried many different brands.</li>
            <li>Works well, but I have to use it on my hands many times a day once home heating is required</li>
            <li>I have sensitivity to most products, so Eucerin is my go-to lotion.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it during summer yet, but I predict that it will be okay year-round.</li>
            <li>Best lotion for very dry skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different brands for my hands and feet, and this is absolutely the best.</li>
            <li>Very good product for extremely dry, chapped skin.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s works fine.</li>
            <li>My baby has severe exzema and this product in so gentle that I can use it several times a day with wonderful results!</li>
            <li>So far so good</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still great for combating eczema and extreme dryness.</li>
            <li>great product for a dry skean!!!</li>
            <li>The intensive repair is great for me, especially during the winter, when my skin get cracked and flaky (I live on the East coast).</li>
            <li>The 2 Pack 21 Oz is the best value buy, but we have a hard time finding in retail stores at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>but the convenience is what I need right now.</li>
            <li>if you have red cracked hands this cream is wonderful heals them quickly over a few days</li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied as I thought I had finally found it on Amazon after many brick and mortar stores had told me they no longer stocked the PLUS variety of the lotion.</li>
            <li>Keeps skin most and supple all day long.</li>
            <li>thanks for the prime delivery</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>WORKS FAST AND COMPLETE</li>
            <li>Perhaps Eucerin replaced the Plus version with this new product.  </li>
            <li>Fairly expensive lotion that doesn&#x27;t have much of a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soft and well nourished.</li>
            <li>I have paid a lot more for lotion and its not nearly as effective,</li>

            <li> I have paid a lot more for lotion and its not nearly as effective,</li>
            <li> Not sure how they make their product &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; differently than others since almost all have the same ingredients; mainly water/mineral oil</li>
            <li> However if your skin is as dry as mine is and get dry rashes during the winter then this will clear up your rashes in less than 3 days and is the only lotion I trust to keep me moisturized the entire day.</li>
            <li> i am using this lotion from quite long and is one of my fav&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> As long as they make this stuff</li>
            <li> what I rcvd was just plain old Eucerin.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t go back to any other lotion.  </li>
            <li> I would suggest it to anyone looking to help take care of dry skin problems; this stuff works head to toes!</li>
            <li> Getting it in a larger bottle with a little lotion gift is nothing but a plus.</li>
            <li> The dog tries to lick it too.</li>
            <li> Thick cream, needed for my old skin.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing, as the only reason I ordered online was because I can&#x27;t fine Eucerin PLUS at the stores.</li>
            <li> I had seen the other reviews and thought I&#x27;d give this a chance, given the Eucerin Plus seems to be unavailable anywhere else.  </li>
            <li> Also, it is not a very good price for being the regular Eucerin lotion.</li>
            <li> Very sticky and difficult to spread over my body.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Given it&#x27;s in a sealed 2-pack, I&#x27;m unable to check whether the product is similar to the Eucerin PLUS version, thus back to Amazon it goes.</li>
            <li> Use it year round.</li>
            <li> I feel that I paid for a product of which a portion has been wasted.</li>
            <li> I used Eucerin approximately 7:30 Friday morning and had no need when I left at 6:15 that afternoon.</li>
            <li> I had to mix it with another lotion so that this one wouldn&#x27;t go to waste.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin and usually need to lotion my legs three times a day (for the least)</li>
            <li> It may seem thick and slow to absorb but give it a minute</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t  do as it says it does terrible greasy not even a lotion</li>
            <li> Worst lotion I have ever bought!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> i am using this lotion from quite long and is one of my fav&#x27;s. thanks for the prime delivery</li>
            <li> NOT Eucerin PLUS Intensive Repair which is the only lotion recommended to me by my doctor. Just the regular Eucerin Intensive Repair. Very dissatisfied as I thought I had finally found it on Amazon after many brick and mortar stores had told me they no longer stocked the PLUS variety of the lotion. Also, it is not a very good price for being the regular Eucerin lotion.</li>
            <li> my wife loves this stuff. The dog tries to lick it too.</li>
            <li> DOES THE JOB. WORKS FAST AND COMPLETE</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t  do as it says it does terrible greasy not even a lotion</li>
            <li> A couple of days and cracks and dryness were gone.</li>
            <li> it stays on my skin does not absorb it</li>
            <li> Recommended by Doctors for Diabetics. Use it year round.</li>
            <li> Although I did not receive the \\&quot;Plus\\&quot; variety that is pictured the product I received was close and seems to work well.  Next time however I will insist that the product match my request.  I like the idea that Eucerin lotion matches the PH factor of the skin (according to what I saw and heard on the Doctors TV program).</li>
            <li> great product for a dry skean!!!</li>
            <li> This order was received with the top dispenser bent and leaking into the wrapper. I feel that I paid for a product of which a portion has been wasted.</li>
            <li> I cannot review Eucerin Plus because although the advertised picture and description both indicate Eucerin PLUS what I rcvd was just plain old Eucerin. Very disappointing, as the only reason I ordered online was because I can&#x27;t fine Eucerin PLUS at the stores.</li>
            <li> This is NOT the advertised product listed on the product title and shown in the picture, which is of \\&quot;Eucerin PLUS Intensive Repair Lotion\\&quot;.  I received instead Eucerin Intensive Repair.  I had seen the other reviews and thought I&#x27;d give this a chance, given the Eucerin Plus seems to be unavailable anywhere else.  Perhaps Eucerin replaced the Plus version with this new product.  Either way, this listing is incorrect, and I did not receive the product advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given it&#x27;s in a sealed 2-pack, I&#x27;m unable to check whether the product is similar to the Eucerin PLUS version, thus back to Amazon it goes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different brands for my hands and feet, and this is absolutely the best. It absorbs well and is not greasy. I keep a bottle at my desk, in my bathroom, and next to the kitchen sink.</li>
            <li> The best Lotion we ever used and we have tried many different brands. The 2 Pack 21 Oz is the best value buy, but we have a hard time finding in retail stores at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand since childhood and it&#x27;s still great for combating eczema and extreme dryness. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin and usually need to lotion my legs three times a day (for the least) before I leave work.  I used Eucerin approximately 7:30 Friday morning and had no need when I left at 6:15 that afternoon. GREAT!!!</li>
            <li> Works well, but I have to use it on my hands many times a day once home heating is required</li>
            <li> This is the best body lotion.  So good it seems to smooth out wrinkles!! :-) It may seem thick and slow to absorb but give it a minute and it&#x27;s works fine. Recommended by dermatologist.</li>
            <li> What can I say. This is my standby lotion. Getting it in a larger bottle with a little lotion gift is nothing but a plus. As long as they make this stuff I&#x27;ll keep buying it.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin soft and well nourished.</li>
            <li> My baby has severe exzema and this product in so gentle that I can use it several times a day with wonderful results!</li>
            <li> Best lotion for very dry skin. Keeps skin most and supple all day long. Have recommended this to all my friends and family.</li>
            <li> Thick cream, needed for my old skin. So far so good</li>
            <li> This is great for sensitive skin and great for winter dryness! I have sensitivity to most products, so Eucerin is my go-to lotion. The intensive repair is great for me, especially during the winter, when my skin get cracked and flaky (I live on the East coast). I haven&#x27;t used it during summer yet, but I predict that it will be okay year-round.</li>
            <li> if you have red cracked hands this cream is wonderful heals them quickly over a few days</li>
            <li> Not sure how they make their product &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; differently than others since almost all have the same ingredients; mainly water/mineral oil but this stuff is heavnly for my skin. I would suggest it to anyone looking to help take care of dry skin problems; this stuff works head to toes!</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for several years now, after it was given to me as a sample in the hospital.  I won&#x27;t go back to any other lotion.  It absorbs well, there is no scent to compete with, and my skin is in the best condition it has ever been!  I also use the Body Wash Oil by Eucerin in the shower.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Excellent products and a very good price for them.. I have found this lotion to be the best lotion on the market at a very reasonable price.  I have paid a lot more for lotion and its not nearly as effective,</li>
            <li> Very good product for extremely dry, chapped skin.  I use it daily and every time I wash my hands.&lt;br /&gt;Order was delivered promptly.  A bit more expensive than Bed, Bath and Beyond but the convenience is what I need right now.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  Use alittle on damp skin.</li>
            <li> Worst lotion I have ever bought! Very sticky and difficult to spread over my body. I had to mix it with another lotion so that this one wouldn&#x27;t go to waste.</li>
            <li> Fairly expensive lotion that doesn&#x27;t have much of a pleasant scent. However if your skin is as dry as mine is and get dry rashes during the winter then this will clear up your rashes in less than 3 days and is the only lotion I trust to keep me moisturized the entire day.</li>
