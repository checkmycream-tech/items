            <li>Great product, I don&#x27;t use it every time I wash my hair</li>

            <li>THIS STUFF IS SERIOUSLY AMAZING!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing!  </li>
            <li>but when I spoke to the seller my issue was met with amazing customer service!</li>
            <li>My teammates and I couldn&#x27;t believe how nice it made my hair after just one use!</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li>My hair always feels wonderfully silky and healthy after using this.</li>
            <li>I used many Joico products but this is the best.</li>
            <li>Basically a really good hair day (or days I guess depending on your hair washing regimen).</li>
            <li>i loved this product</li>
            <li>Its not greasy, just gave my hair that good salon result feelings.</li>
            <li>and the good price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It adds good slip and brush-ability.  </li>
            <li>I use the KPAK about once a week for a good conditioning treatment.  </li>
            <li>I will be using this line from now on, even after trying Mizani, Aphogee and Aveda products which are all good, but Joico gives me the moisturizing that my hair craves.</li>
            <li>I loved this product...</li>
            <li>I loved this conditioner as it makes my thinning hair seem fuller and doesn&#x27;t make it frizzy looking.  </li>
            <li>They are cheaper and have good reviews.</li>
            <li>The hair stylist used this product on my hair and I loved it</li>
            <li>Good seller and I like this hair mask.</li>
            <li>It smelled ok, however I myself did not get great results?  </li>
            <li>My hair has not looked this healthy since I was a child!</li>

            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>a lot of this made my hair feel amazing.</li>
            <li>I also find using the pump handy.</li>
            <li>And do yourself a favor, and buy a bottle of Nutiva or Garden of life coconut oil, regardless of what kind of hair you have.</li>
            <li>I normally use the joico k-pak reconstruct conditioner and have been very happy with it</li>
            <li>it is worth it to me) and see if I get these great results each time.</li>
            <li>I love love love it!</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s SO strong!</li>
            <li>My hair feels great after the first use.</li>
            <li>I use Lamas Beauty because they lather super good.</li>
            <li>Tabatha Coffey recommended it on the Dr. Oz show, and I love me some Tabatha</li>
            <li>It was separated even after shaking and making sure it was room temp.</li>
            <li>ok so i payed quite a bit for this product.</li>
            <li>I ordered the shampoo and conditioner revitaluxe k-pak after seeing such great results from this!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many hair conditioners, packs and masks..</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It should have a light kind of creamy floral note to it.  </li>
            <li>Great product, really makes a difference on your hair.  </li>
            <li>it works :)</li>
            <li>This is the bomb buy it better</li>
            <li>Leaves it shiny and so smooth!</li>
            <li>Such a great product! :)</li>
            <li>and it really works great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve reordered it many times.</li>
            <li>I love this repair treatment.</li>
            <li>I really love it.    </li>
            <li>I am glad I did not pay alot for this product.</li>
            <li>I use it as a leave in conditioner when I wear my hair curly to give my hair more time to absorb the product.</li>
            <li>However, this one is more pricey.  </li>
            <li>I would buy it again when the price is more resonable.</li>
            <li>My hair gets more conditioned with each use.</li>
            <li>That showed instant results for a really great price!!</li>
            <li>I may not buy again until it is more</li>
            <li>This was the right consistency and I loved it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved the results after the first use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After reading the reviews, I had very high hopes that a really good conditioner would help the level of dryness and make it silkier.  </li>
            <li>This stuff will get you back to brilliant in no time.  </li>
            <li>Best $22 spent!</li>
            <li>I could easily comb my hair without any tangles.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Joico is an amazing brand of products I first started using them when my hair was fried after heat and color damage.</li>
            <li>Works great for long fine hair!</li>
            <li>it is very good for dry damaged hair.</li>
            <li>For damaged fine hair, this is a miracle worker.</li>
            <li>I got a sample pack of this product when I purchased  Joico&#x27;s Smooth Cure Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
            <li>After one treatment, my hair is silky, smooth, shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li>I am happy to report (despite the inaccurate product photo, bottle has been redesigned and Cap totally different now) that I got a legit tube of product from &amp;#34;TheSmartLook&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>You are welcome to contact me later.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it and left it in while going to the beach or pool, and it works great.</li>
            <li>and please, use sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li>Fantastic for damedged hair.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t make my hair any better don&#x27;t buy if you want to work right away</li>
            <li>love this great for fine thin hair works better for me than conditioners 3x the price!</li>
            <li>i got all excited , when i went to use the product it was not creamy like it should have been</li>
            <li>I use it in the shower while i continue to clean my body...</li>
            <li>:B005K09UV0 Joico K Pak Revitaluxe Treatment, 16.2 Fluid Ounce]] and find it to be more cost effective.</li>
            <li>to damage) brittle, flat hair, into full, bouncy, shiny, soft, smooth, healthy looking, beautiful hair.    </li>
            <li>I finally can stop searching for a good hair product.</li>
            <li>The seller did a good job in communicating with me about needing to substitute some smaller sizes for the one I ordered.  </li>
            <li>Although I did purchase it, because I read nothing but good reviews about this product and when I do use it, I will come back and give it another review.</li>
            <li>i have boughten this before from my hairstylist and just loved the product , so when i saw this on amazon at a cheaper cost and a bigger bottle</li>
            <li>Product is lightweight and offers a nice scent.</li>
            <li>None the less, it does work and really does make the cuticle and core of the hair happy!  </li>
            <li>The first place I searched was AMAZON.COM and very quickly found it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The seller shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>Everything got sorted out quickly and it was no time before I was using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is just as smooth when using Suave with Keratin-- also much cheaper!</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what is says!</li>
            <li>I use the Joico to strengthen and repair, since I heat style my hair (I blow dry and flat iron twice a week) and the Alter ego I used because It makes my hair amazingly shiny like glass, soft, smooth, bouncy and beautiful.</li>
            <li>They are nothing short of amazing.</li>
            <li>If you use this once a week it seems to soften your hair and keeps the color looking fresh.</li>
            <li>Worth the 4 stars just for that</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised this didn&#x27;t get better reviews..</li>
            <li>I have never encountered a product by this company that isn&#x27;t worth the money!!1</li>
            <li>so I ordered it right then,</li>
            <li>All right with the the purchase and delivery.</li>
            <li>All right, I recommend.</li>
            <li>my hair sucked this right up</li>
            <li>You just need a little bit and works amazing!</li>
            <li>: I have been using this product for a year and a half now and love it more than ever.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and the Revitaluxe definitely adds volume and body without feeling like my hair is coated with anything.</li>
            <li>The product is good but a little pricey, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is rather thin &amp; I did not find it to be very good at managing my unruly hair.</li>
            <li>After the first time I have left it on in the shower probably longer than 5 minutes, so I think the longer you can leave it on the better the results.</li>
            <li>I did use entire bottle just to make sure.</li>
            <li>Love this deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>I find my hair feels and looks much better than it did prior to use it</li>
            <li>I got it much cheaper than I would have paid in the salon!</li>
            <li>It works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>I am not yet able to review this product because I have used it only once.</li>
            <li>First time using this</li>
            <li>Regular KPak treatment is much better.</li>
            <li>My aunts a cosmotolegist &amp; she recommended this to me because i have severely damaged hair.. &amp; it really does work!</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it claims, it rapairs and strengthens damaged hair, lacking protein.</li>
            <li>This product has helped my hair so much!</li>
            <li>Makes you hair more manageable whirl repairing it at the same time.</li>
            <li>so the ends are bleached and pretty damaged.</li>
            <li>The price is pretty affordable too.</li>
            <li>One the first use</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>I was really amazed!</li>
            <li>It actually has hurt my hair more.</li>
            <li>and I curl it pretty often on super high heat, (which I know isn&#x27;t the smartest..)</li>
            <li>I believe the fragrance that is used is a popular scent as I&#x27;ve smelled this scent on other women</li>
            <li>I used a pretty large amount of it, because for some reason I couldn&#x27;t feel it in my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair falls out in the shower, and is now more brittle and dry than it was before I started using it.  </li>
            <li>leaves your hair super soft, i use it about 2-3 times a week.</li>
            <li>but, I don&#x27;t want such a strong scent in my hair product.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m definitely going to be purchasing a 2nd bottle soon and probably other products they carry - my hair was soft and full of life again this really is better than most high-end products I have used!</li>
            <li>But when I rinsed it and dried it it was amazing.</li>
            <li>but im very upset..</li>
            <li>I really thought there was no hope for me.</li>
            <li>So much cheaper than at beauty supply store.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m still really concerned about things like UV damage (I play outdoor sports).  </li>
            <li>It was a real life saver for my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not noticing much of a difference when using this product.  </li>
            <li>This product has really helped my hair to feel thicker &amp; to repair the ends.  </li>
            <li>one evening and the Lady from Tabatha take over Salons was on the show and she recommend this product alone with some hair vitimans it really works.</li>
            <li>so I have to really give it some moisture to the ends, etc.  </li>
            <li>I really want to use the word \\&quot;stench\\&quot; but that&#x27;s rather subjective ...&lt;</li>
            <li>I bought this Joico KPack not thinking it would do much I read the reviews after</li>
            <li>After using joico my hair was repaired and it really helped take care of all the damage and breakage in my hair.</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>The only thing is, it does seem to be most effective when you first use it, I don&#x27;t know that the results really last through another wash, definitely not through a couple, because my hair is back to misbehaving by then.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I wish this could be used daily, it&#x27;s like a great hair day in a little tube!</li>
            <li>It did not come in the original box (only Joico product that does BTW), and the &amp;#34;off smell&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>so I was excited to try this when a sales rep at my local beauty supply store told me this could help repair my hair.</li>
            <li>what else can you say when more than half is mixed with FREE water!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I never blow it dry, use very mild shampoo &amp; always leave conditioner in for 5+ minutes.  </li>
            <li>Decent price, though.</li>
            <li>I used the K-pak Deep Penetrating Reconstuctor regularly despite coloring and perming my hair and I received many compliments on the softness of my hair.</li>
            <li>Based on the cost, I would have presumed a professional product such as this product would have given me my money&#x27;s worth, unfortunately not.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone with damaged or over processed hair.</li>
            <li>Even after the first use, my highlighted (bleached), aging hair (over 50) became so soft again that I&#x27;ve decided not to cut it short right away.</li>
            <li>This was recommended by my hair colorist and I&#x27;m not usually one for fancy restorative hair masks, but this is one that has changed my mind!</li>
            <li>I always put a little more conditioner in after showering &amp; leave it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>THINK IT WAS THAT GREAT SORRY.</li>
            <li>I normally have unruly, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>it worked good but not great.</li>
            <li>bugs me a little knowing more than likely why its not 100% right.  </li>
            <li>I expected my hair to be soft, detangled easily and pliable like the JOICO Moisture Recovery.   </li>
            <li>I would use hand fulls of conditioner and even more styling products to try to tame it.  </li>
            <li>I use it after shampoo and also sometimes as live in conditioner</li>
            <li>It was a complete waste of money and precious strands.</li>
            <li>It feels safe to use everyday so far.</li>
            <li>I used the item but couldn&#x27;t really tell a major difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair very soft and shiny (feels like it boosts color too</li>
            <li>Compared to all the other treatments I have bought in the past Joico is amazing!</li>
            <li>usually have a lot more to say about a product, but</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>All that has been fixed!</li>
            <li>This is the first product that actually has worked to get rid of my frizzes.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down and it feels conditioned and soft afterwards.  </li>
            <li>The initial reviews were so positive, I decided to buy this product hoping that it would save my hair breakage.  </li>
            <li>i tried the 1oz first and it was super small</li>
            <li>Product seemed to be old.</li>
            <li>yet not too soft it will not hold my style.</li>
            <li>I have never lost so much hair from this product than any of the numerous products that I have purchased.  </li>
            <li>I am transitioning with the use of keratin treatments from relaxed to my natural type 4b hair.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend it to anyone who wants to try a deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>I color my hair frequently</li>
            <li>My hair was so soft I couldn&#x27;t stop running my fingers through my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and managable after 1 week.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it once so far</li>
            <li>It really helps your hair come back to life</li>
            <li>, that I added my old one after rinsing to ensure I could brush it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it makes my hair soft and shiny and doesn&#x27;t make it greasy.</li>
            <li>Terrific for naturally curly hair which tends to dry out easily and becomes coarse and brittle.&lt;br /&gt;Great PRICE!</li>
            <li>but now whenever I use it my hair is really soft, shiny, and is less frizzy (which is saying something, since I have super stubborn frizz that doesn&#x27;t seem to have a reaction to a lot of products).</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s possible that some ladies received older product..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure, but so far i&#x27;m not disappointed in mine..</li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin hair, and it has been breaking off.  </li>
            <li>A lot of people are saying it&#x27;s watered down &amp; doesn&#x27;t smell right..</li>
            <li>Had major hair breakage</li>
            <li>I usually feel that those OTC 3-minute hair masks from neutrogena and etc, are fine enough for my hair.</li>
            <li>then Shea moisture for a blonde and natural hair in</li>
            <li>I purchased this product with high hopes of it helping my dry hair.  </li>
            <li>Or Alter ego Energizing and rebalancing conditioner if it is normal or dry.</li>
            <li>(there are some conditioners much more expensive that I have tried for my frizzy hair that didn&#x27;t work near as well, so</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because my hair was thinning in the top , and I had tried several other products in the past that wasn,t working.</li>
            <li>Strangely it reminds me of some of the Retro Mary Kay scents in their Mature Skin lotions...  </li>
            <li>This product was watered down, and I know this because I got the REAL thing from a salon in my town.  </li>
            <li>If your hair does not have a protein loss problem, this may not be for you, as ironicaly too much protein will have the same effect as too little protein.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s amazing!  </li>

            <li> &amp; I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li> My hair always feels wonderfully silky and healthy after using this.</li>
            <li> I used many Joico products but this is the best.</li>
            <li> Basically a really good hair day (or days I guess depending on your hair washing regimen).</li>
            <li> i loved this product</li>
            <li> Its not greasy, just gave my hair that good salon result feelings.</li>
            <li> and the good price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It adds good slip and brush-ability.  </li>
            <li> I use the KPAK about once a week for a good conditioning treatment.  </li>
            <li> I will be using this line from now on, even after trying Mizani, Aphogee and Aveda products which are all good, but Joico gives me the moisturizing that my hair craves.</li>
            <li> I loved this product...</li>
            <li> I loved this conditioner as it makes my thinning hair seem fuller and doesn&#x27;t make it frizzy looking.  </li>
            <li> They are cheaper and have good reviews.</li>
            <li> The hair stylist used this product on my hair and I loved it</li>
            <li> Good seller and I like this hair mask.</li>
            <li> It smelled ok, however I myself did not get great results?  </li>
            <li> My hair has not looked this healthy since I was a child!</li>

            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> a lot of this made my hair feel amazing.</li>
            <li> I also find using the pump handy.</li>
            <li> And do yourself a favor, and buy a bottle of Nutiva or Garden of life coconut oil, regardless of what kind of hair you have.</li>
            <li> I normally use the joico k-pak reconstruct conditioner and have been very happy with it</li>
            <li> it is worth it to me) and see if I get these great results each time.</li>
            <li> I love love love it!</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s SO strong!</li>
            <li> My hair feels great after the first use.</li>
            <li> I use Lamas Beauty because they lather super good.</li>
            <li> Tabatha Coffey recommended it on the Dr. Oz show, and I love me some Tabatha</li>
            <li> It was separated even after shaking and making sure it was room temp.</li>
            <li> ok so i payed quite a bit for this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered the shampoo and conditioner revitaluxe k-pak after seeing such great results from this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many hair conditioners, packs and masks..</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It should have a light kind of creamy floral note to it.  </li>
            <li> Great product, really makes a difference on your hair.  </li>
            <li> it works :)</li>
            <li> This is the bomb buy it better</li>
            <li> Leaves it shiny and so smooth!</li>
            <li> Such a great product! :)</li>
            <li> and it really works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve reordered it many times.</li>
            <li> I love this repair treatment.</li>
            <li> I really love it.    </li>
            <li> I am glad I did not pay alot for this product.</li>
            <li> I use it as a leave in conditioner when I wear my hair curly to give my hair more time to absorb the product.</li>
            <li> However, this one is more pricey.  </li>
            <li> I would buy it again when the price is more resonable.</li>
            <li> My hair gets more conditioned with each use.</li>
            <li> That showed instant results for a really great price!!</li>
            <li> I may not buy again until it is more</li>
            <li> This was the right consistency and I loved it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved the results after the first use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After reading the reviews, I had very high hopes that a really good conditioner would help the level of dryness and make it silkier.  </li>
            <li> This stuff will get you back to brilliant in no time.  </li>
            <li> Best $22 spent!</li>
            <li> I could easily comb my hair without any tangles.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Joico is an amazing brand of products I first started using them when my hair was fried after heat and color damage.</li>
            <li> Works great for long fine hair!</li>
            <li> it is very good for dry damaged hair.</li>
            <li> For damaged fine hair, this is a miracle worker.</li>
            <li> I got a sample pack of this product when I purchased  Joico&#x27;s Smooth Cure Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
            <li> After one treatment, my hair is silky, smooth, shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li> I am happy to report (despite the inaccurate product photo, bottle has been redesigned and Cap totally different now) that I got a legit tube of product from &amp;#34;TheSmartLook&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> You are welcome to contact me later.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it and left it in while going to the beach or pool, and it works great.</li>
            <li> and please, use sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li> Fantastic for damedged hair.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t make my hair any better don&#x27;t buy if you want to work right away</li>
            <li> love this great for fine thin hair works better for me than conditioners 3x the price!</li>
            <li> i got all excited , when i went to use the product it was not creamy like it should have been</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower while i continue to clean my body...</li>
            <li> :B005K09UV0 Joico K Pak Revitaluxe Treatment, 16.2 Fluid Ounce]] and find it to be more cost effective.</li>
            <li> to damage) brittle, flat hair, into full, bouncy, shiny, soft, smooth, healthy looking, beautiful hair.    </li>
            <li> I finally can stop searching for a good hair product.</li>
            <li> The seller did a good job in communicating with me about needing to substitute some smaller sizes for the one I ordered.  </li>
            <li> Although I did purchase it, because I read nothing but good reviews about this product and when I do use it, I will come back and give it another review.</li>
            <li> i have boughten this before from my hairstylist and just loved the product , so when i saw this on amazon at a cheaper cost and a bigger bottle</li>
            <li> Product is lightweight and offers a nice scent.</li>
            <li> None the less, it does work and really does make the cuticle and core of the hair happy!  </li>
            <li> The first place I searched was AMAZON.COM and very quickly found it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The seller shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li> Everything got sorted out quickly and it was no time before I was using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is just as smooth when using Suave with Keratin-- also much cheaper!</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what is says!</li>
            <li> I use the Joico to strengthen and repair, since I heat style my hair (I blow dry and flat iron twice a week) and the Alter ego I used because It makes my hair amazingly shiny like glass, soft, smooth, bouncy and beautiful.</li>
            <li> They are nothing short of amazing.</li>
            <li> If you use this once a week it seems to soften your hair and keeps the color looking fresh.</li>
            <li> Worth the 4 stars just for that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised this didn&#x27;t get better reviews..</li>
            <li> I have never encountered a product by this company that isn&#x27;t worth the money!!1</li>
            <li> so I ordered it right then,</li>
            <li> All right with the the purchase and delivery.</li>
            <li> All right, I recommend.</li>
            <li> my hair sucked this right up</li>
            <li> You just need a little bit and works amazing!</li>
            <li> : I have been using this product for a year and a half now and love it more than ever.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and the Revitaluxe definitely adds volume and body without feeling like my hair is coated with anything.</li>
            <li> The product is good but a little pricey, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is rather thin &amp; I did not find it to be very good at managing my unruly hair.</li>
            <li> After the first time I have left it on in the shower probably longer than 5 minutes, so I think the longer you can leave it on the better the results.</li>
            <li> I did use entire bottle just to make sure.</li>
            <li> Love this deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> I find my hair feels and looks much better than it did prior to use it</li>
            <li> I got it much cheaper than I would have paid in the salon!</li>
            <li> It works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> I am not yet able to review this product because I have used it only once.</li>
            <li> First time using this</li>
            <li> Regular KPak treatment is much better.</li>
            <li> My aunts a cosmotolegist &amp; she recommended this to me because i have severely damaged hair.. &amp; it really does work!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it claims, it rapairs and strengthens damaged hair, lacking protein.</li>
            <li> This product has helped my hair so much!</li>
            <li> Makes you hair more manageable whirl repairing it at the same time.</li>
            <li> so the ends are bleached and pretty damaged.</li>
            <li> The price is pretty affordable too.</li>
            <li> One the first use</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I was really amazed!</li>
            <li> It actually has hurt my hair more.</li>
            <li> and I curl it pretty often on super high heat, (which I know isn&#x27;t the smartest..)</li>
            <li> I believe the fragrance that is used is a popular scent as I&#x27;ve smelled this scent on other women</li>
            <li> I used a pretty large amount of it, because for some reason I couldn&#x27;t feel it in my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair falls out in the shower, and is now more brittle and dry than it was before I started using it.  </li>
            <li> leaves your hair super soft, i use it about 2-3 times a week.</li>
            <li> but, I don&#x27;t want such a strong scent in my hair product.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m definitely going to be purchasing a 2nd bottle soon and probably other products they carry - my hair was soft and full of life again this really is better than most high-end products I have used!</li>
            <li> But when I rinsed it and dried it it was amazing.</li>
            <li> but im very upset..</li>
            <li> I really thought there was no hope for me.</li>
            <li> So much cheaper than at beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m still really concerned about things like UV damage (I play outdoor sports).  </li>
            <li> It was a real life saver for my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not noticing much of a difference when using this product.  </li>
            <li> This product has really helped my hair to feel thicker &amp; to repair the ends.  </li>
            <li> one evening and the Lady from Tabatha take over Salons was on the show and she recommend this product alone with some hair vitimans it really works.</li>
            <li> so I have to really give it some moisture to the ends, etc.  </li>
            <li> I really want to use the word \\&quot;stench\\&quot; but that&#x27;s rather subjective ...&lt;</li>
            <li> I bought this Joico KPack not thinking it would do much I read the reviews after</li>
            <li> After using joico my hair was repaired and it really helped take care of all the damage and breakage in my hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> The only thing is, it does seem to be most effective when you first use it, I don&#x27;t know that the results really last through another wash, definitely not through a couple, because my hair is back to misbehaving by then.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I wish this could be used daily, it&#x27;s like a great hair day in a little tube!</li>
            <li> It did not come in the original box (only Joico product that does BTW), and the &amp;#34;off smell&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> so I was excited to try this when a sales rep at my local beauty supply store told me this could help repair my hair.</li>
            <li> what else can you say when more than half is mixed with FREE water!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I never blow it dry, use very mild shampoo &amp; always leave conditioner in for 5+ minutes.  </li>
            <li> Decent price, though.</li>
            <li> I used the K-pak Deep Penetrating Reconstuctor regularly despite coloring and perming my hair and I received many compliments on the softness of my hair.</li>
            <li> Based on the cost, I would have presumed a professional product such as this product would have given me my money&#x27;s worth, unfortunately not.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone with damaged or over processed hair.</li>
            <li> Even after the first use, my highlighted (bleached), aging hair (over 50) became so soft again that I&#x27;ve decided not to cut it short right away.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my hair colorist and I&#x27;m not usually one for fancy restorative hair masks, but this is one that has changed my mind!</li>
            <li> I always put a little more conditioner in after showering &amp; leave it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> THINK IT WAS THAT GREAT SORRY.</li>
            <li> I normally have unruly, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> it worked good but not great.</li>
            <li> bugs me a little knowing more than likely why its not 100% right.  </li>
            <li> I expected my hair to be soft, detangled easily and pliable like the JOICO Moisture Recovery.   </li>
            <li> I would use hand fulls of conditioner and even more styling products to try to tame it.  </li>
            <li> I use it after shampoo and also sometimes as live in conditioner</li>
            <li> It was a complete waste of money and precious strands.</li>
            <li> It feels safe to use everyday so far.</li>
            <li> I used the item but couldn&#x27;t really tell a major difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair very soft and shiny (feels like it boosts color too</li>
            <li> Compared to all the other treatments I have bought in the past Joico is amazing!</li>
            <li> usually have a lot more to say about a product, but</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> All that has been fixed!</li>
            <li> This is the first product that actually has worked to get rid of my frizzes.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down and it feels conditioned and soft afterwards.  </li>
            <li> The initial reviews were so positive, I decided to buy this product hoping that it would save my hair breakage.  </li>
            <li> i tried the 1oz first and it was super small</li>
            <li> Product seemed to be old.</li>
            <li> yet not too soft it will not hold my style.</li>
            <li> I have never lost so much hair from this product than any of the numerous products that I have purchased.  </li>
            <li> I am transitioning with the use of keratin treatments from relaxed to my natural type 4b hair.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend it to anyone who wants to try a deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> I color my hair frequently</li>
            <li> My hair was so soft I couldn&#x27;t stop running my fingers through my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and managable after 1 week.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it once so far</li>
            <li> It really helps your hair come back to life</li>
            <li> , that I added my old one after rinsing to ensure I could brush it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it makes my hair soft and shiny and doesn&#x27;t make it greasy.</li>
            <li> Terrific for naturally curly hair which tends to dry out easily and becomes coarse and brittle.&lt;br /&gt;Great PRICE!</li>
            <li> but now whenever I use it my hair is really soft, shiny, and is less frizzy (which is saying something, since I have super stubborn frizz that doesn&#x27;t seem to have a reaction to a lot of products).</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s possible that some ladies received older product..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure, but so far i&#x27;m not disappointed in mine..</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin hair, and it has been breaking off.  </li>
            <li> A lot of people are saying it&#x27;s watered down &amp; doesn&#x27;t smell right..</li>
            <li> Had major hair breakage</li>
            <li> I usually feel that those OTC 3-minute hair masks from neutrogena and etc, are fine enough for my hair.</li>
            <li> then Shea moisture for a blonde and natural hair in</li>
            <li> I purchased this product with high hopes of it helping my dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Or Alter ego Energizing and rebalancing conditioner if it is normal or dry.</li>
            <li> (there are some conditioners much more expensive that I have tried for my frizzy hair that didn&#x27;t work near as well, so</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because my hair was thinning in the top , and I had tried several other products in the past that wasn,t working.</li>
            <li> Strangely it reminds me of some of the Retro Mary Kay scents in their Mature Skin lotions...  </li>
            <li> This product was watered down, and I know this because I got the REAL thing from a salon in my town.  </li>
            <li> If your hair does not have a protein loss problem, this may not be for you, as ironicaly too much protein will have the same effect as too little protein.</li>
            <li> My hair is no long dry especially at the ends where I am having issues retaining length.</li>
            <li> I had some grey hair which was growing in as coarse and kinky.</li>
            <li> used this product only once as the directions was not clear on frequency of usage.  </li>
            <li> If anything it left my hair feeling dry.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was watered down, left on the shelf too long, or just not a good batch, but the product came out of the original packaging, and was not sealed in any way.</li>
            <li> My hair is long strawberry blonde hair that is dry, tangly &amp; prone to feeling like straw.  </li>
            <li> It does not take long...</li>
            <li> and i like to keep it long.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used Joico products in a long time</li>
            <li> have very damaged, fairly thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a week ,its really thick and it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I do believe the tube was a little older judging from the production code and slightly</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering this again when this bottle is empty!</li>
            <li> It is similar to other products that I have been using.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I will blend it in with my other conditioners until it&#x27;s gone, but definitely not buying again.</li>
            <li> I was originally sent the wrong item</li>
            <li> I have very tight coily hair and this product did not make my hair soft or manageable after use</li>
            <li> so I gave it a try for my dry frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> However, after using Revitaluxe my hair was dry and felt asperous.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry from color and weather, could be my type of hair?</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t foam or lather nor feel &amp;#34;slippery&amp;#34; in the shower, but after hair is dry, I can notice that my hair is healthier and softer.</li>
            <li> Joico makes a variety of K-PAK treatments for dry damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> This product works well, I would recommend it for dry hair</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s dry and frizzy</li>
            <li> and when I blew it dry</li>
            <li> I learned of this product via Dr. OZ to help revitalize dry &amp; damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product to aid in strenghtening my hair during this delicate process particularly at the demarcation line.  </li>
            <li> I use this brand on a regular basis and feel that this was either fraudulant or watered down.</li>
            <li> it is very dry latley</li>
            <li> If in the other hand, your hair is just dry, and therefor breaking and frizzing up, you need a moisturizing conditioner instead.</li>
            <li> When I first used it I was disappointed because it didn&#x27;t seem to make much of a difference.</li>
            <li> I have heavy blonde highlights my hair is thin/lot of it</li>
            <li> Really was not great on my hair which is relaxed.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> A must try if your hair is dry and needs a boost!!</li>
            <li> actually just made it feel stiff and</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s probably due to the shine), doesn&#x27;t seem to build up.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference over my other hair treatment products.</li>
            <li> Compared to the other Joico treatments, this one does not weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li> and I mean SLIGHTLY different smell.  </li>
            <li> After using this product around 1-2x a week (every other time I wash my hair), you see the difference!</li>
            <li> previous review of this product was deleted, so I&#x27;m guessing that will happen again.</li>
            <li> This was suggested to me by my salon hair stylist which I did buy at the salon but after running out found it here for less...</li>
            <li> What a huge disappointment for the Joico name!</li>
            <li> It was dry and hard to manage.  </li>
            <li> It is so damaged I was forced to cut off about an inch, but the ends were still so dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> Throw out your other products and try Joico!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know whether I just needed to use it a few times or what,</li>
            <li> I am a swimmer and have been looking for a solution to the dried out hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really heavy musky smell.</li>
            <li> I had really short broken off bangs that would stick up in the air.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally prone to split ends as I HAVE to get a trim once a month because the ends get so dry that it gets impossible to even run my fingers through the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> Thought that was a little shady....</li>
            <li> I washed my hair as usual, used less conditioner than usual and after rinsing, applied Joico K-Pak Revitaluxe Restorative Treatment for 3 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately i have to cut off all the dead ends and spend tons of money trying different products trying to restore and hydrate it.</li>
            <li> Not a good as other joico products .</li>
            <li> takes very little</li>
            <li> This along with weekly Virgin Coconut oil masks, have transformed my damaged, weak, dry, dull, thin(due</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your hard earned money on this s***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got this for my color treated hair which is usually styled with blow dryer and styling iron.</li>
            <li> However, this is for hair suffering from protein loss which is usually the case for hair that is chemicaly treated, or damaged by chemicals or exesive use of heat.</li>
            <li> No more dryness or split ends.  </li>
            <li> I wash, toss a little gel in and go!!</li>
            <li> I would give it a negative score, but it does allow me to.  </li>
            <li> so my hair definitely suffers from breakage and weakness, especially at the ends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now used it 3 times, leaving it in for at least 10 to 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Not as thick and creamy as I was hoping.</li>
            <li> I have thick permed hair that is also colored.  </li>
            <li> Rinse it out with as cold a temperature as you can stand then squeeze and air dry your hair.  </li>
            <li> The treatment is very thick, had a hard time washing it out.</li>
            <li> If your hair is in bad shape, it may take several treatments.</li>
            <li> This is the worst product I have ever purchased and trust me, I have spent a vast amount of money over my years on hair care products.</li>
            <li> Felt horrible on my hair and really did nothing for it.</li>
            <li> Hair was in poor condition and now it stopped falling out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the product I bought was not the same that was given me , very disappointed , it seems the product and fake .</li>
            <li> WAY TO EXPENSIVE</li>
            <li> But it is expensive.</li>
            <li> Im sorry</li>
            <li> Heals, repairs, beautifies, and makes hair grow like crazy.</li>
            <li> it was all watery and had a bad smell to it .</li>
            <li> Very Disappointed.....</li>
            <li> Was awful.</li>
            <li> It was awful and did nothing for my hair.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Terrific for naturally curly hair which tends to dry out easily and becomes coarse and brittle.&lt;br /&gt;Great PRICE!</li>
            <li> This product is great if you color.  If you use this once a week it seems to soften your hair and keeps the color looking fresh.</li>
            <li> Works well as a deep conditioner. Tabatha Coffey recommended it on the Dr. Oz show, and I love me some Tabatha so I gave it a try for my dry frizzy hair. When I first used it I was disappointed because it didn&#x27;t seem to make much of a difference. I don&#x27;t know whether I just needed to use it a few times or what, but now whenever I use it my hair is really soft, shiny, and is less frizzy (which is saying something, since I have super stubborn frizz that doesn&#x27;t seem to have a reaction to a lot of products). Basically a really good hair day (or days I guess depending on your hair washing regimen). After the first time I have left it on in the shower probably longer than 5 minutes, so I think the longer you can leave it on the better the results. The only thing is, it does seem to be most effective when you first use it, I don&#x27;t know that the results really last through another wash, definitely not through a couple, because my hair is back to misbehaving by then. While it is a bit pricey for using as a conditioner every time, I am still going to try that (there are some conditioners much more expensive that I have tried for my frizzy hair that didn&#x27;t work near as well, so it is worth it to me) and see if I get these great results each time.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time. Product seemed to be old. It was separated even after shaking and making sure it was room temp. Felt horrible on my hair and really did nothing for it. I did use entire bottle just to make sure. Was awful. Would not recommend!</li>
            <li> Not as thick and creamy as I was hoping. Decent price, though.</li>
            <li> Love this deep conditioner. It does not take long...I use it in the shower while i continue to clean my body...rinse my hair and it is like silk...yet not too soft it will not hold my style.</li>
            <li> This is the worst product I have ever purchased and trust me, I have spent a vast amount of money over my years on hair care products. Based on the cost, I would have presumed a professional product such as this product would have given me my money&#x27;s worth, unfortunately not. I have never lost so much hair from this product than any of the numerous products that I have purchased.  The initial reviews were so positive, I decided to buy this product hoping that it would save my hair breakage.  I would give it a negative score, but it does allow me to.  Let the buyer beware....</li>
            <li> This product was watered down, and I know this because I got the REAL thing from a salon in my town.  Don&#x27;t waste your hard earned money on this s***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually have a lot more to say about a product, but what else can you say when more than half is mixed with FREE water!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My previous review of this product was deleted, so I&#x27;m guessing that will happen again. Whoever is deleting these reviews - you stink!!</li>
            <li> ok so i payed quite a bit for this product. i tried the 1oz first and it was super small i used it in 2 uses. i loved this product so i bought this one.. it arrived today when i opened the package the product was all over the inside. when i opened it, it was just ALL OVER. i dont know if this is the sellers fault or packaging or ups WHOEVER i do not know but im very upset.. i payed good money and they could have atleast checked to see if it was IN GOOD SHAPE!</li>
            <li> Great product, I don&#x27;t use it every time I wash my hair</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t came with box, but products seems legit</li>
            <li> I am transitioning with the use of keratin treatments from relaxed to my natural type 4b hair.  I bought this product to aid in strenghtening my hair during this delicate process particularly at the demarcation line.  I expected my hair to be soft, detangled easily and pliable like the JOICO Moisture Recovery.   However, after using Revitaluxe my hair was dry and felt asperous. By the time I finished detangling it, I collected 2 medium size balls of hair! It was a complete waste of money and precious strands. If you want hair on your head and not in the trash don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li> I am a swimmer and have been looking for a solution to the dried out hair. My hair breaks off and has tons of split ends and i like to keep it long. Unfortunately i have to cut off all the dead ends and spend tons of money trying different products trying to restore and hydrate it. THIS STUFF IS SERIOUSLY AMAZING! if you are looking for the ah-ha moment and something that just exceeds expectations this is the product! My teammates and I couldn&#x27;t believe how nice it made my hair after just one use! I ordered the shampoo and conditioner revitaluxe k-pak after seeing such great results from this! Best $22 spent!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d hear about this product from the Dr Oz show. I&#x27;ve tried so many hair conditioners, packs and masks..some expensive, and while they were ok, nothing has matched the results of this revitaluxe. Even after the first use, my highlighted (bleached), aging hair (over 50) became so soft again that I&#x27;ve decided not to cut it short right away. Its not greasy, just gave my hair that good salon result feelings. Love it. I finally can stop searching for a good hair product.</li>
            <li> Wow! What a difference this product has made. I got a sample pack of this product when I purchased  Joico&#x27;s Smooth Cure Shampoo and Conditioner. I washed my hair as usual, used less conditioner than usual and after rinsing, applied Joico K-Pak Revitaluxe Restorative Treatment for 3 minutes.  My hair has not looked this healthy since I was a child! I normally have unruly, frizzy hair. I had some grey hair which was growing in as coarse and kinky. All that has been fixed! After one treatment, my hair is silky, smooth, shiny and manageable. I&#x27;m amazed at the difference this treatment has made in my hair. I really thought there was no hope for me. Thank you Joico!!! Please NEVER discontinue this product. It is fantastic!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 5/5/13: I have been using this product for a year and a half now and love it more than ever. I have eliminated using another conditioner with it because it works great without any additional conditioners. I have started buying [[ASIN:B005K09UV0 Joico K Pak Revitaluxe Treatment, 16.2 Fluid Ounce]] and find it to be more cost effective. I also find using the pump handy.</li>
            <li> the product I bought was not the same that was given me , very disappointed , it seems the product and fake .</li>
            <li> I am happy to report (despite the inaccurate product photo, bottle has been redesigned and Cap totally different now) that I got a legit tube of product from &amp;#34;TheSmartLook&amp;#34;.  Worth the 4 stars just for that and the good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I do believe the tube was a little older judging from the production code and slightly and I mean SLIGHTLY different smell.  None the less, it does work and really does make the cuticle and core of the hair happy!  It adds good slip and brush-ability.  I subtracted one star for two reasons.  1.  It did not come in the original box (only Joico product that does BTW), and the &amp;#34;off smell&amp;#34; bugs me a little knowing more than likely why its not 100% right.  It should have a light kind of creamy floral note to it.  Strangely it reminds me of some of the Retro Mary Kay scents in their Mature Skin lotions...  Must be the Keratin and Protein that does that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note &amp;#34;TheSmartLook&amp;#34; seems to have disappeared off Amazon... Concerning??!?</li>
            <li> I find my hair feels and looks much better than it did prior to use it takes very little you don&#x27;t want to put but a dab</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my shampoo and conditioner!  The price was great, the product is great(recommended by my beautician). I got it much cheaper than I would have paid in the salon!</li>
            <li> Great product, really makes a difference on your hair.  Would recommend it to anyone who wants to try a deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> I saw Tabatha Coffey recommend this on a talk show recently so I wanted to try it.  It works pretty well.  The seller did a good job in communicating with me about needing to substitute some smaller sizes for the one I ordered.  They even threw in an extra one.  I&#x27;d definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I DIDN&#x27;T THINK IT WORKED GREAT LIKE I HAD HEARD ON YOUTUBE...WAY TO EXPENSIVE AND I DIDN&#x27;T THINK IT WAS THAT GREAT SORRY.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised this didn&#x27;t get better reviews..&lt;br /&gt;I have very damaged, fairly thick wavy hair. It is so damaged I was forced to cut off about an inch, but the ends were still so dry and brittle. I color my hair frequently (I go through total color changes multiple times a year) so I was excited to try this when a sales rep at my local beauty supply store told me this could help repair my hair. I used a pretty large amount of it, because for some reason I couldn&#x27;t feel it in my hair. But when I rinsed it and dried it it was amazing. My hair was so soft I couldn&#x27;t stop running my fingers through my hair. I could easily comb my hair without any tangles. And my hair was so swingy and bouncy. I wish this could be used daily, it&#x27;s like a great hair day in a little tube! Try it! You have nothing to lose...</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my hair colorist and I&#x27;m not usually one for fancy restorative hair masks, but this is one that has changed my mind! I usually feel that those OTC 3-minute hair masks from neutrogena and etc, are fine enough for my hair. However, in comparison, this mask does not just restore moisture, but it definitely does restore protein! I color my hair every 3-4 months and I curl it pretty often on super high heat, (which I know isn&#x27;t the smartest..) so my hair definitely suffers from breakage and weakness, especially at the ends. After using this product around 1-2x a week (every other time I wash my hair), you see the difference! So don&#x27;t hesistate if you are in between buying this K-pak versus an OTC one.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what is says! I would highly recommend this to anyone with damaged or over processed hair. It pays to purchase and use Joico. I have never encountered a product by this company that isn&#x27;t worth the money!!1</li>
            <li> It smelled ok, however I myself did not get great results?  My hair is dry from color and weather, could be my type of hair?</li>
            <li> So much cheaper than at beauty supply store. Also one of the best restorative treatments out there.</li>
            <li> Left my severely chemically damaged hair feeling like silk.  I will definitely be ordering this again when this bottle is empty!</li>
            <li> I was on Amazon when this product was featured by a guest on Dr. Oz so I ordered it right then, but, when I looked at it again a couple hours later it doubled in price.  Thought that was a little shady....it worked good but not great.</li>
            <li> I cannot rate this product, because I have not used it yet. Although I did purchase it, because I read nothing but good reviews about this product and when I do use it, I will come back and give it another review.</li>
            <li> Hair damaged at bit by heat or product?  This stuff will get you back to brilliant in no time.  It&#x27;s amazing!  Wash your hair in the hottest temperature you can stand then apply this stuff and let it sit for 10 minutes.  Rinse it out with as cold a temperature as you can stand then squeeze and air dry your hair.  I don&#x27;t use heat, color or product but I&#x27;m still really concerned about things like UV damage (I play outdoor sports).  This stuff makes mine feel like silk.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I am not yet able to review this product because I have used it only once. You are welcome to contact me later.</li>
            <li> I got this for my color treated hair which is usually styled with blow dryer and styling iron. My hair feels great after the first use. It doesn&#x27;t foam or lather nor feel &amp;#34;slippery&amp;#34; in the shower, but after hair is dry, I can notice that my hair is healthier and softer. It feels safe to use everyday so far.</li>
            <li> I love Joico products!!!.  A stylist and friend said I should try this.  I have thick permed hair that is also colored.  It was dry and hard to manage.  I would use hand fulls of conditioner and even more styling products to try to tame it.  I used this for a week and also got the Joico shampoo &amp; conditioners. I will never use another product.  My hair is soft and managable after 1 week.  I wash, toss a little gel in and go!! Throw out your other products and try Joico!! it works :)</li>
            <li> love this great for fine thin hair works better for me than conditioners 3x the price!</li>
            <li> I remember using Joico in the 80&#x27;s.  I&#x27;m still a fan of the KPAK conditioner.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down and it feels conditioned and soft afterwards.  I&#x27;ve used the shampoos too, and I&#x27;m a fan.  I use the KPAK about once a week for a good conditioning treatment.  I&#x27;ve used it and left it in while going to the beach or pool, and it works great.</li>
            <li> This is the bomb buy it better then Shea moisture for a blonde and natural hair in and you can leave it for 2-3 mind not 30</li>
            <li> All right with the the purchase and delivery.</li>
            <li> Not a good as other joico products . didn&#x27;t make my hair any better don&#x27;t buy if you want to work right away</li>
            <li> My friend who is a stylist recommended this product to me because I over processed and damaged my hair with hair color and bleach. My hair was breaking off and I was terrified that I was going to be bald. This product smoothed the hair follicle and prevented further damage to my hair. It was a real life saver for my hair. I don&#x27;t know what I would&#x27;ve done without it. Now my hair is healthier and stronger. I use this product every time I wash my hair.(about 2 days a week) I leave it at the ends for 10 minutes while I shower. Once I rinse out my hair, I can feel the difference IMMEDIATELY. If your hair is damaged, you need this.</li>
            <li> The Joico K-Pack line work so well to treat and restore damaged or colored hair. Easy to use and goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I bought some of the Joice products after doing the hair quiz at [...] I absolutely loved the results after the first use. My hair is no long dry especially at the ends where I am having issues retaining length. I have fine/medium hair and the Joico K-Pak has been the best product thusfar for my relaxed fine/meduim hair texture. I will be using this line from now on, even after trying Mizani, Aphogee and Aveda products which are all good, but Joico gives me the moisturizing that my hair craves.</li>
            <li> Joico makes a variety of K-PAK treatments for dry damaged hair.  I had tried the K-PAK with Revitaluxe from a sample at my salon.  Compared to the other Joico treatments, this one does not weigh my hair down.  I have very fine hair and the Revitaluxe definitely adds volume and body without feeling like my hair is coated with anything.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was watered down, left on the shelf too long, or just not a good batch, but the product came out of the original packaging, and was not sealed in any way. It was watery, and not at all what I am used to using.</li>
            <li> First time using this and I love it! Compared to all the other treatments I have bought in the past Joico is amazing! Literally like crack for your hair!</li>
            <li> I recommend this to everyone! It&#x27;s a miracle treatment for your hair! Leaves it shiny and so smooth! You just need a little bit and works amazing! I love love love it!</li>
            <li> Works great for long fine hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it once so far and I already see a difference in my hair. Such a great product! :)</li>
            <li> This did nothing at all for my hair. If anything it left my hair feeling dry. Regular KPak treatment is much better.</li>
            <li> I have very tight coily hair and this product did not make my hair soft or manageable after use</li>
            <li> This product works well, I would recommend it for dry hair</li>
            <li> I use it after shampoo and also sometimes as live in conditioner and it really works great. The product is good but a little pricey, I recommend this product. I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> i have boughten this before from my hairstylist and just loved the product , so when i saw this on amazon at a cheaper cost and a bigger bottle i got all excited , when i went to use the product it was not creamy like it should have been it was all watery and had a bad smell to it . I wont be using this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not noticing much of a difference when using this product.  I&#x27;ll just continue to use the K-Pak Deep Penetrating Reconstructor for a fraction of the cost and get the results i&#x27;m expecting.</li>
            <li> My aunts a cosmotolegist &amp; she recommended this to me because i have severely damaged hair.. &amp; it really does work! I recently just got this &amp; I&#x27;m loving it! A lot of people are saying it&#x27;s watered down &amp; doesn&#x27;t smell right.. But i&#x27;ve actually purchased this through my aunt before.. the texture &amp; smell are the same as the one i had purchased from my aunts salon. So it&#x27;s possible that some ladies received older product.. I&#x27;m not sure, but so far i&#x27;m not disappointed in mine.. &amp; it came within 2 days after i had purchased it.</li>
            <li> My hair always feels wonderfully silky and healthy after using this.</li>
            <li> I loved this product...</li>
            <li> I bleach my hair a lot of this made my hair feel amazing. I use it about once a week.</li>
            <li> I loved this conditioner as it makes my thinning hair seem fuller and doesn&#x27;t make it frizzy looking.  I&#x27;ve reordered it many times.</li>
            <li> I have recently stopped coloring my hair and it&#x27;s dry and frizzy no matter what product I&#x27;ve used to condition it until I used Joico K-PAK Revitaluxe Bio-Advanced Restorative Treatment.  This is the first product that actually has worked to get rid of my frizzes.  I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I love this repair treatment. It does exactly what it claims, it rapairs and strengthens damaged hair, lacking protein. This along with weekly Virgin Coconut oil masks, have transformed my damaged, weak, dry, dull, thin(due to damage) brittle, flat hair, into full, bouncy, shiny, soft, smooth, healthy looking, beautiful hair.    However, this is for hair suffering from protein loss which is usually the case for hair that is chemicaly treated, or damaged by chemicals or exesive use of heat. If your hair does not have a protein loss problem, this may not be for you, as ironicaly too much protein will have the same effect as too little protein. It will result in lots of hair breakage. So take that into consideration. Lack of elasticity is a sign of protein loss, so if your hair has lost elasticity, this product is for you. If in the other hand, your hair is just dry, and therefor breaking and frizzing up, you need a moisturizing conditioner instead. Try Alter Ego Carota, if your hair is greasy. Or Alter ego Energizing and rebalancing conditioner if it is normal or dry. Or Alter Ego coconut conditioner, if moisture without oiliness is what your looking for. You won&#x27;t regret it. They are nothing short of amazing. I alternate between the Joico and the alter ego. Once a week I use the Joico and once a week the Alter ego, as I wash my 2c-3a curly, frizzy hair type every 3 days. I use the Joico to strengthen and repair, since I heat style my hair (I blow dry and flat iron twice a week) and the Alter ego I used because It makes my hair amazingly shiny like glass, soft, smooth, bouncy and beautiful. I really love it.    So take all this into consideration when buying this product. And do yourself a favor, and buy a bottle of Nutiva or Garden of life coconut oil, regardless of what kind of hair you have. You&#x27;ll be amazed at what it does with regular use. Heals, repairs, beautifies, and makes hair grow like crazy. Ah! and please, use sulfate free shampoo. It makes all the difference in the world. I use Lamas Beauty because they lather super good. But it is expensive. So try Now foods or the ones at Puritan Pride. They are cheaper and have good reviews. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> All right, I recommend.</li>
            <li> Fantastic for damedged hair. It really helps your hair come back to life and it smells devine. I love it!</li>
            <li> Wonderful for restoring my hair and adding moisture!</li>
            <li> I have wirey frizzy hair and the gray hairs tend to be short and wirey. I read a review from another customer that stated that it was an excellent conditioner for this hair type. I normally use the joico k-pak reconstruct conditioner and have been very happy with it but I thought I would give the revitaluxe a try. The conditioner is rather thin &amp; I did not find it to be very good at managing my unruly hair. I will be going back to the k-pak reconstruct.</li>
            <li> What a huge disappointment for the Joico name! I use this brand on a regular basis and feel that this was either fraudulant or watered down. It was awful and did nothing for my hair. I use the shampoo and conditioner, and they are wonderful. I am glad I did not pay alot for this product.</li>
            <li> I like this product. It adds shine and strengthens my hair as well.I use it as a leave in conditioner when I wear my hair curly to give my hair more time to absorb the product.</li>
            <li> It is similar to other products that I have been using.  However, this one is more pricey.  I would buy it again when the price is more resonable.</li>
            <li> This was the right consistency and I loved it. I wish it was the same consistency in the jar but it was too runny.</li>
            <li> This product has really helped my hair to feel thicker &amp; to repair the ends.  I have very fine, thin hair, and it has been breaking off.  This product has helped my hair so much! Saw it on an episode of Dr. Oz, so thought I&#x27;d try it.  Will definitely reorder!</li>
            <li> Had major hair breakage</li>
            <li> The hair stylist used this product on my hair and I loved it so I bought some. I feel it has helped my severly damaged hair.</li>
            <li> For damaged fine hair, this is a miracle worker. I used many Joico products but this is the best. Makes you hair more manageable whirl repairing it at the same time.</li>
            <li> I know this has rave reviews, but it didn&#x27;t work fo rme.  My hair is long strawberry blonde hair that is dry, tangly &amp; prone to feeling like straw.  I never blow it dry, use very mild shampoo &amp; always leave conditioner in for 5+ minutes.  I always put a little more conditioner in after showering &amp; leave it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the reviews, I had very high hopes that a really good conditioner would help the level of dryness and make it silkier.  I&#x27;ve now used it 3 times, leaving it in for at least 10 to 15 minutes.  My hair felt so straw-like with this product, that I added my old one after rinsing to ensure I could brush it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will blend it in with my other conditioners until it&#x27;s gone, but definitely not buying again.</li>
            <li> works great for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have ombre hair so the ends are bleached and pretty damaged. My hair is naturally prone to split ends as I HAVE to get a trim once a month because the ends get so dry that it gets impossible to even run my fingers through the ends of my hair. I&#x27;ve had this over two weeks and couldn&#x27;t be happier. Makes my hair very soft and shiny (feels like it boosts color too but that&#x27;s probably due to the shine), doesn&#x27;t seem to build up. Overall, recommend! The price is pretty affordable too.</li>
            <li> This product has gone way up in price since I ordered it! I will not be getting it again!  I know Tabatha rated it great on Dr. Oz show but she must be making $$$$$$ for saying that, in my opinion. Or if I have a client who likes it I will get it somewhere else then Amazon!</li>
            <li> One the first use I noticed a difference. My hair gets more conditioned with each use. Its moisturized and stronger with every use softening hair on contact. I love it! Purchased the larger version as well. Will definitely continue to use item.</li>
            <li> I saw this as a recommendation on Dr. Oz. I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference over my other hair treatment products.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because my hair was thinning in the top , and I had tried several other products in the past that wasn,t working. I was sitting watching Dr. Oz one evening and the Lady from Tabatha take over Salons was on the show and she recommend this product alone with some hair vitimans it really works. I strongly recommend this product. (Viviscal  Extra Strength Hair Nutrient)</li>
            <li> This product is great and improved my split ends</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unsure whether this product does anything beneficial or not. My hair is just as smooth when using Suave with Keratin-- also much cheaper!</li>
            <li> Love it!  Its a great treatment for colored hair.  No more dryness or split ends.  Adds shine.  Its great.  Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> The K-Pak revitalize conditions and adds to the Joico regimen.</li>
            <li> It works great! I use it before and after hair color.  Hair was in poor condition and now it stopped falling out.&lt;br /&gt;  Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;  Mahara</li>
            <li> My hair has been relaxed so I have to really give it some moisture to the ends, etc.  I use this product with heat cap for about 15 minutes when I shampoo.  Works for me!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see anyone else mention the smell of this product. I believe the fragrance that is used is a popular scent as I&#x27;ve smelled this scent on other women but it is definitely not my scent. It&#x27;s a really heavy musky smell. And it&#x27;s SO strong! I may be in the minority here but, I don&#x27;t want such a strong scent in my hair product. I really want to use the word \\&quot;stench\\&quot; but that&#x27;s rather subjective ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to go back to the Joico K Pak Deep Penetrating Reconstructor. It has a softer scent (banana) that fades within moments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do want to mention that the K-pak product will continue to repair your hair over time. If your hair is in bad shape, it may take several treatments. I used the K-pak Deep Penetrating Reconstuctor regularly despite coloring and perming my hair and I received many compliments on the softness of my hair.</li>
            <li> This is suppose to be for brittle hair, which is what I have, but it did nothing for me. The treatment is very thick, had a hard time washing it out.</li>
            <li> I bought this Joico KPack not thinking it would do much I read the reviews after and I have to agree this conditioner after one use made my hair feel like I just left the salon! I have heavy blonde highlights my hair is thin/lot of it and I have been growing it out it is very dry latley and when I applied this on my hair for 5 mintues my hair sucked this right up and when I blew it dry I was really amazed! I haven&#x27;t used Joico products in a long time but I&#x27;m definitely going to be purchasing a 2nd bottle soon and probably other products they carry - my hair was soft and full of life again this really is better than most high-end products I have used! Finally someth. That showed instant results for a really great price!! A must try if your hair is dry and needs a boost!! Great job Joico! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product with high hopes of it helping my dry hair.  It actually has hurt my hair more. My hair falls out in the shower, and is now more brittle and dry than it was before I started using it.  Im sorry i bought it because now it sits in my bathroom closet. Very Disappointed.....</li>
            <li> I used the item but couldn&#x27;t really tell a major difference in my hair.  The seller shipped quickly.  I&#x27;m used to using WEN so I will just stick to that.</li>
            <li> This was suggested to me by my salon hair stylist which I did buy at the salon but after running out found it here for less...it is very good for dry damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my Stylist.  This product does what it says.  My hair is softer and supple.  I used it 2x per month. Product is lightweight and offers a nice scent.</li>
            <li> I was originally sent the wrong item but when I spoke to the seller my issue was met with amazing customer service! Everything got sorted out quickly and it was no time before I was using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joico is an amazing brand of products I first started using them when my hair was fried after heat and color damage. I had really short broken off bangs that would stick up in the air. After using joico my hair was repaired and it really helped take care of all the damage and breakage in my hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this product it makes my hair soft and shiny and doesn&#x27;t make it greasy. I use it twice a week ,its really thick and it doesn&#x27;t take much. Like it a lot.</li>
            <li> leaves your hair super soft, i use it about 2-3 times a week.</li>
            <li> Really was not great on my hair which is relaxed.&lt;br /&gt;It actually just made it feel stiff and a bit hard.&lt;br /&gt;I  don&#x27;t think it damaged, cause I walways countered with a moisturising conditioner, it but it was of no benefit either.</li>
            <li> I learned of this product via Dr. OZ to help revitalize dry &amp; damaged hair.  The first place I searched was AMAZON.COM and very quickly found it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product only once as the directions was not clear on frequency of usage.  I may not buy again until it is more clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The buying experience with AMAZON.COM was excellent.</li>
            <li> Good seller and I like this hair mask.</li>
