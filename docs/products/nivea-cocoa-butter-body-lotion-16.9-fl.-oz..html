            <li>It works great and is kind to your pocketbook, as well.</li>
            <li>Nivea is a good brand and makes good products.</li>
            <li>This is a really good</li>
            <li>makes my skin feel good all day</li>
            <li>So getting a skin hydrator seemed like a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nivea has always been a good product and this is another one I will use.</li>
            <li>That means that in the fall and winter our skin can be exceptionally dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I have to point out the marks for anyone to notice them these days, which if phenomenal!</li>
            <li>Great for keeping skin smooth.</li>
            <li>I‚Äôve always liked cocoa butter as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I really liked this lotion a lot.</li>
            <li>Seems like a really nice lotion.</li>
            <li>Nice.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This really is one of the best lotions I&#x27;ve used, so I deal with the scent.</li>
            <li>This product had a nice, pleasant scent that was not too strong.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked Nivea lotions and this one has a nice, light pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>This was lovely to use after a two day road trip and a nice warm shower.  </li>
            <li>It has a light cocoa scent that smells good.</li>
            <li>This scent is so strong!</li>
            <li>Love love love!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m pretty happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t provide better relief than this.</li>
            <li>Yet, at the end of the day, they really don&#x27;t do more than this product.</li>
            <li>Perhaps, one day I will find something better.</li>
            <li>What more do you need from a lotion?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>love Nivea Creme,</li>
            <li>I love the benefits of cocoa butter</li>
            <li>When I used it, everything about it reminded me of the Eucerin lotion (which I love), even the scent, except</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>the more dessicated you will look, no matter how humid your environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this Nivea.  </li>
            <li>When I put lotion on, I want to be able to turn a switch to turn my lights out or to turn the door knob.  </li>
            <li>So many lotions just make my hands too greasy feeling but not this one.</li>
            <li>This Nivea has more of a perfume-like scent.</li>
            <li>I love summertime.&lt;br /&gt;Swimming.&lt;br</li>
            <li>love the way Nivea Body Lotion makes my legs look</li>
            <li>Jergens Shea Butter Body Lotion, a comparable product in scent and performance, costs $4.00 more on Amazon!&lt;br</li>
            <li>In addition, I love the cocoa butter fragrance.</li>
            <li>It just requires more use than would be required by a somewhat richer lotion.</li>
            <li>Greasy lotion will hydrate your skin for sure</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the cocoa butter lotion by them.</li>
            <li>I have never felt more confident in my skin before.</li>
            <li>After finishing the bottle, my skin was perfectly smooth and hydrated, and my stretchmarks were virtually gone!</li>
            <li>Use before bedtime - okay, that will work.  </li>
            <li>One note: if SPF could be added it would be even better.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion.</li>
            <li>Better, though, is the fact that it moisterizes so well, and soaks into your skin, leaving it soft and beautiful.  </li>
            <li>Somehow, NIVEA has managed to combine just the right ingredients in this pleasantly scented, smooth moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed using this fragrant, smooth lotion.</li>
            <li>importantly, it was found to be safe for your skin.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is sturdy and the pump easy to use.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>The lotion rubs in easily and doesn&#x27;t leave skin greasy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It looks simple, doesn&#x27;t make any huge life changing promises, but it was incredibly inexpensive.</li>
            <li>It applies easily, isn&#x27;t greasy, but skin feels and appears lubricated after use.</li>
            <li>It‚Äôs not too strong though</li>
            <li>So the Nivea Body Cocoa Butter Body Lotion is fine as a product.</li>
            <li>The Nivea Body Cocoa Butter Body Lotion is a fabulous addition to this category of product and it&#x27;s pretty amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>The product delivery system, bottle and pump function perfectly and the price is typical for this size.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And to be honest, I often love a new product - in the beginning.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased and I highly recommend this</li>
            <li>Something about the texture reminds me of the original Jergens, light and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>and I liked it so much</li>
            <li>This lotion does a great job of moisturizing my hairy arms without making a big mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This lotion really penetrates and lasts without being greasy and the moisturizing is quite effective.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>My daughter now wants her own supply</li>
            <li>it is fantastic for all types of skin!&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and feels silky.  </li>
            <li>Smooth on after a shower for ease of application.  </li>
            <li>The product went on smoothly, and was not greasy.</li>
            <li>This Nivea cocoa butter is as good as anything I‚Äôve used although the smell is different than most.</li>
            <li>Yes, it has cocoa butter, coconut oil, and other good stuff that provides the things that moisturize your skin, but there are many more ingredients that I can&#x27;t even pronounce.</li>
            <li>The bottle is a nice, generous size, with a wide top to the pump, which makes it very easy to use.</li>
            <li>It has a very mild scent, which I prefer, and tends to dissipate quickly.</li>
            <li>The lotion itself is wonderful, not too heavy and not too light, but softens my skin very well, even the areas with the most dryness.</li>
            <li>This lotion contains the dreaded parabens, methyl- and ethyl-, so if you&#x27;re one of the many who feel parabens are linked to cancer, be aware of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A rich, lightly-scented, non-greasy, hydrating body moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Traditionally, people use lotion for their hands and maybe their feet, but the idea of using it on your whole body is becoming more and more popular.</li>
            <li>Although this contains cocoa butter and coconut oil, it doesn&#x27;t smell like either -- but the scent is pleasant (and you could always sniff this at a store first before ordering, if you wanted to see if you liked the scent, since this brand is widely available).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great for dry skin.</li>
            <li>The lotion is nice and silky, goes on smoothly, absorbs well and makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>great on very dry skin</li>
            <li>It does a great job on those rough spots like elbows, knees and ankles.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;d be great if Nivea would create a more natural version of this same product.</li>
            <li>I use it after I workout and shower and the rest of the day my skin feels nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE 8/3/2016: After using this product for 2 years, plus trying many other lotions in-between, I still think is one of the best overall body lotions for the money.</li>
            <li>I bought it because I was pregnant and wanted something with cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>I am a smooth chocolate bar ;)</li>
            <li>In a light to rich scale, it is right in the middle, which probably is a tad lighter than I need, but it still works ok.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin super soft like no other lotion I have used before, and it smells amazing!</li>
            <li>It makes my skin super soft like no other lotion I have used before, and it smells amazing!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>totally absorbed, no sticky feel.</li>
            <li>Oh Nivea, it is my favorite lotion brand by far.</li>
            <li>I have always enjoyed using Nivea products in the past, so I was happy to receive this new Cocoa Butter body lotion.</li>
            <li>Love Nivea products never been disappointed this cream smells good with out the overwhelming coco butter smell and product moisturizers all day and keeps my skin comfortable till I shower !</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s not oily like most moisturizers, it absorbs quickly and lasts for a long time (I live in Utah, it&#x27;s super dry here, this stuff is great).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also happy that the lotion smell isn&#x27;t overpowering and my wife&#x27;s skin isn&#x27;t too slick (some lotions have that effect).</li>
            <li>It has a distinct smell which I enjoy and it works better than other types of moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mixed success with Nivea products (love the hand cream, don&#x27;t care for the CoQ10 cellulite cream).  </li>
            <li>It was also effective with helping my dry skin on my elbows and knees.</li>
            <li>It does contain parabens so watch out if you are avoiding those; you can see the full ingredients list on the main product</li>
            <li>The bottle is sturdy and the pump is generous --very broad and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Goes on really smooth and leaves skin feeling really soft, I just can&#x27;t take the smell.</li>
            <li>They said that they like it better than the last two brands of lotions they used.</li>
            <li>Like many things, women&#x27;s preferences are mysterious to me.</li>
            <li>so if that‚Äôs a concern to you please be aware.</li>
            <li>When I first tried it, there was a moment when I thought it would be greasy, but that sensation soon faded.</li>
            <li>The first three ingredients are Water, Glycerin and Isohexadecane.</li>
            <li>Since ingredients are listed in order of proportion of the product, the other ingredients are some kind of &amp;#34;helpers&amp;#34; to create the lotion.</li>
            <li>It left my skin nice and soft but not greasy.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t love all the ingredients, but it does perform well as a lotion and is at least as good as anything else in the same price range.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant scent and it really does last a long time on the skin.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>with pure relief.</li>
            <li>This lotion was able to not only soften my stretch mark scars, however it made them almost completely vanish!</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Fragrance is light coco and talc, and a question of personal fragrance.</li>
            <li>It is gentle, with a hint of the cocoa butter, which I appreciate, as I didn&#x27;t want to smell like a piece of chocolate candy, or like I was wearing a sun-tanning product.</li>
            <li>pump bottle makes it very convenient to use.</li>
            <li>The pump works really well.</li>
            <li>This looked perfect to use on my hands on cold days.</li>
            <li>I live in a part of the country where we have pretty much zero humidity.</li>
            <li>I live in hot, humid Florida</li>
            <li>I tried this first on my lower legs and they were really soft and smooth the next day.  </li>
            <li>It smells really nice too very tropical but not overwhelmingly so.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for that special product for several years now</li>
            <li>It must be true that smelling something can bring back memories.  </li>
            <li>recommend this to everyone and anyone who wants to try some new lotion.</li>
            <li>Frankly, I wish this had a slight better scent.  </li>
            <li>most cocoa butters smell - slightly vanilla-like.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The older you get</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it&#x27;s a</li>
            <li>Isohexadecane is a high purity, iso-paraffin emollient and solvent used in cosmetics and beauty</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a thick lotion, almost a body butter texture -- great for dry winter skin.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel very soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are some other multi-syllabic ingredients such as phenoxyethanol, sodium ceteargyl sulfate, sodium hydroxide, etc., used as preservatives or emulsifiers, for the most part.  </li>
            <li>only problem is: after a month of swimming and sunbathing, my legs look don&#x27;t look to pretty in shorts.  </li>
            <li>I find the aroma a bit strong but certainly not intolerable and it diminishes considerably in a short while.</li>
            <li>If your skin feels &#x27;thirsty&#x27; frequently, give it a drink of this.</li>
            <li>but I wanted something lighter for daily use on my whole body.</li>
            <li>Like it so much i will likely keep using it after the baby comes.</li>
            <li>It just dries out because it&#x27;s old skin.  </li>
            <li>(Listen up, young grasshoppers)</li>
            <li>This product does not have an all natural ingredient list</li>
            <li>Putting it on after shower, it lasts about 8 hours if you do not wash hands frequently; and 4 to 6 hours if you do.</li>
            <li>Seems to work nicely so far</li>
            <li>but I really wanted to review this based on the bottle, strangely enough!</li>
            <li>After getting stretch marks all over my body, I felt self conscious.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s moisturizing without being thick and fragrant without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Lotion\\&quot; due to the other having even more added chemical ingredients, and as far as body lotions go</li>
            <li>And I love the subtle scent.</li>
            <li>It looks decent enough to leave sitting on your counter and has a sturdy pump, which also has a lock feature if you are traveling with it.</li>
            <li>If you overdo it, it can feel a little bit greasy, but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>The coconut scent is light, not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I had large purple marks, and extremely dry hands and feet.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed for my dry skin type!!</li>
            <li>That third one was new to me</li>
            <li>My feet have always been super dry and rough and this keeps them soft as ever.</li>
            <li>Thick but absorbs easily.</li>
            <li>I swear by this lotion, and believe it is worth 10 times what all of those high end lotions that make endless empty promises are worth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Nivea usually has some pretty decent lotions, but this one is too runny.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is very similar to Eucerin Smoothing Repair Lotion to me, as far as the texture and the smell.</li>
            <li>It is completely locked solid.</li>
            <li>When I received this lotion in mail, the top screw-top cover was broken with lotion leaking all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I judge lotions not only by how soft it makes my skin and how long it keeps it soft but also by the greasy factor.  </li>
            <li>That is why I always come back after the occasional &#x27;side step&#x27; for the sake of being &#x27;open to&#x27; and trying something new.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give it a thumb&#x27;s in the middle until Nivea goes back to the drawing board and completely redesigns the pump.</li>
            <li>This is actually par for the course in major brand-name skin products from companies like Nivea, Olay, etc.  </li>
            <li>For years my wife has had a combination of body and hand lotions, and I&#x27;ve always associated the various feminine preparations with the general realm of beauty products.</li>
            <li>I have continued to use this as a general skin cream especially after being out of doors or immersed in water.</li>
            <li>This lotion is relatively thin and absorbs into the skin very quickly.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference yet in my skin other than my legs don&#x27;t feel as dry but find myself squirting it on my hands each time I pass by my vanity and dabbing it on my face and neck and rubbing it into my hands simply because I like how it feels and smells.</li>

            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I have to point out the marks for anyone to notice them these days, which if phenomenal!</li>
            <li> Great for keeping skin smooth.</li>
            <li> I‚Äôve always liked cocoa butter as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I really liked this lotion a lot.</li>
            <li> Seems like a really nice lotion.</li>
            <li> Nice.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This really is one of the best lotions I&#x27;ve used, so I deal with the scent.</li>
            <li> This product had a nice, pleasant scent that was not too strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Nivea lotions and this one has a nice, light pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li> This was lovely to use after a two day road trip and a nice warm shower.  </li>
            <li> It has a light cocoa scent that smells good.</li>
            <li> This scent is so strong!</li>
            <li> Love love love!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty happy with this product.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t provide better relief than this.</li>
            <li> Yet, at the end of the day, they really don&#x27;t do more than this product.</li>
            <li> Perhaps, one day I will find something better.</li>
            <li> What more do you need from a lotion?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> love Nivea Creme,</li>
            <li> I love the benefits of cocoa butter</li>
            <li> When I used it, everything about it reminded me of the Eucerin lotion (which I love), even the scent, except</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> the more dessicated you will look, no matter how humid your environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this Nivea.  </li>
            <li> When I put lotion on, I want to be able to turn a switch to turn my lights out or to turn the door knob.  </li>
            <li> So many lotions just make my hands too greasy feeling but not this one.</li>
            <li> This Nivea has more of a perfume-like scent.</li>
            <li> I love summertime.&lt;br /&gt;Swimming.&lt;br</li>
            <li> love the way Nivea Body Lotion makes my legs look</li>
            <li> Jergens Shea Butter Body Lotion, a comparable product in scent and performance, costs $4.00 more on Amazon!&lt;br</li>
            <li> In addition, I love the cocoa butter fragrance.</li>
            <li> It just requires more use than would be required by a somewhat richer lotion.</li>
            <li> Greasy lotion will hydrate your skin for sure</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the cocoa butter lotion by them.</li>
            <li> I have never felt more confident in my skin before.</li>
            <li> After finishing the bottle, my skin was perfectly smooth and hydrated, and my stretchmarks were virtually gone!</li>
            <li> Use before bedtime - okay, that will work.  </li>
            <li> One note: if SPF could be added it would be even better.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.</li>
            <li> Better, though, is the fact that it moisterizes so well, and soaks into your skin, leaving it soft and beautiful.  </li>
            <li> Somehow, NIVEA has managed to combine just the right ingredients in this pleasantly scented, smooth moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed using this fragrant, smooth lotion.</li>
            <li> importantly, it was found to be safe for your skin.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is sturdy and the pump easy to use.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> The lotion rubs in easily and doesn&#x27;t leave skin greasy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It looks simple, doesn&#x27;t make any huge life changing promises, but it was incredibly inexpensive.</li>
            <li> It applies easily, isn&#x27;t greasy, but skin feels and appears lubricated after use.</li>
            <li> It‚Äôs not too strong though</li>
            <li> So the Nivea Body Cocoa Butter Body Lotion is fine as a product.</li>
            <li> The Nivea Body Cocoa Butter Body Lotion is a fabulous addition to this category of product and it&#x27;s pretty amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> The product delivery system, bottle and pump function perfectly and the price is typical for this size.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And to be honest, I often love a new product - in the beginning.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased and I highly recommend this</li>
            <li> Something about the texture reminds me of the original Jergens, light and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> and I liked it so much</li>
            <li> This lotion does a great job of moisturizing my hairy arms without making a big mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This lotion really penetrates and lasts without being greasy and the moisturizing is quite effective.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> My daughter now wants her own supply</li>
            <li> it is fantastic for all types of skin!&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and feels silky.  </li>
            <li> Smooth on after a shower for ease of application.  </li>
            <li> The product went on smoothly, and was not greasy.</li>
            <li> This Nivea cocoa butter is as good as anything I‚Äôve used although the smell is different than most.</li>
            <li> Yes, it has cocoa butter, coconut oil, and other good stuff that provides the things that moisturize your skin, but there are many more ingredients that I can&#x27;t even pronounce.</li>
            <li> The bottle is a nice, generous size, with a wide top to the pump, which makes it very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It has a very mild scent, which I prefer, and tends to dissipate quickly.</li>
            <li> The lotion itself is wonderful, not too heavy and not too light, but softens my skin very well, even the areas with the most dryness.</li>
            <li> This lotion contains the dreaded parabens, methyl- and ethyl-, so if you&#x27;re one of the many who feel parabens are linked to cancer, be aware of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A rich, lightly-scented, non-greasy, hydrating body moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Traditionally, people use lotion for their hands and maybe their feet, but the idea of using it on your whole body is becoming more and more popular.</li>
            <li> Although this contains cocoa butter and coconut oil, it doesn&#x27;t smell like either -- but the scent is pleasant (and you could always sniff this at a store first before ordering, if you wanted to see if you liked the scent, since this brand is widely available).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> The lotion is nice and silky, goes on smoothly, absorbs well and makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> great on very dry skin</li>
            <li> It does a great job on those rough spots like elbows, knees and ankles.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;d be great if Nivea would create a more natural version of this same product.</li>
            <li> I use it after I workout and shower and the rest of the day my skin feels nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE 8/3/2016: After using this product for 2 years, plus trying many other lotions in-between, I still think is one of the best overall body lotions for the money.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I was pregnant and wanted something with cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> I am a smooth chocolate bar ;)</li>
            <li> In a light to rich scale, it is right in the middle, which probably is a tad lighter than I need, but it still works ok.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin super soft like no other lotion I have used before, and it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> It makes my skin super soft like no other lotion I have used before, and it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> totally absorbed, no sticky feel.</li>
            <li> Oh Nivea, it is my favorite lotion brand by far.</li>
            <li> I have always enjoyed using Nivea products in the past, so I was happy to receive this new Cocoa Butter body lotion.</li>
            <li> Love Nivea products never been disappointed this cream smells good with out the overwhelming coco butter smell and product moisturizers all day and keeps my skin comfortable till I shower !</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s not oily like most moisturizers, it absorbs quickly and lasts for a long time (I live in Utah, it&#x27;s super dry here, this stuff is great).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also happy that the lotion smell isn&#x27;t overpowering and my wife&#x27;s skin isn&#x27;t too slick (some lotions have that effect).</li>
            <li> It has a distinct smell which I enjoy and it works better than other types of moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mixed success with Nivea products (love the hand cream, don&#x27;t care for the CoQ10 cellulite cream).  </li>
            <li> It was also effective with helping my dry skin on my elbows and knees.</li>
            <li> It does contain parabens so watch out if you are avoiding those; you can see the full ingredients list on the main product</li>
            <li> The bottle is sturdy and the pump is generous --very broad and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Goes on really smooth and leaves skin feeling really soft, I just can&#x27;t take the smell.</li>
            <li> They said that they like it better than the last two brands of lotions they used.</li>
            <li> Like many things, women&#x27;s preferences are mysterious to me.</li>
            <li> so if that‚Äôs a concern to you please be aware.</li>
            <li> When I first tried it, there was a moment when I thought it would be greasy, but that sensation soon faded.</li>
            <li> The first three ingredients are Water, Glycerin and Isohexadecane.</li>
            <li> Since ingredients are listed in order of proportion of the product, the other ingredients are some kind of &amp;#34;helpers&amp;#34; to create the lotion.</li>
            <li> It left my skin nice and soft but not greasy.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t love all the ingredients, but it does perform well as a lotion and is at least as good as anything else in the same price range.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant scent and it really does last a long time on the skin.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> with pure relief.</li>
            <li> This lotion was able to not only soften my stretch mark scars, however it made them almost completely vanish!</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is light coco and talc, and a question of personal fragrance.</li>
            <li> It is gentle, with a hint of the cocoa butter, which I appreciate, as I didn&#x27;t want to smell like a piece of chocolate candy, or like I was wearing a sun-tanning product.</li>
            <li> pump bottle makes it very convenient to use.</li>
            <li> The pump works really well.</li>
            <li> This looked perfect to use on my hands on cold days.</li>
            <li> I live in a part of the country where we have pretty much zero humidity.</li>
            <li> I live in hot, humid Florida</li>
            <li> I tried this first on my lower legs and they were really soft and smooth the next day.  </li>
            <li> It smells really nice too very tropical but not overwhelmingly so.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for that special product for several years now</li>
            <li> It must be true that smelling something can bring back memories.  </li>
            <li> recommend this to everyone and anyone who wants to try some new lotion.</li>
            <li> Frankly, I wish this had a slight better scent.  </li>
            <li> most cocoa butters smell - slightly vanilla-like.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The older you get</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it&#x27;s a</li>
            <li> Isohexadecane is a high purity, iso-paraffin emollient and solvent used in cosmetics and beauty</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a thick lotion, almost a body butter texture -- great for dry winter skin.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel very soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are some other multi-syllabic ingredients such as phenoxyethanol, sodium ceteargyl sulfate, sodium hydroxide, etc., used as preservatives or emulsifiers, for the most part.  </li>
            <li> only problem is: after a month of swimming and sunbathing, my legs look don&#x27;t look to pretty in shorts.  </li>
            <li> I find the aroma a bit strong but certainly not intolerable and it diminishes considerably in a short while.</li>
            <li> If your skin feels &#x27;thirsty&#x27; frequently, give it a drink of this.</li>
            <li> but I wanted something lighter for daily use on my whole body.</li>
            <li> Like it so much i will likely keep using it after the baby comes.</li>
            <li> It just dries out because it&#x27;s old skin.  </li>
            <li> (Listen up, young grasshoppers)</li>
            <li> This product does not have an all natural ingredient list</li>
            <li> Putting it on after shower, it lasts about 8 hours if you do not wash hands frequently; and 4 to 6 hours if you do.</li>
            <li> Seems to work nicely so far</li>
            <li> but I really wanted to review this based on the bottle, strangely enough!</li>
            <li> After getting stretch marks all over my body, I felt self conscious.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s moisturizing without being thick and fragrant without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Lotion\\&quot; due to the other having even more added chemical ingredients, and as far as body lotions go</li>
            <li> And I love the subtle scent.</li>
            <li> It looks decent enough to leave sitting on your counter and has a sturdy pump, which also has a lock feature if you are traveling with it.</li>
            <li> If you overdo it, it can feel a little bit greasy, but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> The coconut scent is light, not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I had large purple marks, and extremely dry hands and feet.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed for my dry skin type!!</li>
            <li> That third one was new to me</li>
            <li> My feet have always been super dry and rough and this keeps them soft as ever.</li>
            <li> Thick but absorbs easily.</li>
            <li> I swear by this lotion, and believe it is worth 10 times what all of those high end lotions that make endless empty promises are worth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Nivea usually has some pretty decent lotions, but this one is too runny.  </li>
            <li> This lotion is very similar to Eucerin Smoothing Repair Lotion to me, as far as the texture and the smell.</li>
            <li> It is completely locked solid.</li>
            <li> When I received this lotion in mail, the top screw-top cover was broken with lotion leaking all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I judge lotions not only by how soft it makes my skin and how long it keeps it soft but also by the greasy factor.  </li>
            <li> That is why I always come back after the occasional &#x27;side step&#x27; for the sake of being &#x27;open to&#x27; and trying something new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it a thumb&#x27;s in the middle until Nivea goes back to the drawing board and completely redesigns the pump.</li>
            <li> This is actually par for the course in major brand-name skin products from companies like Nivea, Olay, etc.  </li>
            <li> For years my wife has had a combination of body and hand lotions, and I&#x27;ve always associated the various feminine preparations with the general realm of beauty products.</li>
            <li> I have continued to use this as a general skin cream especially after being out of doors or immersed in water.</li>
            <li> This lotion is relatively thin and absorbs into the skin very quickly.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference yet in my skin other than my legs don&#x27;t feel as dry but find myself squirting it on my hands each time I pass by my vanity and dabbing it on my face and neck and rubbing it into my hands simply because I like how it feels and smells.</li>
            <li> Just one use of this particular lotion, and the dry rough skin will vanish!</li>
            <li> At my age I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll suddenly have pretty skin, but at least I want it to reduce the drying out, and it seems to do that ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and this is just another in the long of disappointments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so my skin doesn&#x27;t dry out from the elements.  </li>
            <li> my dry arms aren&#x27;t so dry now.</li>
            <li> lotion itself is not too oily and not too dry.</li>
            <li> They look dry and scaly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I spend hundreds of dollars on products claiming to make stretch marks vanish, and help heal dry cracked skin  to no avail.</li>
            <li> My wife has extremely dry skin</li>
            <li> and it is helping her dry skin alot</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s recommended for Dry to Very Dry Skin, and it contains Vitamin E.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t like to use the same lotion every day, switching between a few based on how my skin feels at the time.</li>
            <li> With age (and yard work) I found that my skin (especially hands) were getting dried out and beginning to crack.</li>
            <li> it has sort of a bitter smell once applied.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I usually put apply this lotion all over my body once daily, after showering.</li>
            <li> Likewise, the other &amp;#34;helpers&amp;#34; that make up the Nivea Cocoa Butter are included as part of the lotion delivery system, added moisturizers or perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this Nivea lotion does contain perfume, in addition to other ingredients to aid in product flow, consistency, shelf-life, etc.</li>
            <li> I plunked it down on my desk and started using it.</li>
            <li> No more dry skin bumps!</li>
            <li> Aside from any of that, though, recently, I&#x27;ve had a serious bout with a cold and was constantly using tissues and washing hands, Nivea lotion helped considerably.</li>
            <li> IMO, there is no better lotion for very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I decided to try on my feet, and eve put a little on my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> For me, the smell is very obnoxious, but for others in the household, they are between not really smelling it to it isn&#x27;t bad, but has a \\&quot;different\\&quot; smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just kind of boring.</li>
            <li> I had to wash my hands a few times to get it off.</li>
            <li> Well, if you wait a couple of hours, that is true, but if you are hoping that you can rub it in and then not feel like your hands are covered in olive oil, you will be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> But I figured it would be hard to mess up cocoa butter lotion, so I gave this a try.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this one is so much stronger and lingers a lot longer, and makes me so sick.</li>
            <li> wire and a chunk of what appears to be hard glue sticking out of it.</li>
            <li> You know what I mean.</li>
            <li> That feels unpleasant here, especially in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> company has had a couple complaints, in the past, not with this product, but, regarding it&#x27;s advertising, falsely, in one instance and another for a map created for them, however, both were corrected to the satisfaction of complainants.</li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t for broken container, I would have given it 4 starts but</li>
            <li> Worse yet you can see a (rusted?)</li>
            <li> yes, decent lotion but the worst pump I&#x27;ve ever seen for this type of product.</li>
            <li> broken screw-top makes it difficult to use.</li>
            <li> It is by far the worst pump based container I have ever seen.</li>
            <li> But why spend $$ needlessly?</li>
            <li> I had terrible skin on my legs and this has gone a long way in improving it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad.  </li>
            <li> Although it does contain artificial fragrance, it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin (and I appreciate that it doesn&#x27;t contain dyes).  </li>
            <li> Obsessed with this lotion!</li>
            <li> Obsessed with this lotion!</li>
            <li> Once they do, I&#x27;ll re-review it but for now, just stay away from this thing as you&#x27;ll just end up with bad feelings towards the company.</li>
            <li> and it moisturizes the skin, but the packaging is terrible.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve had mixed success with Nivea products (love the hand cream, don&#x27;t care for the CoQ10 cellulite cream).  But I figured it would be hard to mess up cocoa butter lotion, so I gave this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty happy with this product.  Although it does contain artificial fragrance, it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin (and I appreciate that it doesn&#x27;t contain dyes).  It does contain parabens so watch out if you are avoiding those; you can see the full ingredients list on the main product page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a thick lotion, almost a body butter texture -- great for dry winter skin.  Despite the thickness, it absorbs into the skin without leaving residue.  I tried this first on my lower legs and they were really soft and smooth the next day.  Although this contains cocoa butter and coconut oil, it doesn&#x27;t smell like either -- but the scent is pleasant (and you could always sniff this at a store first before ordering, if you wanted to see if you liked the scent, since this brand is widely available).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I don&#x27;t love all the ingredients, but it does perform well as a lotion and is at least as good as anything else in the same price range.</li>
            <li> great on very dry skin</li>
            <li> IMO, there is no better lotion for very dry skin. Not at this great price! If your skin feels &#x27;thirsty&#x27; frequently, give it a drink of this. You&#x27;ll find yourself saying: &amp;#34;Aaaaahhhh&amp;#34;! with pure relief. Yes, there are bigger names (with much bigger prices) out there. But why spend $$ needlessly? They don&#x27;t provide better relief than this. That is why I always come back after the occasional &#x27;side step&#x27; for the sake of being &#x27;open to&#x27; and trying something new. And to be honest, I often love a new product - in the beginning. Yet, at the end of the day, they really don&#x27;t do more than this product. So, I come back. Perhaps, one day I will find something better. Until then, this is the one for me.</li>
            <li> Smells great. Wonderful texture. Thick but absorbs easily. Moisturizes well. Reasonably priced. What more do you need from a lotion?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Nivea Creme, but I wanted something lighter for daily use on my whole body. I love Dermalogica&#x27;s Body Hydrating Cream, but it gets expensive if you tend to apply lotion twice a day, as I do. I also don&#x27;t like to use the same lotion every day, switching between a few based on how my skin feels at the time. This has been added to the rotation with CeraVe Moisturizing Lotion and Everyone Lotion in Coconut + Lemon.</li>
            <li> This lotion is very similar to Eucerin Smoothing Repair Lotion to me, as far as the texture and the smell. Goes on really smooth and leaves skin feeling really soft, I just can&#x27;t take the smell. This scent is so strong! I love the benefits of cocoa butter but I never use it because I can&#x27;t stand the smell of cocoa butter, but I found this lotion and it didn&#x27;t have that smell, so I decided to give it a try. When I used it, everything about it reminded me of the Eucerin lotion (which I love), even the scent, except this one is so much stronger and lingers a lot longer, and makes me so sick.</li>
            <li> Love this. I bought it because I was pregnant and wanted something with cocoa butter. Like it so much i will likely keep using it after the baby comes.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I got some at the local drug store recently on a whim and I liked it so much I thought I&#x27;d write a review. Best moisturizer I&#x27;ve used yet! I had terrible skin on my legs and this has gone a long way in improving it. No more dry skin bumps! Also, it&#x27;s not oily like most moisturizers, it absorbs quickly and lasts for a long time (I live in Utah, it&#x27;s super dry here, this stuff is great).</li>
            <li> I live in hot, humid Florida so my skin doesn&#x27;t dry out from the elements.  It just dries out because it&#x27;s old skin.  The older you get (Listen up, young grasshoppers) the more dessicated you will look, no matter how humid your environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I have to moisturize to keep the crepy skin at bay.  Sounds simple enough, but there&#x27;s also that Florida humidity to remember. To avoid tacky skin here, the creams or body lotions I use have to absorb well and not leave a sticky film on the skin surface.  That feels unpleasant here, especially in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to report that this skin lotion passes the summer Florida test.  It moisturizes well, absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t leave the skin tacky.  Win-win.  Except if you&#x27;re a purist.  This lotion contains the dreaded parabens, methyl- and ethyl-, so if you&#x27;re one of the many who feel parabens are linked to cancer, be aware of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some other multi-syllabic ingredients such as phenoxyethanol, sodium ceteargyl sulfate, sodium hydroxide, etc., used as preservatives or emulsifiers, for the most part.  This is actually par for the course in major brand-name skin products from companies like Nivea, Olay, etc.  Just saying, if you don&#x27;t like these additives, beware.</li>
            <li> This is good lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it because the fragrance isn&#x27;t overpowering and my dry arms aren&#x27;t so dry now. My arms always get sun damaged by this time of the summer and my skin starts to get flaky. This lotion does a great job of moisturizing my hairy arms without making a big mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The women in my household like this lotion too. They said that they like it better than the last two brands of lotions they used. Like many things, women&#x27;s preferences are mysterious to me. I&#x27;m just happy that they&#x27;re happy though. I&#x27;m also happy that the lotion smell isn&#x27;t overpowering and my wife&#x27;s skin isn&#x27;t too slick (some lotions have that effect).</li>
            <li> I love this Nivea.  I judge lotions not only by how soft it makes my skin and how long it keeps it soft but also by the greasy factor.  When I put lotion on, I want to be able to turn a switch to turn my lights out or to turn the door knob.  So many lotions just make my hands too greasy feeling but not this one. This is only one of two lotions that I have tried that doesn&#x27;t make my hands feel greasy.  It does a great job on those rough spots like elbows, knees and ankles.  It has a pleasant scent and it really does last a long time on the skin.  I use it after I workout and shower and the rest of the day my skin feels nice and soft.  Great product</li>
            <li> I‚Äôve always liked cocoa butter as a moisturizer. It has a distinct smell which I enjoy and it works better than other types of moisturizer. This Nivea cocoa butter is as good as anything I‚Äôve used although the smell is different than most. This Nivea has more of a perfume-like scent. It‚Äôs not too strong though so it‚Äôs not a problem for me. This lotion really penetrates and lasts without being greasy and the moisturizing is quite effective. This product does not have an all natural ingredient list so if that‚Äôs a concern to you please be aware.</li>
            <li> When I received this lotion in mail, the top screw-top cover was broken with lotion leaking all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But lotion itself is not too oily and not too dry. Putting it on after shower, it lasts about 8 hours if you do not wash hands frequently; and 4 to 6 hours if you do. Fragrance is light coco and talc, and a question of personal fragrance. If it wasn&#x27;t for broken container, I would have given it 4 starts but broken screw-top makes it difficult to use.</li>
            <li> So the Nivea Body Cocoa Butter Body Lotion is fine as a product. It&#x27;s cream and it moisturizes the skin, but the packaging is terrible. The pump just does not want to work. It is completely locked solid. Worse yet you can see a (rusted?) wire and a chunk of what appears to be hard glue sticking out of it. It is by far the worst pump based container I have ever seen. Whoever designed this should not have a job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yes, decent lotion but the worst pump I&#x27;ve ever seen for this type of product. I&#x27;ll give it a thumb&#x27;s in the middle until Nivea goes back to the drawing board and completely redesigns the pump. Once they do, I&#x27;ll re-review it but for now, just stay away from this thing as you&#x27;ll just end up with bad feelings towards the company.</li>
            <li> It has a light cocoa scent that smells good. It makes my skin feel very soft. When I first tried it, there was a moment when I thought it would be greasy, but that sensation soon faded. The moisture lasts even after I wash my hands. Great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I love summertime.&lt;br /&gt;Swimming.&lt;br /&gt;Sunbathing.&lt;br /&gt;Shorts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is: after a month of swimming and sunbathing, my legs look don&#x27;t look to pretty in shorts.  They look dry and scaly.&lt;br /&gt;I love the way Nivea Body Lotion makes my legs look and feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* The bottle is sturdy and the pump easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;* The lotion rubs in easily and doesn&#x27;t leave skin greasy.&lt;br /&gt;* Nivea has competitively priced this product.  Jergens Shea Butter Body Lotion, a comparable product in scent and performance, costs $4.00 more on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;*  The scent isn&#x27;t overpowering and doesn&#x27;t last long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;* Frankly, I wish this had a slight better scent.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad.  It&#x27;s just kind of boring.</li>
            <li> A rich, lightly-scented, non-greasy, hydrating body moisturizer.  I usually put apply this lotion all over my body once daily, after showering. Prefect for use after a day on the beach. It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I really liked this lotion a lot. It left my skin nice and soft but not greasy. It smells really nice too very tropical but not overwhelmingly so. The collar of the bottle was broke when this arrived but the pump still worked, that could use improvement but the product is great.</li>
            <li> I love Nivea lotions and this one was perfect for the itch I get every winter on my shins, used it and it got rid of the itch after a shor twhile, still use it on my feet.</li>
            <li> Love Nivea products never been disappointed this cream smells good with out the overwhelming coco butter smell and product moisturizers all day and keeps my skin comfortable till I shower ! Highly recommend it&#x27;s a must buy bargin !</li>
            <li> I have always enjoyed using Nivea products in the past, so I was happy to receive this new Cocoa Butter body lotion. The bottle is a nice, generous size, with a wide top to the pump, which makes it very easy to use. The lotion itself is wonderful, not too heavy and not too light, but softens my skin very well, even the areas with the most dryness. I also like the scent. It is gentle, with a hint of the cocoa butter, which I appreciate, as I didn&#x27;t want to smell like a piece of chocolate candy, or like I was wearing a sun-tanning product. I am very pleased and I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 8/3/2016: After using this product for 2 years, plus trying many other lotions in-between, I still think is one of the best overall body lotions for the money. It works great and is kind to your pocketbook, as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed using this fragrant, smooth lotion. It&#x27;s moisturizing without being thick and fragrant without being overwhelming. Something about the texture reminds me of the original Jergens, light and easy to apply. In addition, I love the cocoa butter fragrance. There&#x27;s a hint of the tropics without the &amp;#34;I&#x27;ve been on the beach all day&amp;#34; smell. Somehow, NIVEA has managed to combine just the right ingredients in this pleasantly scented, smooth moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Nivea is a good brand and makes good products. This lotion is relatively thin and absorbs into the skin very quickly. It has a very mild scent, which I prefer, and tends to dissipate quickly. It does not leave skin greasy, either. This is a really good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the container is well designed. It looks decent enough to leave sitting on your counter and has a sturdy pump, which also has a lock feature if you are traveling with it.</li>
            <li> My wife loves using body lotion to moisturize her skin and shave her legs. Traditionally, people use lotion for their hands and maybe their feet, but the idea of using it on your whole body is becoming more and more popular. The Nivea Body Cocoa Butter Body Lotion is a fabulous addition to this category of product and it&#x27;s pretty amazing stuff. My only concern is all the chemical ingredients they put in this stuff. Yes, it has cocoa butter, coconut oil, and other good stuff that provides the things that moisturize your skin, but there are many more ingredients that I can&#x27;t even pronounce. It&#x27;d be great if Nivea would create a more natural version of this same product.</li>
            <li> makes my skin feel good all day</li>
            <li> Obsessed with this lotion! It makes my skin super soft like no other lotion I have used before, and it smells amazing! My feet have always been super dry and rough and this keeps them soft as ever. Love love love!</li>
            <li> I live in a part of the country where we have pretty much zero humidity. That means that in the fall and winter our skin can be exceptionally dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion has done a great job of keeping our skin hydrated. If you overdo it, it can feel a little bit greasy, but it&#x27;s not bad. The scent reminds me of the way most cocoa butters smell - slightly vanilla-like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump bottle makes it very convenient to use. I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting the bottle covered in slippery lotion.</li>
            <li> For years my wife has had a combination of body and hand lotions, and I&#x27;ve always associated the various feminine preparations with the general realm of beauty products. Nivea Cocoa Butter Body Lotion is subtitled--&amp;#34;Intensively Hydrates Skin&amp;#34; and that&#x27;s what I needed. With age (and yard work) I found that my skin (especially hands) were getting dried out and beginning to crack. So getting a skin hydrator seemed like a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I plunked it down on my desk and started using it. Every now and then my wife would pop in and pump some on her hands too; so it became a family hydrator. After having used it for several weeks, it seems to work. At my age I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll suddenly have pretty skin, but at least I want it to reduce the drying out, and it seems to do that ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In looking at the ingredients, Cocoa Butter, is listed as Ingredient #12. Actually, #12 is listed as Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter. Since ingredients are listed in order of proportion of the product, the other ingredients are some kind of &amp;#34;helpers&amp;#34; to create the lotion. The first three ingredients are Water, Glycerin and Isohexadecane. That third one was new to me so I looked it up and found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Isohexadecane is a high purity, iso-paraffin emollient and solvent used in cosmetics and beauty products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More importantly, it was found to be safe for your skin.  Likewise, the other &amp;#34;helpers&amp;#34; that make up the Nivea Cocoa Butter are included as part of the lotion delivery system, added moisturizers or perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s recommended for Dry to Very Dry Skin, and it contains Vitamin E. In a light to rich scale, it is right in the middle, which probably is a tad lighter than I need, but it still works ok. It just requires more use than would be required by a somewhat richer lotion.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice product. Goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy.  I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference yet in my skin other than my legs don&#x27;t feel as dry but find myself squirting it on my hands each time I pass by my vanity and dabbing it on my face and neck and rubbing it into my hands simply because I like how it feels and smells.</li>
            <li> Nivea usually has some pretty decent lotions, but this one is too runny.  It smells a bit off as well....it has sort of a bitter smell once applied.  I had to wash my hands a few times to get it off.</li>
            <li> Greasy lotion will hydrate your skin for sure</li>
            <li> This body lotion is great. My daughter now wants her own supply</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I expected.  I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> Seems to work nicely so far but I really wanted to review this based on the bottle, strangely enough! The pump works really well. Definitely worth the money. Seems like a really nice lotion.</li>
            <li> Nice.  As advertised.</li>
            <li> Keeps your skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> Your skin will thank you.</li>
            <li> totally absorbed, no sticky feel. Keeps skin moisturized throughout the day.</li>
            <li> What can I say... it&#x27;s lotion. It does the job. You know what I mean.</li>
            <li> Great product!! Couldn&#x27;t find anywhere else !!! Exactly what I needed for my dry skin type!! 5 stars for excellent product and excellent price üëåüèª</li>
            <li> Oh Nivea, it is my favorite lotion brand by far. Just one use of this particular lotion, and the dry rough skin will vanish! I absolutely love the cocoa butter lotion by them. This lotion was able to not only soften my stretch mark scars, however it made them almost completely vanish! I have to point out the marks for anyone to notice them these days, which if phenomenal! I have never felt more confident in my skin before. After getting stretch marks all over my body, I felt self conscious. I had large purple marks, and extremely dry hands and feet. No matter what i tried, i could not get rid of either of my problems. I spend hundreds of dollars on products claiming to make stretch marks vanish, and help heal dry cracked skin  to no avail. I gave up trying for a while. One day i was shopping in my local store, and I came upon this in the aisle. It looks simple, doesn&#x27;t make any huge life changing promises, but it was incredibly inexpensive. This looked perfect to use on my hands on cold days. After just 3 uses on my hands, they felt rejuvenated! I decided to try on my feet, and eve put a little on my stretch marks. After just a week I noticed a difference. After finishing the bottle, my skin was perfectly smooth and hydrated, and my stretchmarks were virtually gone! I swear by this lotion, and believe it is worth 10 times what all of those high end lotions that make endless empty promises are worth.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to everyone and anyone who wants to try some new lotion. it is fantastic for all types of skin!&lt;br /&gt;Good luck and happy buying!</li>
            <li> My wife has extremely dry skin and it is helping her dry skin alot</li>
            <li> Since using Nivea Cocoa Butter lotion I no longer have scaly skin on my legs.  And I love the subtle scent.</li>
            <li> I use this everywhere. Great for keeping skin smooth.</li>
            <li> Again another claim that a lotion rubs in and disappears without any greasy residue.  Well, if you wait a couple of hours, that is true, but if you are hoping that you can rub it in and then not feel like your hands are covered in olive oil, you will be disappointed.  I have been searching for that special product for several years now and this is just another in the long of disappointments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a product that will keep you hands from drying out, but the time it takes to disappear is just not practical for me.  Use before bedtime - okay, that will work.  Before you go out on the town, forget it.</li>
            <li> This was lovely to use after a two day road trip and a nice warm shower.  The lotions was not oily, to me anyway, and felt wonderful.  I have continued to use this as a general skin cream especially after being out of doors or immersed in water.</li>
            <li> I have a love/hate relationship with Nivea Body Cocoa Butter Body Lotion. The lotion is nice and silky, goes on smoothly, absorbs well and makes my skin feel soft. It is perfect in every way EXCEPT for the smell! For me, the smell is very obnoxious, but for others in the household, they are between not really smelling it to it isn&#x27;t bad, but has a \\&quot;different\\&quot; smell. I also have the same problems with unscented lotions - so for those that don&#x27;t mind the unscented kinds, they probably won&#x27;t mind this. I battle with this love/hate relationship because the product works so darn well! It is a great lotion for those with eczema, as it keeps the skin moisturized and hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really is one of the best lotions I&#x27;ve used, so I deal with the scent. Yes, it&#x27;s that good!</li>
            <li> Creamy and wonderful... Nivea has always been a good product and this is another one I will use. The coconut scent is light, not overwhelming. Reminds me of summer!! The bottle is sturdy and the pump is generous --very broad and easy to use. Goes on smooth and feels silky.  One note: if SPF could be added it would be even better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Nivea lotions and this one has a nice, light pleasant scent.  Better, though, is the fact that it moisterizes so well, and soaks into your skin, leaving it soft and beautiful.  Smooth on after a shower for ease of application.  For some reason when I think of cocoa butter, I think of summer and sunny days.  It must be true that smelling something can bring back memories.  Love this lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve replaced a competing product on my bathroom shelf with this \\&quot;Nivea Body Lotion\\&quot; due to the other having even more added chemical ingredients, and as far as body lotions go I think it&#x27;s a matter of choosing the lesser of evils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this Nivea lotion does contain perfume, in addition to other ingredients to aid in product flow, consistency, shelf-life, etc. not unlike the competing brands. I find the aroma a bit strong but certainly not intolerable and it diminishes considerably in a short while. It applies easily, isn&#x27;t greasy, but skin feels and appears lubricated after use. The product delivery system, bottle and pump function perfectly and the price is typical for this size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company has had a couple complaints, in the past, not with this product, but, regarding it&#x27;s advertising, falsely, in one instance and another for a map created for them, however, both were corrected to the satisfaction of complainants. Aside from any of that, though, recently, I&#x27;ve had a serious bout with a cold and was constantly using tissues and washing hands, Nivea lotion helped considerably.</li>
            <li> This product had a nice, pleasant scent that was not too strong. The product went on smoothly, and was not greasy. It was also effective with helping my dry skin on my elbows and knees.</li>
            <li> Obsessed with this lotion! It makes my skin super soft like no other lotion I have used before, and it smells amazing!</li>
