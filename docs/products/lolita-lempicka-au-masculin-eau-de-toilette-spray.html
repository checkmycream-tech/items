            <li>It truly does smell like black liquorice, and I think it&#x27;s a very beautiful and attractive smell.  </li>
            <li>The projection is great for like the first 5 minutes; after that, it stays about 1 inch away from the skin.  </li>
            <li>Lolita Lempicka smells pretty great.</li>
            <li>The description of the cologne is very accurate.  </li>
            <li>I find this very light and tolerant.  </li>

            <li>I love it too.</li>
            <li>You want to be sure to get the Eau De Toilette.</li>
            <li>Made a better impact when given as a gift on xmas morning.</li>
            <li>so reasonable,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll buy the item one more time.</li>
            <li>I like this mostly because no one else has it</li>
            <li>this is the secound time I&#x27;m ordering  :&gt;)</li>
            <li>He likes it :)</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance when it is in its fullest bloom.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband for Valentines Day, I absolutely love this scent on him.</li>
            <li>I remember trying this cologne and falling in love quite sometime ago.  </li>
            <li>Unlike most of the reviews I have read about this product, as it gave me the indication that it is quite longlasting</li>
            <li>Ladies love this scent</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s now one of our favorite scents.</li>
            <li>You see I&#x27;m used to buying Lolita for myself (which I love love love) and was intrigued when I saw it for men</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance on my husband</li>
            <li>The Eau De Toileet is much better than the cologne.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very unique</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clean and light and I receive many compliments from both men &amp; woman!</li>
            <li>This is such a wonderful and unique scent.</li>
            <li>it wasnt what i was hoping for, it smells alot like licorice and very synthetic, but it smells good</li>
            <li>are endless, want to know what it is and the best thing is that nobody has ever heard of it.   </li>
            <li>Is easy on the sinus.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clean and sexy and just yummy on him.</li>
            <li>Too strong gives me a headache.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for me, it&#x27;s not excruciatingly sweet</li>
            <li>i get him new scents every month glad he likes this one :) thank you!</li>
            <li>Product was exactly what was describe; great quality and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>it reminds me of a good sweet cigar and is very earthy to me</li>
            <li>It is bold, very bold, at first but settles nicely.</li>
            <li>This is, in my humble opinion, the best anise/gourmand men&#x27;s fragrance available.</li>
            <li>they liked it that much.  </li>
            <li>It has a very unique scent - fresh with sort of a licorice scent to it.</li>
            <li>Strong, sweet, almost tropical-like in some ways.</li>
            <li>but it came in a cool, decorative box (which I&#x27;m sure I appreciated more than my boyfriend) and with a tube of scented body wash.</li>
            <li>soft, powdery, sweet, and anise is your thing, this one&#x27;s a good one.  </li>
            <li>it may easily be the most appreciated gift they receive.  </li>
            <li>It does smell better to me after I have had it on for a while, because it can be a bit overpowering at first.</li>
            <li>very few scents compare to this and it will make u smell VERY SEXY!!!</li>
            <li>Sweet perfume, but not too sweet.</li>
            <li>not overpowering, but not too sweet.</li>
            <li>I love it so much</li>
            <li>Love it so much</li>
            <li>May be a bit too sweet for some tastes.</li>
            <li>And it almost makes it a spicy sweet fragrance.</li>
            <li>It is seriously the best smelling cologne I&#x27;ve ever smelled</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a cologne fade away so quickly.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was super prompt.</li>
            <li>But it fades quickly after that.</li>
            <li>After about 20 mins, the scent becomes sweet, boozy, and surprisingly fresh (almost a tea-like smell).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I found this here for an extremely resonable price!</li>
            <li>Upon first use, it smells great, a very soft scent nothing loud</li>
            <li>I found it elsewhere for $30.00, a price that its worth.</li>
            <li>In fact the licorice is much more on the natural anise side of things.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth mentioning.</li>
            <li>In fact it&#x27;s something I would be more surprised to smell on a man than on</li>
            <li>On the other side the female version is awesome is identical to Angel.</li>
            <li>It is in that very select group that I like to refer to as \\&quot;clean fragrances\\&quot;...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a very powdery sweet scent, with a dominant note of anise.  </li>
            <li>I had to do a double take and reread the shipping invoice to make sure I had ordered the right item.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a very light scent that knocks your sokcs off up close...and personal.</li>
            <li>I have a low tolerance for most cologne or perfume.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I have been stopped by total strangers (men and women) and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll go ahead and keep this as a collection item since it has a unique smell and bottle design, but I&#x27;ll never waste my money on Lolita Lempicka Au Masculin again!</li>
            <li>I have been wearing this for several years now and get so many compliments.</li>
            <li>Different from most men&#x27;s colognes.</li>
            <li>Overall, while I like it, it is not my favorite.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have it</li>
            <li>Besides it&#x27;s not expensive.</li>
            <li>Rich, romantic, and not too sweet, Au Masculin is a fragrance I pray Lempicka will always keep in their lineup.</li>
            <li>You may need a small refresher spritz halfway through your day, but that&#x27;s something I&#x27;m happy to live with.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s interesting, because it&#x27;s one of the few scents I have worn that stays true to the bottle scent while it is on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is definitely a VERY enticing scent for men.</li>
            <li>At this point it becomes something I really want to sink my teeth into.     </li>
            <li>Highly recommended seller products!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t much care for how it smells on me.  </li>
            <li>The hint of licorice and other spices make this a soft warm scent.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something different and unique.  </li>
            <li>Like always it&#x27;s a truly unique scent, with a nice, very subtle note of licorice/anise.  </li>
            <li>The first time I wore it, the smell was completely gone after one hour.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not bad, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>The cheapest price compare to the rest out there for this particular brand.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of depressing because I really love how this cologne smells.  </li>
            <li>This particular bottle&lt;br /&gt;somehow did not meet what I know the product to be.  </li>
            <li>I read forums and saw people saying the formula may have changed as this cologne is twelve years or older.  </li>
            <li>With everything under the sun in the high end fragrances.</li>
            <li>Has a nice delicate scent.</li>
            <li>I asked if she could smell my new cologne.</li>
            <li>Has a very soft powdery licorice scent.</li>
            <li>First impression, the item that arrived was different from the one pictured.</li>
            <li>Finally after about a couple of hours, you&#x27;re left with a yummy, sweet (but not overly), boozy scent.</li>
            <li>It was a blind purchase, the scent is quite strong but doesn&#x27;t last more than 2 hours on my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;30yrs old</li>
            <li>People compliment him frequently when he wears Lolita.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t project far ahead if you.</li>
            <li>None of the women I spend time near care for it on me either, and</li>
            <li>If you want something masculine, you can take a pass.</li>
            <li>So of course I bought Lolita Lempicka blindly after reading some good reviews on it.</li>
            <li>Its a good purchase for a blind one.</li>
            <li>(I hate those fragances), but it&#x27;s sweet enough that smells great.</li>
            <li>This fragrance I had the opportunity to smell years ago at a local high end department store.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s certainly unique and different from your typical men&#x27;s fragrance.</li>
            <li>Every time I start using a new cologne, I can sense it for its entire staying time.  </li>
            <li>It seemed to be a bit weaker in scent than what I&#x27;ve enjoyed in the past and didn&#x27;t seem to &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; as long as it used to.</li>
            <li>Lolita is like no other.</li>
            <li>this is the first perfume that i have absolutely nothing negative to say about, men this is a must have for me from now on .</li>
            <li>Would buy them again in the near future.</li>
            <li>I discovered Lolita Lempicka au Masculine several years ago.  </li>
            <li>I really like the use of rum here, instead of any other booze.</li>
            <li>Au Masculine has become increasingly more difficult to locate, so</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Perfect for me, it&#x27;s not excruciatingly sweet</li>
            <li> i get him new scents every month glad he likes this one :) thank you!</li>
            <li> Product was exactly what was describe; great quality and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> it reminds me of a good sweet cigar and is very earthy to me</li>
            <li> It is bold, very bold, at first but settles nicely.</li>
            <li> This is, in my humble opinion, the best anise/gourmand men&#x27;s fragrance available.</li>
            <li> they liked it that much.  </li>
            <li> It has a very unique scent - fresh with sort of a licorice scent to it.</li>
            <li> Strong, sweet, almost tropical-like in some ways.</li>
            <li> but it came in a cool, decorative box (which I&#x27;m sure I appreciated more than my boyfriend) and with a tube of scented body wash.</li>
            <li> soft, powdery, sweet, and anise is your thing, this one&#x27;s a good one.  </li>
            <li> it may easily be the most appreciated gift they receive.  </li>
            <li> It does smell better to me after I have had it on for a while, because it can be a bit overpowering at first.</li>
            <li> very few scents compare to this and it will make u smell VERY SEXY!!!</li>
            <li> Sweet perfume, but not too sweet.</li>
            <li> not overpowering, but not too sweet.</li>
            <li> I love it so much</li>
            <li> Love it so much</li>
            <li> May be a bit too sweet for some tastes.</li>
            <li> And it almost makes it a spicy sweet fragrance.</li>
            <li> It is seriously the best smelling cologne I&#x27;ve ever smelled</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a cologne fade away so quickly.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was super prompt.</li>
            <li> But it fades quickly after that.</li>
            <li> After about 20 mins, the scent becomes sweet, boozy, and surprisingly fresh (almost a tea-like smell).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I found this here for an extremely resonable price!</li>
            <li> Upon first use, it smells great, a very soft scent nothing loud</li>
            <li> I found it elsewhere for $30.00, a price that its worth.</li>
            <li> In fact the licorice is much more on the natural anise side of things.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s worth mentioning.</li>
            <li> In fact it&#x27;s something I would be more surprised to smell on a man than on</li>
            <li> On the other side the female version is awesome is identical to Angel.</li>
            <li> It is in that very select group that I like to refer to as \\&quot;clean fragrances\\&quot;...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a very powdery sweet scent, with a dominant note of anise.  </li>
            <li> I had to do a double take and reread the shipping invoice to make sure I had ordered the right item.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a very light scent that knocks your sokcs off up close...and personal.</li>
            <li> I have a low tolerance for most cologne or perfume.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I have been stopped by total strangers (men and women) and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll go ahead and keep this as a collection item since it has a unique smell and bottle design, but I&#x27;ll never waste my money on Lolita Lempicka Au Masculin again!</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this for several years now and get so many compliments.</li>
            <li> Different from most men&#x27;s colognes.</li>
            <li> Overall, while I like it, it is not my favorite.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have it</li>
            <li> Besides it&#x27;s not expensive.</li>
            <li> Rich, romantic, and not too sweet, Au Masculin is a fragrance I pray Lempicka will always keep in their lineup.</li>
            <li> You may need a small refresher spritz halfway through your day, but that&#x27;s something I&#x27;m happy to live with.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s interesting, because it&#x27;s one of the few scents I have worn that stays true to the bottle scent while it is on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is definitely a VERY enticing scent for men.</li>
            <li> At this point it becomes something I really want to sink my teeth into.     </li>
            <li> Highly recommended seller products!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t much care for how it smells on me.  </li>
            <li> The hint of licorice and other spices make this a soft warm scent.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something different and unique.  </li>
            <li> Like always it&#x27;s a truly unique scent, with a nice, very subtle note of licorice/anise.  </li>
            <li> The first time I wore it, the smell was completely gone after one hour.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not bad, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> The cheapest price compare to the rest out there for this particular brand.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of depressing because I really love how this cologne smells.  </li>
            <li> This particular bottle&lt;br /&gt;somehow did not meet what I know the product to be.  </li>
            <li> I read forums and saw people saying the formula may have changed as this cologne is twelve years or older.  </li>
            <li> With everything under the sun in the high end fragrances.</li>
            <li> Has a nice delicate scent.</li>
            <li> I asked if she could smell my new cologne.</li>
            <li> Has a very soft powdery licorice scent.</li>
            <li> First impression, the item that arrived was different from the one pictured.</li>
            <li> Finally after about a couple of hours, you&#x27;re left with a yummy, sweet (but not overly), boozy scent.</li>
            <li> It was a blind purchase, the scent is quite strong but doesn&#x27;t last more than 2 hours on my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;30yrs old</li>
            <li> People compliment him frequently when he wears Lolita.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t project far ahead if you.</li>
            <li> None of the women I spend time near care for it on me either, and</li>
            <li> If you want something masculine, you can take a pass.</li>
            <li> So of course I bought Lolita Lempicka blindly after reading some good reviews on it.</li>
            <li> Its a good purchase for a blind one.</li>
            <li> (I hate those fragances), but it&#x27;s sweet enough that smells great.</li>
            <li> This fragrance I had the opportunity to smell years ago at a local high end department store.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s certainly unique and different from your typical men&#x27;s fragrance.</li>
            <li> Every time I start using a new cologne, I can sense it for its entire staying time.  </li>
            <li> It seemed to be a bit weaker in scent than what I&#x27;ve enjoyed in the past and didn&#x27;t seem to &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; as long as it used to.</li>
            <li> Lolita is like no other.</li>
            <li> this is the first perfume that i have absolutely nothing negative to say about, men this is a must have for me from now on .</li>
            <li> Would buy them again in the near future.</li>
            <li> I discovered Lolita Lempicka au Masculine several years ago.  </li>
            <li> I really like the use of rum here, instead of any other booze.</li>
            <li> Au Masculine has become increasingly more difficult to locate, so</li>
            <li> One is Eau De Toilettte and the other is L&#x27;Eau Au Masculine.</li>
            <li> Has the base notes I was looking for and has a light long lasting fresh smell.  </li>
            <li> To my nose, I first detect a heavy blast of dark, flowery licorice.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s crazy that most people have never even heard of it.</li>
            <li> My son had never heard of this brand but says he received compliments all day long.</li>
            <li> I am NOT a professional or even a niche scent collector,</li>
            <li> I can definitively say, however, that this bottle just didn&#x27;t match up to other bottles I&#x27;ve bought and purchased in terms of strength and &amp;#34;lastingness&amp;#34; (if there is such a word).</li>
            <li> It keeps it masculin but preserves the sweetness at the same time while turning down the licorice sugar blast in the beginning</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t blind buy this, I read reviews first and then went to the store, tested it on me, and bought it the same day.  </li>
            <li> It is also hardly something I would consider masculine.  </li>
            <li> In roughly 2 weeks the mens and ladies  Lolitas jumped from $26.00 to $70-100.00.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it has passed its shelf life, or maybe it is even because it&#x27;s a colder time of year than when I initially tested this cologne.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it can last a solid 6ish hours.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of a lighter Thierry Mugler &amp;#34;Angel,&amp;#34; but less powdery.</li>
            <li> The only issue I had with it is that, perhaps, I got a little outdated bottle?</li>
            <li> I came across a few reviews of this Lolita Lempicka Au Masculin, and the reviews caught my attention.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering&lt;br /&gt;it from Amazon now for a few years ever since my daughter sneaked a&lt;br /&gt;bottle of it into my suitcase as I was leaving after an extended stay with&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for quite a few years.</li>
            <li> think my only real negative is the staying power.</li>
            <li> but i notice theres very little longevity or maybe its just my bottle</li>
            <li> When I opened the box, it was reeking of a very harsh chemical smell that felt like a burning sensation in my nose.</li>
            <li> Fruity yet woodsey smell hard to describe, Girls will eat it up!</li>
            <li> Too much dusty powder and licorice.  </li>
            <li> , i keep this as my secret :</li>
            <li> I sprayed it on my wrists and behind my ears.</li>
            <li> The projection was very faint, less than I remember.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Needless to say I am a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> do not buy blind.</li>
            <li> I am grateful to have found this, as the Mens version is difficult to locate.</li>
            <li> I promise you won&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> Sad to say, Amazon does not accept returns for fragrances.</li>
            <li> It was not performing, very poor longevity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like that in my fragrances as I HATE ones that precede a foot ahead of you and leaves a choking cloud behind you.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when I received my bottle today.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My hubby can&#x27;t stop smelling him self and I can&#x27;t stop smelling him, great product Amazon keep it coming..I would deff recomend this product.</li>
            <li> this is an excellent scent. its intoxicating and very sexy smelling. very few scents compare to this and it will make u smell VERY SEXY!!! the anise is done better in this one than ANYTHING ELSE and it has a great drydown without being cloying</li>
            <li> My wife found the women&#x27;s version of this cologne in bermuda and it smells great, so I happen to see the man&#x27;s version of her cologne and tried it and thought it was great as well. Fruity yet woodsey smell hard to describe, Girls will eat it up!</li>
            <li> Sweet perfume, but not too sweet. Somewhat reminds me of cotton candy. Perfect for me, it&#x27;s not excruciatingly sweet (I hate those fragances), but it&#x27;s sweet enough that smells great.</li>
            <li> I wear Versace, Lacoste, YSL, Azzaro&lt;br /&gt;30yrs old...if you are in this group you won&#x27;t like it&lt;br /&gt;However, I did not like this one at all, and gave it as a present. On the other side the female version is awesome is identical to Angel.</li>
            <li> Too much dusty powder and licorice.  Gave it to a friend, over 60, who loved it.</li>
            <li> 1. Items literally came 2 days after I purchased the online item.  2. Good quality product. Love the smell.  3. The cheapest price compare to the rest out there for this particular brand.  4. Would buy them again in the near future.</li>
            <li> I have a low tolerance for most cologne or perfume. Too strong gives me a headache.  I find this very light and tolerant.  I manage a strip club and the compliments from the girls are endless, want to know what it is and the best thing is that nobody has ever heard of it.   It is nice to find quality products that are not mainstream.</li>
            <li> this is the first perfume that i have absolutely nothing negative to say about, men this is a must have for me from now on . :) ... i forgot to say my girlfriend love it and my friends always asking me what perfume i use, i keep this as my secret :P.</li>
            <li> YUMMY SMELL FOR YOUR MAN.</li>
            <li> Oh la la!!!    This is definitely a VERY enticing scent for men. To my nose, I first detect a heavy blast of dark, flowery licorice. After about 20 mins, the scent becomes sweet, boozy, and surprisingly fresh (almost a tea-like smell). I&#x27;m guessing this is because of the rum in it. I really like the use of rum here, instead of any other booze. It keeps it masculin but preserves the sweetness at the same time while turning down the licorice sugar blast in the beginning or it would have been way too cloying. Finally after about a couple of hours, you&#x27;re left with a yummy, sweet (but not overly), boozy scent. At this point it becomes something I really want to sink my teeth into.     If this description sounds good to you, I think you should give this one a chance. Don&#x27;t let the girly name fool you. This one is SOOO sexy! ;o)</li>
            <li> The cotton candy smell is great.  One office lady said I smelled like I just got out of shower.  This is my favorite EDT.</li>
            <li> Lolita is like no other. If you don&#x27;t know this.... I just couldn&#x27;t imgine life without Lolita. Mm mm mm</li>
            <li> I discovered Lolita Lempicka au Masculine several years ago.  I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I have been stopped by total strangers (men and women) and asked what fragrance I was wearing...they liked it that much.  It is in that very select group that I like to refer to as \\&quot;clean fragrances\\&quot;...Jean Paul Gaultier \\&quot;La Male\\&quot; is another.  Au Masculine has become increasingly more difficult to locate, so I suggest if you try it and like it, by extra.  This also makes a wonderful gift for those gentlemen on your shopping list...it may easily be the most appreciated gift they receive.  \\&quot;A top-rated BEST BUY!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I was looking for something different and unique.  I&#x27;ve been collecting colognes now for a couple of years, and I have over 20 different colognes.  I came across a few reviews of this Lolita Lempicka Au Masculin, and the reviews caught my attention.  Since none of the stores in my area sell this cologne, I ended up blind-buying this one.  The description of the cologne is very accurate.  It truly does smell like black liquorice, and I think it&#x27;s a very beautiful and attractive smell.  The only problems with this cologne is that it only lasts on my skin for about ONE HOUR and the projection is non-existent!!!  I&#x27;ve never had a cologne fade away so quickly.  It&#x27;s kind of depressing because I really love how this cologne smells.  The projection is great for like the first 5 minutes; after that, it stays about 1 inch away from the skin.  No...  It&#x27;s not because I&#x27;ve become \\&quot;accustomed\\&quot; to the smell.  Like I said earlier, I have over 20 different colognes.  Every time I start using a new cologne, I can sense it for its entire staying time.  That was not the case with Au Masculin.  The first time I wore it, the smell was completely gone after one hour.  I&#x27;ll go ahead and keep this as a collection item since it has a unique smell and bottle design, but I&#x27;ll never waste my money on Lolita Lempicka Au Masculin again!</li>
            <li> do not buy blind. it wasnt what i was hoping for, it smells alot like licorice and very synthetic, but it smells good</li>
            <li> The hint of licorice and other spices make this a soft warm scent. I hope this never stops being made.  I have been wearing this for several years now and get so many compliments. I am grateful to have found this, as the Mens version is difficult to locate. I bought 2 to be safe!</li>
            <li> My brother in law  said this is his favorite cologne I have given him- not overpowering, but not too sweet. People compliment him frequently when he wears Lolita.</li>
            <li> Bought for my BF and he loves this scent.</li>
            <li> My son had never heard of this brand but says he received compliments all day long. Is easy on the sinus. Have purchased more.</li>
            <li> I purchase this for myself, it&#x27;s for men, but  I love it so much, it is my go to scent! It&#x27;s clean and light and I receive many compliments from both men &amp; woman! Awesome!</li>
            <li> It even came in a boxed set gift with shower gel.  I LOVE this scent on my husband.  It isn&#x27;t flowery at all but is not musky like that either.  It is very nice.  He is a nurse and wears it to work and he says a lot of patience comment how nice it is.</li>
            <li> I got this for fathers day and was happy with it. Has a very soft powdery licorice scent. It does stay close to the skin. Holy price jump. In roughly 2 weeks the mens and ladies  Lolitas jumped from $26.00 to $70-100.00. I found it elsewhere for $30.00, a price that its worth.</li>
            <li> Like always it&#x27;s a truly unique scent, with a nice, very subtle note of licorice/anise.  The only regret is it&#x27;s lack of projection and staying power.</li>
            <li> I love this fragance, also girls like it. Sniff sniff. Nice smell. Both the body wash and the parfum are great.</li>
            <li> My husband has been wearing this for years and gets so many compliments on it. I always recommend it to women to give their boyfriends/husbands it for a gift. It is seriously the best smelling cologne I&#x27;ve ever smelled and it&#x27;s crazy that most people have never even heard of it.</li>
            <li> This is such a wonderful and unique scent. Bought it for my son once again since he couldn&#x27;t believe all the responses he received from people. I love it too. There is a difference in the two fragrances. One is Eau De Toilettte and the other is L&#x27;Eau Au Masculine. You want to be sure to get the Eau De Toilette. I promise you won&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> This is a unique fragrance for men, I liked it when I tried a sample, I loved it when I bought it !Plus you can&#x27;t beat the prices at Amazon. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with product.</li>
            <li> I thought I was simply purchasing the cologne but it came in a cool, decorative box (which I&#x27;m sure I appreciated more than my boyfriend) and with a tube of scented body wash. Very pleased. Made a better impact when given as a gift on xmas morning. Shipping was super prompt. Very pleased with everything.</li>
            <li> both price and quality were good.&lt;br /&gt;but, I waited for this item about three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Because price of this item was so reasonable,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll buy the item one more time.</li>
            <li> I like this mostly because no one else has it and it&#x27;s a very light scent that knocks your sokcs off up close...and personal. I love it!</li>
            <li> Best scent I ever received as a gift. Love it so much this is the secound time I&#x27;m ordering  :&gt;)</li>
            <li> Strong, sweet, almost tropical-like in some ways. Some reviewers say licorice but I don&#x27;t personally get that. Different from most men&#x27;s colognes. May be a bit too sweet for some tastes. It does smell better to me after I have had it on for a while, because it can be a bit overpowering at first. Overall, while I like it, it is not my favorite. May or may not buy again.</li>
            <li> Got this for my boyfriend, def a very strong cologne but smells great. He likes it :) i get him new scents every month glad he likes this one :) thank you!</li>
            <li> This is, in my humble opinion, the best anise/gourmand men&#x27;s fragrance available. Rich, romantic, and not too sweet, Au Masculin is a fragrance I pray Lempicka will always keep in their lineup. You may need a small refresher spritz halfway through your day, but that&#x27;s something I&#x27;m happy to live with.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that I actually don&#x27;t like licorice. The taste has never appealed to me. So of course I bought Lolita Lempicka blindly after reading some good reviews on it. But then I read some of the reviews on Amazon praising how licorice-y Lolita was and I started to regret my purchase. I can safely say that I was wrong to doubt it. Lolita Lempicka smells pretty great. In fact the licorice is much more on the natural anise side of things. And it almost makes it a spicy sweet fragrance. It&#x27;s very unique so I recommend it to someone looking for an unconventional fragrance. And the bottle is pretty awesome. So if you&#x27;re on the fence about it, try thinking of the way licorice smells rather than it tastes. It&#x27;s quite mystifying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think my only real negative is the staying power. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it can last a solid 6ish hours. But it fades quickly after that. That&#x27;s not bad, especially for the price. I think it&#x27;s worth mentioning. Also, this is a skin clinger. It doesn&#x27;t project far ahead if you. I like that in my fragrances as I HATE ones that precede a foot ahead of you and leaves a choking cloud behind you. It&#x27;s obnoxious. So keep that in mind when purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think this is a very universal fragrance. But it&#x27;s certainly unique and different from your typical men&#x27;s fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance when it is in its fullest bloom.  This particular bottle&lt;br /&gt;somehow did not meet what I know the product to be.  I&#x27;ve been ordering&lt;br /&gt;it from Amazon now for a few years ever since my daughter sneaked a&lt;br /&gt;bottle of it into my suitcase as I was leaving after an extended stay with&lt;br /&gt;her - commented I loved it.  Over 5 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handler company got it to me at good time.  I have no complaints&lt;br /&gt;about the service they provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking forward to receiving the fragrance.  It is for Men.  I like it&lt;br /&gt;because it is stronger and lasting.  Not so with this bottle.  I realize the&lt;br /&gt;handler has nothing to do with what&#x27;s in the bottle.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for Valentines Day, I absolutely love this scent on him. It&#x27;s clean and sexy and just yummy on him. My husband also likes it and he and I are big perfume users. With everything under the sun in the high end fragrances. I&#x27;m so happy I found this here for an extremely resonable price!</li>
            <li> This review is for the Lolita Lempicka Au Masculin 3.4 oz EDT.  First impression, the item that arrived was different from the one pictured. It came in a larger box and  the bottle was a different design. The cap was a gold metallic instead of the semi transparent one from the picture. Also it included a 2.5 oz shower gel.  I had to do a double take and reread the shipping invoice to make sure I had ordered the right item. It was a nice bonus though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, on to the scent.  I remember trying this cologne and falling in love quite sometime ago.  I am NOT a professional or even a niche scent collector, however this scent while similar is different in fundamental ways.  I sprayed it on my wrists and behind my ears. It has a very nice smell, not obnoxious or abrasive. The projection was very faint, less than I remember. Also, about an hour after I embraced a friend. I asked if she could smell my new cologne. She tried again, and could pick up nothing. I repeated with another person who responded the same. It was not performing, very poor longevity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say I am a little disappointed. I&#x27;m not sure if it has passed its shelf life, or maybe it is even because it&#x27;s a colder time of year than when I initially tested this cologne.  I read forums and saw people saying the formula may have changed as this cologne is twelve years or older.  Don&#x27;t quote me on that. I do plan on returning this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE*** 4/14 Well they&#x27;ve updated the picture online. It matches the one I received versus the one I saw when I ordered.</li>
            <li> Unlike most of the reviews I have read about this product, as it gave me the indication that it is quite longlasting yet it&#x27;s not. It was a blind purchase, the scent is quite strong but doesn&#x27;t last more than 2 hours on my skin. Test before purchase.</li>
            <li> Wore this to work today and got about 5 compliments. Ladies love this scent</li>
            <li> Upon first use, it smells great, a very soft scent nothing loud (some compliments here &amp; there) but i notice theres very little longevity or maybe its just my bottle but id say 1-4 hours maximum i experience with this cologne. Its a good purchase for a blind one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for quite a few years. It has a very unique scent - fresh with sort of a licorice scent to it. The only issue I had with it is that, perhaps, I got a little outdated bottle? It seemed to be a bit weaker in scent than what I&#x27;ve enjoyed in the past and didn&#x27;t seem to &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; as long as it used to. I don&#x27;t know if colognes have a shelf-life and this may have been beyond the date. I can definitively say, however, that this bottle just didn&#x27;t match up to other bottles I&#x27;ve bought and purchased in terms of strength and &amp;#34;lastingness&amp;#34; (if there is such a word).</li>
            <li> This smells so good I bought it for my husband and it&#x27;s now one of our favorite scents. I actually didn&#x27;t know about this until I saw it on Amazon. You see I&#x27;m used to buying Lolita for myself (which I love love love) and was intrigued when I saw it for men so I had to get it and I&#x27;m so happy I did. It smells delicious and stays on all day. An absolutely great purchase.</li>
            <li> This fragrance I had the opportunity to smell years ago at a local high end department store. The item I ordered didn&#x27;t disappoint. Great product detail and fair price! Highly recommended seller products!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t blind buy this, I read reviews first and then went to the store, tested it on me, and bought it the same day.  I guess I got caught up in the excitement, because I bought a 3.4 ounce bottle, which I have used maybe 6 sprays of in the six or eight months since I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have nothing against the cologne per se.  As a niche perfumer myself, I can see that it is indeed well crafted.  But it does not appeal, and it gets no compliments.  It is also hardly something I would consider masculine.  In fact it&#x27;s something I would be more surprised to smell on a man than on a woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very powdery sweet scent, with a dominant note of anise.  I don&#x27;t much care for how it smells on me.  None of the women I spend time near care for it on me either, and that&#x27;s interesting, because it&#x27;s one of the few scents I have worn that stays true to the bottle scent while it is on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If soft, powdery, sweet, and anise is your thing, this one&#x27;s a good one.  If you want something masculine, you can take a pass.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance on my husband it reminds me of a good sweet cigar and is very earthy to me</li>
            <li> Product was exactly what was describe; great quality and fast shipping. Has a nice delicate scent. I only wish the smell could last longer throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Very good product, the best mark in the vendor announced, 100 percent patched, ESPECIALLY THAT Nara seeking something useful and good</li>
            <li> This perfume is good, the scent is very nice. This is the first time I have it and I really liked it. Besides it&#x27;s not expensive. Buy it, you won&#x27;t regret.</li>
            <li> Has the base notes I was looking for and has a light long lasting fresh smell.  The Eau De Toileet is much better than the cologne.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when I received my bottle today. When I opened the box, it was reeking of a very harsh chemical smell that felt like a burning sensation in my nose. I&#x27;m guessing the box had been exposed to heat and the entire content has been ruined because of the heat. Sad to say, Amazon does not accept returns for fragrances. Guess I&#x27;ll just have to throw this to the garbage.</li>
            <li> This fragrance won&#x27; be for everyone. It is warm and I detect notes of Patchouli and licorice? It is bold, very bold, at first but settles nicely. If you&#x27;re lookin for something different, his might be the one for you. It reminds me of a lighter Thierry Mugler &amp;#34;Angel,&amp;#34; but less powdery.</li>
