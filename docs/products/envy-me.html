            <li>IT IS A OK SMELL DEF</li>
            <li>I GET MORE COMPLIMENTS WITH 20.00 BOTTLES OF PERFUME.</li>
            <li>for sure, every one will envy you when they smell this on you,this is a very sweet and sexy eut de toilette.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have the money to buy a true bottle of Envy Me!</li>
            <li>Gigantic bottle that came very quickly.</li>
            <li>Kinda strong and gives me a headache</li>
            <li>This is the scent I was wearing when my husband and I met and he liked very much.</li>
            <li>It smells great and last all day!!</li>
            <li>Perfect for everyday wear.</li>
            <li>The scent is fun, flirty, sweet but not too sweet and sexy.</li>
            <li>She loved it and it was big bottle</li>
            <li>TO ME IT HAS A SWEET ANT SPRAY SMELL</li>
            <li>Quick sipping.</li>
            <li>, she&#x27;s so cute and lively.</li>
            <li>amazing scent... receive compliments daily on this one...  </li>
            <li>Gucci&#x27;s doing something right.</li>
            <li>To those of you with similar concerns: this IS definitely the beautiful Gucci scent you remember.</li>
            <li>Exact as it was described.</li>
            <li>;-)  </li>
            <li>This is one of the only places I&#x27;ve been able to find this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I decided to buy the larger 3.3oz size.</li>
            <li>The lotion moisturizes without feeling greasy and really lasts too.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended to all!</li>
            <li>And I bet she&#x27;s really well-respected at work, too.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>(I wonder if the folks claiming &amp;#34;fake perfume&amp;#34; have received a different item... because the bottle arrived in its original box.)</li>
            <li>The bottle is almost as gorgeous as the scent... and LARGE; 3.3 oz should last at least a year.</li>
            <li>Of course everyone will interpret it differently (and I&#x27;m not a smelling expert), but I&#x27;ve always perceived this perfume as young, fun, and smart.</li>
            <li>a new classic on par with Eternity</li>
            <li>This perfume never seems to get old even after all these years.</li>
            <li>My #1 concern placing this order was based on a few reviews I&#x27;d come across regarding this item being a cheap knockoff of Envy</li>
            <li>no other perfume can beat this.</li>
            <li>this was my first time actually purchasing it, and I don&#x27;t leave the house without a few sprays.</li>

            <li> I ordered on Monday 11/10, expecting the shipment sometime the following week, so you can imagine how surprised I was when the perfume arrived a mere 3 days later on Thursday 11/13.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Gucci Envy Me for the past five years and have purchased a number of bottles during that time.</li>
            <li> Sephora has it for $90 which is crazy expensive when you compare it to the price here on amazon.</li>

            <li> I have been wearing Gucci Envy Me for the past five years and have purchased a number of bottles during that time. I love the scent. I always purchase from a department store and should have done so again! In an attempt to save money, I bought online and it is NOT the perfume I&#x27;ve been wearing for five years. This is either an old, expired bottle or it is not authentic. I won&#x27;t be buying beauty products on Amazon ever again. Wish I never had since now I don&#x27;t have the money to buy a true bottle of Envy Me!</li>
            <li> This is the same product that you buy elsewhere but almost $20 cheaper.  So great product and great deal.</li>
            <li> amazing scent... receive compliments daily on this one...  a new classic on par with Eternity</li>
            <li> I love this perfume!  Found it in a magazine ad and was very happy to find it so well priced on Amazon.com.  Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Exact as it was described. Quick sipping. Happy</li>
            <li> Bought for my GF. She loved it and it was big bottle so it will last long time. Also same price as small bottle on Gucci site, so twice the amount for same price.</li>
            <li> Gucci Envy Me smells wonderful and is long-lasting.  The lotion moisturizes without feeling greasy and really lasts too.  It smells so good that I wear it by itself during the day. The scent is citrus, a bit grapefruity, definitely a summery fragrance.  Some fragrances give me a raging headache, but not Envy Me. This is the scent I was wearing when my husband and I met and he liked very much. ;-)  I will buy this one again and again.</li>
            <li> Wife wanted this, and she lives it. It smells great and last all day!! Will buy this product again if possible.</li>
            <li> for sure, every one will envy you when they smell this on you,this is a very sweet and sexy eut de toilette.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife and she loves it. Will get her another one when this one runs out. :-)</li>
            <li> Mom got this for her birthday years ago, and I stole a bunch of it. Got some for myself for Christmas, and love the floral-y scent. Boyfriend won&#x27;t stop sniffing me when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Price was great, product is great…classic! This is my go to fragrance at all times. I love all Gucci scents.</li>
            <li> I got my product a day before I thought I would. It was actually a birthday gift for my girlfriend, so getting it sooner was awesome! The scent of course is amazing and I know she will love, since she&#x27;s the one that picked it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> I ordered Envy Me by Gucci @ a great price.  The item was shipped quickly and arrived in great condition. I would recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> My wife love this perfume and I love its smell.</li>
            <li> Had gucci envy me from the store before n smelt amazing...This one is expired or was heat damaged before I got it  it smells different and I would not buy from them again</li>
            <li> My wife cannot find this perfume in the stores anymore. So she loved it when she opened it up at Christmas.</li>
            <li> This is not Gucci envy me beware!!!</li>
            <li> The scent is fun, flirty, sweet but not too sweet and sexy. Perfect for everyday wear. Definitely buy online at amazon. Sephora has it for $90 which is crazy expensive when you compare it to the price here on amazon. Will repurchase.</li>
            <li> Gigantic bottle that came very quickly. Will definitely reorder in the future! This is one of the only places I&#x27;ve been able to find this product.</li>
            <li> I like it but then I don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s ok. Kinda strong and gives me a headache so I just use 2 sprits and im known to overspray perfume sometimes, but even me, cannot handle this one.</li>
            <li> This perfume never seems to get old even after all these years. I am glad I can still find it as there has never been a perfume I bought twice but this one.</li>
            <li> Envy Me is one of my favorite scents, and you can&#x27;t beat this price! I&#x27;m glad I decided to buy the larger 3.3oz size.</li>
            <li> she actually requested i buy this brand because she loves it...If she likes it and makes her happy, then im happy</li>
            <li> My #1 concern placing this order was based on a few reviews I&#x27;d come across regarding this item being a cheap knockoff of Envy Me. To those of you with similar concerns: this IS definitely the beautiful Gucci scent you remember. (I wonder if the folks claiming &amp;#34;fake perfume&amp;#34; have received a different item... because the bottle arrived in its original box.) I ordered on Monday 11/10, expecting the shipment sometime the following week, so you can imagine how surprised I was when the perfume arrived a mere 3 days later on Thursday 11/13. The bottle is almost as gorgeous as the scent... and LARGE; 3.3 oz should last at least a year. At its current price under $52 (with free shipping!), this item is a great find at a great bargain.</li>
            <li> Love the smooth, refreshing, fruity smell of this cologne! Will order again- may be a while though!  Highly recommended to all!</li>
            <li> MY SON, BROUGHT ME THIS FOR CHRISTMAS. IT IS A OK SMELL DEF NOTHING TO BRAG ON. I HAVEN&#x27; T GOTTEN ONE COMPLIMENT WITH IT ON. I GET MORE COMPLIMENTS WITH 20.00 BOTTLES OF PERFUME. TO ME IT HAS A SWEET ANT SPRAY SMELL AND IT DOES NOT LAST ALL DAY. IF THEY SAY IT DOES THEY ARE LIEING!!!!</li>
            <li> No complaints. It smells great. Great Seller</li>
            <li> This is it. I have loved this perfume for many years but this was my first time actually purchasing it, and I don&#x27;t leave the house without a few sprays. Of course everyone will interpret it differently (and I&#x27;m not a smelling expert), but I&#x27;ve always perceived this perfume as young, fun, and smart. When I wear this I want everyone to think, &amp;#34;Wow, she&#x27;s so cute and lively. And I bet she&#x27;s really well-respected at work, too.&amp;#34; I haven&#x27;t passed out surveys but I think the point gets across. Am I envied? You bet. Gucci&#x27;s doing something right.</li>
            <li> THE BEST PERFUME I HAVE EVER GOT.love the fragrance. no other perfume can beat this.</li>
            <li> The smell it&#x27;s not that lasting..</li>
