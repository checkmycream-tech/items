            <li> The other two have not impressed me much but the Deep Facial Line product absolutely did.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure how much this product did for me since I started using other skincare products around the same time.</li>
            <li> just got it not to long ago</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to change or give up old habits, but while I have done that to some extent, these potions &amp; cr√®mes, along with their promises, DO aid to a certain degree.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> It is good. I like it.</li>
            <li> Works fine...don&#x27;t expect miracles.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this eye cream. Helps me even to keep the under eye refreshed. Love under my Mac Pro long concealer.</li>
            <li> still using it.. so I can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s working yet just got it not to long ago</li>
            <li> I have been using for 3 weeks now and I really cannot tell any difference. I am hoping if I keep using that I will see a change soon.</li>
            <li> I really like the feel of the cream - it&#x27;s more of a gel  feels wonderful  a great price  I have only been using it for less than a week and I am using other new items as well but I have to say that I love the way it feels and I would definitely like to purchase more  very pleased</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it very good at diminishing/keeping at bay the squinting wrinkle between the eyebrows and the laugh lines. It&#x27;s the best anti-wrinkle treatment I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Works well on me..has improved my skin texture and I am 78 years old so can use some improvement.  My granddaughter uses it for acne and seems to help a lot .</li>
            <li> I have been using it for more than 3 months and did not see any difference.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well and as well as the costlier brand.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to Vita-K products by a dermatologist.  They use Vitamin K cream to reduce bruising and swelling and speed healing after surgery.  And it works.  While no product I&#x27;ve ever used has completely eliminated &amp;#34;deep facial lines&amp;#34; (no matter how much I paid for it), Vita-K, used regularly, softens them considerably.  I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> My skin has brightened and my wrinkles are a bit softer.</li>
            <li> Give it two weeks and you will see AMAZING results.  My skin is firmer and the fine lines on my forhead are barely visible.</li>
            <li> Right price, fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I received this and the age spot and Crows feet corrector last year as a klout perk.  The other two have not impressed me much but the Deep Facial Line product absolutely did.  I am 43  with pretty good skin,  but I inherited my father&#x27;s forehead wrinkles.  This product does a GREAT job at softening the lines and making them CONSIDERABLY less noticeable.  My whole face is smoother and softer using this. I notice a big difference in just a few weeks. I was thrilled to find the price was so great,  too.  I use strivectin around my eyes,  but this is my go to for whole face.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. I do not feel bad for putting this on my skin, I have noticed my forehead wrinkles are lighten .</li>
            <li> So Far - So Good. Only  few weeks, but seems to do the job predicted.</li>
            <li> This had almost immediate brightening and smoothing effects on my skin. I really like it and will repurchase. A great value too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned to withhold my judgments on products until I&#x27;ve used them for at least 60 days....sometimes 120 days is better ;)... I am a senior women whose skin is finally showing the deeper rigors of life! &amp;#34;Expression&amp;#34; lines between the eyebrows from squinting at the sun for many decades (even though I&#x27;ve worn sun glasses religiously since living closer to the equator for most of my life), and those &amp;#34;pucker&amp;#34; lines on the upper lip from years of drinking my ice tea through a straw! These are the daily postures our skin/body reflects on everybody as the years go on. It&#x27;s difficult to change or give up old habits, but while I have done that to some extent, these potions &amp; cr√®mes, along with their promises, DO aid to a certain degree. I HAVE seen a definite softening between my eyebrows as well as on the upper lip. I shall continue to use this product for another 6 weeks (&amp; then some, as the amount necessary is small and I figure it&#x27;ll last me a good 4 months) and then perhaps choose to buy another tube. ;)</li>
            <li> I have noticed a little differences in the lines...they are not as apparent as before</li>
            <li> This is my third bottle. I did not believe skin products could help and was given this as a gift. I used it on half my face to prove it didn&#x27;t work only once a day. I had a weird eyebrow situation,  like dandruff in my eyebrows.  It cleared it up and I was amazed. Every product I used for my eyebrows failed. This got me hooked and I started using it daily. In the meantime a woman ten years older than me had her wrinkles disappearing. I ran out and my eyebrows were ok so I did not think about it until I saw that woman again a year later. I really looked at my face and realized I looked worse and she didn&#x27;t.  I immediately ordered this product and intend to use it twice a day.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how much this product did for me since I started using other skincare products around the same time. I like the feel, the gel smooths out my forehand lines, feel a little like glue. I only use it on my forehead. The price is good, may buy it again.</li>
            <li> It seems to be working, but I want to wait a little longer for the final decision.  I really am using it on my wwrinkled upper lip and it does seem less wrinkled so I would probably buy it again.</li>
