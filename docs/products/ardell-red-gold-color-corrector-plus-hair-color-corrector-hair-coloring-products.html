            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS STUFF!  </li>
            <li>works amazingly well.</li>
            <li>(Ion is nice)</li>
            <li>I will keep a supply on hand and save $$ doing my own hair</li>
            <li>The nice thing about this is that you can add to to anything--shampoo, conditioner, even bleach solution--to make your own toner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and works everytime.  </li>
            <li>good Producer, love it , and the shipping was fast and the Packaging it is good .</li>
            <li>I love this product and use it all the time.  </li>
            <li>The sound is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li>I like wella t18 better</li>
            <li>though I feel it&#x27;s prob still better than nothing</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too sure what I was getting myself into.</li>
            <li>I plan on mixing a couple more packets with my conditioner so I can ward off the red/gold from returning.</li>
            <li>Glad I found it.</li>
            <li>love this product and will purchase again n again...</li>
            <li>I normally use Clairol&#x27;s Perfect 10 hair coloring in light ash blond (009A) and mix it with Clairol&#x27;s Perfect 10 in extra light blond (9.5) in a 50/50 mix.  </li>
            <li>I think in hindsight, this would work best on hair that is already lightened and toned to some extent (or naturally blonde or light brown hair).</li>
            <li>for the fact that my product was shipped early and i received it in 2 days, am really happy.</li>
            <li>Totally surprised at this; maybe they changed the formula to make it cheaper to produce (as so many companies do and then ruin a good product).  </li>
            <li>I left it on 15 minutes (instead of 10 minutes) and the color came out beautiful with no reddish undertones or gold undertones.  </li>
            <li>this is mild but ok.</li>
            <li>I save a huge amount of money by not buying the pre-tinted products for blondes, and I get to use the products that I prefer.</li>
            <li>it was so cheap.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to see that my red undertone was done...</li>
            <li>This is a great product and it helps to keep the red tones as bay when I color my hair.  </li>
            <li>Does a great job removing the red.  </li>
            <li>I am able to dye it again, I will use this along with the grey magic for sure!</li>
            <li>I bought this because I&#x27;m lightening my red hair to a very light blonde on a gradual basis and it works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Gonna try doubling it next time, so I&#x27;ll post if it&#x27;s any more effective,</li>
            <li>Dyed my hair strawberry blonde and it turned bright bright red.</li>
            <li>(For blonde toning it is good but go with wella after dye or bleach toner with 20</li>
            <li>I loved the shade of blonde</li>
            <li>so I assumed it was probably pretty strong.....</li>
            <li>This brand worked perfectly and people ask how i get such a lovely toned down blond color - even hair dressers.  </li>
            <li>It really works!!  </li>
            <li>So pretty!</li>
            <li>It gives a sophisticated natural tone to any hair color.</li>
            <li>To me its worth the price if it works.</li>
            <li>I finally just used this the other day and to my honest surprise my hair is a beautiful shade of blonde from root to tip.</li>
            <li>I will try again and use more the next time.  </li>
            <li>It does improve brassiness but it didnt give me exactly the results i was hoping for.</li>
            <li>love the product it works as stated mixed it with my shampoo and end results were what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Follow package insert directions for how many drops (I think it&#x27;s 17 per box of hair color, but I could be remembering incorrectly, so double check me).  </li>
            <li>I do also use 40 developer in lieu of the 10 volume that comes with my box brand, but it takes both the increased volume developer AND this stuff to make me the same ash color as the chick on the box :)</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>At last, I am truly pleased with my hair color and also that my gray is covered, too.  </li>
            <li>It completely removes the red while at the same time leaves the hair looking great.</li>
            <li>When I did dye my hair, I used this along with grey magic.</li>
            <li>so i am not sure it is still good.</li>
            <li>I had read the reviews here that were mostly positive and was very hopeful that this would work for me.</li>
            <li>got this in an attempt to get rid of those hot tones and &amp;#34;cool things down&amp;#34; to a normal hair color.  </li>
            <li>Until I found this product I was ready to give up on coloring my hair.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this to anybody bleach their hair</li>
            <li>i will have to use it again and leave the dye in for a longer time before I can decide if it really deserves five stars.</li>
            <li>I went to the dollar store and used a conditioner with no alcohol an mixed it with the Wylers blueberry punch and after 30&#x3D;40 minutes my hair was light brown like I wanted.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>That works very well for me.</li>
            <li>And surprisingly this tiny little bottle, even having to use a lot for 3 boxes of hair dye, lasts longer than you would think and the price is certainly right.</li>
            <li>It took out most of the red and orange color and left me with a golden blonde which is exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>also tried a different gel that had a similar purpose of getting rid of reddish tints and intensifying hair color, but that one was a huge pain in the ass because it was full of chemicals which made my whole bathroom stink along with anything I added it to, was in a tube that spilled everywhere, and tinted my hair a blue color.</li>
            <li>i wish it could tone a little more.</li>
            <li>It turned my hair dye pink which I was happy about because when reading past reviews thats what people said had happened before it worked for them.</li>
            <li>Maybe it works differently in a professional hair dye, but if you (like me) use a box dye from Target, it does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>Sad reality is, this was not the first time I&#x27;ve messed up my hair color wise...</li>
            <li>I have lite blonde hair and it is such a nice shade of blonde now.</li>
            <li>and then redying your hair to a new color.</li>
            <li>First, she used an Ash Blonde hair color with 15 drops of this stuff added, and kept it on for 25 minutes.  </li>
            <li>only problem is if your hair has a significant amount if red in it, say after bleaching.</li>
            <li>I could never figure out how I would use the same exact color and brand</li>
            <li>If you are like me and get unusually higher amount of red-orangy tones when lightening hair then skip the suggested application and add 10 extra (over the suggested amount) drops to your hair color.</li>
            <li>I admit I was nervous when it came to how many drops went into each bottle (I need 3 boxes of dye due to thick &amp; very long hair) and the dye turns a bright pink color.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t completely tell how well it worked.</li>
            <li>you really want to eliminate red tones from colored hair, get Ardell&#x27;s \\&quot;UNRED\\&quot; product instead.</li>
            <li>It did not help the copper penny look of my red hair much.</li>
            <li>I apply it to my hair dye and my shampoo when I lighten my dark hair to light blonde.</li>
            <li>My hair went from the wrong kind of Raggedy Ann to a soft Blond/light brown.</li>
            <li>I have natural red tones to my hair and even though I use ash toned hair color</li>
            <li>I only tried once so far by mixing with my hair lightener before fixing my roots.  </li>
            <li>I was being careful not to add too much to the mixture.</li>
            <li>my hair being naturally brunette with red tones running through it.</li>
            <li>Hi-lift ash blonde and ion sensitive scalp 20 vol developer.</li>
            <li>It barely had anything in the bottle to begin with</li>
            <li>Just a few drops of this stuff added to the hair color fixes the tone back to a true ash blonde.</li>
            <li>I have naturally ash blonde hair and since the grays have been coming in, I have used Ash Blonde hair colors</li>
            <li>Compared to that, the red gold was much easier to use and mix into other products, and didn&#x27;t leave a specific tint in my hair.</li>
            <li>Really tones down the red and there have been no problems with orange at all.</li>
            <li>I have not used it in years, and had some high lift ash color that I needed to tone down.  </li>

            <li> I only tried once so far by mixing with my hair lightener before fixing my roots.  </li>
            <li> I was being careful not to add too much to the mixture.</li>
            <li> my hair being naturally brunette with red tones running through it.</li>
            <li> Hi-lift ash blonde and ion sensitive scalp 20 vol developer.</li>
            <li> It barely had anything in the bottle to begin with</li>
            <li> Just a few drops of this stuff added to the hair color fixes the tone back to a true ash blonde.</li>
            <li> I have naturally ash blonde hair and since the grays have been coming in, I have used Ash Blonde hair colors</li>
            <li> Compared to that, the red gold was much easier to use and mix into other products, and didn&#x27;t leave a specific tint in my hair.</li>
            <li> Really tones down the red and there have been no problems with orange at all.</li>
            <li> I have not used it in years, and had some high lift ash color that I needed to tone down.  </li>
            <li> I got this to use in conjunction with bleaching my medium burgundy-ish hair back to my natural dark blonde.</li>
            <li> Her natural color was dark brown.  </li>
            <li> Almost looks natural (except for my dark eyebrows).</li>
            <li> It totally takes the red out of my hair when I color it dark blonde, I am a medium brown that likes to turn red.</li>
            <li> My natural hair color is black.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a &#x27;bottle&#x27; blonde for my entire adult life, and have always had to deal with slight orange tones at the roots due to</li>
            <li> It seemed to do a decent but not outstanding job.</li>
            <li> I recently bleached my hair (from dark brown) and it left this hideous orange-red color.</li>
            <li> Prevents my dark hair from turning yellow when I die it blonde</li>
            <li> It turns whatever product you&#x27;re using either pink, fuchsia, blue, or purple.  </li>
            <li> The effects also don&#x27;t seem to last more than a few weeks unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> However, mixed with color it turns pink</li>
            <li> Those two toned down the red and brassy tones, but soon were beginning to be washed out, and the red stayed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said  - it brought out red and yellows!  </li>
            <li> though it was big it kinda works but not really!</li>
            <li> You wouldn&#x27;t think that a hair product designed to remove red tones would have red coloring in it, but oddly it does!</li>
            <li> I used this product mixed with hair color, in my shampoo and also as an addition to another drabbing product but could see only very slight toning down of red tones in my hair.</li>
            <li> It seems to do the job and keeps the red and gold tones down and helps get the color your going for</li>
            <li> I tried it in my dark ash blonde hair color and as a mix with conditioner as one other reviewer suggested - didn&#x27;t notice any difference.  </li>
            <li> It really does work - No More Red/Orange Hair!!  </li>
            <li> Not much to say</li>
            <li> I will let you know if it works as expected.</li>
            <li> The other negative is that the bottle is very small, so if your hair is longer than around seven inches definitely buy two bottles so you won&#x27;t have to worry about running out if you need to use it with multiple different products in a short amount of time like I did.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was using it with a lot of other products</li>
            <li> colored my hair as per usual and I can&#x27;t tell if this made a different at all, not sure what I expected</li>
            <li> I tried to tone it down with this</li>
            <li> This product does help for blonds looking to tone down their brassiness, but I have found that using the suggested dose does almost nothing-</li>
            <li> Helped tone down brassy color</li>
            <li> This with some other additives, does the job!</li>
            <li> Added it to drug store shampoo and saw no significant toning effect.  </li>
            <li> I worked a little bit though.</li>
            <li> I say don&#x27;t waste your money and just buy a toner or toning shampoo like shimmer lights.</li>
            <li> but every time I use this, it makes me hair worse and red.</li>
            <li> I am so confused, isnt it suppose to fix the red.</li>
            <li> Just a few drops keeps the red/gold/orange out of my hair.</li>
            <li> Was a little alarmed by its color because the drabbers I have used in the past were purple - but it worked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had awful red &amp; brassy tones from a prior attempt to lighten my medium ash brown hair to a dark blonde - this didn&#x27;t help one bit.</li>
            <li> Not sure</li>
            <li> The bottle is small but from one bottle I should get 2 to 3 treatments to add to my hair color.</li>
            <li> this stuff actually got some of the red out which nothing else could do, even tried toner shampoo which was just crap</li>
            <li> I have Hard water that changes my color</li>
            <li> I probably should&#x27;ve realized this but had to learn the hard way.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this negative stars</li>
            <li> No more orange tones!</li>
            <li> Seriously though, whoever made this stufff is god sent.</li>
            <li> it works, not great but at least it works, my hair wasnt cooperating with anything at all</li>
            <li> I am using it wrong though, so probably just disregard this review.</li>
            <li> Just going to say I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it and ill just have to find something else.</li>
            <li> If you use over the counter crap and your a medium brown then you are going&lt;br /&gt;to</li>
            <li> I went on YouTube and found one of those CHILD YOUTUBE STARS (Some of them are geniuses) and VOILA found a girl with the solution to my devastating problem...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I tried it in my dark ash blonde hair color and as a mix with conditioner as one other reviewer suggested - didn&#x27;t notice any difference.  I had awful red &amp; brassy tones from a prior attempt to lighten my medium ash brown hair to a dark blonde - this didn&#x27;t help one bit.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this at Sally&#x27;s. I had read the reviews here that were mostly positive and was very hopeful that this would work for me. I have natural red tones to my hair and even though I use ash toned hair color I never end up with the color I want. Even though I followed the directions properly I ended up with a brighter red color than I ever have. I wish I could give this negative stars but I can&#x27;t. Good thing it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> It really works!!  I was so happy to see that my red undertone was done... I didn&#x27;t give it the five starts because I didn&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it all the time.  It does a really good job at eliminating the brassy undertones when lightening your hair.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This stuff used to work well!  I have not used it in years, and had some high lift ash color that I needed to tone down.  As other reviewers have said  - it brought out red and yellows!  Totally surprised at this; maybe they changed the formula to make it cheaper to produce (as so many companies do and then ruin a good product).  Well, they&#x27;ll stop selling it once people find out it no longer works.</li>
            <li> Dyed my hair strawberry blonde and it turned bright bright red. I tried to tone it down with this and it had no effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using color oops and then redying your hair to a new color.</li>
            <li> I only tried once so far by mixing with my hair lightener before fixing my roots.  It didn&#x27;t make a difference. I will try again and use more the next time.  I was being careful not to add too much to the mixture.</li>
            <li> I have naturally ash blonde hair and since the grays have been coming in, I have used Ash Blonde hair colors - - but they always seem to give an overly brassy tone to my hair, even though they say that they are \\&quot;Cool\\&quot; colors. Just a few drops of this stuff added to the hair color fixes the tone back to a true ash blonde. I love it!</li>
            <li> My wife tried bleaching and coloring her hair at home.  Her natural color was dark brown.  She ended up with lots of red and brassy (read: Orange) tints in her hair, even after adding one round of Medium Ash Blonde and another round of Light Ash Brown hair color.  Those two toned down the red and brassy tones, but soon were beginning to be washed out, and the red stayed.&lt;br /&gt;We got this in an attempt to get rid of those hot tones and &amp;#34;cool things down&amp;#34; to a normal hair color.  First, she used an Ash Blonde hair color with 15 drops of this stuff added, and kept it on for 25 minutes.  NO change in her hair color.  Next she added 24 drops of this stuff to her shampoo...NO change.  Next she tried 23 drops in her conditioner, and left that to sit for 15 minutes.  AGAIN no change or improvement.&lt;br /&gt;Just so you know...this is RED dye mixed with BLUE dye, and some fillers (propolene glycol, alcohol, etc.)  It is basically a purple dye.  It turns whatever product you&#x27;re using either pink, fuchsia, blue, or purple.  It did NOT however, take out the red and brassy tints in my wife&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> The sound is AMAZING. Even at highest volume there is no distortion. I love it! Would recommend to anyone! Works well with Androids.</li>
            <li> I was using it with a lot of other products so I can&#x27;t completely tell how well it worked. It seemed to do a decent but not outstanding job. The other negative is that the bottle is very small, so if your hair is longer than around seven inches definitely buy two bottles so you won&#x27;t have to worry about running out if you need to use it with multiple different products in a short amount of time like I did.&lt;br /&gt;I also tried a different gel that had a similar purpose of getting rid of reddish tints and intensifying hair color, but that one was a huge pain in the ass because it was full of chemicals which made my whole bathroom stink along with anything I added it to, was in a tube that spilled everywhere, and tinted my hair a blue color. Compared to that, the red gold was much easier to use and mix into other products, and didn&#x27;t leave a specific tint in my hair.</li>
            <li> This product does help for blonds looking to tone down their brassiness, but I have found that using the suggested dose does almost nothing- I use about 8-10 drops in my hair color when it starts looking orange.  The effects also don&#x27;t seem to last more than a few weeks unfortunately.  Still, I am very glad I found this product and will continue to use it I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> I like wella t18 better you get no brass this is mild but ok. (For blonde toning it is good but go with wella after dye or bleach toner with 20 (Ion is nice)</li>
            <li> Helped tone down brassy color</li>
            <li> This is SUCH a LIFE SAVER!!! I had CLOWN ORANGE HAIR!!! I went on YouTube and found one of those CHILD YOUTUBE STARS (Some of them are geniuses) and VOILA found a girl with the solution to my devastating problem... ARDELL COLOR CORRECTOR! Sad reality is, this was not the first time I&#x27;ve messed up my hair color wise... My solution was to Cut it and start over again... NOT THIS TIME! My hair went from the wrong kind of Raggedy Ann to a soft Blond/light brown. So pretty! I LOVE IT! and in between you can just put the drops in your conditioner and keep the Brassiness away. I have Hard water that changes my color so this keeps it under wraps. Great product!</li>
            <li> Color corrector.  Way to go.</li>
            <li> Until I found this product I was ready to give up on coloring my hair. It totally takes the red out of my hair when I color it dark blonde, I am a medium brown that likes to turn red. I will keep a supply on hand and save $$ doing my own hair</li>
            <li> good Producer, love it , and the shipping was fast and the Packaging it is good .</li>
            <li> I add this to all my hair color and I never end up with trash brassy hair. It gives a sophisticated natural tone to any hair color.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any change in the gold tones in my hair.  I only used it once in my ash blonde hair dye and my hair still turned out goldish then I used it in my conditioner which didn&#x27;t do anything and I tryed it in shimmerlights shampoo and it seemed to help but I think it was the shampoo and not this. I say don&#x27;t waste your money and just buy a toner or toning shampoo like shimmer lights.</li>
            <li> I added this with my regular hair bleaching and 30 developer. It took out all the burnt orange color immediately. I did not have to bleach my hair again over and over to get it the color I wanted. I absolutely recommend this to anybody bleach their hair and they need 20 developer and over.</li>
            <li> took out the brassy look.  If you use over the counter crap and your a medium brown then you are going&lt;br /&gt;to need this.  Stop walking around looking like the copper top battery!</li>
            <li> Added it to drug store shampoo and saw no significant toning effect.  Added it to purple shampoo and it supercharged its performance.  I am using it wrong though, so probably just disregard this review.</li>
            <li> I recently bleached my hair (from dark brown) and it left this hideous orange-red color. So I purchased the Ardell hair color corrector and mixed it with blonde hair dye. It turned my hair dye pink which I was happy about because when reading past reviews thats what people said had happened before it worked for them. It took out most of the red and orange color and left me with a golden blonde which is exactly what I wanted! Will definitely use again.</li>
            <li> It works great....I use it all the time</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t use regular blond (too much red and/or gold tones) with my skin color.  So always need a drabber.  This brand worked perfectly and people ask how i get such a lovely toned down blond color - even hair dressers.  I just do it myself with organic dyes and a drabber.  This one was perfect.  Was a little alarmed by its color because the drabbers I have used in the past were purple - but it worked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am happy to recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> cuts brass color in haircolor</li>
            <li> Ive only used this product once. There are several uses in the bottle. It does improve brassiness but it didnt give me exactly the results i was hoping for. i will have to use it again and leave the dye in for a longer time before I can decide if it really deserves five stars.</li>
            <li> BEST TO HAVE THIS FOR HOME HAIR COLORING .  GLAD AMAZON HAD IT  !</li>
            <li> I had to use this to correct a home mishap and it worked great to balance out the mess-up. love the product it works as stated mixed it with my shampoo and end results were what I wanted.</li>
            <li> colored my hair as per usual and I can&#x27;t tell if this made a different at all, not sure what I expected though I feel it&#x27;s prob still better than nothing</li>
            <li> Not much to say but it does the job. I intend to bleach different types of hair and this product will help me do so.</li>
            <li> This product is great I needed it for my closure when I over bleached the knots and it work great</li>
            <li> You wouldn&#x27;t think that a hair product designed to remove red tones would have red coloring in it, but oddly it does! As a result, this stuff actually ADDS RED to the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you really want to eliminate red tones from colored hair, get Ardell&#x27;s \\&quot;UNRED\\&quot; product instead. It works great.</li>
            <li> a MUST MUST MUST have if, like me, you use box colors and your ash blondes *always* turn out apricot.  Follow package insert directions for how many drops (I think it&#x27;s 17 per box of hair color, but I could be remembering incorrectly, so double check me).  I do also use 40 developer in lieu of the 10 volume that comes with my box brand, but it takes both the increased volume developer AND this stuff to make me the same ash color as the chick on the box :)</li>
            <li> it didnt do anything excpet stain my shower and my hands!</li>
            <li> MY brown hair always  turns red, even if my hairdresser colors it..  30 drops of this corrector with 2 ounces of color was my answer to this problem.</li>
            <li> I got this to use in conjunction with bleaching my medium burgundy-ish hair back to my natural dark blonde. The nice thing about this is that you can add to to anything--shampoo, conditioner, even bleach solution--to make your own toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is if your hair has a significant amount if red in it, say after bleaching. I probably should&#x27;ve realized this but had to learn the hard way. ;) I think in hindsight, this would work best on hair that is already lightened and toned to some extent (or naturally blonde or light brown hair).</li>
            <li> Not sure but every time I use this, it makes me hair worse and red. I am so confused, isnt it suppose to fix the red. Will not purchase again</li>
            <li> must have changed the composition.. not the same. still brassy.</li>
            <li> I am beyond happy with this product! I&#x27;ve been a &#x27;bottle&#x27; blonde for my entire adult life, and have always had to deal with slight orange tones at the roots due to my hair being naturally brunette with red tones running through it. No more orange tones! I finally just used this the other day and to my honest surprise my hair is a beautiful shade of blonde from root to tip. I admit I was nervous when it came to how many drops went into each bottle (I need 3 boxes of dye due to thick &amp; very long hair) and the dye turns a bright pink color. I wasn&#x27;t too sure what I was getting myself into. But I forged on and to my delight everything was perfect. And surprisingly this tiny little bottle, even having to use a lot for 3 boxes of hair dye, lasts longer than you would think and the price is certainly right. So I can say to anyone with doubts, buy it, use it, don&#x27;t worry about a thing. You&#x27;ll be happy with the results!</li>
            <li> Did an excellent job of eliminating brassiness when I bleached the Knots on my lace closure and when I used it to lighten my hair extensons.</li>
            <li> My natural hair color is black. In lifting my hair to brown and above, I tend to get a lot of red and brassy tones. I used this the last time I dyed my hair. I used two packets with 1:1 mixture of Ion color brilliance 12.1 Hi-lift ash blonde and ion sensitive scalp 20 vol developer. It worked! It banished the red from the brown and the brassiness from my highlights. I plan on mixing a couple more packets with my conditioner so I can ward off the red/gold from returning.</li>
            <li> Finally, I&#x27;ve found a way to remove the reddish and gold undertones that I was getting after home hair coloring.  I normally use Clairol&#x27;s Perfect 10 hair coloring in light ash blond (009A) and mix it with Clairol&#x27;s Perfect 10 in extra light blond (9.5) in a 50/50 mix.  I added 15 drops of Ardell&#x27;s Hair Color Corrector, Red and Gold, to one ounce of coloring plus one ounce of the peroxide (that comes in the white bottle).  I left it on 15 minutes (instead of 10 minutes) and the color came out beautiful with no reddish undertones or gold undertones.  At last, I am truly pleased with my hair color and also that my gray is covered, too.  I am so glad that I found this product!</li>
            <li> it works, not great but at least it works, my hair wasnt cooperating with anything at all n this stuff actually got some of the red out which nothing else could do, even tried toner shampoo which was just crap</li>
            <li> well i didnt read the ounces when i bought it i though it was big it kinda works but not really!</li>
            <li> Helps my haircolor not be brassy. Without it my haircolor is too red with gold flecks. This with some other additives, does the job!</li>
            <li> Love this product! It completely removes the red while at the same time leaves the hair looking great. It is a must have item for anyone in the hair profession.</li>
            <li> When I did dye my hair, I used this along with grey magic. I loved the shade of blonde I got using this product, it looked so natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I am able to dye it again, I will use this along with the grey magic for sure!</li>
            <li> It did not help the copper penny look of my red hair much. I worked a little bit though. I went to the dollar store and used a conditioner with no alcohol an mixed it with the Wylers blueberry punch and after 30&#x3D;40 minutes my hair was light brown like I wanted. I got a chuckle out of the experience and as I&#x27;m just covering grays who cares.LOL.</li>
            <li> in theory you are to put it in your hair color and purple blocks the orange. However, mixed with color it turns pink so i am not sure it is still good. Some ppl mix it with hair mask or conditioner</li>
            <li> This stuff was watery and the color was not concentrated at all. Did nothing to correct the yellow tones in my hair.</li>
            <li> works amazingly well. I apply it to my hair dye and my shampoo when I lighten my dark hair to light blonde. No brassy tones at all! Almost looks natural (except for my dark eyebrows).</li>
            <li> This is a great product and it helps to keep the red tones as bay when I color my hair.  Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen this help my hair at all. Just going to say I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it and ill just have to find something else.</li>
            <li> I swear by this stuff. Thank you god! haha. Seriously though, whoever made this stufff is god sent. It works wonders</li>
            <li> I love this product! I add it to my shampoo and conditioner, and also to my minoxidil (generic Rogaine) to counteract yellowing of my blonde hair. I save a huge amount of money by not buying the pre-tinted products for blondes, and I get to use the products that I prefer.</li>
            <li> My hair looks like it did when I had it professionaly done. I could never figure out how I would use the same exact color and brand my hair stylist would use and my hair would still have brassiness. This was the trick. I have lite blonde hair and it is such a nice shade of blonde now. I am going to order this again. The bottle is small but from one bottle I should get 2 to 3 treatments to add to my hair color. To me its worth the price if it works.</li>
            <li> Added 15 drops to my color mixed well and had not a hint of red.... Will be using this every time I color my hair.</li>
            <li> Maybe it works differently in a professional hair dye, but if you (like me) use a box dye from Target, it does absolutely nothing. Gonna try doubling it next time, so I&#x27;ll post if it&#x27;s any more effective,</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product yet.  As soon as the month is up I will let you know if it works as expected.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference. It barely had anything in the bottle to begin with so I assumed it was probably pretty strong..... no.</li>
            <li> Works beautifully. Prevents my dark hair from turning yellow when I die it blonde</li>
            <li> It does what it says.... kills brassy tones. If you are like me and get unusually higher amount of red-orangy tones when lightening hair then skip the suggested application and add 10 extra (over the suggested amount) drops to your hair color. That works very well for me.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and works everytime.  Does a great job removing the red.  Will buy it again. Glad I found it.</li>
            <li> for the fact that my product was shipped early and i received it in 2 days, am really happy. the red corrector does what it says by eliminating red undertones, brassiness and unwanted color hair bleach can give u..love this product and will purchase again n again...</li>
            <li> I used this product mixed with hair color, in my shampoo and also as an addition to another drabbing product but could see only very slight toning down of red tones in my hair.</li>
            <li> Just a few drops keeps the red/gold/orange out of my hair.</li>
            <li> i wish it could tone a little more. theres still some brassiness in my hair</li>
            <li> I bought this because I&#x27;m lightening my red hair to a very light blonde on a gradual basis and it works perfectly.  Really tones down the red and there have been no problems with orange at all.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF!  It really does work - No More Red/Orange Hair!!  I use 10 drops per ounce of hair color and my color comes out looking great.  I also use 3-4 drops per ounce in my conditioner and allow it to remain on my hair 10-15 minutes before rinsing out.  I feel this helps to maintain the correct shade between coloring.</li>
            <li> Keeps the red tint out of my brunette hair color</li>
