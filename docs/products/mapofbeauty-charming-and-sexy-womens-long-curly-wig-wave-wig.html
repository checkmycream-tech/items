            <li>I wore it to school and everyone liked it.</li>
            <li>Has a nice feel to it.</li>
            <li>As a budget wig, this is nice.</li>
            <li>Price is cheap and the quality is good.</li>
            <li>I feel this gives it even more believability.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you may get more then one use out of it.</li>
            <li>This is more like a custom wig so shaking or swinging the hair uncontrollable will cause it to matte and tangled.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend to anyone top</li>
            <li>so cute</li>
            <li>I just got this wig yesterday, and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>the wig is really pretty and versitilie it does shed alot and its also not my hair color but still looks really good and is comfortable</li>
            <li>I love the length and it doesn&#x27;t feel like its extremely cheap or anything.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because it does get tangled and matted at the bottom but easy to fix.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty nice wig for $8.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll be fine</li>
            <li>The reviews I found about China Post were hit and miss but the tracking worked fine for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However it fit really good, and the color was nice except for the slight shine, but what do you expect from a 7 dollar wig?</li>
            <li>This is a nice reasonable wig that I use as a stand by for a quick on the go style when I don&#x27;t have the time to do my hair.</li>
            <li>The wig was beautiful right out of the package, with bouncy, shiny curls and long bangs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and smooth, no tangles, and it came before the expected date! :)</li>
            <li>It will matte up quickly.  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t super shiny or anything.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought so many wigs on Amazon, and this one is overall my favorite.</li>
            <li>This wig is good if you need something cheap for just a few wears.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m sure this is the absolute best investment in long black wigs.</li>
            <li>This wig is soft and good quality for the overall price.</li>
            <li>Most wigs I&#x27;ve had previously (generic ebay, EpicCosplay, Arda) have fit comfortably but this was a  smaller than I would have preferred.</li>
            <li>You also want to be willing to spend time styling it and making to it how you wish.</li>
            <li>I was able to use it for the event intended but it does not last through longtime use.</li>
            <li>The wig looks a lot like real hair!</li>
            <li>Other than that it is a nice wig for what you spend on it.</li>
            <li>was concerned with the shipping as I needed the wig by the beginning of April but was really happy it came a lot earlier than expected.</li>
            <li>My only complain is that it tangles a lot, but it&#x27;s easy to brush out.</li>
            <li>With a steamer, and little TLC this thing stays nice.  </li>
            <li>I feel if your more careful with your wigs...</li>
            <li>It SHEDS ALOT and tangled extremely fast.</li>
            <li>so if you have larger head, this won&#x27;t fit you.</li>
            <li>The bangs are much longer than they look and need to be trimmed and styled to the way you&#x27;d like them.</li>
            <li>so it really helps with not showing the thinness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bangs were down to my chin, so even if you were some how able to fix the tangled mess you would have to trim the bangs to the appropriate length!</li>
            <li>for&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;It is definitely good for a last minute cosplay or costume if you intend to wear it once as the hair does tangle EXTREMELY easily.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>In about an hour of styling i got it to look decent.</li>
            <li>It feels pretty natural especially for the price.</li>
            <li>It still kinda fit but was definitely tight.</li>
            <li>Just basically try to keep it still and straight as possible when wearing this wig.</li>
            <li>But overall, this wig is very small cap wise and not styled in the front so don&#x27;t get this if you have a larger head and don&#x27;t have time to style and cut this wig.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that this wig was so small it didn&#x27;t fit halfway on my head!</li>
            <li>The bangs came down in the front straight down but were able to be held back with just hairspray.</li>
            <li>The bangs come in far longer than necessary, though I understand this is for cutting/styling purposes.</li>
            <li>This wig came neatly, had a few but not difficult tangles and a bit early.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s long, well put together, and as long as you&#x27;re gentle with it, it can be</li>
            <li>Very long very pretty but after being at a convention for a few days it will tangle but with a de-tangling brush</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how long it took to get here, and then when I took it out of the package it was so tangled that I could not wear it!</li>
            <li>This wig is soft and very long but those side bangs do not hang like they do on the model.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t affect me as much since I have black hair</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t affect me as much since I have black hair</li>
            <li> but I was totally wrong this wig felt like real hair and looked like real hair</li>
            <li> it sheds a lot and it gets tangled very easily plus it feels and looks very very fake</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American and have a lot of thick natural hair, so I put on two wig caps to see if that would help, but no, it did not.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not too thick, but it is reasonably so.</li>
            <li> My mannequin likes it - the side bangs definitely fall in her face though, so I have to pin them back a little.</li>
            <li> The net is black underneath</li>
            <li> || Expected: March 26 - April 13 | Arrived: March 19th&lt;</li>
            <li> However, the side bangs were a lot shorter than expected.</li>
            <li> I have bought different wigs for different occasions from other site but their hair didn&#x27;t have the soft touch and it looked so fake that I couldn&#x27;t even go out of the house unless I put on one of my other wigs.</li>
            <li> Length: Wig is ~30 in (didn&#x27;t measure but based on previous wigs I&#x27;ve owned) and reached the small of my back.</li>
            <li> Its soft but really thin.</li>
            <li> so i sewed them down and added some tracks for an ombre effect.</li>
            <li> I got this after a month and a half, but it was what i paid for and thats when i said i would get it, so that point is moot.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall: It came untangled with slightly curly ends.</li>
            <li> Too long, toi thin and tangled.</li>
            <li> so much don&#x27;t waste your hard earn money on this garbage</li>
            <li> I was not satisfied with my product, period.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Wig Cap: Small.</li>
            <li> In fact it frizzed so much i was unable to make it look like it and ended up just separating it into 5 sections and curling it without heat because i was afraid to</li>
            <li> seriously sucks...</li>
            <li> The wig itself is very small fitted for the head</li>
            <li> Also, the curls are difficult to keep in place, and they don&#x27;t all seem to fall quite even in length.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For a mere $7</li>
            <li> The hair is unable to bring up in front of the shoulders.</li>
            <li> The wig came knotted and the hairs were very difficult to separate to make it look like the picture.</li>
            <li> Delivery: (ordered March 2)</li>
            <li> i hate it</li>
            <li> For nappy so fast..piece of crap</li>
            <li> Mine wad falling to pieces it was terrible</li>
            <li> and they are TERRIBLE quality..</li>
            <li> Awful.</li>
            <li> Worst wig I have ever had</li>

            <li> Love this! It&#x27;s nice and smooth, no tangles, and it came before the expected date! :)</li>
            <li> The wig was beautiful right out of the package, with bouncy, shiny curls and long bangs. The only problem is that this wig was so small it didn&#x27;t fit halfway on my head! I&#x27;m African American and have a lot of thick natural hair, so I put on two wig caps to see if that would help, but no, it did not. Not for big headed people.</li>
            <li> Ah, this wig is great! It&#x27;s long, well put together, and as long as you&#x27;re gentle with it, it can be styled!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not too thick, but it is reasonably so. The bangs come in far longer than necessary, though I understand this is for cutting/styling purposes. Also, the curls are difficult to keep in place, and they don&#x27;t all seem to fall quite even in length. I feel this gives it even more believability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a mere $7, I&#x27;m sure this is the absolute best investment in long black wigs. Not only can I use this for Fem!John, but I think it&#x27;ll work for Vriska and Jade as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: It came in just eight days! Not business ones, just a regular eight days from China to California!</li>
            <li> I got this after a month and a half, but it was what i paid for and thats when i said i would get it, so that point is moot. The wig came knotted and the hairs were very difficult to separate to make it look like the picture. In fact it frizzed so much i was unable to make it look like it and ended up just separating it into 5 sections and curling it without heat because i was afraid to and it had lost some of its curl overnight on my mannequin head. The hair is unable to bring up in front of the shoulders. However it fit really good, and the color was nice except for the slight shine, but what do you expect from a 7 dollar wig? The bangs came down in the front straight down but were able to be held back with just hairspray. In about an hour of styling i got it to look decent. If you plan on just buying this and storing it in a box, you may want to get something that will hold the shape so the curls wont tangle. You also want to be willing to spend time styling it and making to it how you wish. It is not a bad wig, not the best either, but i can make it work.</li>
            <li> Very long very pretty but after being at a convention for a few days it will tangle but with a de-tangling brush you&#x27;ll be fine</li>
            <li> The wig was a case of &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;It is definitely good for a last minute cosplay or costume if you intend to wear it once as the hair does tangle EXTREMELY easily.&lt;br /&gt;But I feel if your more careful with your wigs...you may get more then one use out of it.</li>

            <li> This is a nice reasonable wig that I use as a stand by for a quick on the go style when I don&#x27;t have the time to do my hair. It will matte up quickly.  Just basically try to keep it still and straight as possible when wearing this wig. This is more like a custom wig so shaking or swinging the hair uncontrollable will cause it to matte and tangled.</li>

The bangs were down to my chin, so even if you were some how able to fix the tangled mess you would have to trim the bangs to the appropriate length! I was not satisfied with my product, period.</li>
            <li> This wig is good if you need something cheap for just a few wears. It SHEDS ALOT and tangled extremely fast. I was able to use it for the event intended but it does not last through longtime use.</li>
            <li> Mine wad falling to pieces it was terrible I would not recommend to anyone top be honest Don&#x27;t get out..</li>
            <li> this wig...seriously sucks...i waited weeks...over a month for these wigs...and they are TERRIBLE quality..the costumer service can not be beat but i guess when your selling products in this quality you have to make up for it somehow....</li>
            <li> it sheds a lot and it gets tangled very easily plus it feels and looks very very fake i hate it so much don&#x27;t waste your hard earn money on this garbage</li>
            <li> With a steamer, and little TLC this thing stays nice.  Not a fan of wigs with straps so i sewed them down and added some tracks for an ombre effect. so cute</li>
            <li> I buy wigs all the time.  This wig is soft and very long but those side bangs do not hang like they do on the model.  You gotta play with them to get them to lie like that.  Other than that it is a nice wig for what you spend on it.</li>

            <li> I just got this wig yesterday, and I absolutely love it. I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because it does get tangled and matted at the bottom but easy to fix. I plan to wear this wig on a weekly if not daily basis. I love the length and it doesn&#x27;t feel like its extremely cheap or anything. It feels pretty natural especially for the price. (:</li>
            <li> This wig is soft and good quality for the overall price. The wig itself is very small fitted for the head so if you have larger head, this won&#x27;t fit you. This wig came neatly, had a few but not difficult tangles and a bit early. The bangs are much longer than they look and need to be trimmed and styled to the way you&#x27;d like them. I bought this wig for a Meulin (homestuck) cosplay because the style and length. But overall, this wig is very small cap wise and not styled in the front so don&#x27;t get this if you have a larger head and don&#x27;t have time to style and cut this wig.</li>
            <li> I have bought different wigs for different occasions from other site but their hair didn&#x27;t have the soft touch and it looked so fake that I couldn&#x27;t even go out of the house unless I put on one of my other wigs. But when i purchased this wig i thought it was going to be like the others but I was totally wrong this wig felt like real hair and looked like real hair i was so impressed by how well it fit and stayed on all day and even when i went out on a date and was dancing or singing. I&#x27;m very glad I decided to buy this.</li>
            <li> Delivery: (ordered March 2) || Expected: March 26 - April 13 | Arrived: March 19th&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned with the shipping as I needed the wig by the beginning of April but was really happy it came a lot earlier than expected. The reviews I found about China Post were hit and miss but the tracking worked fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wig Fiber: Has a nice feel to it. Wasn&#x27;t super shiny or anything. *Have not used heat on this wig yet so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s heat resistant*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wig Cap: Small. Most wigs I&#x27;ve had previously (generic ebay, EpicCosplay, Arda) have fit comfortably but this was a  smaller than I would have preferred. It still kinda fit but was definitely tight. It doesn&#x27;t affect me as much since I have black hair but this would be troublesome of anyone who doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wig Length: Wig is ~30 in (didn&#x27;t measure but based on previous wigs I&#x27;ve owned) and reached the small of my back. However, the side bangs were a lot shorter than expected. It did not reach my chin when I pulled which was disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wig Thickness: Good. The net is black underneath so it really helps with not showing the thinness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: It came untangled with slightly curly ends. It&#x27;s a pretty nice wig for $8. As a budget wig, this is nice.</li>
            <li> This wig is sooo amazing. I&#x27;ve bought so many wigs on Amazon, and this one is overall my favorite. It&#x27;s bouncy and perfectly curled, and works great for alot of cosplays. I use mine for Feferi, Fem!John and Fancy!Jade, all from Homestuck. I would totally recommend getting it, it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
            <li> Great wig, fits well and has a nice gloss. Price is cheap and the quality is good. You also get a net for the wig in the package.</li>
            <li> Awful. Worst wig I have ever had</li>
            <li> Its soft but really thin.</li>
            <li> Too long, toi thin and tangled.</li>
            <li> Great for Feferi Cosplay!</li>
