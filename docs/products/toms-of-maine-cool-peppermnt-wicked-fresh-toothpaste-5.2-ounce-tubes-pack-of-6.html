            <li>I was impressed at how clean my mouth</li>
            <li>It tastes great, and I have no reason to believe it isn&#x27;t doing a great job to clean my</li>
            <li>I love the opportunity to try great products and share my opinions of them.  </li>
            <li>that Toms is a nice company, they donate time and money to good causes.   </li>
            <li>LOVE it!</li>
            <li>This just makes me feel even better about using their products!</li>
            <li>All this and more is listed on the toothpaste tube, so I can read it and feel good while</li>
            <li>I tend to need/prefer toothpaste that has a whitening agent, but this is great for first thing in the morning to get rid of morning mouth!</li>
            <li>Also, I thought the texture was good too- smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this because I had heard good things about the Tom&#x27;s of Maine brand.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>I have to say I&#x27;m enjoying this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>and my breath was still ok.  </li>
            <li>I wish I felt better about that.  </li>
            <li>That makes me feel good, as well as the basic Tom&#x27;s of Maine desire to make products that are recycleable and great for the environment.  </li>
            <li>I want to be sure and give a shout out to Bzz agent for sending me the sample.  </li>
            <li>so I wasnt sure how I would like this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I just feel like I have nice, fresh, stinkfree breath!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure, at first, that a toothpaste made in an eco-concious way, and without the \\&quot;standard\\&quot; toothpaste ingredients that are all animal tested, and probably not all that good for you, etc.</li>
            <li>It is great that it is natural, too.</li>
            <li>I really liked the Wicked Fresh variety.  </li>
            <li>The peppermint taste is strong but not over powering , it didnt burn and I didnt have that pastiness in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>and I can honestly say that its my new favorite product.</li>
            <li>I received this item for free to try in exchange for sharing my opinion of the product with others.</li>
            <li>I received this toothpaste free to try as a promotional offer.  </li>
            <li>But it does not do the job on fresh breath that I sincerely feel the Tom&#x27;s of Maine has done.      </li>
            <li>Like the others I received a free sample from buzzagent-</li>
            <li>After brushing, my teeth felt squeaky clean and my breath was very fresh.</li>
            <li>The peppermint taste is not overpowering like I thought it might be, but it still leaves you feeling refreshed and clean tasting.</li>
            <li>Though I don&#x27;t always insist on natural products, I use them when I can, so when I was offered a free sample of this product through a Bzz Campaign, it seemed a great way to try a natural toothpaste, something I hadn&#x27;t done before.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a good item</li>
            <li>I like to avoid plastic when I can, so I think this is cool.</li>
            <li>I am a Buzz Agent and was given a full size sample of this toothpaste in exchange for my feedback on it.  </li>
            <li>I received a sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine (Cool Peppermint)</li>
            <li>I am a Buzz Agent and was given a full size sample of this toothpaste to try and give my feedback on it.</li>
            <li>I have been moving in the direction of using more natural products and was very excited to receive a sample of Tom&#x27;s Wicked Fresh from BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;In general, though, this is a great product and I highly recommend for those looking for an effective natural toothpaste.</li>
            <li>The cool peppermint flavor was mildly minty.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this because of the fresh breath benefits it boasts.</li>
            <li>It is fresh, clean, and minty.  </li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s gluten free and made with all natural ingredients.   </li>
            <li>The peppermint flavor was too mild for me</li>
            <li>I received a tube of Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked Fresh Cool Peppermint as a Bzz Agent.</li>
            <li>What I like less is that I feel it isn&#x27;t doing as great of a job of cleaning my teeth.  </li>
            <li>You get that fresh feeling and it gets rid of stinky breathe.</li>
            <li>I, too, had the opportunity to try out Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked Fresh toothpaste as part of a Bzz Campaign through BzzAgent.com.  </li>
            <li>The toothpaste keeps your breath fresh all day.</li>
            <li>I received a sample of the Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked Fresh toothpaste.</li>
            <li>It does have a nice boost of flouride - and maybe I am just \\&quot;used to\\&quot; the Arm and Hammer that I bought last time.  </li>
            <li>would be worth using.</li>
            <li>Wicked Fresh for being a Bzzz agent.  </li>
            <li>I received a sample of Wicked Fresh Tom&#x27;s of Maine toothpaste as a Bzzz Agent.</li>
            <li>Secondly, I have experienced no tooth sensitivity with this toothpaste, like I do with many of the other pastes.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste leaves your mouth feeling super fresh and clean, but with no harsh chemical burn!</li>
            <li>The fresh breath effect is unusual and I like that!  </li>
            <li>It also leaves your breath smelling nice for a long time.  </li>
            <li>this isnt the first time I have tried the Toms brand.  </li>
            <li>The first time was YEARS ago</li>
            <li>I allowed her (she is 7) to go first and asked her opinion..</li>
            <li>I received some free samples of the Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked Fresh toothpaste, and since I was just about out of my regular toothpaste, thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li>This has a fresh clean taste unlike other toothpastes like crest or colgate that i find to be a bit too sweet tasting.</li>
            <li>I especially like using it at night because when I wake up in the morning, my teeth still feel fresh and clean,</li>
            <li>I brushed my teeth over three hours ago, and they still feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Tom&#x27;s of Maine isn&#x27;t quite as cloyingly sweet as the regular mint toothpaste, and leaves me with fresh breath, without feeling like I just ate a handfull of breath mints.</li>
            <li>I also really like the fact that its ADA  </li>
            <li>However, I didn&#x27;t really like the taste of it.</li>
            <li>This was very minty and didn&#x27;t taste all like baking soda though.  </li>
            <li>I like that it really does freshen breath -</li>
            <li>I used the paste then had very garlicky soup</li>
            <li>I handed out samples to my friends and they really like it as well..</li>
            <li>I really like this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I really like this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>It cleaned my teeth well, gave me fresh breath that lasted a while and didn&#x27;t bother my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>It tastes really great--fresh but not medicinal or like chemicals.</li>
            <li>However, after using it for a few weeks now, I can honestly say that it does a wonderful job, and is equal to, if not better than the big brand names.</li>
            <li>That definitely makes my teeth feel clean.  </li>
            <li>If a natural toothpaste is important to you, I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I will say my mouth and teeth felt very clean after using and I have noticed the fresh breath effects last longer than my typical toothpastes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bad breath is one my great fears, so I like the fact that this toothpaste stresses its breath-freshening qualities - and that it works!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used their toothpaste before because I really like how they use all natural ingredients and even explain why each ingredient is used on their website.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find that this toothpaste delivered that very \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; feeling, with a lasting feeling of fresh breath.  </li>
            <li>Tom&#x27;s of Maine is a reliable company for quality natural products, and their business ethic is admirable as well - I really like that employees there receive paid days to volunteer and that they focus on recyclable materials in their packaging.</li>
            <li>The only reason I did not stick with it is because they did not leave me with that \\&quot;minty fresh feeling\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>My teeth felt super clean, but I was not able to get used to the taste.  </li>
            <li>Not as minty as the toothpaste brands I normally use (i.e. Colgate, Crest)</li>
            <li>This just feels very natural and at the same time fresh.</li>
            <li>I do suffer from gingivitis, and I&#x27;m not sure this toothpaste will help me fight this as some of the more mainstream brands might.</li>
            <li>I have used this for over a week and my sensitive teeth aren&#x27;t bothered at all!  </li>
            <li>Of course, once I brushed again that minty freshness was quick to come back.     </li>
            <li>It offers the coolest, freshest, yet natural peppermint tasting toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>Toms uses natural materials and doesn&#x27;t test on animals.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They tout this as being a natural toothpaste, but it does contain fluoride.  </li>
            <li>I have to say I have been pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>It seems that every tube of toothpaste you see in the grocery store has whitening ingredients in it - even the sensitive brands.</li>
            <li>Thirdly, I really like the company philosophy of giving back to the community, and not using animal testing.</li>
            <li>Initially, I was worried that it would taste salty as most natural ones that I&#x27;ve tried in the past have been.  </li>
            <li>The natural spearmint and other essential oils do seem to help keep my breath fresh for several hours (although I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to say all day) after brushing.</li>
            <li>It is entirely possible that I&#x27;ve grown too accustomed to artificial products, but I did not fall in love with Wicked Fresh.  </li>
            <li>I really like how this toothpaste is all-natural and doesn&#x27;t contain the same chemicals that other toothpastes have.</li>

            <li> I received a sample of this toothpaste and I am hooked! This toothpaste leaves your mouth feeling super fresh and clean, but with no harsh chemical burn!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product to test and I can honestly say that its my new favorite product. No joke! I have only used Crest extra whitening for the last ten years. I have tried Toms products in the past because I like the fact that they are natural and are not tested on animals. The only reason I did not stick with it is because they did not leave me with that \\&quot;minty fresh feeling\\&quot;. It may sound silly but I don&#x27;t like toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t do that. I was a little skeptical that a natural product could compete but it does!!!! This product has me sold! You get that fresh feeling and it gets rid of stinky breathe. I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t burn either. I also really like the fact that its ADA  I am a believer and after 10 years of loyalty to Crest I am switching over... I LOVE LOVE LOVE it!</li>
            <li> One of my fave toothpastes. It offers the coolest, freshest, yet natural peppermint tasting toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever tried. If you like non-fake tasting toothpaste you should try this.</li>
            <li> I, too, had the opportunity to try out Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked Fresh toothpaste as part of a Bzz Campaign through BzzAgent.com.  I&#x27;ve used their toothpaste before because I really like how they use all natural ingredients and even explain why each ingredient is used on their website.  I also like how their toothpastes aren&#x27;t all sugary like other toothpastes.  I really liked the Wicked Fresh variety.  I especially like using it at night because when I wake up in the morning, my teeth still feel fresh and clean, like I recently brushed them.  I can&#x27;t wait to try the other flavors.</li>
            <li> I received a tube of Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked Fresh Cool Peppermint as a Bzz Agent. I have to say I&#x27;m enjoying this toothpaste. The peppermint taste is not overpowering like I thought it might be, but it still leaves you feeling refreshed and clean tasting. I love that it&#x27;s gluten free and made with all natural ingredients.   Also, I thought the texture was good too- smooth and creamy. A great toothpaste!!</li>
            <li> I received this item for free to try in exchange for sharing my opinion of the product with others. I really like how this toothpaste is all-natural and doesn&#x27;t contain the same chemicals that other toothpastes have. However, I didn&#x27;t really like the taste of it. It is minty, but has a strange taste to it, perhaps from the licorice extract. Overall, it&#x27;s a good item but I think the taste could be improved upon.</li>
            <li> I received this toothpaste free to try as a promotional offer.  Initially, I was worried that it would taste salty as most natural ones that I&#x27;ve tried in the past have been.  This was very minty and didn&#x27;t taste all like baking soda though.  It also leaves your breath smelling nice for a long time.  I brushed my teeth over three hours ago, and they still feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I just got this toothpaste as a sample and i love it. Toms uses natural materials and doesn&#x27;t test on animals. I also like that Toms is a nice company, they donate time and money to good causes.   The toothpaste keeps your breath fresh all day. I suggest anyone try it.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this toothpaste from a promotional that Tom&#x27;s recently held. The toothpaste performs well and has a pleasant taste, but I disappointed when I read the ingredients to learn that this toothpaste contains SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate)! I will not be buying this product.</li>
            <li> I have been moving in the direction of using more natural products and was very excited to receive a sample of Tom&#x27;s Wicked Fresh from BzzAgent.  It is entirely possible that I&#x27;ve grown too accustomed to artificial products, but I did not fall in love with Wicked Fresh.  My teeth felt super clean, but I was not able to get used to the taste.  I might use it every once in a while, but I don&#x27;t think I would buy another tube of it.  However, I admire the company and what they stand for and am committed to trying other Tom&#x27;s of Maine products.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of the Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked Fresh toothpaste. I like that it really does freshen breath - I used the paste then had very garlicky soup and my breath was still ok.  Of course, once I brushed again that minty freshness was quick to come back.     What I like less is that I feel it isn&#x27;t doing as great of a job of cleaning my teeth.  I wish I felt better about that.  It does have a nice boost of flouride - and maybe I am just \\&quot;used to\\&quot; the Arm and Hammer that I bought last time.  That definitely makes my teeth feel clean.  But it does not do the job on fresh breath that I sincerely feel the Tom&#x27;s of Maine has done.      It is great that it is natural, too. That makes me feel good, as well as the basic Tom&#x27;s of Maine desire to make products that are recycleable and great for the environment.  I like that.      Really, overall, I like the Tom&#x27;s of Maine a lot.  The fresh breath effect is unusual and I like that!  I like that tingly feeling in my mouth after I brush - and that is awesome!    I want to be sure and give a shout out to Bzz agent for sending me the sample.  I love the opportunity to try great products and share my opinions of them.  Being a Bzz agent is really great.</li>
            <li> Like the others I received a free sample from buzzagent- this isnt the first time I have tried the Toms brand.  The first time was YEARS ago and I didnt care for it at all.. so I wasnt sure how I would like this toothpaste.  When the box arrived my daughter and I couldnt wait to try it that evening!  I allowed her (she is 7) to go first and asked her opinion.. she loved it! Next it was my turn..  I took my time, trying to see how it tasted how it felt etc and I too loved it.  After I was finished I felt like my mouth was cleaner and fresher than it had been in a long time. The peppermint taste is strong but not over powering , it didnt burn and I didnt have that pastiness in my mouth.  I handed out samples to my friends and they really like it as well.. and the fact that its made from natural ingredients is even better(no artificial color or flavor)!</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste. This has a fresh clean taste unlike other toothpastes like crest or colgate that i find to be a bit too sweet tasting. This just feels very natural and at the same time fresh.</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to try this product through BzzAgent.com  I prefer to use natural toothpastes, but I find they often lack the minty \\&quot;zing\\&quot; of conventional toothpastes.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that this toothpaste delivered that very \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; feeling, with a lasting feeling of fresh breath.  I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> Though I don&#x27;t always insist on natural products, I use them when I can, so when I was offered a free sample of this product through a Bzz Campaign, it seemed a great way to try a natural toothpaste, something I hadn&#x27;t done before. Bad breath is one my great fears, so I like the fact that this toothpaste stresses its breath-freshening qualities - and that it works! The natural spearmint and other essential oils do seem to help keep my breath fresh for several hours (although I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to say all day) after brushing. It tastes great, and I have no reason to believe it isn&#x27;t doing a great job to clean my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other pros - I like the packaging of this product. The tube is made of aluminum (I think) and reminds me of toothpaste tubes from my childhood. I like to avoid plastic when I can, so I think this is cool. Tom&#x27;s of Maine is a reliable company for quality natural products, and their business ethic is admirable as well - I really like that employees there receive paid days to volunteer and that they focus on recyclable materials in their packaging. All this and more is listed on the toothpaste tube, so I can read it and feel good while I brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A minor con - I do suffer from gingivitis, and I&#x27;m not sure this toothpaste will help me fight this as some of the more mainstream brands might. I&#x27;ll have to see what my dentist says next time around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, though, this is a great product and I highly recommend for those looking for an effective natural toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I am a Buzz Agent and was given a full size sample of this toothpaste in exchange for my feedback on it.  I was excited to try this because I had heard good things about the Tom&#x27;s of Maine brand.  This toothpaste did not disappoint. The cool peppermint flavor was mildly minty. Not as minty as the toothpaste brands I normally use (i.e. Colgate, Crest), so it took some time to get used to it. After brushing, my teeth felt squeaky clean and my breath was very fresh. I was impressed at how clean my mouth felt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They tout this as being a natural toothpaste, but it does contain fluoride.  I am not sure if I would buy this again as it seems to be somewhat pricey.</li>
            <li> I received some free samples of the Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked Fresh toothpaste, and since I was just about out of my regular toothpaste, thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I have to say I have been pleasantly surprised. I wasn&#x27;t sure, at first, that a toothpaste made in an eco-concious way, and without the \\&quot;standard\\&quot; toothpaste ingredients that are all animal tested, and probably not all that good for you, etc. would be worth using. However, after using it for a few weeks now, I can honestly say that it does a wonderful job, and is equal to, if not better than the big brand names. Tom&#x27;s of Maine isn&#x27;t quite as cloyingly sweet as the regular mint toothpaste, and leaves me with fresh breath, without feeling like I just ate a handfull of breath mints. I just feel like I have nice, fresh, stinkfree breath! Secondly, I have experienced no tooth sensitivity with this toothpaste, like I do with many of the other pastes. It seems that every tube of toothpaste you see in the grocery store has whitening ingredients in it - even the sensitive brands. Tom&#x27;s of Maine is just toothpaste - it has none of those chemicals. Thirdly, I really like the company philosophy of giving back to the community, and not using animal testing. This just makes me feel even better about using their products!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine (Cool Peppermint) Wicked Fresh for being a Bzzz agent.  I really like this toothpaste.  It is fresh, clean, and minty.  It cleaned my teeth well, gave me fresh breath that lasted a while and didn&#x27;t bother my sensitive teeth. I have used this for over a week and my sensitive teeth aren&#x27;t bothered at all!  I love it.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of Wicked Fresh Tom&#x27;s of Maine toothpaste as a Bzzz Agent. It tastes really great--fresh but not medicinal or like chemicals. I tend to need/prefer toothpaste that has a whitening agent, but this is great for first thing in the morning to get rid of morning mouth!</li>
            <li> I am a Buzz Agent and was given a full size sample of this toothpaste to try and give my feedback on it. I was excited to try this because of the fresh breath benefits it boasts. The peppermint flavor was too mild for me and it was hard to get used to as it is not as minty as the toothpaste brands I normally use (i.e. Colgate, Crest). I will say my mouth and teeth felt very clean after using and I have noticed the fresh breath effects last longer than my typical toothpastes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know that I would buy this because I prefer a toothpaste with whitening in it. If a natural toothpaste is important to you, I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
