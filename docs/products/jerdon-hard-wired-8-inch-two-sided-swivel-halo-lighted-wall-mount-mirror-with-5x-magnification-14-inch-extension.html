            <li>The mirror looks great</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>

            <li>Looks very nice as well.</li>
            <li>; feature is very handy as well.  </li>
            <li>Very happy with quality of the mirror, install was easy.</li>
            <li>Good looking chrome finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved it and immediately went online and ordered one to install in our remodel.  </li>
            <li>Received in good shape appearance wise.</li>
            <li>Good thing</li>
            <li>mirror works great and it swings out nicely.</li>
            <li>Good height placement by my contractor.</li>
            <li>Nice magnifying mirror, good quality,</li>
            <li>Good quality and my wife is thrilled.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li>With the light and the magnification, it is a great tool for staying tidily groomed.</li>
            <li>Nice looking and works well.</li>
            <li>This mirror looks nice, but it does not work as well as I was hoping.  </li>
            <li>That said, it might have been nice to have a bit more light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The quality is very nice and it is definitely worth the price.  </li>
            <li>my case, although I have a fair amount of home electrical experience, given where I wanted to mount the mirror I did not have an easy way to install a junction box and feed the house wiring to splice in without some significant damage to the wall.  </li>
            <li>Love this vanity mirror.  </li>
            <li>This is a well crafted product that looks like it will be able to stand up to quite a bit of abuse over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Probably the thing that will be most impactful to the sturdy look and feel of the unit when all is said and done is how stably it is mounted to the wall.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- Still working very well and still has a great look and feel.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- Would love to give this 5-stars.  </li>
            <li>Product was better that advertised.</li>
            <li>But the magnifying side is great and it folds back to be fairly flush with the wall which I was concerned about.  </li>
            <li>Just have to be sure to turn the mirror on before hopping in the shower.</li>
            <li>and I just love this mounted mirror.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Mirror part is okay</li>
            <li>Love it but started to rust from steam in bathroom</li>
            <li>I am pretty pleased with the result, but again, it probably voided my warranty and took a fair amount of time and some know-how.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pretty good quality.</li>
            <li>In fairness, I think the product was never intended to be its own primary light source.  </li>
            <li>I love this mirror and light.</li>
            <li>Minimal fuss to install and works great!  </li>
            <li>x10 mirror for more detailed work.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is made for hard wiring and easy to install, it looks great when done and the 5x side is great for shaving.</li>
            <li>, it is handy, but the light is not too strong, works as well with the light as without the light.  </li>
            <li>Easy to mount and wire.</li>
            <li>This one went in easily, works well, and my wife loves it.  </li>
            <li>Easy to install and sturdy when mounted correctly.</li>
            <li>Well made, solidly built product, with a good mirror and a nice look, but mounting options are a bit tricky and will take some time and electrical</li>
            <li>would recommend this to anyone looking for a high quality mirror that you might find in a good hotel.</li>
            <li>Considering that some of these lighted mirrors can be hundreds of dollars (who in their right mind would pay that much??), this is a great bargain.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine for what you pay for this item.</li>
            <li>Then when you get out of the shower the mirror will indeed be fog free</li>
            <li>We use them often and like them light quite a bit.</li>
            <li>The light is operated with a switch on the unit.</li>
            <li>Just what we needed for plucking eyebrows and whatnot and leaves both hands free.  </li>
            <li>so cannot comment on durability or light life.</li>
            <li>This model is wired directly into the wall, so unless you are good with wiring, installation will require the assistance of an electrician.</li>
            <li>Love the mirror, easy to hardwire, would have liked it an inch or two larger, though.</li>
            <li>They look nice and high quality and do not detract from the bathroom decor.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the purchase and recommend it to anyone interested in a quality product.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this mirror to use in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li>The lighting does not add much and I found that ambient light provides better light in my installation.  </li>
            <li>Nice magnification, but the light is too dim.  </li>
            <li>The light level and color is just right for makeup application and the magnified mirror</li>
            <li>The light around the edge of the mirror is really intended for evening out the light on one&#x27;s face, not for full illumination.  </li>
            <li>The result is an extremely solid and stable attachment to the wall, which translates throughout the body of the unit for a wonderful solid</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update May 8, 2014:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now had this mirror installed for over 4 months, so time for a quick update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only reason I can&#x27;t is because the unit should come with better mounting options, rather than the purchaser having to get creative.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the light that much as I have plenty of light in my bathroom</li>
            <li>This mirror, in shiny chrome, is not only convenient and functional, but adds an attractive modern touch to my master bath redo.  </li>
            <li>The light is quite bright and the mirror makes personal grooming so much easier.</li>
            <li>The light on it works really well</li>
            <li>Again, I really liked the mobility of this mirror but it is bulky which I guess is necessary</li>
            <li>Barely use the light because we have good lighting above it.</li>
            <li>right before you jump in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with the solid, heavy feel of the product.  </li>
            <li>The magnification on the 5x is clear and easy to look at.  </li>
            <li>I previously owned a non-lighted Jerdon x7 mirror &amp; loved it.</li>
            <li>Would be good if the bulb was LED and maybe a little brighter.</li>
            <li>Halo light could be a little brighter but overall a great deal for the money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit after I first got it installed</li>
            <li>my case, since I went with the &#x27;warranty-voiding-cut-holes-in-the-unit-splice-in-your-own-cord&#x27; option, I was able to mount it where I wanted, which allowed me to put three heavy-duty screws into a 4x4 stud, and use a solid anchor for the 4th screw hole.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing this unit will most often be used in a bathroom or vanity area where you already have a standard 1x mirror.  </li>
            <li>Still on the first bulb (no surprise).  </li>
            <li>My wife wanted this makeup mirror and bought it locally in the plug in version for a lot more than Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described ...</li>
            <li>And, if you forget to turn it off after use it can get rather hot to the touch.</li>
            <li>The non-lighted version was on a different wall and the backlight from a skylight gave better vision.</li>
            <li>I love this product but would definitely have liked the extension &amp;#34;arm&amp;#34; to be a few inches longer.  </li>
            <li>Be aware, this mirror needs to be mounted in a place where you have illumination from your main vanity light or other light source.  </li>
            <li>On/Off switch, makes it easy to use with or without the back lighting.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- Mine shipped with a spare bulb and 2 solid drywall mounting anchors (though I would strongly recommend 4) and 3 wire nuts.  </li>
            <li>Make sure that everything is very secure to studs behind the wall surface.</li>
            <li>Again, I can&#x27;t stress enough the importance of a heavy-duty mount -- it will make all the difference in how it feels over time and how much you enjoy using</li>
            <li>If the mount is flimsy, the whole thing is going to feel like it can break off at any moment</li>
            <li>, that is too much already.  </li>
            <li>Incidentally, the key to having the mirror be \\&quot;fog free\\&quot; is to turn the mirror light on</li>
            <li>and it would have been really in the way when it wasn&#x27;t being used.</li>
            <li>Reasonable Price</li>
            <li>I really needed a plug-in rather than a wired mirror.</li>
            <li>5X allows for tweezing and realistic examination of your pores and imperfections.  </li>
            <li>Swing arm seems tight but probably OK once installed.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Again, if you&#x27;re not handy it could be a bit frustrating; if you&#x27;re comfortable with electrical and willing to do a bit of work, you&#x27;ll likely be very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it was a used item , but like was like new conditions&lt;br /&gt;Need</li>
            <li>and you can use it right away even if your regular bathroom mirror is completely fogged over.  </li>
            <li>Now if only I can remember where I put the bulb a year from now when the first bulb burns out .. .&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a result, for me at least, this unit would have been more useful if the otherside were a different magnification level than 1x.  </li>
            <li>Try out different locations and make sure you don&#x27;t create interference with other items in your bathroom like a sconce or mirror door that opens.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and you will be much less comfortable using it day in and day out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works good, seems to be a little heavy since it sags down just a bit from the wall but works fine.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I&#x27;m not sure this is really a con, as some people may want to use the 1x, but for me I&#x27;m likely to only use the 5x, so the 1x side is kind of wasted.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Buyer beware that the unit is designed for flush wall installation, with direct wiring to a junction box.  </li>
            <li>Although you cannot tell from the picture, this mirror is really fat (front to back) and clunky looking.  </li>
            <li>it looks like a professionally installed item with no trailing wires across the vanity to a socket.</li>
            <li>Shipped on time and arrived early and with out damage</li>
            <li>Why in the world would they make a &amp;#34;lighted&amp;#34; make up mirror so dim.  </li>
            <li>This is model wired directly to service.</li>
            <li>The magnification is just right too--there are other mirrors that are 10X, which I think is probably way beyond what anyone looking at you can see.  </li>
            <li>The image is crisp and has a decent focal length, so my eyes did not tire even after a long, long time of working at those pesky hairs, pimples and pores.  </li>
            <li>I do try to be careful not to pull down on it as I know that these things can become loose and pull out of the wall pretty easily.</li>
            <li>Probably not that big of a deal for shaving, but definitely helpful for makeup or other detailed work.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend not using a \\&quot;old work\\&quot; box if possible because the weight of the mirror extended</li>
            <li>Mirror is a bit on the thick size to accommodate the light bulb and still give it clearance from the mirror surfaces that sandwich it.</li>
            <li>I found this one for almost half the price and for only a few more bucks in wire supplies</li>
            <li>Just to check it out, I tried turning off all the bathroom lights to use just the Jerdon mirror, and, yes, I could see my ghostly reflection peering darkly back at me, but with not nearly enough light to do any serious work.  </li>
            <li>but the lamps are weak and don&#x27;t put out enough light.</li>

            <li> Barely use the light because we have good lighting above it.</li>
            <li> right before you jump in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I am very happy with the solid, heavy feel of the product.  </li>
            <li> The magnification on the 5x is clear and easy to look at.  </li>
            <li> I previously owned a non-lighted Jerdon x7 mirror &amp; loved it.</li>
            <li> Would be good if the bulb was LED and maybe a little brighter.</li>
            <li> Halo light could be a little brighter but overall a great deal for the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit after I first got it installed</li>
            <li> my case, since I went with the &#x27;warranty-voiding-cut-holes-in-the-unit-splice-in-your-own-cord&#x27; option, I was able to mount it where I wanted, which allowed me to put three heavy-duty screws into a 4x4 stud, and use a solid anchor for the 4th screw hole.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing this unit will most often be used in a bathroom or vanity area where you already have a standard 1x mirror.  </li>
            <li> Still on the first bulb (no surprise).  </li>
            <li> My wife wanted this makeup mirror and bought it locally in the plug in version for a lot more than Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as described ...</li>
            <li> And, if you forget to turn it off after use it can get rather hot to the touch.</li>
            <li> The non-lighted version was on a different wall and the backlight from a skylight gave better vision.</li>
            <li> I love this product but would definitely have liked the extension &amp;#34;arm&amp;#34; to be a few inches longer.  </li>
            <li> Be aware, this mirror needs to be mounted in a place where you have illumination from your main vanity light or other light source.  </li>
            <li> On/Off switch, makes it easy to use with or without the back lighting.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- Mine shipped with a spare bulb and 2 solid drywall mounting anchors (though I would strongly recommend 4) and 3 wire nuts.  </li>
            <li> Make sure that everything is very secure to studs behind the wall surface.</li>
            <li> Again, I can&#x27;t stress enough the importance of a heavy-duty mount -- it will make all the difference in how it feels over time and how much you enjoy using</li>
            <li> If the mount is flimsy, the whole thing is going to feel like it can break off at any moment</li>
            <li> , that is too much already.  </li>
            <li> Incidentally, the key to having the mirror be \\&quot;fog free\\&quot; is to turn the mirror light on</li>
            <li> and it would have been really in the way when it wasn&#x27;t being used.</li>
            <li> Reasonable Price</li>
            <li> I really needed a plug-in rather than a wired mirror.</li>
            <li> 5X allows for tweezing and realistic examination of your pores and imperfections.  </li>
            <li> Swing arm seems tight but probably OK once installed.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Again, if you&#x27;re not handy it could be a bit frustrating; if you&#x27;re comfortable with electrical and willing to do a bit of work, you&#x27;ll likely be very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it was a used item , but like was like new conditions&lt;br /&gt;Need</li>
            <li> and you can use it right away even if your regular bathroom mirror is completely fogged over.  </li>
            <li> Now if only I can remember where I put the bulb a year from now when the first bulb burns out .. .&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a result, for me at least, this unit would have been more useful if the otherside were a different magnification level than 1x.  </li>
            <li> Try out different locations and make sure you don&#x27;t create interference with other items in your bathroom like a sconce or mirror door that opens.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and you will be much less comfortable using it day in and day out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works good, seems to be a little heavy since it sags down just a bit from the wall but works fine.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I&#x27;m not sure this is really a con, as some people may want to use the 1x, but for me I&#x27;m likely to only use the 5x, so the 1x side is kind of wasted.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Buyer beware that the unit is designed for flush wall installation, with direct wiring to a junction box.  </li>
            <li> Although you cannot tell from the picture, this mirror is really fat (front to back) and clunky looking.  </li>
            <li> it looks like a professionally installed item with no trailing wires across the vanity to a socket.</li>
            <li> Shipped on time and arrived early and with out damage</li>
            <li> Why in the world would they make a &amp;#34;lighted&amp;#34; make up mirror so dim.  </li>
            <li> This is model wired directly to service.</li>
            <li> The magnification is just right too--there are other mirrors that are 10X, which I think is probably way beyond what anyone looking at you can see.  </li>
            <li> The image is crisp and has a decent focal length, so my eyes did not tire even after a long, long time of working at those pesky hairs, pimples and pores.  </li>
            <li> I do try to be careful not to pull down on it as I know that these things can become loose and pull out of the wall pretty easily.</li>
            <li> Probably not that big of a deal for shaving, but definitely helpful for makeup or other detailed work.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend not using a \\&quot;old work\\&quot; box if possible because the weight of the mirror extended</li>
            <li> Mirror is a bit on the thick size to accommodate the light bulb and still give it clearance from the mirror surfaces that sandwich it.</li>
            <li> I found this one for almost half the price and for only a few more bucks in wire supplies</li>
            <li> Just to check it out, I tried turning off all the bathroom lights to use just the Jerdon mirror, and, yes, I could see my ghostly reflection peering darkly back at me, but with not nearly enough light to do any serious work.  </li>
            <li> but the lamps are weak and don&#x27;t put out enough light.</li>
            <li> If you go with a heavy duty junction box (heavy metal, please, not a flimsy plastic one) stably mounted to a stud, that might be adequate support.  </li>
            <li> It does take some technical know-how for installation, since one must be prepared for drilling and hooking into the electrical box behind the wall, in order to conceal the power cord, but the final result is worth it.  </li>
            <li> While I would have liked the extension to be longer the most disappointing feature by far is the halo lighting which is essentially worthless.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve been plodding through life with a standard bathroom mirror, you owe it to yourself to get a decent magnifying mirror, and this one doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  </li>
            <li> She really wanted it in a hard wired version.  </li>
            <li> I spent quite a bit of time on some deferred facial maintenance, and didn&#x27;t have any problem staying with it for a while.  </li>
            <li> Different magnification on the other side?  </li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t the idea to see better when putting on your makeup?!  :(</li>
            <li> Cons: Since it is hardwired it can only be turned on when my other LED bath lights are on.</li>
            <li> This mirror is just heavy enough to warrant extra scrutiny of what you&#x27;re mounting it on.</li>
            <li> The backlight is not nearly strong enough to use independently.  </li>
            <li> so I choose a x5 after returning two x10 Zadro (too close) brushed nickel versions, one about 3&amp;#34; wide &amp; the other about 1&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> A much better value than the very expensive mirrors I priced out elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the magnification didn&#x27;t quite meet my needs (not strong enough) and the light it emits</li>
            <li> Arms are a little on the short side and the pivot points require oiling so as not to grind.</li>
            <li> I used a little home engineering to get it in the wall adjacent to a stud near an electrical source and installed it in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I have only had for a few weeks</li>
            <li> wide.</li>
            <li> about!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the chrome finish model to go with the other chrome fixtures in my bathroom and it matches well.  </li>
            <li> I believe other reviewers mentioned this</li>
            <li> I have other lighting.</li>
            <li> Chrome finish matches the other chrome fixtures.</li>
            <li> This is not a flimsy imitation that feels like it is going to break every time you move it.  </li>
            <li> Big problem is, that isn&#x27;t noticed until after the mirror is installed as this is hard</li>
            <li> so I was on the prowl for a mountable one &amp; did not want a cord hanging down.  </li>
            <li> the only problem is the bulb is not bright enough and it makes it hard to see</li>
            <li> Backlight is not very strong.  </li>
            <li> It is too heavy for bolts.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This unit is heavy</li>
            <li> but it has stayed firmly attached to the wall and</li>
            <li> Not cheaply made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is from the lights or just a product problem.</li>
            <li> And, yes, this would almost certainly void the warranty.  :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> My wife wanted a wall mounted Mirror - since this was hard wired</li>
            <li> Too heavy!!</li>
            <li> You know those hotel room swivel-out mirrors with enough magnification so that you can see in gory detail every screaming pimple and every disgusting, clogged pore -- I mean, so that you can see clearly to shave or put on your makeup?  </li>
            <li> In other words, instead of 1x and 5x mirrors, perhaps 5x and 7x or 5x and 10x (now that would be scary to look into!).  </li>
            <li> but it does seem a bit weak.  </li>
            <li> The mirror was not too expensive, I guess I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> When turned on the &amp;#34;halo&amp;#34; shows up in the iris&#x27; of my eyes which is annoying so now just don&#x27;t turn it on at all.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this vanity mirror.  Looks beautiful on the wall of our remodeled master bath.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is made for hard wiring and easy to install, it looks great when done and the 5x side is great for shaving.</li>
            <li> Perfect for our bathroom. Barely use the light because we have good lighting above it. Looks very nice as well.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror and light. The light is quite bright and the mirror makes personal grooming so much easier.</li>
            <li> Nice looking and works well.</li>
            <li> Too heavy!! And bulky!</li>
            <li> Great product.  You just have to use an electrical box rather than the enclosed molly bolts.  It is too heavy for bolts.  I used a little home engineering to get it in the wall adjacent to a stud near an electrical source and installed it in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine for what you pay for this item.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve been plodding through life with a standard bathroom mirror, you owe it to yourself to get a decent magnifying mirror, and this one doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  You know those hotel room swivel-out mirrors with enough magnification so that you can see in gory detail every screaming pimple and every disgusting, clogged pore -- I mean, so that you can see clearly to shave or put on your makeup?  Now that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m talking about!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the chrome finish model to go with the other chrome fixtures in my bathroom and it matches well.  I&#x27;ve only had this installed for a couple of days, so can&#x27;t comment on longevity yet, but with that caveat, let&#x27;s jump into the pros and cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Solid and sturdy.  I am very happy with the solid, heavy feel of the product.  This is not a flimsy imitation that feels like it is going to break every time you move it.  This is a well crafted product that looks like it will be able to stand up to quite a bit of abuse over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The magnification on the 5x is clear and easy to look at.  I&#x27;ll admit after I first got it installed I spent quite a bit of time on some deferred facial maintenance, and didn&#x27;t have any problem staying with it for a while.  The image is crisp and has a decent focal length, so my eyes did not tire even after a long, long time of working at those pesky hairs, pimples and pores.  (Note, I do not wear glasses, so can&#x27;t comment on whether that would impact the experience.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Good looking chrome finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- On/Off switch, makes it easy to use with or without the back lighting.  The switch feels solid and should stand up to a lot of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Mine shipped with a spare bulb and 2 solid drywall mounting anchors (though I would strongly recommend 4) and 3 wire nuts.  The latter two things not a big deal, but the spare bulb is definitely helpful.  Now if only I can remember where I put the bulb a year from now when the first bulb burns out .. .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Backlight.  It is helpful to have a backlight to even out the lighting on one&#x27;s face for consistency.  Probably not that big of a deal for shaving, but definitely helpful for makeup or other detailed work.  But . . . (see con&#x27;s) . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Backlight is not very strong.  Be aware, this mirror needs to be mounted in a place where you have illumination from your main vanity light or other light source.  The backlight is not nearly strong enough to use independently.  Just to check it out, I tried turning off all the bathroom lights to use just the Jerdon mirror, and, yes, I could see my ghostly reflection peering darkly back at me, but with not nearly enough light to do any serious work.  In fairness, I think the product was never intended to be its own primary light source.  The light around the edge of the mirror is really intended for evening out the light on one&#x27;s face, not for full illumination.  That said, it might have been nice to have a bit more light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- You need some electrical skills to install.  Buyer beware that the unit is designed for flush wall installation, with direct wiring to a junction box.  This is not for mounting just anywhere and then plugging it into your bathroom outlet -- there is no cord option included.  So your mounting options are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(i) Cut open your wall, install a junction box, feed your house wiring over to the junction box, splice in the mirror wiring (which will probably require additional lengths of wire).  Folks, please don&#x27;t do this unless you know what you are doing with electrical wiring! Or . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(ii) Do some metal work on the unit itself (cutting an opening in the wall housing, the back plate and the wire cover plate), and splice in your own cord.  Folks, please don&#x27;t do this unless you know what you are doing with electrical wiring!  And, yes, this would almost certainly void the warranty.  :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my case, although I have a fair amount of home electrical experience, given where I wanted to mount the mirror I did not have an easy way to install a junction box and feed the house wiring to splice in without some significant damage to the wall.  So I went with (ii).  If I can, I&#x27;ll post a picture of how it turned out.  I am pretty pleased with the result, but again, it probably voided my warranty and took a fair amount of time and some know-how.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Mounting brackets insufficient.  Come to think of it, why did they include those drywall mounting anchors in the box anyway?  The unit is supposed to be mounted on a junction box.  Hmmm.  Anyway . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit is heavy (yes, that was one of the pros, but it also impacts mounting).  If you go with a heavy duty junction box (heavy metal, please, not a flimsy plastic one) stably mounted to a stud, that might be adequate support.  However, I would recommend, if possible, finding a way to use 4 screws/anchors, rather than just the two suggested in the included instructions.  Probably the thing that will be most impactful to the sturdy look and feel of the unit when all is said and done is how stably it is mounted to the wall.  If the mount is flimsy, the whole thing is going to feel like it can break off at any moment and you will be much less comfortable using it day in and day out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my case, since I went with the &#x27;warranty-voiding-cut-holes-in-the-unit-splice-in-your-own-cord&#x27; option, I was able to mount it where I wanted, which allowed me to put three heavy-duty screws into a 4x4 stud, and use a solid anchor for the 4th screw hole.  The result is an extremely solid and stable attachment to the wall, which translates throughout the body of the unit for a wonderful solid feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Different magnification on the other side?  I&#x27;m guessing this unit will most often be used in a bathroom or vanity area where you already have a standard 1x mirror.  As a result, for me at least, this unit would have been more useful if the otherside were a different magnification level than 1x.  In other words, instead of 1x and 5x mirrors, perhaps 5x and 7x or 5x and 10x (now that would be scary to look into!).  Anyway, I&#x27;m not sure this is really a con, as some people may want to use the 1x, but for me I&#x27;m likely to only use the 5x, so the 1x side is kind of wasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, that is too much already.  Hopefully that will help.  Summary: Well made, solidly built product, with a good mirror and a nice look, but mounting options are a bit tricky and will take some time and electrical skills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update May 8, 2014:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now had this mirror installed for over 4 months, so time for a quick update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I use it virtually every day.  With the 5x mirror side, that is.  As suspected from the outset, I haven&#x27;t had any occasion to use the 1x side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Still working very well and still has a great look and feel.  Again, I can&#x27;t stress enough the importance of a heavy-duty mount -- it will make all the difference in how it feels over time and how much you enjoy using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Still on the first bulb (no surprise).  Now where did I put that spare bulb in case I need it . . . ?  Incidentally, the key to having the mirror be \\&quot;fog free\\&quot; is to turn the mirror light on right before you jump in the shower.  Then when you get out of the shower the mirror will indeed be fog free and you can use it right away even if your regular bathroom mirror is completely fogged over.  The fog-free capability comes from a combination of (i) the air-flow openings around the outside of the mirror housing, and (ii) the warmth from the bulb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Would love to give this 5-stars.  They way I have it installed and working it definitely merits it.  The only reason I can&#x27;t is because the unit should come with better mounting options, rather than the purchaser having to get creative.  Again, if you&#x27;re not handy it could be a bit frustrating; if you&#x27;re comfortable with electrical and willing to do a bit of work, you&#x27;ll likely be very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> The product is very good and meets expectations. I am satisfied with the purchase and recommend it to anyone interested in a quality product.</li>
            <li> Product was better that advertised. Easy to mount and wire. Wife loves the mirror. Halo light could be a little brighter but overall a great deal for the money.</li>
            <li> Nice magnifying mirror, good quality,</li>
            <li> This mirror looks nice, but it does not work as well as I was hoping.  I will keep it, it is handy, but the light is not too strong, works as well with the light as without the light.  I think if I had to buy another one, I will look for another product.  The mirror was not too expensive, I guess I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> Although you cannot tell from the picture, this mirror is really fat (front to back) and clunky looking.  We returned it.</li>
            <li> My wife wanted this makeup mirror and bought it locally in the plug in version for a lot more than Amazon.  She really wanted it in a hard wired version.  I found this one for almost half the price and for only a few more bucks in wire supplies she had the mirror without dangling cords.  Good quality and my wife is thrilled.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this mirror to use in my bathroom.  Unfortunately, the magnification didn&#x27;t quite meet my needs (not strong enough) and the light it emits also isn&#x27;t very bright.  My daughter thinks it&#x27;s &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34; so I had it installed in her bathroom.  She&#x27;s 23 and I&#x27;m 58.</li>
            <li> Considering that some of these lighted mirrors can be hundreds of dollars (who in their right mind would pay that much??), this is a great bargain.  I don&#x27;t use the light that much as I have plenty of light in my bathroom but it does seem a bit weak.  But the magnifying side is great and it folds back to be fairly flush with the wall which I was concerned about.  I&#x27;ve only had it for about 6 weeks but it has stayed firmly attached to the wall and the joints work well.  I do try to be careful not to pull down on it as I know that these things can become loose and pull out of the wall pretty easily.</li>
            <li> My wife has wanted a lighted mirror like this for years.  This one went in easily, works well, and my wife loves it.  Therefore, it gets five stars.</li>
            <li> I needed a lighted mirror for makeup application.  I don&#x27;t like my countertop cluttered so I was on the prowl for a mountable one &amp; did not want a cord hanging down.  This mirror was perfect!  The &amp;#34;no fog&amp;#34; feature is very handy as well.  Just have to be sure to turn the mirror on before hopping in the shower.</li>
            <li> I have now installed three of these in bathrooms I have remodeled. We use them often and like them light quite a bit. They look nice and high quality and do not detract from the bathroom decor. The light is operated with a switch on the unit. With the light and the magnification, it is a great tool for staying tidily groomed. This model is wired directly into the wall, so unless you are good with wiring, installation will require the assistance of an electrician.</li>
            <li> The mirror looks great the only problem is the bulb is not bright enough and it makes it hard to see</li>
            <li> Again, I really liked the mobility of this mirror but it is bulky which I guess is necessary and it would have been really in the way when it wasn&#x27;t being used.</li>
            <li> Great function - Great look! Reasonable Price</li>
            <li> We just remodeled our bathroom and I just love this mounted mirror.  it is out of the way when you don&#x27;t use it but pulls out and is just perfect for make up and tweezing eyebrows.</li>
            <li> My wife wanted a wall mounted Mirror - since this was hard wired it looks like a professionally installed item with no trailing wires across the vanity to a socket.</li>
            <li> My mistake. I really needed a plug-in rather than a wired mirror. Oh, well . . . . .</li>
            <li> I love this product but would definitely have liked the extension &amp;#34;arm&amp;#34; to be a few inches longer.  The light on it works really well and the price was great!</li>
            <li> This mirror, in shiny chrome, is not only convenient and functional, but adds an attractive modern touch to my master bath redo.  The light level and color is just right for makeup application and the magnified mirror gives an undistorted reflection.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mirror for about a year now.  We were in the process of remodeling our master bathroom when we went to the Vdara hotel in Las Vegas and there was one in the bathroom there.  I loved it and immediately went online and ordered one to install in our remodel.  Absolutely love it!  I am far-sighted, so the magnifying mirror helps me to put makeup on.  Works well and is so convenient to have wall mounted.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this daily. Got it as an anniversary present. Works good, seems to be a little heavy since it sags down just a bit from the wall but works fine. Would be good if the bulb was LED and maybe a little brighter. Thats me talking, my wife has not said anything about brightness issues.</li>
            <li> Very happy with quality of the mirror, install was easy. Shipped on time and arrived early and with out damage</li>
            <li> Nice magnification, but the light is too dim.  I believe other reviewers mentioned this and I wish I had listened.  Why in the world would they make a &amp;#34;lighted&amp;#34; make up mirror so dim.  Isn&#x27;t the idea to see better when putting on your makeup?!  :(</li>
            <li> Received in good shape appearance wise. Swing arm seems tight but probably OK once installed. This mirror is just heavy enough to warrant extra scrutiny of what you&#x27;re mounting it on. Make sure that everything is very secure to studs behind the wall surface. This is model wired directly to service.</li>
            <li> Works great. Just what we needed for plucking eyebrows and whatnot and leaves both hands free.  The fact that it swivels and can be adjusted to where you want it is a great feature.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Easy to install and sturdy when mounted correctly. Wife LOVES it.</li>
            <li> A much better value than the very expensive mirrors I priced out elsewhere. Pretty good quality. While I would have liked the extension to be longer the most disappointing feature by far is the halo lighting which is essentially worthless. Good thing I have other lighting.</li>
            <li> Mirror part is okay but the lamps are weak and don&#x27;t put out enough light. Big problem is, that isn&#x27;t noticed until after the mirror is installed as this is hard-wired!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the design is such the mirror doesn&#x27;t fold up as compactly as it could.</li>
            <li> Very solid mirror and arm unit.  Exactly as described ... hanging screws and extra bulb were included!  Minimal fuss to install and works great!  5 Stars!</li>
            <li> Mirror is a bit on the thick size to accommodate the light bulb and still give it clearance from the mirror surfaces that sandwich it. Arms are a little on the short side and the pivot points require oiling so as not to grind. And, if you forget to turn it off after use it can get rather hot to the touch. All in all, if i had it to do over again I would go with a larger mirror with LED lights instead.</li>
            <li> Love it but started to rust from steam in bathroom</li>
            <li> I installed this in short order.  It was designed for cordless so I cut a hole in the wall mounted a box and wired it up.  I would recommend not using a \\&quot;old work\\&quot; box if possible because the weight of the mirror extended can put some strain on the wall/sconce interface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror works great and it swings out nicely. The quality is very nice and it is definitely worth the price.  The lighting does not add much and I found that ambient light provides better light in my installation.  I would say lighting will always depend on the installation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another installation issue.  Try out different locations and make sure you don&#x27;t create interference with other items in your bathroom like a sconce or mirror door that opens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chrome finish looks very good too.  Not cheaply made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone looking for a high quality mirror that you might find in a good hotel.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a bargain, comparing it to the prices of similar lighted magnifying mirros out there.  It does take some technical know-how for installation, since one must be prepared for drilling and hooking into the electrical box behind the wall, in order to conceal the power cord, but the final result is worth it.  The magnification is just right too--there are other mirrors that are 10X, which I think is probably way beyond what anyone looking at you can see.  5X allows for tweezing and realistic examination of your pores and imperfections.  Also, this mirror comes in several finishes; I chose chrome to match the hardware in my bathroom.  Highly recommended. I have only had for a few weeks so cannot comment on durability or light life.</li>
            <li> very happy with it, just like the pictures&lt;br /&gt;very happy with the delivery time&lt;br /&gt;it was a used item , but like was like new conditions&lt;br /&gt;Need to be mounted on a outlet box (you will rought in a power feed)&lt;br /&gt;Switch is in the mounting plate of fixture</li>
            <li> Love the mirror, easy to hardwire, would have liked it an inch or two larger, though.</li>
            <li> I previously owned a non-lighted Jerdon x7 mirror &amp; loved it. When we remodeled my bathroom I wanted the same and to add a lighted version. Well, they don&#x27;t sell one (after a lengthy online search) so I choose a x5 after returning two x10 Zadro (too close) brushed nickel versions, one about 3&amp;#34; wide &amp; the other about 1&amp;#34; wide. I found this one on Amazon as an &amp;#34;open box&amp;#34; offer and saved about $100. I&#x27;m getting used to this one but have had to make some adjustments. Pros: Chrome finish matches the other chrome fixtures. Good height placement by my contractor. Cons: Since it is hardwired it can only be turned on when my other LED bath lights are on. When turned on the &amp;#34;halo&amp;#34; shows up in the iris&#x27; of my eyes which is annoying so now just don&#x27;t turn it on at all. Not sure if this is from the lights or just a product problem. The regular side mirror I added a suction cup 3&amp;#34; x10 mirror for more detailed work. The non-lighted version was on a different wall and the backlight from a skylight gave better vision. Nothing is set in stone so I can change this but I would recommend trying out the mirror you do choose before making it a permanent fixture.</li>
