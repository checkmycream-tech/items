            <li>This sirum binds the cells and retains moisture resulting to a more plump appearance to my skin.</li>
            <li>and I can use my make up on top.</li>
            <li>my skin is glowingly beautiful and velvety soft.  </li>
            <li>I easily break out (adult acne-I&#x27;m 39) and so finding a good moisturizer has been a nightmare before trying this!</li>
            <li>I was excited to receive this Sano Naturals Hyaluronic acid serum in the mail!</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly though, and doesn&#x27;t leave any kind of residue.</li>
            <li>I love the way this product feels on my skin- sooo hydrating, does not cause stinging on my sensitive skin like most products do!!</li>
            <li>The bottle it comes in is glass and has a dropper to help disperse cleanly !</li>
            <li>give it a week and wrote a update to my review so far I&#x27;m very satisfied!</li>
            <li>VERY GOOD PRODUCT MAKES YOU LOOK YOUNGER</li>
            <li>I started this a week ago, and so far it has been great</li>
            <li>It is important to keep a healthy complextion with all of my ongoing work.</li>
            <li>It reduces the appearance of discoloration associated with sun damage, blemishes and acne scarring leaving skin with a smooth, healthy looking complexion.</li>
            <li>so I wanted to test it out on my face to see how good it really worked.</li>
            <li>This product is lovely and smoothing under the eye area after using the SANO eye cream which is my absolute favorite !</li>
            <li>It dries very quickly, which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good..lite and easy on the skin.</li>

            <li>This is PURE LOVE!</li>
            <li>This Hyaluronic Acid Serum is an ultra moisturizing serum that visibly improves the appearance of dryness, wrinkles and fine lines on your skin.</li>
            <li>The product is organic and used for improving dryness, fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I use Vitamin C serum first, then use this on top of it, my skin always looks refreshed and more youthful.</li>
            <li>Love how smooth it goes on and how quickly it dries.</li>
            <li>My husband who is almost 58 and myself at 35 have been using this one our face at night and see a huge difference in skin glow and reduced fine lines and puffiness.</li>
            <li>It helps reduce fine likes and redness of the face making your face feel smooth.</li>
            <li>My face is clearing up and I am noticing a huge difference.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and is not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>This serum is paraben and sulfate free &amp; also vegan &amp; cruelty free which is always a must for me when buying product.</li>
            <li>This is a great product but it shows three bottles and i only received one bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can say that it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>, this one goes on smoothly, isn&#x27;t sticky.</li>
            <li>it goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>His cheeks and lips were smooth.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>It is important that I keep a glow to my face.</li>
            <li>If you want smooth skin, buy this.</li>
            <li>but when this company asked me to leave a review for a free bottle I immediately clicked through to do so.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 59 and found what I was looking for in a fast effective wrinkle eliminator.</li>
            <li>This serum is light, but moisturize my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say this is a total win.</li>
            <li>It looks and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>It soaks right in, and gives me a nice, fresh, dewy look.  </li>
            <li>and i notice the difference right away:)</li>
            <li>Bought to try some other products :) Great find</li>
            <li>As I have gotten older, I notice more and more wrinkles, but when I use this on my skin, it feels supple and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and it dries quickly.</li>
            <li>A serum that will take your original discolored tones of your skin and create a more balanced and even tone to give you the best younger looking face possible.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different brands and I love this serum!  </li>
            <li>I noticed my skin texture improving almost immediately, and as I continued to use it, most of those tiny wrinkles around my eyes and mouth diminished more and more.  </li>
            <li>I received my SANO NATURALS Hyaluronic Acid Serum + yesterday and I am so excited.  </li>
            <li>But as of my first use, my skin feels smooth and there is visible moisture retention!  </li>
            <li>This advanced treatment addresses signs of aging on the face, including wrinkles, fine lines, smile lines, creases and crow&#x27;s feet.</li>
            <li>This is the first Sano Naturals product that I have tried, but not the first Hyaluronic Acid Serum that I have used, so I was excited when I was asked to try this for my honest review.</li>
            <li>for some reason I liked the last brand better</li>
            <li>Love how soft and smooth this stuff goes on!</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and is not sticky, absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>But so far I love the product!</li>
            <li>It is very light and penetrates fast.</li>
            <li>Thank you for providing the right tools to help my skin!</li>
            <li>I really like the bottle and love the dropper.</li>
            <li>I love this product, my face feels &amp; looks so much smoother</li>
            <li>I have not been wowed by many of these anti&#x3D;aging products, but this one comes very close.</li>
            <li>Will be ordering more very soon.</li>
            <li>It got here on there and full in botlle</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about their products.</li>
            <li>I use it with my morning and evening moisturizer and love how much softer it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li>To be fair I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice anything truly remarkable</li>
            <li>However, still waiting for full results.</li>
            <li>if used consistently, it really does take years off your skin and leaves the skin softer smoother more even and radiant looking.  </li>
            <li>It really works, after two weeks my face and neck looked  80% better, I  am using on my hands too.</li>
            <li>I will continue to the prioduct to see if the age and aspect part is true.</li>
            <li>It is loaded with Vitamin C, a powerful anti-oxdiant that takes charge and fights off free radicals and repairs damaged skin.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t need much and glides on smoothly, drying quickly!</li>
            <li>Ansious to prove some other products if this great product line.</li>
            <li>To keep up fine lines this really does work!</li>
            <li>so I feel it finished too quickly.  </li>
            <li>I do like that it has no scent and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>This has helped my skin tremendously.</li>

            <li>I use a little in the morning and at night and have been very pleased with the results!</li>
            <li>and I love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural organic ingredients !</li>

            <li>So far, I have noticed that my skin is more even toned.</li>
            <li>I could not even tell I had applied the serum once it absorbed into the places treated.</li>
            <li>It was definitely worth</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m able to use it at night and in the morning especially since it isn&#x27;t greasy</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t describe how smooth and soft this makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li>you have dryness most likely.</li>

            <li>Fast Shipping too!</li>
            <li>I received my product today and used it for the first time.  </li>
            <li>I am in the process of beginning a &amp;#34;women over 40&amp;#34; beauty vlog and intend for this product to be my first review.  </li>

            <li>that is exactly what I achieved.</li>
            <li>It is very a very smooth serum and goes on and sinks in right away.  </li>
            <li>This dual function serum not only repairs the appearance of your skin but also protects your skin as it is loaded with essential vitamin c, which is a powerful antioxidant that fights free radicals, and repairs damaged skin!!</li>
            <li>so I am pretty much always on the go.</li>
            <li>I recently started to use Sano Natural products, I love how they feel, the products get rapidly absorbed by the skin.</li>

            <li>It has made a noticeable difference in my skin tone, fine wrinkles, pore size and overall brightness.  </li>
            <li>By far the best product on the market after using Hyaluronic Acid Serum which is a Daily Moisturzier I had to give a review;  it not only makes my face feel soft but also rids my daily acne; my face feels fresh and clean on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday and it is amazing at moisturizing my face after I wash it, while also regulating my oily skin during the day.</li>
            <li>My 61 year old skin is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in my skin and the bottle is already finished.  </li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t have to use much at all.</li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>For a person like me who has very oily skin</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need much product to start seeing results.</li>
            <li>It takes a couple of minutes, but it really hydrates the skin.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>and I really like how it makes my skin look and feel.  </li>
            <li>Really haven&#x27;t seen a difference</li>
            <li>It really did not do anything.</li>
            <li>I actually really like the smell.</li>
            <li>but I really like the way it feels on my skin, along with all the benefits of the ingredients</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was very misleading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shirley Werner</li>
            <li>Now it smooth and wrinkles are not as deep.</li>
            <li>Really like this serum.</li>
            <li>I really do like these products</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much product.</li>
            <li>and I really do recommend this product for face, neck, hands and probably anywhere else</li>
            <li>I really like this serum.</li>
            <li>very fair,sensitive skin and my face has never looked, brighter and clearer.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and will buy it again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the serum for about 2 weeks now, and it really helps keeping my face and hands moisturized throughout the day.</li>
            <li>My face felt very moisturized.</li>
            <li>but I like it very much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use a light daily moisturizer over it.</li>
            <li>So, let me tell you, I really like this product.</li>
            <li>My skin is much softer &amp; healthier looking.</li>
            <li>This does seem to hydrate the face very well.</li>
            <li>I was surprised!!!</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive skin and so far after 3 application, no bad reaction.</li>
            <li>First off, I am only 23 years old, so I&#x27;m not too worried about wrinkles and fine lines yet; HOWEVER, i am all about preventing them.</li>
            <li>The serum spreads out nicely and a little drop spreads out pretty far.</li>
            <li>It dosnt seem like much when you open it,smells like clean roses,but works wonders.</li>
            <li>My skin is really sensitive to certain products, but I had no ill effects with this one.  </li>
            <li>What I like the most about this hyaluronic acid serum compared to the other serums that I have tried, is that it is thicker than the others.</li>
            <li>it is a little thin, but they all are, it has a pleasant scent and absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li>I have long been wanting a product that is natural and healthy to activate collagen production without surgery.</li>
            <li>the smell is not strong I like that because I don&#x27;t like smells that are to strong on my face.so far I tried on hands and it isn&#x27;t greasy and feels smooth</li>
            <li>/&gt;Living in Western New York it is important to use protection for the face because of the climate drying out the skin and chapping it.</li>
            <li>I use it at night after I cleanse my face with no other than clean and clear, (from Walmart)</li>
            <li>I care for my skin diligently,so I expected to see more vivid results.</li>
            <li>When I received this serum I first tested it out on my hand to see how it felt, since my skin is sensitive at times.</li>
            <li>Was surprised at the high!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like I have new skin!</li>
            <li>even when I wear makeup, it goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>the older I get.</li>
            <li>I have used much more expensive products from salons and these work better.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product with high expectations, and to my surprise IT</li>
            <li>I highly highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have definitely seen improvement in my skin but, I ran out and couldnt afford to buy more right away and within a week my skin was going back to looking the same as before</li>
            <li>So far have not seen much difference in the lines on my face.  </li>
            <li>So far I can say I really like this product.</li>
            <li>an it made me look alive again, haha</li>
            <li>I have used Sano&#x27;s Serum even without my moisturizer sometimes and my face feels soft even at the end of the afternoon in an office with too much air conditioning.</li>
            <li>This is smoth kind of thick, not too watery.</li>
            <li>The serum soaks into the skin quickly and I am left with a soft feel that is not at all greasy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just received it this week &amp; I&#x27;m a new member of the Sano Family...</li>
            <li>That is a new feeling for a post menopausal woman.</li>
            <li>This product together with the Phytoceramides and eye cream has given my skin a new lift and glow</li>
            <li>This is  a new purchase.  </li>
            <li>I am so looking forward to seeing the results of my new purchase of Sano Hyaluronic acid and Serum that I received yesterday.  </li>
            <li>This serum will deeply penetrate into your skin to seal in hydration in order to smooth your skins appearance making for a younger healthier complexion.</li>
            <li>At first I felt like a little burning sensation but it quickly went away.</li>
            <li>have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It also arrived early!</li>
            <li>So far I like it!</li>
            <li>but his skin became so soft!  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling tight and my make up goes on smoothly over.</li>
            <li>I will see after a few months of use if I see a difference in fine lines.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve noticed a huge improvement, but I think my few sun spots are faded just a bit.</li>
            <li>It keep my skin soft and hydrated</li>
            <li>i just  stared using it , i will see in a month  if htere are any results, so  far  </li>
            <li>it makes my skin  soft</li>
            <li>The wrinkles on my face don&#x27;t completely go away...</li>
            <li>I like it so far, would order again</li>
            <li>and it is completely gone.  </li>
            <li>So far my skin feels softer and feels lighter.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised to find something that worked for me.</li>
            <li>I like this serum so far.</li>
            <li>Organic Natural Skincare for Face.]</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok,made my skin soft.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and a lot of thing burn my face.</li>
            <li>It is really eliminating some deep wrinkles I had over my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>This has maintained a soft and moisturized feel even on the coldest of days.</li>
            <li>and it really has made definite improvements.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I had to stop buying vit c serum from another seller on amazon for same reason (even though that time product was very brown</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still young, but I figured getting a head start couldn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li>Afterwards I touched my hand and it felt really soft.</li>
            <li>how much time we spend outside</li>
            <li>He used it on his face and wow.  </li>
            <li>Smells soft.</li>
            <li>I like using natural and organic products on my face</li>
            <li>and I can really feel it cover my entire face.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I found this product now, while I am in my late 40s,</li>
            <li>this  product was the natural substances they put into the serum.</li>
            <li>People have always said I look young for my age</li>
            <li>I apply the Sano Hyaluronic Serum immediately after washing my face and it leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>I will keep using this all natural product.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and I had no trouble with this Sano product.</li>
            <li>but so far it agrees with my skin.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural and organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>I am a mature woman in my early 70&#x27;s</li>
            <li>This is a dual function serum that lifts sagging skin and protects it from future harm and attacks by the sun uv rays and other environmental elements that attacks your skin by accelerating the aging appearance of your skin and better yet, this serum has antioxidants that begins the healing process of cell damaged skin and delivering its nutrients deep into the dermis for a healthier look, feel and appearance</li>
            <li>After the 2nd day my face was even better and already lightning some of my dark spots from recently breaking out.</li>
            <li>However this order of vit C serum is NOT the light nearly clear serum that it should be, it is a brownish color and has a slight odor and oddly enough this time has a sticker added to bottle with expiration date that says it is still &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; which I question since I have been buying this product a longtime and it should not have a color or odor!</li>
            <li>It&amp;#34;s gentle and soothing to my dry skin.</li>
            <li>Deep penetrating to seal in hydration to firm and smooth skin&#x27;s appearance for a youthful-looking complexion.</li>
            <li>My pores are smaller, my skin is softer, I have had no break outs since I started using it, my skin isn&#x27;t really oily anymore, and my acne scars are starting to lighten up.</li>
            <li>The product does not appear heavy on the skin and disappears into the skin quite quickly with no odor as a lot of cleansers have.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, and it absorbs into my skin very quickly.</li>
            <li>Only a small amount is needed and absorbs easily.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a high quality daily moisturizing facial serum.</li>
            <li>Hyaluronic acid alone leaves your skin with a cracked smile feeling like you have a dried face mask on.</li>
            <li>I have liked this product, but fail to see the glow that I&#x27;d hoped for.</li>
            <li>I am very selective about what products go on my face after the roller, and this fits the bill due to</li>
            <li>After coming off of birth control, my skin has been completely unpredictable and prone to intense breakouts along the jaw, chin &amp; mouth.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using this product my skin has balanced out and is much smoother, firmer with less visible lines around the eyes where the majority of my problem is.</li>
            <li>I am a 48yr old mother of six and have been experiencing increasing dry skin and wrinkles related with hormonal aging.  </li>
            <li>It came in a nice bottle, and after using it for a week, it smoothed the fine lines on my stomach that I get whenever I lean over, which is basically every second of my life because I have awful posture.</li>

            <li> my skin is glowingly beautiful and velvety soft.  </li>
            <li> I easily break out (adult acne-I&#x27;m 39) and so finding a good moisturizer has been a nightmare before trying this!</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this Sano Naturals Hyaluronic acid serum in the mail!</li>

            <li> give it a week and wrote a update to my review so far I&#x27;m very satisfied!</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD PRODUCT MAKES YOU LOOK YOUNGER</li>
            <li> I started this a week ago, and so far it has been great</li>
            <li> It is important to keep a healthy complextion with all of my ongoing work.</li>
            <li> It reduces the appearance of discoloration associated with sun damage, blemishes and acne scarring leaving skin with a smooth, healthy looking complexion.</li>
            <li> so I wanted to test it out on my face to see how good it really worked.</li>

            <li> It dries very quickly, which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good..lite and easy on the skin.</li>

            <li> This is PURE LOVE!</li>
            <li> This Hyaluronic Acid Serum is an ultra moisturizing serum that visibly improves the appearance of dryness, wrinkles and fine lines on your skin.</li>
            <li> The product is organic and used for improving dryness, fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I use Vitamin C serum first, then use this on top of it, my skin always looks refreshed and more youthful.</li>
            <li> Love how smooth it goes on and how quickly it dries.</li>
            <li> My husband who is almost 58 and myself at 35 have been using this one our face at night and see a huge difference in skin glow and reduced fine lines and puffiness.</li>
            <li> It helps reduce fine likes and redness of the face making your face feel smooth.</li>
            <li> My face is clearing up and I am noticing a huge difference.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and is not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> This serum is paraben and sulfate free &amp; also vegan &amp; cruelty free which is always a must for me when buying product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product but it shows three bottles and i only received one bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can say that it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> , this one goes on smoothly, isn&#x27;t sticky.</li>
            <li> it goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> His cheeks and lips were smooth.  </li>
            <li> Leaves skin smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> It is important that I keep a glow to my face.</li>
            <li> If you want smooth skin, buy this.</li>
            <li> but when this company asked me to leave a review for a free bottle I immediately clicked through to do so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 59 and found what I was looking for in a fast effective wrinkle eliminator.</li>
            <li> This serum is light, but moisturize my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say this is a total win.</li>
            <li> It looks and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> It soaks right in, and gives me a nice, fresh, dewy look.  </li>
            <li> and i notice the difference right away:)</li>
            <li> Bought to try some other products :) Great find</li>
            <li> As I have gotten older, I notice more and more wrinkles, but when I use this on my skin, it feels supple and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and it dries quickly.</li>
            <li> A serum that will take your original discolored tones of your skin and create a more balanced and even tone to give you the best younger looking face possible.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different brands and I love this serum!  </li>
            <li> I noticed my skin texture improving almost immediately, and as I continued to use it, most of those tiny wrinkles around my eyes and mouth diminished more and more.  </li>
            <li> I received my SANO NATURALS Hyaluronic Acid Serum + yesterday and I am so excited.  </li>
            <li> But as of my first use, my skin feels smooth and there is visible moisture retention!  </li>
            <li> This advanced treatment addresses signs of aging on the face, including wrinkles, fine lines, smile lines, creases and crow&#x27;s feet.</li>
            <li> This is the first Sano Naturals product that I have tried, but not the first Hyaluronic Acid Serum that I have used, so I was excited when I was asked to try this for my honest review.</li>
            <li> for some reason I liked the last brand better</li>
            <li> Love how soft and smooth this stuff goes on!</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and is not sticky, absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> But so far I love the product!</li>
            <li> It is very light and penetrates fast.</li>
            <li> Thank you for providing the right tools to help my skin!</li>
            <li> I really like the bottle and love the dropper.</li>
            <li> I love this product, my face feels &amp; looks so much smoother</li>
            <li> I have not been wowed by many of these anti&#x3D;aging products, but this one comes very close.</li>
            <li> Will be ordering more very soon.</li>
            <li> It got here on there and full in botlle</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about their products.</li>
            <li> I use it with my morning and evening moisturizer and love how much softer it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li> To be fair I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice anything truly remarkable</li>
            <li> However, still waiting for full results.</li>
            <li> if used consistently, it really does take years off your skin and leaves the skin softer smoother more even and radiant looking.  </li>
            <li> It really works, after two weeks my face and neck looked  80% better, I  am using on my hands too.</li>
            <li> I will continue to the prioduct to see if the age and aspect part is true.</li>
            <li> It is loaded with Vitamin C, a powerful anti-oxdiant that takes charge and fights off free radicals and repairs damaged skin.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t need much and glides on smoothly, drying quickly!</li>
            <li> Ansious to prove some other products if this great product line.</li>
            <li> To keep up fine lines this really does work!</li>
            <li> so I feel it finished too quickly.  </li>
            <li> I do like that it has no scent and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> This has helped my skin tremendously.</li>
            <li> I also wear an organic sunblock and gently exfoliate regularly (1-2 times a week) and this is great for after care-</li>
            <li> love their products highly recommend, my skin is fabluous</li>
            <li> I had a very dry skin and while using during night I wake up with a bright tight beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> come with good quality and long usable date!</li>
            <li> This serum is making my skin glow, and feel so much more lively.</li>
            <li> and this was gentle to use and easy to transport on trips or on the go.</li>
            <li> I use a little in the morning and at night and have been very pleased with the results!</li>
            <li> and I love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural organic ingredients !</li>
            <li> My fine lines and wrinkles looked diminished after using this and my face just looks so much healthier.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and dries fast, and you can even wear it under your make up.</li>
            <li> So far, I have noticed that my skin is more even toned.</li>
            <li> I could not even tell I had applied the serum once it absorbed into the places treated.</li>
            <li> It was definitely worth</li>
            <li> It also helps with the appearance of smile lines, creases, crow’s feet, etc.</li>
            <li> Definately worth trying it out, I will be reordering.</li>
            <li> The price is excellent when comparing to other similar products in the market.</li>
            <li> i have used many hyaluronic acid serums,  and this one is just as good if not better than ones costing twice as much.</li>
            <li> The difference in my skin has really been significant with a noticeable reduction in wrinkles around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I could see it right away when I used this serum.</li>
            <li> Goes on &amp; soaks right in.</li>
            <li> Less wrinkles, more volume and better color.</li>
            <li> I put a small amount on my hand and it had a light scent but smelled pretty good.</li>
            <li> I am a true produce researcher and really do my homework before buying anything.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel smooth and New..</li>
            <li> I put some on my hands as well, and after washing them the skin is still very soft, smooth, with a brightening effect.</li>
            <li> the very reasonable</li>
            <li> + is a naturally organically derived ultra moisturizing serum that improves dryness, wrinkles and fine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for about 2 weeks, and so far I love it, starting to diminish fine lines around my lips and eyes.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!  </li>
            <li> This is my second bottle, love it.</li>
            <li> product makes the skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> My skin already seems much healthier since adding it to my beauty regime!</li>
            <li> I have reordered with this seller because the first order was great, a thick light (nearly clear)  color serum (as it should be)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to use it at night and in the morning especially since it isn&#x27;t greasy</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t describe how smooth and soft this makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li> you have dryness most likely.</li>
            <li> I will look forward to purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t take much!</li>
            <li> After the first night I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> At first I gave it four starts</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping too!</li>
            <li> I received my product today and used it for the first time.  </li>
            <li> I am in the process of beginning a &amp;#34;women over 40&amp;#34; beauty vlog and intend for this product to be my first review.  </li>
            <li> I use it before I put on Argon Oil, and it helps it to go more deeply into my skin.</li>
            <li> Darken the skin of my face after first application.</li>
            <li> that is exactly what I achieved.</li>
            <li> It is very a very smooth serum and goes on and sinks in right away.  </li>
            <li> This dual function serum not only repairs the appearance of your skin but also protects your skin as it is loaded with essential vitamin c, which is a powerful antioxidant that fights free radicals, and repairs damaged skin!!</li>
            <li> so I am pretty much always on the go.</li>
            <li> I recently started to use Sano Natural products, I love how they feel, the products get rapidly absorbed by the skin.</li>
            <li> it absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling natural, not sticky.  </li>
            <li> my skin looks fresh and soft!</li>

            <li> It has made a noticeable difference in my skin tone, fine wrinkles, pore size and overall brightness.  </li>
            <li> By far the best product on the market after using Hyaluronic Acid Serum which is a Daily Moisturzier I had to give a review;  it not only makes my face feel soft but also rids my daily acne; my face feels fresh and clean on a daily basis.</li>

            <li> and I really like how it makes my skin look and feel.  </li>
            <li> Really haven&#x27;t seen a difference</li>
            <li> It really did not do anything.</li>
            <li> I actually really like the smell.</li>
            <li> but I really like the way it feels on my skin, along with all the benefits of the ingredients</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was very misleading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shirley Werner</li>

            <li> I really like this serum.</li>
            <li> very fair,sensitive skin and my face has never looked, brighter and clearer.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the serum for about 2 weeks now, and it really helps keeping my face and hands moisturized throughout the day.</li>
            <li> My face felt very moisturized.</li>
            <li> but I like it very much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use a light daily moisturizer over it.</li>
            <li> So, let me tell you, I really like this product.</li>
            <li> My skin is much softer &amp; healthier looking.</li>
            <li> This does seem to hydrate the face very well.</li>
            <li> I was surprised!!!</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive skin and so far after 3 application, no bad reaction.</li>
            <li> First off, I am only 23 years old, so I&#x27;m not too worried about wrinkles and fine lines yet; HOWEVER, i am all about preventing them.</li>
            <li> The serum spreads out nicely and a little drop spreads out pretty far.</li>
            <li> It dosnt seem like much when you open it,smells like clean roses,but works wonders.</li>
            <li> My skin is really sensitive to certain products, but I had no ill effects with this one.  </li>
            <li> What I like the most about this hyaluronic acid serum compared to the other serums that I have tried, is that it is thicker than the others.</li>
            <li> it is a little thin, but they all are, it has a pleasant scent and absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li> I have long been wanting a product that is natural and healthy to activate collagen production without surgery.</li>
            <li> the smell is not strong I like that because I don&#x27;t like smells that are to strong on my face.so far I tried on hands and it isn&#x27;t greasy and feels smooth</li>
            <li> /&gt;Living in Western New York it is important to use protection for the face because of the climate drying out the skin and chapping it.</li>
            <li> I use it at night after I cleanse my face with no other than clean and clear, (from Walmart)</li>
            <li> I care for my skin diligently,so I expected to see more vivid results.</li>
            <li> When I received this serum I first tested it out on my hand to see how it felt, since my skin is sensitive at times.</li>
            <li> Was surprised at the high!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like I have new skin!</li>
            <li> even when I wear makeup, it goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> the older I get.</li>
            <li> I have used much more expensive products from salons and these work better.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product with high expectations, and to my surprise IT</li>
            <li> I highly highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have definitely seen improvement in my skin but, I ran out and couldnt afford to buy more right away and within a week my skin was going back to looking the same as before</li>
            <li> So far have not seen much difference in the lines on my face.  </li>
            <li> So far I can say I really like this product.</li>
            <li> an it made me look alive again, haha</li>
            <li> I have used Sano&#x27;s Serum even without my moisturizer sometimes and my face feels soft even at the end of the afternoon in an office with too much air conditioning.</li>
            <li> This is smoth kind of thick, not too watery.</li>
            <li> The serum soaks into the skin quickly and I am left with a soft feel that is not at all greasy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just received it this week &amp; I&#x27;m a new member of the Sano Family...</li>
            <li> That is a new feeling for a post menopausal woman.</li>
            <li> This product together with the Phytoceramides and eye cream has given my skin a new lift and glow</li>
            <li> This is  a new purchase.  </li>
            <li> I am so looking forward to seeing the results of my new purchase of Sano Hyaluronic acid and Serum that I received yesterday.  </li>
            <li> This serum will deeply penetrate into your skin to seal in hydration in order to smooth your skins appearance making for a younger healthier complexion.</li>
            <li> At first I felt like a little burning sensation but it quickly went away.</li>
            <li> have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It also arrived early!</li>
            <li> So far I like it!</li>
            <li> but his skin became so soft!  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling tight and my make up goes on smoothly over.</li>
            <li> I will see after a few months of use if I see a difference in fine lines.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve noticed a huge improvement, but I think my few sun spots are faded just a bit.</li>
            <li> It keep my skin soft and hydrated</li>
            <li> i just  stared using it , i will see in a month  if htere are any results, so  far  </li>
            <li> it makes my skin  soft</li>
            <li> The wrinkles on my face don&#x27;t completely go away...</li>
            <li> I like it so far, would order again</li>
            <li> and it is completely gone.  </li>
            <li> So far my skin feels softer and feels lighter.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised to find something that worked for me.</li>
            <li> I like this serum so far.</li>
            <li> Organic Natural Skincare for Face.]</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok,made my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and a lot of thing burn my face.</li>
            <li> It is really eliminating some deep wrinkles I had over my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> This has maintained a soft and moisturized feel even on the coldest of days.</li>
            <li> and it really has made definite improvements.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I had to stop buying vit c serum from another seller on amazon for same reason (even though that time product was very brown</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still young, but I figured getting a head start couldn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> Afterwards I touched my hand and it felt really soft.</li>
            <li> how much time we spend outside</li>
            <li> He used it on his face and wow.  </li>
            <li> Smells soft.</li>
            <li> I like using natural and organic products on my face</li>
            <li> and I can really feel it cover my entire face.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I found this product now, while I am in my late 40s,</li>
            <li> this  product was the natural substances they put into the serum.</li>
            <li> People have always said I look young for my age</li>
            <li> I apply the Sano Hyaluronic Serum immediately after washing my face and it leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> I will keep using this all natural product.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and I had no trouble with this Sano product.</li>
            <li> but so far it agrees with my skin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural and organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> I am a mature woman in my early 70&#x27;s</li>
            <li> This is a dual function serum that lifts sagging skin and protects it from future harm and attacks by the sun uv rays and other environmental elements that attacks your skin by accelerating the aging appearance of your skin and better yet, this serum has antioxidants that begins the healing process of cell damaged skin and delivering its nutrients deep into the dermis for a healthier look, feel and appearance</li>
            <li> After the 2nd day my face was even better and already lightning some of my dark spots from recently breaking out.</li>
            <li> However this order of vit C serum is NOT the light nearly clear serum that it should be, it is a brownish color and has a slight odor and oddly enough this time has a sticker added to bottle with expiration date that says it is still &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; which I question since I have been buying this product a longtime and it should not have a color or odor!</li>
            <li> It&amp;#34;s gentle and soothing to my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Deep penetrating to seal in hydration to firm and smooth skin&#x27;s appearance for a youthful-looking complexion.</li>
            <li> My pores are smaller, my skin is softer, I have had no break outs since I started using it, my skin isn&#x27;t really oily anymore, and my acne scars are starting to lighten up.</li>
            <li> The product does not appear heavy on the skin and disappears into the skin quite quickly with no odor as a lot of cleansers have.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and it absorbs into my skin very quickly.</li>
            <li> Only a small amount is needed and absorbs easily.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a high quality daily moisturizing facial serum.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid alone leaves your skin with a cracked smile feeling like you have a dried face mask on.</li>
            <li> I have liked this product, but fail to see the glow that I&#x27;d hoped for.</li>
            <li> I am very selective about what products go on my face after the roller, and this fits the bill due to</li>
            <li> After coming off of birth control, my skin has been completely unpredictable and prone to intense breakouts along the jaw, chin &amp; mouth.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using this product my skin has balanced out and is much smoother, firmer with less visible lines around the eyes where the majority of my problem is.</li>
            <li> I am a 48yr old mother of six and have been experiencing increasing dry skin and wrinkles related with hormonal aging.  </li>
            <li> It came in a nice bottle, and after using it for a week, it smoothed the fine lines on my stomach that I get whenever I lean over, which is basically every second of my life because I have awful posture.</li>
            <li> Maybe because of my skin type I am black with normal skin.</li>
            <li> I had spend a lot of money in expensive products and have not seen such a fast positive results like with Sano products.</li>
            <li> I think it will if used long enough.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not been long enough.</li>
            <li> I am liking the results so far even though it&#x27;s only been a few days.</li>
            <li> I am blonde with green eyes and 46 years old.</li>
            <li> I hate it because when I put certain serums to help the dry spots, it makes the oily spots more oily.</li>
            <li> For serious dry skin this Hyaluronic Acid Serum really helps!</li>
            <li> Cant wait to see long term results.</li>
            <li> So I have to be extra careful when opening and closing the serum.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll you only get one as I expected.</li>
            <li> My skin feels hydrated all day long.</li>
            <li> I was trying to figure out how long each bottle has lasted me</li>
            <li> My breakouts were also smaller and less red.</li>
            <li> No different than any other serum.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this very long</li>
            <li> I have always suffered from dry skin on my face and hands and I am always trying to find ways to help hydrate and keep them moisturized.</li>
            <li> My forehead was always dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> My hands aren&#x27;t that dry to start with</li>
            <li> but I also have dry patches.</li>
            <li> I waited for it to dry and then put on my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> and my skin was just so dry.</li>
            <li> I use salycic acid and benzoyl peroxide which dry out areas around my nose, chin and eye area.</li>
            <li> and I have dry yet oily acne prone skin</li>
            <li> but after just a week of use I see a big difference and other people started noticing !</li>
            <li> I have fought to find something to help with dry skin, and now I have!</li>
            <li> but this definitely hydrates my skin so they are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I put a little bit and spread around especially concentrating on dry spots.</li>
            <li> My combination skin typically gets oily and dry at the same time and since applying this I noticed nearly no dryness and less oiliness-</li>
            <li> I am holding back on the 5 star until I have used it a little longer.</li>
            <li> all worries gone about aged skin.</li>
            <li> I had a reunion with my four sisters a few months ago, and even though I am the oldest, I actually started looking like the oldest.  </li>
            <li> I put only a few drops on my face and a drop on each hand</li>
            <li> The biggest problem I have is to remember to apply it while my skin is still damp or wet.</li>
            <li> Only had this product a few weeks</li>
            <li> Please believe me I do not do product reviews on products unless I absolutely loved or hated it.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I spread it on my hand and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> There is no smell to the product and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting rid of my other products, and just going to use this for now on!.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> I also had a round red mark on the middle of my nose for at least a year</li>
            <li> but once you get used to that you won&#x27;t have any other complaints.</li>
            <li> I am going to try there other products.</li>
            <li> This serum also lifts and tones the look of aging and sagging skin while reducing the appearance of discoloration due to sun damage, aging and acne scarring.</li>
            <li> but these products have helped me feel like I am getting rid of some of the last few years!</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t bother my face like all other face serums and creams.</li>
            <li> lifts and tones the look of aging and sagging skin while reducing discoloration due to sun damage, aging and acne scarring.</li>
            <li> I realize this and other products may take time to yield optimal results</li>
            <li> I was having trouble with my face and hands being so dry.</li>
            <li> It is a little harder to get out</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gel-ish consistency which makes it hard for the dropper to pick up, and instead the gel gets stuck to the outside of the dropped instead of inside it.</li>
            <li> I recently met someone who was shocked to find out how old I am, they said , they could have sworn I was 10 years younger!!</li>
            <li> The serum is just thick enough that it doesn&#x27;t run like water.</li>
            <li> I also felt as it it was moisturizing and being I have thin, sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I love that it comes with a dropper, I hate when face oils/serums don&#x27;t have one.</li>
            <li> It is thick enough</li>
            <li> I wash my face, pat dry (but leave a little moisture on it), apply product, then apply moisturizer, then make up.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this a few days now.</li>
            <li> soooo it would be weird if it was super thick..</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t see my dry spots no more.</li>
            <li> I received this for a review and gave it to my husband to try as I was sent a few other brands too.  </li>
            <li> The name sounds complicated and medical but the results are quite simple.</li>
            <li> This has helped hydrate my skin and has lead to my wrinkles to be less visable</li>
            <li> Breaking out bad and horribly dry despite using Ole Henriksen products,paulas choice and first aid beauty moisturizer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell of the serum is not very strong and goes away in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> If you have dry or dehydrated skin (and who doesn’t have it this time of year with the forced air heat taking all of the moisture out of our skin), then I have something you will want to take notice of and use.</li>
            <li> I use a little of this then some lotion</li>
            <li> I have been uing for 1 month and have noticed little difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I wash my face and then apply a few drops while my skin is still moist.</li>
            <li> It does not leave you skin all oily, but firm and well mosturized.</li>
            <li> Just received this product a few days ago.</li>
            <li> I use this hyaluronic acid and the vitamin C together everyday</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few weeks</li>
            <li> so I have reserved the 5 star rating for an update within a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I used it everyday and my face feels like and looks like a million bucks.</li>
            <li> I will continue use and cannot wait for the results in a few weeks after seeing changes this soon.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Serums are usually dense and weigh you down.</li>
            <li> I ran out of the sano hyaluronic acid + serum and had some plain vit c and did not like it as well because it made my face breakout</li>
            <li> It makes my skin under the eyes tight and luminous !</li>
            <li> I have noticed in the past few days that my skin looks plumper and feels softer.</li>
            <li> Not sure what it is doing yet?</li>
            <li> I use it every morning on my face and neck then a apply day cream, sunblock and my usual makeup.</li>
            <li> I use it on my nose since I get dry skin there a lot, especially during this time with allergies or getting sick.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little tough to get by</li>
            <li> Also I have a hard time making a bottle stretch to a month</li>
            <li> &amp; I like it, hard to say if I see any differences at this time</li>
            <li> It is a thick gel and comes with a dropper.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m not ok with unnecessary ingredients.</li>
            <li> Seriously I wish I had took pictures.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick</li>
            <li> and I am unable to wear foundation because my skins sucks up all the moisture.</li>
            <li> Been sick all winter with sick kids and no sleep had really messed up my face.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but I figured I would give it a chance.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my skin moisturizer in the cold weather and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> My life is crazy hectic</li>
            <li> But I started up again a week ago, after I came out of the hospital, and I looked bad.</li>
            <li> Afraid of getting another bad one!</li>
            <li> BUT I would like to say that I am disappointed in the vit c product this time!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> After using this product morning and night for 1 month, I notice brighter skin color and feels smoother. I will keep using this to see if it will reduce wrinkles. I combined this with Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> This serum works well when combined with a moisturizer</li>
            <li> Not a moisturizer. Must use moisturizer with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really great product and works as it says it does.  I really love this company and will continue to use their products.  I am a very happy customer. It also arrived early! Thank you so much!  My face is clearing up and I am noticing a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in my skin and the bottle is already finished.  I was using as directed so I feel it finished too quickly.  Don&#x27;t think I will reorder, might try another product.  Looking for something that will tighten myskin and reduce wrinkles around eyes, and the jowl/neck area of my face.</li>
            <li> This soaks in well and you don&#x27;t have to use much at all. This, in combination with Vitamin C lotion, makes my face and neck feel firmer and softer.</li>
            <li> This arrived very quickly and in excellent condition. I really like the bottle and love the dropper. The dropper makes it very easy to apply. I wash my face and then apply a few drops while my skin is still moist. After that, I apply my moisturizer. It goes on smoothly and is not greasy at all. The serum is just thick enough that it doesn&#x27;t run like water. So far, I have noticed that my skin is more even toned. I am holding back on the 5 star until I have used it a little longer. I love that the products are organic</li>
            <li> I love this product, my face feels &amp; looks so much smoother</li>
            <li> I started hearing about the hyaluronic acis and vitamin C from various sources, so I started looking around for a product the would contain the proper ingredients. I have not been wowed by many of these anti&#x3D;aging products, but this one comes very close. I have used it for about 3 weeks and find this to be one of the better of these type of skin products. My girlfriend is using it now and loves it too. It does not leave you skin all oily, but firm and well mosturized. Will be ordering more very soon.</li>
            <li> I love the Hyaluronic Acid Serum.  It&amp;#34;s gentle and soothing to my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any change on my skin with this product. Maybe because of my skin type I am black with normal skin. It got here on there and full in botlle</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok could not tell it did anything for me</li>
            <li> I love this product.. I just received it this week &amp; I&#x27;m a new member of the Sano Family... Can&#x27;t say enough good things about their products. Thank you for providing the right tools to help my skin!</li>
            <li> make my face lightening</li>
            <li> Love this product! Got it in two days and use it every day to hydrate my skin before my moisturizer! It&#x27;s like I have new skin!</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle, love it. My skin feels vey good.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It keep my skin soft and hydrated</li>
            <li> I love this serum.. my face feels so amazing. .really fast shipping. And it was packed so well. .ty</li>
            <li> This is a great serum, goes on non greasy and works well under make up</li>
            <li> OMG!! LOVE IT!!!  used it once and change my skin....&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe the results! I&#x27;m getting rid of my other products, and just going to use this for now on!.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, thank you , thank you....</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and it is amazing at moisturizing my face after I wash it, while also regulating my oily skin during the day. BEST product I have found for the money and for those of us with the dry/oil skin combo.</li>
            <li> Sano Naturals has nailed it for me. These are really great products. At the end of the day, I feel like I just moisturized my skin. That is a new feeling for a post menopausal woman.</li>
            <li> I apply this serum in the morning and again at night before going to bed.  This serum is an ultra moisturizing serum that greatly improves diminishing of  fine lines, smile lines, frown lines  and wrinkles. It also tones out your skin tones and smooths to give it a firmer and lift appearance for a vigorous and youthful complexion without the wrinkly and sagging skin. This is a dual function serum that lifts sagging skin and protects it from future harm and attacks by the sun uv rays and other environmental elements that attacks your skin by accelerating the aging appearance of your skin and better yet, this serum has antioxidants that begins the healing process of cell damaged skin and delivering its nutrients deep into the dermis for a healthier look, feel and appearance</li>
            <li> I am not Steven, I am his wife Dorothy. I ordered this product with high expectations, and to my surprise IT WORKS! My skin literally just drank it in. NO OILY RESIDUE! For a person like me who has very oily skin this was imperative in a moisturizer. The INSTANT RESULTS amazed me. I was not expecting it to work instantly. I put some on my hands as well, and after washing them the skin is still very soft, smooth, with a brightening effect. Please believe me I do not do product reviews on products unless I absolutely loved or hated it. This is PURE LOVE!</li>
            <li> So far have not seen much difference in the lines on my face.  I do like that it has no scent and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I used this for a couple of weeks and I do notice an improvement in texture.  It&#x27;s easy to apply and it dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for about 2 weeks, and so far I love it, starting to diminish fine lines around my lips and eyes.</li>
            <li> For serious dry skin this Hyaluronic Acid Serum really helps! I use this serum on my hands and face. I have always suffered from dry skin on my face and hands and I am always trying to find ways to help hydrate and keep them moisturized. I only use one drop on each hand and 3 drops on my face. I put a drop on each cheek and one on my forehead and rub them in. The serum soaks into the skin quickly and I am left with a soft feel that is not at all greasy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of the serum is not very strong and goes away in a few minutes. I could not even tell I had applied the serum once it absorbed into the places treated. I am very happy with the squeeze dropper to help apply the serum also because it seems more sanitary than reaching your fingers into a &amp;#34;tub&amp;#34; of product. The serum spreads out nicely and a little drop spreads out pretty far. I didn&#x27;t need much product to start seeing results. I provided &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; pictures of my hand. I received this product for purpose of testing, an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> i just  stared using it , i will see in a month  if htere are any results, so  far  it makes my skin  soft</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD PRODUCT MAKES YOU LOOK YOUNGER</li>
            <li> This product is very good it helped my face looks younger I will use it again this is my second battle.</li>
            <li> This acid serum is wonderful  I use it twice daily along with Vit. C serum for a truly radiant  complection..all worries gone about aged skin. This is a great product alone or with another  moisture product  I will always keep this on hand because I saw drastic improvement  with my skin texture ..Not one person believes I&#x27;m 71..Marilyn Alcorn</li>
            <li> LOVE IT - MAKES MY SKIN FEEL AND LOOK GOOD WITHOUT BEING OILY.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It takes a couple of minutes, but it really hydrates the skin. I use it on my hands too and it makes my wrist wrinkles go away.  The wrinkles on my face don&#x27;t completely go away...sigh...but this definitely hydrates my skin so they are less noticeable. Awesome for cuticles.  I will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> come with good quality and long usable date!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just about finished the 1st bottle. Love how smooth it goes on and how quickly it dries. Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling tight and my make up goes on smoothly over. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve noticed a huge improvement, but I think my few sun spots are faded just a bit. I will continue to use this serum!</li>
            <li> I Have seen a difference, it has a way of tightening the skin. I will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> I love this! It is very light and penetrates fast. After using this for a week I am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> You do NOT get three like the ad says</li>
            <li> I like it so far, would order again</li>
            <li> love this stuff. will be buying more</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  This is my second purchase of this product and I really like how it makes my skin look and feel.  Softens lines and moisturizing.  I also had a round red mark on the middle of my nose for at least a year and it is completely gone.  I ran out of the sano hyaluronic acid + serum and had some plain vit c and did not like it as well because it made my face breakout but this one does not. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> The serum arrived on time and packaged well...I love the bottle and dropper that it comes in..the smell is not strong I like that because I don&#x27;t like smells that are to strong on my face.so far I tried on hands and it isn&#x27;t greasy and feels smooth gonna try on my face tonight give it a week and wrote a update to my review so far I&#x27;m very satisfied!</li>
            <li> for some reason I liked the last brand better</li>
            <li> Just received this product a few days ago. My skin feels absolutely amazing after I use it every morning and night. It keeps my skin moisturizer in the cold weather and lasts all day. The smell is a little tough to get by but once you get used to that you won&#x27;t have any other complaints.</li>
            <li> I love Sano Naturals Serum, I use it every day. I read a comment that said they didn&#x27;t like it because it was to watery but I love that about the product it absorbs into the skin immediately. I am going to try there other products.</li>
            <li> I love the way this product feels on my skin- sooo hydrating, does not cause stinging on my sensitive skin like most products do!! Cant wait to see long term results.</li>
            <li> Really haven&#x27;t seen a difference</li>
            <li> Absolutely love love love</li>
            <li> I like how the product feels and smells. I love the dropper for sanitary reasons. So far my skin feels softer and feels lighter.  Thank you .</li>
            <li> This product together with the Phytoceramides and eye cream has given my skin a new lift and glow and i really love it. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This arrived very quickly and in good condition. It came in a nice bottle, and after using it for a week, it smoothed the fine lines on my stomach that I get whenever I lean over, which is basically every second of my life because I have awful posture. It also made the skin on the back of my hand and face supple. It dries very quickly, which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I docked one lippie is because of the consistency of the liquid combined with the dropper. It&#x27;s a gel-ish consistency which makes it hard for the dropper to pick up, and instead the gel gets stuck to the outside of the dropped instead of inside it. So I have to be extra careful when opening and closing the serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But otherwise, this is a great product!</li>
            <li> Hey there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must tell you that I love this product!!!!!....I purchased this product with my own money  a couple of months ago...you know, I wanted to give it some time to do its thing, and oh my goodness!!!!! ....my skin is glowingly beautiful and velvety soft.  My skin is really sensitive to certain products, but I had no ill effects with this one.  All I can tell you is, try it for yourself....because everyone is different.  I&#x27;m just informing you on what it did for me...It was definitely worth the very reasonable investment!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best regards to you all,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charli:-)</li>
            <li> This serum is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.. It makes my skin feel smooth and New.. I will purchase this again and again.. Thank you Sano for making a product that speaks for itself..</li>
            <li> It really did not do anything. I am better off just using Oil of Olay products</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Seriously I wish I had took pictures. I will definately buy again. To keep up fine lines this really does work! U wont regret it!</li>
            <li> As someone that’s always looking for beauty products to help improve the appearance of my skin I was excited to receive this Sano Naturals Hyaluronic acid serum in the mail! After testing this serum out for myself I have to say this serum works wonders!! This Hyaluronic Acid Serum is an ultra moisturizing serum that visibly improves the appearance of dryness, wrinkles and fine lines on your skin. This serum also lifts and tones the look of aging and sagging skin while reducing the appearance of discoloration due to sun damage, aging and acne scarring. It also helps with the appearance of smile lines, creases, crow’s feet, etc. This serum will deeply penetrate into your skin to seal in hydration in order to smooth your skins appearance making for a younger healthier complexion. This dual function serum not only repairs the appearance of your skin but also protects your skin as it is loaded with essential vitamin c, which is a powerful antioxidant that fights free radicals, and repairs damaged skin!! This serum is paraben and sulfate free &amp; also vegan &amp; cruelty free which is always a must for me when buying product. All of these amazing features of this serum definitely makes for the perfect serum formulated for many of your skin care needs!! I definitely recommend this Hyaluronic Acid Serum to everyone and anyone.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2 weeks now and I absolutely love it.&lt;br /&gt;This product makes the skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This product is a must! Use along with VIt C serum...or alone!  It is the best hydration for your skin!</li>
            <li> I use it with my morning and evening moisturizer and love how much softer it makes my face feel. My face also looks brighter.  Definately worth trying it out, I will be reordering.</li>
            <li> My daughter bought this for me and insisted I try it. I was skeptical, but I figured I would give it a chance.  I use it before my morning moisturizer and then at night I wash my make up off, apply and then apply moisturizer over it. I felt as if my face tightened in some areas they haven&#x27;t tightened in before. I also felt as it it was moisturizing and being I have thin, sensitive skin I was surprised to find something that worked for me. I am loving this stuff.</li>
            <li> I like this serum so far. I actually really like the smell. To me it smells likes roses. It&#x27;s very thick and you don&#x27;t need a lot of product to cover your face and neck. I use it in the morning and at night and have had no issues using it under makeup. To be fair I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice anything truly remarkable but I really like the way it feels on my skin, along with all the benefits of the ingredients, so I&#x27;m going to keep on using it:)</li>
            <li> Love love love it!!!!  And I can really tell the difference since using this for a few weeks.  Re-ordered a 2nd time from this company, the eye cream, hyaluronic Acid &amp; the Vitamin C serum.  I had a reunion with my four sisters a few months ago, and even though I am the oldest, I actually started looking like the oldest.  Had to make a life adjustment and get some help!!!  Can&#x27;t wait &#x27;til our next reunion :D</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00QL89MRW Hyaluronic Acid Serum for Skin. Organic Natural Skincare for Face.]] This is a great product but it shows three bottles and i only received one bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was very misleading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shirley Werner</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok,made my skin soft.But hasn&#x27;t help in discolorations</li>
            <li> Ok, so in one of the questions someone asked if you get 3 bottles.  The answer was &amp;#34;yes you will love&amp;#34; . We&#x27;ll you only get one as I expected. They are just showing all sides of the bottle. But so far I love the product! I have sensitive skin and a lot of thing burn my face. This is smoth kind of thick, not too watery. So far I like it!</li>
            <li> This is  a new purchase.  I can say that it goes on smoothly. Only a small amount is needed and absorbs easily.  My skin feels hydrated all day long. So far I can say I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I am so looking forward to seeing the results of my new purchase of Sano Hyaluronic acid and Serum that I received yesterday.  This morning when I applied it to my face it had a wonderful feel on my skin.  I can&#x27;t wait for a great outcome!</li>
            <li> Good..lite and easy on the skin.</li>
            <li> These Sano products are amazing! I use this hyaluronic acid and the vitamin C together everyday and I have shed years off my face. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> It is really eliminating some deep wrinkles I had over my eyebrows.  I am thrilled, as that is why I bought it.</li>
            <li> Love love love this. My forehead was always dry and flaky. But, not anymore. Now it smooth and wrinkles are not as deep. But I don&#x27;t see any flaky skin !</li>
            <li> My final product I used for my face this week was the daily moisturizing skin revitalizer by SANO Naturals called Hyaluronic Acid Serum. The name sounds complicated and medical but the results are quite simple. The product is organic and used for improving dryness, fine lines and wrinkles. A serum that will take your original discolored tones of your skin and create a more balanced and even tone to give you the best younger looking face possible. I was curious to use this on my 32 year old crows feet that have started to show up around my eye lids. This serum I have used daily for over a week and I definitely can report a difference. My skin feels moisturized and looks healthy reducing the appearance of my pores on my face as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Living in Western New York it is important to use protection for the face because of the climate drying out the skin and chapping it. This has maintained a soft and moisturized feel even on the coldest of days. I put only a few drops on my face and a drop on each hand and it really has made definite improvements. The product does not appear heavy on the skin and disappears into the skin quite quickly with no odor as a lot of cleansers have. I have sensitive skin and this was gentle to use and easy to transport on trips or on the go. This product doesn&#x27;t take more then a drop to work its magic on your skin!  I definitely recommend this product! It&#x27;s a HIT!</li>
            <li> Really like this serum. Great consistency, smooths over skin easy. My skin feels taught and noticing improvement in appearance as I use it. Recommend it!</li>
            <li> Did not work for my skin.</li>
            <li> Not sure what it is doing yet? Only have been using for two weeks and do not feel or see any difference. Probably will not purchase again because I like instant results.</li>
            <li> I bought this serum in addition to the Sano phitoceramides supplement. It works wonderful in my skin. I had a very dry skin and while using during night I wake up with a bright tight beautiful skin. I can see the difference and others too. My skin was thirsty and now I am giving what it was needing. I am very happy with the conbination of these products. Ansious to prove some other products if this great product line. I had spend a lot of money in expensive products and have not seen such a fast positive results like with Sano products. Will recommend .</li>
            <li> This product has made a visible difference in my skin! And, I love the way it feels. It&#x27;s so moisturizing!</li>
            <li> I started this a week ago, and so far it has been great, I will keep you posted I have used it for a month now, It was doing great than I got meningitis, and couldnt use it for awhile. But I started up again a week ago, after I came out of the hospital, and I looked bad. I been using it again for the last week an it made me look alive again, haha I would buy it again I really do like these products</li>
            <li> I recently started to use Sano Natural products, I love how they feel, the products get rapidly absorbed by the skin. My skin is firmer and younger looking . I recently met someone who was shocked to find out how old I am, they said , they could have sworn I was 10 years younger!!</li>
            <li> These are great products.  The second product from Sano that I have used and I am really happy with the results.</li>
            <li> This has helped my skin tremendously. After coming off of birth control, my skin has been completely unpredictable and prone to intense breakouts along the jaw, chin &amp; mouth. I definitely saw a shift in my skin&#x27;s ability to recuperate and cope with my hormonal imbalance after starting to use this serum. I&#x27;ve even used it before flights to give my skin an extra nourishing kick and prevent dryness. It works!!</li>
            <li> using it to lighten skin spots and tighten pores</li>
            <li> I start to use Sano from two days and i feel my skin become softer.</li>
            <li> This serum is making my skin glow, and feel so much more lively. My skin already seems much healthier since adding it to my beauty regime!</li>
            <li> My husband who is almost 58 and myself at 35 have been using this one our face at night and see a huge difference in skin glow and reduced fine lines and puffiness.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any big changes but I like the product. Will order again! I wanted to give review on the vit-C serum after I have reordered from this buyer but it doesn&#x27;t give me the option.  BUT I would like to say that I am disappointed in the vit c product this time! I have reordered with this seller because the first order was great, a thick light (nearly clear)  color serum (as it should be) no expiration date on bottle and none needed. However this order of vit C serum is NOT the light nearly clear serum that it should be, it is a brownish color and has a slight odor and oddly enough this time has a sticker added to bottle with expiration date that says it is still &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; which I question since I have been buying this product a longtime and it should not have a color or odor! I had to stop buying vit c serum from another seller on amazon for same reason (even though that time product was very brown-even stained my skin)! Sadly, not likely to order again to say the least.from this seller either. Afraid of getting another bad one!</li>
            <li> I love this I was having trouble with my face and hands being so dry. Using this evey morning my face and hands stay nice and mosturized. I use a little of this then some lotion and my skin is feeling so much better.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a serum to revive your skin condition, this is it. I use Vitamin C serum first, then use this on top of it, my skin always looks refreshed and more youthful.</li>
            <li> I have bee using this product for 3 days and see a difference in my skin already. ..it&#x27;s GREAT!!</li>
            <li> I love this! I&#x27;m able to use it at night and in the morning especially since it isn&#x27;t greasy I can have under my makeup. This has helped hydrate my skin and has lead to my wrinkles to be less visable</li>
            <li> I have definitely seen improvement in my skin but, I ran out and couldnt afford to buy more right away and within a week my skin was going back to looking the same as before so there is no residual benifit and it is a product that you will need to use daily for the rest of your life maintain better looking skin. Also I have a hard time making a bottle stretch to a month</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use as a deterrent for aging skin.  I&#x27;m still young, but I figured getting a head start couldn&#x27;t hurt. I can&#x27;t describe how smooth and soft this makes my skin feel.  I have to remind myself that touching the skin can cause blemishes because I want to touch it all the time!  The biggest problem I have is to remember to apply it while my skin is still damp or wet. It soaks right in, and gives me a nice, fresh, dewy look.  I definitely plan to order again.</li>
            <li> I like serums, this one goes on smoothly, isn&#x27;t sticky. My skin seems to like it!</li>
            <li> This item was delivered very quickly, and was just as described.  This is a great product, and so far - I am quite happy with the results.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a high quality daily moisturizing facial serum.</li>
            <li> Any of this stuff is great! But it only last a mo..1 oz..I purchased another one on here that I reviewed that has 2 oz..and cheaper;; This serum give the complexion  a healthy glow..I use it at night after I cleanse my face with no other than clean and clear, (from Walmart) use the serum and the re-vita lift L&#x27;Oreal face cream,, used it for years..</li>
            <li> This product makes my skin so smooth! It is light &amp; feels great under any of my moisturizers. My skin retains moisture better.</li>
            <li> I wash my face, pat dry (but leave a little moisture on it), apply product, then apply moisturizer, then make up.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this a few days now. It is a thick gel and comes with a dropper. The dropper doesn&#x27;t work for me so I just get the product off the outside of the dropper. It doesn&#x27;t take much product. A little goes a long way. I have noticed in the past few days that my skin looks plumper and feels softer. I am liking the results so far even though it&#x27;s only been a few days. I will keep using it! :-)</li>
            <li> Works great with vitamin c serum skin looks tighter and got carded 2 in a day I&#x27;m in my 40s. Lol! Buy it! Although it&#x27;s only one bottle not three FYI!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different brands and I love this serum!  I just took delivery of my second bottle.  I noticed my skin texture improving almost immediately, and as I continued to use it, most of those tiny wrinkles around my eyes and mouth diminished more and more.  I like the feel of the serum as I apply it- it absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling natural, not sticky.  Makeup applied over it goes on smoothly.  I am so happy I discovered Sano!</li>
            <li> So far, so good. Pleasant smell, dries quickly. However, still waiting for full results.</li>
            <li> I have fought to find something to help with dry skin, and now I have! As I have gotten older, I notice more and more wrinkles, but when I use this on my skin, it feels supple and even when I wear makeup, it goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> Love it. Its very light. Serums are usually dense and weigh you down. This one does not. Im prone to breakouts but this serum did not agitate my skin at all. This bottle will last both me and my husband about 3 months. I love that it comes with a dropper, I hate when face oils/serums don&#x27;t have one.</li>
            <li> This product is lovely and smoothing under the eye area after using the SANO eye cream which is my absolute favorite ! I put this serum on top overnight and I wake up with beautiful rested hydrated eyes that are not sunken in ! It makes my skin under the eyes tight and luminous ! Love this product will continue to buy ! Excellent seller excellent communication and super fast shipping ! The bottle it comes in is glass and has a dropper to help disperse cleanly ! Love how soft and smooth this stuff goes on! No side effects no break outs or clogged pores !</li>
            <li> I am honestly really pleased with this product. When I received this serum I first tested it out on my hand to see how it felt, since my skin is sensitive at times. I put a small amount on my hand and it had a light scent but smelled pretty good. I spread it on my hand and a little goes a long way. Afterwards I touched my hand and it felt really soft. My hands aren&#x27;t that dry to start with so I wanted to test it out on my face to see how good it really worked. I do have combination skin. I have my oily parts but I also have dry patches. I hate it because when I put certain serums to help the dry spots, it makes the oily spots more oily. Not with this product. I tested it out after cleansing my face. I put a little bit and spread around especially concentrating on dry spots. I waited for it to dry and then put on my moisturizer. My dry spots actually looked really good and I didn&#x27;t see my dry spots no more. I use it on my nose since I get dry skin there a lot, especially during this time with allergies or getting sick. My skin has never looked softer and brighter. I highly highly recommend this product. I was given this product to test out in exchange for my honest unbiased review. These opinions are all my own and I really do recommend this product for face, neck, hands and probably anywhere else you have dryness most likely.</li>
            <li> Solution is too oily and stratified.</li>
            <li> sticky !!!!!  don&#x27;t see any improvement</li>
            <li> I received this for a review and gave it to my husband to try as I was sent a few other brands too.  I loved it on him.  He has never taken care of his skin and with the amount of cancer in his family and how much time we spend outside I worry about skin cancer.  I don&#x27;t know if it reversed anything but his skin became so soft!  He used it on his face and wow.  His cheeks and lips were smooth.  I noticed his pores looked smaller too.</li>
            <li> Wife ordered this and likes it.</li>
            <li> Love the product. Affordable. Smells soft. Leaves skin smooth and silky. I look for product with benefitial factors in them before I purchase them and this product falls into those specifics.  Wonderful results from use, and quickly. I will look forward to purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> big change in my face.</li>
            <li> Good products with nice skin and fresh.</li>
            <li> On my second bottle of this product. REALLY love it. My 61 year old skin is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> My skin breaks out in rashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my third bottle and I absolutely LOVE it.  I use a little in the morning and at night and have been very pleased with the results! I was trying to figure out how long each bottle has lasted me and I think one month- it doesn&#x27;t take much! I easily break out (adult acne-I&#x27;m 39) and so finding a good moisturizer has been a nightmare before trying this! My combination skin typically gets oily and dry at the same time and since applying this I noticed nearly no dryness and less oiliness- and almost no breakouts! I also wear an organic sunblock and gently exfoliate regularly (1-2 times a week) and this is great for after care- my skin looks fresh and soft!</li>
            <li> I really like this serum. i have used many hyaluronic acid serums,  and this one is just as good if not better than ones costing twice as much. it is a little thin, but they all are, it has a pleasant scent and absorbs nicely. how nice it is to find an acid that moisturizes and still does the job that an acid is supposed to do. if used consistently, it really does take years off your skin and leaves the skin softer smoother more even and radiant looking.  i love the discovery of this amazing product!!</li>
            <li> It really works, after two weeks my face and neck looked  80% better, I  am using on my hands too.</li>
            <li> I have used Sano&#x27;s Serum even without my moisturizer sometimes and my face feels soft even at the end of the afternoon in an office with too much air conditioning. I am sure you will be satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Seems like my complexion is smoother &amp; more even-toned. A little bit goes a long way. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been using this twice daily along with swan naturals 20% vitamin c anti aging serum and have had an improvement in fine lines and. My face is smoother.</li>
            <li> This is the first Sano Naturals product that I have tried, but not the first Hyaluronic Acid Serum that I have used, so I was excited when I was asked to try this for my honest review. I like using natural and organic products on my face and I always make sure that the products don&#x27;t contain any parabens, so this product fit my criteria perfectly. I love how hyaluronic acid moisturizes and hydrates my skin. I could see it right away when I used this serum. What I like the most about this hyaluronic acid serum compared to the other serums that I have tried, is that it is thicker than the others. In fact, this is probably the thickest serum that I have ever used. For me, that means that it is easier to put on my finger tips (doesn&#x27;t run everywhere) and I can really feel it cover my entire face. It absorbs quickly though, and doesn&#x27;t leave any kind of residue. My fine lines and wrinkles looked diminished after using this and my face just looks so much healthier. I am so glad that I found this product now, while I am in my late 40s, so I can continue using it the older I get.</li>
            <li> love sano products, vitamin c, then hyaluronic acid then rosehip oil, all layed then my moisturizer on top. rockin it on anti aging&lt;br /&gt;I love their products highly recommend, my skin is fabluous</li>
            <li> My life is crazy hectic so I am pretty much always on the go. I would have to say as a model, that I need good skin. It is important that I keep a glow to my face. It is important to keep a healthy complextion with all of my ongoing work. I found this product online through a website called tomoson. I am always iffy about things they put in serums so I made sure to look at them before trying the product. One thing I did like about this  product was the natural substances they put into the serum. I have used this product for a few weeks and I can tell there is a big difference in my complexion. I am glowing and feel great! These are my words 100% I did test this product!</li>
            <li> I purchased the SANO Vitamin C Eye Gel+, Hyaluronic Acid Serum+, and Vitamin C Serum+ all at the same time and I love these products. I have used much more expensive products from salons and these work better. My skin looks healthier every time I use them. Less wrinkles, more volume and better color. I am blonde with green eyes and 46 years old. People have always said I look young for my age but these products have helped me feel like I am getting rid of some of the last few years!</li>
            <li> This serum is wonderful, my skin absorbs it and i notice the difference right away:)</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive skin and so far after 3 application, no bad reaction. good&lt;br /&gt;product.</li>
            <li> Bought this to try cause it had awesome reviews and my skin was just so dry. Been sick all winter with sick kids and no sleep had really messed up my face. Breaking out bad and horribly dry despite using Ole Henriksen products,paulas choice and first aid beauty moisturizer.For under $11 bucks couldnt resist. After the first night I noticed a difference. My face was brighter,more even and much more moisturized. My breakouts were also smaller and less red. After the 2nd day my face was even better and already lightning some of my dark spots from recently breaking out.Skin even clearer. I only got this on the 4th but i&#x27;ve used 4 times and I love it. I&#x27;m using on my entire face and neck.Works great under make-up no problem. I use a moisturizer over it.I like it better than my Ole truth serum :) It dosnt seem like much when you open it,smells like clean roses,but works wonders.Fyi my breakouts were the cystic kind and thats what it&#x27;s clearing up. For something so great and under $11 bucks give it a try.Bought to try some other products :) Great find</li>
            <li> I apply the Sano Hyaluronic Serum immediately after washing my face and it leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Loving using this weightless, non greasy formula!</li>
            <li> I have just started using product about 4 weeks ago, and it&#x27;s just wonderful. I have very fair,sensitive skin and my face has never looked, brighter and clearer. Plus, it&#x27;s organic so it doesn&#x27;t bother my face like all other face serums and creams. It goes on smooth and dries fast, and you can even wear it under your make up. My skin just feels and looks wonderful, and I have even been told I look younger.  I just bought another bottle, this product is a must to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Sano,&lt;br /&gt;Deb</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff!  My skin just soaks it in, NOT GREASY feels like silk soaking into my skin I love it and will most defiantly buy it again.  If you want smooth skin, buy this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the hyaluronic serum for 7 days now and I love the texture of this product! It is thick enough so you don&#x27;t need much and glides on smoothly, drying quickly! I use it with the vitamin C serum by Sano as well. Together they provide amazing results. I have oily skin and am prone to severe acne break outs. I use salycic acid and benzoyl peroxide which dry out areas around my nose, chin and eye area. Since I&#x27;ve been using this product my skin has balanced out and is much smoother, firmer with less visible lines around the eyes where the majority of my problem is. I really like this product and will buy it again. I&#x27;m looking forward to continued results! I recommend it to anyone to give it try! The best part about Sano Naturals is they send your items immediately! I recieved my products within 2 days of ordering. I was surprised!!!</li>
            <li> Seems to be working great!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. I am a true produce researcher and really do my homework before buying anything.  Hyaluronic acid alone leaves your skin with a cracked smile feeling like you have a dried face mask on. This produce is perfect with the combination of herbs, aloe and seaweed. I never leave reviews because it&#x27;s such a process to do so but when this company asked me to leave a review for a free bottle I immediately clicked through to do so. You will not regret this purchase.  I&#x27;m 59 and found what I was looking for in a fast effective wrinkle eliminator. DON&#x27;T HESITATE. BUY IT YOU&#x27;LL LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> At first I gave it four starts but after just a week of use I see a big difference and other people started noticing ! I use it twice a day and I have dry yet oily acne prone skin and it&#x27;s working great ! No allergic reaction at all ! Smells good to and I love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural organic ingredients ! I wish they made a face wash too because I would be using that as well , I&#x27;m going to stick up on this as well as get some for my mom !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the serum for about 2 weeks now, and it really helps keeping my face and hands moisturized throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I really like using Hyaluronic acid serum,feel great on your face. It also has a lot of great ingredients it it .</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this very long but I love the way it feels and would recommend!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see a difference. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this! It&#x27;s the best brand around --- Will always buy this brand! Fast Shipping too!</li>
            <li> I just bought this product again.  The difference in my skin has really been significant with a noticeable reduction in wrinkles around my eyes.  There is no smell to the product and a little goes a long way.  I use it every morning on my face and neck then a apply day cream, sunblock and my usual makeup.</li>
            <li> This serum is light, but moisturize my skin. Good product.</li>
            <li> Feels good but no visible results</li>
            <li> With this serum it can be mixed with any of your daily moisturizer that&#x27;s what I do daily... It helps reduce fine likes and redness of the face making your face feel smooth. I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW</li>
            <li> Great product!! Was surprised at the high!!</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid Serum is amazing. It made my skin feel good and clean. My face felt very moisturized. I will continue to the prioduct to see if the age and aspect part is true. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to refer it to a friend or family member. i received this product for inspection and an unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Good product.  I started using it and hopefully it will work for me.</li>
            <li> Have always loved these products and even better now at a cheaper price!!</li>
            <li> If you have dry or dehydrated skin (and who doesn’t have it this time of year with the forced air heat taking all of the moisture out of our skin), then I have something you will want to take notice of and use. This is a hyaluronic acid serum that is perfect to help keep moisture in your skin and to help keep it plump and wonderfully hydrated.

Deep penetrating to seal in hydration to firm and smooth skin&#x27;s appearance for a youthful-looking complexion. It has a dual function: it maximizes lift by providing both protection and repair. It is loaded with Vitamin C, a powerful anti-oxdiant that takes charge and fights off free radicals and repairs damaged skin. The hyaluronic acid works with the Vitamin C to promoting absorption and hydrating the skin. It reduces the appearance of discoloration associated with sun damage, blemishes and acne scarring leaving skin with a smooth, healthy looking complexion.

            <li> No different than any other serum. It had a very short expiration date (only 7 months)</li>
            <li> I received my SANO NATURALS Hyaluronic Acid Serum + yesterday and I am so excited.  I have long been wanting a product that is natural and healthy to activate collagen production without surgery. Firmer, younger textured, brighter skin is POSSIBLE and SAFE after all!  I noticed that Geranium Essential Oil is in the Serum ingredients as well..this is beauty &amp;#34;Mother Nature&#x27;s Way&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> Only had this product a few weeks but I like it very much.&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice consistency, so it&#x27;s eay to apply, smells skittle like roses and it seems to have already brightened and toned my skin a bit.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely keep using</li>
            <li> smells good and i&#x27;ll buy more</li>
            <li> This is my second order of Sano Hyaluronic Acid Serum for Skin. It has made a noticeable difference in my skin tone, fine wrinkles, pore size and overall brightness.  I will keep using this all natural product.  I have sensitive skin and I had no trouble with this Sano product.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a week and already my skin is softer. I am nearly 50 so good skin care products are a necessity.</li>
            <li> Works well,didn&#x27;t have a reaction .I have very sensitive skin.Will buy more.Great product.</li>
            <li> It is very a very smooth serum and goes on and sinks in right away.  It is very good!</li>
            <li> Great product!...Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I received my product today and used it for the first time.  I am a 48yr old mother of six and have been experiencing increasing dry skin and wrinkles related with hormonal aging.  I noticed a difference in my skin tone almost immediately.  I realize this and other products may take time to yield optimal results so I have reserved the 5 star rating for an update within a few weeks.  But as of my first use, my skin feels smooth and there is visible moisture retention!  I am in the process of beginning a &amp;#34;women over 40&amp;#34; beauty vlog and intend for this product to be my first review.  Bravo, Sano!</li>
            <li> I have liked this product, but fail to see the glow that I&#x27;d hoped for. I care for my skin diligently,so I expected to see more vivid results.</li>
            <li> Just started using this brand and I like the thicker consistency. It is a little harder to get out but so far it agrees with my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the product a few days, but I really like it. It is similar to another product that I&#x27;ve been using for a while. I decided to try this brand this time instead. A little goes a long way, and it absorbs into my skin very quickly. I use it before I put on Argon Oil, and it helps it to go more deeply into my skin. I also use this after using a derma roller on my face. I am very selective about what products go on my face after the roller, and this fits the bill due to it&#x27;s natural and organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> I love it! Feels great and its not too greasy!</li>
            <li> I have been uing for 1 month and have noticed little difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> This is the second bottle I&#x27;ve purchased. I don&#x27;t see a reduction in wrinkles yet, therefore the four stars, but there are lots of great stuff about it. It goes on smooth and is not sticky, absorbs quickly. Great for under day cream, vitamin C in it. It is vegan which is a big plus for me. I will keep using it and see if it also reduces wrinkles. I think it will if used long enough.</li>
            <li> Excellent Hyaluronic Acid Serum, one of the best around. I&#x27;ll be definitely reordering.</li>
            <li> Darken the skin of my face after first application. Stop using it immediately. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> meh, have noticed no difference at all...</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for a couple weeks now &amp; I like it, hard to say if I see any differences at this time but it&#x27;s not been long enough. This product not oily it&#x27;s like a gel consistency. Goes on &amp; soaks right in. I use a light daily moisturizer over it. I will see after a few months of use if I see a difference in fine lines.</li>
            <li> First off, I am only 23 years old, so I&#x27;m not too worried about wrinkles and fine lines yet; HOWEVER, i am all about preventing them. Anyway, I bought this product because my oily skin is INCREDIBLY dehydrated during the winter months and I am unable to wear foundation because my skins sucks up all the moisture. So, let me tell you, I really like this product. I put it on immediately after I wash my face and it feels great. It is kind of watery... but all of the ingredients are liquids... soooo it would be weird if it was super thick.. because then that means they put a thickening agent in it.. and i&#x27;m not ok with unnecessary ingredients. ANYWAY, my skin feels and looks AMAZING. I have oily/acne prone skin and my face has never looked better. My pores are smaller, my skin is softer, I have had no break outs since I started using it, my skin isn&#x27;t really oily anymore, and my acne scars are starting to lighten up. I&#x27;d say this is a total win.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I could see a difference on my skin it.</li>
            <li> I have been using hyularonic sirum for a year and am very pleased with it. This sirum binds the cells and retains moisture resulting to a more plump appearance to my skin. I also mix it with my retinol cream which prevented the reddening of the skin which was a problem when I used retinol only.&lt;br /&gt;I have just ordered the vitamin &amp;#34;c&amp;#34; sirum and will post any improvements after I use it for 30 days. I am a mature woman in my early 70&#x27;s so I don&#x27;t expect miracles but I did expect some noticeable improvements and that is exactly what I achieved.</li>
            <li> By far the best product on the market after using Hyaluronic Acid Serum which is a Daily Moisturzier I had to give a review;  it not only makes my face feel soft but also rids my daily acne; my face feels fresh and clean on a daily basis. I used it everyday and my face feels like and looks like a million bucks. Thank You SANO</li>
            <li> I have only used 5 times and can see changes to my skin. I see and can feel my skin becoming more firm and soft. I like that it is very light and I can use my make up on top. It looks and goes on smoothly. I will continue use and cannot wait for the results in a few weeks after seeing changes this soon.</li>
            <li> Expression lines are noticeably smaller!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks.  My skin is much softer &amp; healthier looking.</li>
            <li> This does seem to hydrate the face very well.</li>
            <li> Seems like it does it&#x27;s job. The price is excellent when comparing to other similar products in the market. At first I felt like a little burning sensation but it quickly went away. The color of my skin seems to be improving and the spots on my cheeks are going away.  I&#x27;m using it in conjunction with Vitamin C, and cucumber gel.</li>
