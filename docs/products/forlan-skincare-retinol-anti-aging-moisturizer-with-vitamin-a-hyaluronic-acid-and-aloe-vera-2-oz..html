            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li>Overall, I have enjoyed using the Forlan Skincare Retinol Cream</li>
            <li>I have tried using higher concentrations of vitamin A in&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just starting using this product, after two days I have noticed a significant difference on my skin!  </li>
            <li>When I saw the positive reviews for this serum, I just had to have it.</li>
            <li>It’s thick and very smooth, so it goes on easily with no grittiness or lumps.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simply to much for my skin type.</li>

            <li>I really like this vitamin a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It has smoothed and lifted my skin leaving&lt;br /&gt;it much softer.</li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>In fact when I applied it the cream almost melted right into my skin quickly but left a very nice silky feeling behind.</li>
            <li>In fact when I applied it the cream almost melted right into my skin quickly but left a very nice silky feeling behind.</li>
            <li>Although I haven’t seen a huge difference in facial lines, I do feel an extra firmness, and all of the benefits I’ve mentioned are enough for me to absolutely love this cream.</li>
            <li>effect on my acne which is why I chose a Retinol based product in the first place and some of my old acne scars looks&lt;br /&gt;lightened</li>
            <li>Not over powering and not fake smelling, just natural.</li>
            <li>Goes on light, I have no issues so far; I use this as a night serum only.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying out many different eye creams, gels and moisturizers this year in my attempt to look a bit younger.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s only been a few days I Haven&#x27;t been able to experience the full effect.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend giving this Retinol Cream a try.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for an addition to their beauty routine.</li>
            <li>However, it had a much richer consistency like a sunscreen, but it&#x27;s still lightweight and didn&#x27;t feel heavy or oily at all and absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li>It finds a good balance between my oily and dry skin, which means less greasiness and flakes.</li>
            <li>Although others may say that this one is a great moisturizer 2 in 1 already, here in NYC the weather has been bitter cold and my skin does need a bit more moisture.</li>
            <li>so I decided to try a new product.</li>
            <li>Also, this product came in a pretty big bottle for a face moisturizer</li>
            <li>I work outside and this has helped me more than I expected!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this a week now and already my face has cleared up considerably.</li>
            <li>Makes your face feel soft and.</li>
            <li>Using it at night allows me to wake up with soft skin, and using it before my makeup routine in the morning gives me a moisturized foundation to apply my makeup over.</li>
            <li>but it is never too early to take care of your skin.</li>
            <li>My face feels soft.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel really soft</li>
            <li>With this one product you will be helping your skin fight against acne, fine lines, wrinkles, and excessive aging.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t think it was going to work due to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I love beauty products, seriously!</li>
            <li>The moisturizer is thicker than others that I have tired and it has a soft &amp; smooth feeling when applied to the skin.</li>
            <li>I have not been using it for too long, but I like what I&#x27;ve seen so far, in regards to results.  </li>

            <li> Although I haven’t seen a huge difference in facial lines, I do feel an extra firmness, and all of the benefits I’ve mentioned are enough for me to absolutely love this cream.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for an addition to their beauty routine.</li>
            <li> However, it had a much richer consistency like a sunscreen, but it&#x27;s still lightweight and didn&#x27;t feel heavy or oily at all and absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li> It finds a good balance between my oily and dry skin, which means less greasiness and flakes.</li>
            <li> Although others may say that this one is a great moisturizer 2 in 1 already, here in NYC the weather has been bitter cold and my skin does need a bit more moisture.</li>
            <li> so I decided to try a new product.</li>
            <li> Also, this product came in a pretty big bottle for a face moisturizer</li>
            <li> I work outside and this has helped me more than I expected!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this a week now and already my face has cleared up considerably.</li>

            <li> With this one product you will be helping your skin fight against acne, fine lines, wrinkles, and excessive aging.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t think it was going to work due to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love beauty products, seriously!</li>
            <li> The moisturizer is thicker than others that I have tired and it has a soft &amp; smooth feeling when applied to the skin.</li>
            <li> I have not been using it for too long, but I like what I&#x27;ve seen so far, in regards to results.  </li>
            <li> In the past, I was very hesitant to use face products with retinol, as it dries my skin up and causes irritation.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;ll last me a relatively long time.</li>

            <li> creams before, but found them a bit too harsh on my sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t dry my skin up</li>
            <li> Also, a little bit goes a long way with this one, so it’s definitely a more-bang-for-your-buck type of product.</li>
            <li> A little of this product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> is was going to be from other reviews.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that this product worked well with my crazy sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> It will also help unplug pores and will decrease dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cream is a thick white cream</li>
            <li> The cream is a thick white cream</li>
            <li> Does it seem like your typical retinol product?</li>
            <li> The bottle says to &amp;#34;apply liberally&amp;#34;, but I noticed that my skin felt a lot smoother after using just a little bit.</li>
            <li> My skin looks glowing and tighter just in a few days.</li>
            <li> So, I gave it a try, using it on my washed and dried face each night for two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think the product will be used up soon, and i am not sure if it pays to get it again.  </li>
            <li> and I usually use it for 2-3 weeks before I write a review</li>
            <li> Since this is branded as a serum, I expected it to be thin and oily.</li>
            <li> I would recommend using this right before applying your makeup as a base or after washing your face at night.</li>
            <li> The consistency of the cream is thick yet lite.</li>
            <li> Not sure if i will get it again!  </li>
            <li> Not nearly as good as I thought</li>
            <li> It is very expensive and depending on what happens, i am not sure i will get another one?  </li>
            <li> But sadly nothing yet!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I can tell my skin looks better right after I put it on. I haven&#x27;t had a  breakout in a long time. I haven&#x27;t notice a drastic improvement of lines though, I don&#x27;t have fine lines to begin with. Glad it&#x27;s made in USA</li>
            <li> Love this cream!  Now that I&#x27;m 40, I&#x27;m more concerned with wrinkles.  Have been applying this cream before bed each night and I can feel the difference in the morning.  I will also apply in the morning if I&#x27;m not going to be in the sun.  Definitely would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I have only used this cream 3 times including tonight and I love the way it moisturizes my face. Because it&#x27;s only been a few days I Haven&#x27;t been able to experience the full effect. I&#x27;m looking forward to ordering more Retinol products.</li>
            <li> My face breaks out after using this product.  It&#x27;s simply to much for my skin type.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I&#x27;ve only used the product for a week now and I have noticed that my face looks softer and smoother. I&#x27;m looking forward to the next couple of weeks using the product.</li>
            <li> this cream is for a gift to Sweden, so I can not write a review.  Stop asking.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Goes on light, I have no issues so far; I use this as a night serum only.  Will update in a month to see if I see any difference.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product! Does it seem like your typical retinol product? Maybe. Is it? NO WAY! This is one of the best that I have ever found! One thing about this is that it is very natural and organic which is great with skincare. These types of skincare products really seep into your skin easily and rather quickly which is also a plus. That is one of the problems I used to have, where a product just sat on my skin and by the time I was going to sleep, it was just a sticky/yucky feeling. This one I have had no problems with whatsoever. Another point is that this product can be easily layered with another moisturizer if you feel like it. I have also had no problems with that as this retinol formula dries and absorbs quickly. Although others may say that this one is a great moisturizer 2 in 1 already, here in NYC the weather has been bitter cold and my skin does need a bit more moisture. Overall an excellent product and one of my favorites for anti-aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complimentary in return for my honest review.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 4 weeks now, 0 result. I am disappointed. Just throw money.</li>
            <li> I like the packaging and the pump plus the feel of the cream.  Just began using it so I&#x27;ll have to see what the results are later on.  Thanks to the provider for offering this product.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as good as I thought is was going to be from other reviews.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really great product! It&#x27;s absorbs quickly, doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin. It&#x27;s actually feels good on the skin. My skin looks glowing and tighter just in a few days. I use this cream only at night and I don&#x27;t apply anything else. It&#x27;s definitely a good find.</li>
            <li> I just starting using this product, after two days I have noticed a significant difference on my skin!  I work outside and this has helped me more than I expected!!  Thanks !!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t see any results but I like it I been using it around 3 weeks .</li>
            <li> Forlan Skincare Retinol Cream is a duel moisturizer for your face &amp; eyes that can be used during the day and at night. This cream is made up of quality ingredients such as: Shea butter vitamin A, C, &amp;E, and Hyaluronic Acid that will aid in rejuvenating and moisturizing your skin. With this one product you will be helping your skin fight against acne, fine lines, wrinkles, and excessive aging. When used on a daily bases, your skin will noticeably look healthier. The push dispenser allows you to get as much of the product as you need without wasting any. The consistency of the cream is thick yet lite. I would highly recommend giving this Retinol Cream a try.  A little of this product goes a long way. (I received this product free to review, but my opinions are my own.)</li>
            <li> I had great hopes for this.  I have been using it for almost two weeks now.  But sadly nothing yet!  Not sure if i will get it again!  update!  It has now been 5 weeks and still no change.  I think the product will be used up soon, and i am not sure if it pays to get it again.  update 2!  I have been using the product for almost 6 weeks, and finally i think i am seeing a change.  The only problem though, is that the product will be almost gone soon, and i won&#x27;t be able to fully experience it.  It is very expensive and depending on what happens, i am not sure i will get another one?  I was perplexed at all the positive reviews, and then i looked them over again, and realized that a good many were given because the product was given to them.  Seems like a contradiction of interests!</li>
            <li> Forlan Retinol Cream is a great anti aging cream. I like to use products with Retinol because they are proven to show results. This retinol cream also has Vitamin A, C &amp; E, Hyaluronic Acid, Aloe Vera, Jojoba Oil, Sunflower Oil and Shea Butter. One of the Best Retinoid Night/Day Moisturizer Products for the Face and Dark Circles Under Eyes And Superior to Retinyl Palmitate Serum, Great Anti Aging, Anti Wrinkle Properties with a Powerful Cocktail of Antioxidants for Fine Lines, Acne and Younger Looking Skin. Buy with Confidence, as they offer a 100% Guarantee. This is a 2oz bottle, with pump top. Made in the USA. This product was complimentary for testing/review purposes, but I only recommend products I would use personally and believe are good.</li>
            <li> I love it. My skin feels very nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this a week now and already my face has cleared up considerably. I look forward to more positive results as I use it more.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a retinol cream to use for my face, particularly for fine lines around my eyes.  I believe I found what I was looking for.  I have not been using it for too long, but I like what I&#x27;ve seen so far, in regards to results.  It does not act as quickly as prescription creams, but for an OTC retinol products, it does the job.</li>
            <li> Makes your face feel soft and. smooth no break outs I really like that.</li>
            <li> In the past, I was very hesitant to use face products with retinol, as it dries my skin up and causes irritation. I was pleasantly surprised that this product worked well with my crazy sensitive skin! It didn&#x27;t dry my skin up and I didn&#x27;t experience any redness or inflammation from using it. It also works very well in keeping my skin well moisturized and keeping fine lines at bay. It is very well priced - which is always a plus in my book!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to Forlan Skincare Retinol Cream to test out with my daily skin regimen. This daily moisturizer is intended to retain collagen, unclog pores, even out skin tone, reduce oil, restore vibrancy to skin, and improve the overall texture of your skin. Think anti-aging meets moisturizer and toner. With ingredients like Rose Water Oil, Aloe Vera, and vitamins B5, C, A, and E, it seemed impressive. It also contains Hyaluronic Acid, one of the most desired ingredients in skin care products today. So, I gave it a try, using it on my washed and dried face each night for two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am absolutely impressed and happy to say that I’ve since included this in my daily regimen of skin care products. I use it on both my face and neck. The first thing I noticed was the texture of the cream, which I really love. It’s thick and very smooth, so it goes on easily with no grittiness or lumps. Also, a little bit goes a long way with this one, so it’s definitely a more-bang-for-your-buck type of product. Another big plus for me was its ability to control my combination skin. It finds a good balance between my oily and dry skin, which means less greasiness and flakes. Using it at night allows me to wake up with soft skin, and using it before my makeup routine in the morning gives me a moisturized foundation to apply my makeup over. Although I haven’t seen a huge difference in facial lines, I do feel an extra firmness, and all of the benefits I’ve mentioned are enough for me to absolutely love this cream.</li>
            <li> I really like this vitamin a moisturizer. It comes in beautiful packaging with an easy to use pump and has a creamy like&lt;br /&gt;consistency and a nice smell. Since my skin is always oily and prone to pimples I have found this moisturizer has had it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;biggest effect on my acne which is why I chose a Retinol based product in the first place and some of my old acne scars looks&lt;br /&gt;lightened after using this serum for 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> A top notch product that shows excellent results after about 4 weeks with no skin irritation or harsh scent. Recommended!</li>
            <li> If you are like me, you want to try the latest and greatest in skin care products. Yes, I&#x27;m only in my mid twenties but it is never too early to take care of your skin. When I saw the positive reviews for this serum, I just had to have it. From the time of order to delivery, the product was shipped quickly and got here in perfect condition. Now I have only been using it for 9 days and I usually use it for 2-3 weeks before I write a review but I&#x27;ve already had great results so I had to share. My husband even said I look like I have a glow to my skin. It&#x27;s not sticky or greasy and it absorbs nicely without any residue. The scent is pleasant. Not over powering and not fake smelling, just natural. For the size, I think the price is just right. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for an addition to their beauty routine.</li>
            <li> I love beauty products, seriously! I would love nothing more than to try every one known to man. Now they want me to do so with a complimentary bottle of what from the description seems to be some pretty good stuff in exchange for my honest &amp; unbiased opinion on the product? Oh my! Yes please!     I actually have pretty good skin for my age so this is more a preventative measure than a corrective measure at this point. The dispenser is a nice one as described &amp; very easy to use. The cream is a thick white cream but it&#x27;s the right thickness. The scent is a very pleasing light floral scent. Upon reading the ingredients it says it has rose water which would explain it &amp; why it&#x27;s so light &amp; almost airy. I used 2 pumps total for my face &amp; neck area which was ample amount but not too much to be left greasy or oily. In fact when I applied it the cream almost melted right into my skin quickly but left a very nice silky feeling behind. I would say that after a few days of use that my skin had a more youthful look, I don&#x27;t know if I had a more plump appearance but my skin had a almost dewy look to it. I received compliments about it in fact. I have not noticed a reduction in my fine lines yet either but as I said, I have gotten compliments &amp; questions about what I have been doing different. I take that as a very good sign of a product&#x27;s success.etty good skin for my age so this is more a preventative measure than a corrective measure at this point.

            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying out many different eye creams, gels and moisturizers this year in my attempt to look a bit younger. The lastest product that I have been testing out is the Forlan Skincare Retinol Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This anti-aging moisturizer is meant to help reduce fine lines and wrinkles on your skin with the use of the powerful combination of antioxidants (vitamins A, C, B5 And E). It will also help unplug pores and will decrease dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my favorite ingredients in beauty products is Shea Butter, so I&#x27;m more than glad that it is included in the this product. Plus, Shea Butter gives the moisturizer a wonderful scent. The moisturizer is thicker than others that I have tired and it has a soft &amp; smooth feeling when applied to the skin. My skin definitely feels a lot tighter after using it. Overall, I have enjoyed using the Forlan Skincare Retinol Cream and I recommend it to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Disclaimer - I received a complimentary sample in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Amazing! My skin was breaking out badly so I decided to try a new product. I have been using this for a week and my skin is bright and radiant. I don&#x27;t even need to wear make up! This is a must buy!</li>
            <li> Since this is branded as a serum, I expected it to be thin and oily. However, it had a much richer consistency like a sunscreen, but it&#x27;s still lightweight and didn&#x27;t feel heavy or oily at all and absorbed quickly. It didn&#x27;t contain strong perfumes but it did smell fresh. The bottle says to &amp;#34;apply liberally&amp;#34;, but I noticed that my skin felt a lot smoother after using just a little bit. Also, this product came in a pretty big bottle for a face moisturizer so it&#x27;ll last me a relatively long time. I would recommend using this right before applying your makeup as a base or after washing your face at night. Overall, I was happy with the results and the quality of the ingredients. I purchased this product with a 100% off coupon in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> My face feels soft. Not enough time to see any difference yet</li>
            <li> Got it - thank you &amp; so far - so good!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed. This Retinol cream is amazing! It has smoothed and lifted my skin leaving&lt;br /&gt;it much softer. I have tried using higher concentrations of vitamin A in&lt;br /&gt;other creams before, but found them a bit too harsh on my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;This cream gave me no problems and I now find many of my blemishes have&lt;br /&gt;disappeared and my pores are clearer. I am using my a 30 SPF sunscreen on&lt;br /&gt;top during the day as a precaution but I just love the results</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel really soft</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t think it was going to work due to my sensitive skin. But this stuff is awesome will be getting more soon. Thanks for the quick shipping. ♡♡</li>
