            <li>Love this knife.</li>
            <li>Serrated Blade does a great job on the meats that I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>He can cut meat easily and I no longer have to do it for him.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice to be able to cut your own, especially when around others or going out.  </li>
            <li>Great product that allows a person to easily cut foods using only one hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not as sharp as I would have liked but a good product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased that Amazon now carries so many items we used to buy at Medical Supply stores.  </li>
            <li>We replaced our original rocker knife with this one because of the serrations.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for providing me with an easy to use tool!</li>
            <li>Best used when the item to be cut is first stabbed with the point then press down with a rocking motion.</li>
            <li>I ordered the super spoon, the fork and the serrated rocker knife.</li>
            <li>His original knife was purchased at a medical store at twice the price and was not as easy to handle or dishwasher safe.  </li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>I had thumb arthroplasty on my right hand and had to do everything left-handed.</li>
            <li>Insurance used to cover much of the cost of these items but that is no longer true.  </li>
            <li>I purchased another knife that is a lot better for me to handle not very sharp either</li>
            <li>Since receiving the Rocker knife, I am much more independent at the dinnertable.  </li>
            <li>I only have use of one hand from a brain injury and love finding things that make my life easier.</li>
            <li>The rocking motion makes it easy to cut thick subs, sandwiches, pasta, steaks, egg rolls, etc., into easily separable pieces -- using only one hand -- much more easily than a person with two hands could using a traditional straight</li>
            <li>Really was a much needed aide, has made meal time much easier for all.  </li>
            <li>Since I am left-handed, I can&#x27;t really use the knife.</li>
            <li>Fast ship</li>
            <li>He has arthritic hands and Parkinson&#x27;s both, and can handle this much easier.</li>
            <li>Since it is out-of-pocket we really appreciate the reasonable prices and convenience of Amazon.</li>
            <li>For the money a good little knife, but I recommend upgrading the next model.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Began to wakl 3 months later but to this day the use of my left hand has not returned, so I buy many items that work for one-handed people, this knife being one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>easy for clumsy hands to hold and use</li>
            <li>Rocker Knife is not sharp.</li>
            <li>foam handle provides a sure grip, the blade is quite sharp, and it only takes a few tries to get the hang of the right technique.  </li>
            <li>I had a stroke 3 years ago, left side completely</li>
            <li>Purchased for a relative with major hand nerve damage.  </li>

            <li> This particular rocker knife depends on a serrated edge for its cutting abilities, and so might be a safer choicer than others with unserrated, honed edges -- especially for users who have problems with fine motor control.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t sharp enough to allow a person to cut anything!</li>

            <li> Loved how easy it is to cut with!</li>
            <li> The serrations are only on one side of the knife for use by right-handed people. Since I am left-handed, I can&#x27;t really use the knife.</li>
            <li> For the money a good little knife, but I recommend upgrading the next model. Not that its not functional, for a few extra $$ there is a much more serviceable tool for your cutting pleasure.</li>
            <li> Purchased for a relative with major hand nerve damage.  It has been a blessing.</li>

            <li> Great item handle very easy to grip.</li>
            <li> IT HAS A GOOD HANDLE GRIP TO IT BUT WORKS NO BETTER THAN A GOOD WOOD HANDLED STEAK KNIFE.</li>
            <li> I used to have to ask my husband to cut up my food for me.  Since receiving the Rocker knife, I am much more independent at the dinnertable.  Thanks for providing me with an easy to use tool!</li>

            <li> I had a stroke 3 years ago, left side completely paralized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Began to wakl 3 months later but to this day the use of my left hand has not returned, so I buy many items that work for one-handed people, this knife being one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Place over meat, rock back &amp; forth, cuts the meat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works excellent/great on chicken &amp; pork, not so well on a steak unless a soft filet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Debi</li>

            <li> [[VIDEOID:29919704a29359192eda8019741fb90e]] Eating steak, single handed.</li>

            <li> Works great.  Good quality. Fast ship</li>
            <li> I earlier purchased a rocker knife for my husband who is now 1-handed since his stroke.  This knife is great.  He can cut meat easily and I no longer have to do it for him.  Well worth it.</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for my brother. He only has use of one hand and he had been looking for this knife for a himself so he wasn&#x27;t needing to ask for help</li>
            <li> My physical therapist recommended this to me to help me after hand surgery.  It helps keep the stress off the surgery area of my thumb.</li>
            <li> My husband had a terrible accident which injured his arm and hand. When using a regular knife it poked into his palm &amp; caused pain. This wonderful knife has a soft rubberized handle that is easy for him to hold.  The curved blade also make  it easier for him to cut.</li>
            <li> An excellent tool for arthritic hands.  My husband is much happier using this than a regular knife.  He has arthritic hands and Parkinson&#x27;s both, and can handle this much easier.</li>
            <li> Gave 1 to friend who broke her wrist &amp; they were very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Great product that allows a person to easily cut foods using only one hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We purchased ours for my wife, whose hand was weakened by a stroke, but I find myself using it for cutting all sorts of foods.  The rocking motion makes it easy to cut thick subs, sandwiches, pasta, steaks, egg rolls, etc., into easily separable pieces -- using only one hand -- much more easily than a person with two hands could using a traditional straight knife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foam handle provides a sure grip, the blade is quite sharp, and it only takes a few tries to get the hang of the right technique.  This particular rocker knife depends on a serrated edge for its cutting abilities, and so might be a safer choicer than others with unserrated, honed edges -- especially for users who have problems with fine motor control.  A great addition to any kitchen tool kit, and a must-have for those with disabilities.</li>
            <li> This item is not at all as described. It isn&#x27;t sharp enough to allow a person to cut anything!</li>
            <li> I only have use of one hand from a brain injury and love finding things that make my life easier. This is definitely one of them!</li>
            <li> husband has parkinsons and has a hard time cutting his food this with the wide handle helps him do that with ease</li>
            <li> Really was a much needed aide, has made meal time much easier for all.  Recommend to anyone dealing with neuropathy.</li>
            <li> Recovering from a stroke, limitrd use of one hand. It is nice to be able to cut my own food and I can take the knife with me when we eat out. Serrated Blade does a great job on the meats that I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> This knife works well for those who have difficulty cutting meat. While my husband was skeptical at first because of the design, he was happily surprised how easy this made cutting food. Recommended!</li>
            <li> blade was dull, unable to cut very well</li>
            <li> We love this knife, nice and sharp and not too expensive. Would suggest it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Balanced wellpreformsas itshould</li>
            <li> My husband has Parkinson&#x27;s Disease and has great difficulty cutting his food. I thought this knife would help him with his independence. Did not happen! I couldn&#x27;t use it either since I am left-handed and the serrations are for a right-handed person.</li>
            <li> I had a stroke 20 years ago and my husband has had cut my meat for me all these years.  No more! It&#x27;s so nice to be able to cut your own, especially when around others or going out.  It cuts quickly and easily with one hand (and my hand is weak). Wish I&#x27;d known about the Rocker Knife years ago.</li>
            <li> Best used when the item to be cut is first stabbed with the point then press down with a rocking motion.</li>
            <li> We replaced our original rocker knife with this one because of the serrations.  My husband&#x27;s handicap causes him difficulty cutting his food and this knife is such an improvement on the last one.  His original knife was purchased at a medical store at twice the price and was not as easy to handle or dishwasher safe.  I&#x27;m very pleased that Amazon now carries so many items we used to buy at Medical Supply stores.  Insurance used to cover much of the cost of these items but that is no longer true.  Since it is out-of-pocket we really appreciate the reasonable prices and convenience of Amazon.</li>
            <li> Rocker Knife is not sharp. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I ordered the super spoon, the fork and the serrated rocker knife. I wish I had ordered them before the surgery. I had thumb arthroplasty on my right hand and had to do everything left-handed. After getting these, I enjoyed my meals 100% more!</li>
            <li> My husband has ALS and these utensils help with fingers that cramp.</li>
