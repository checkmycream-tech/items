            <li>The best have been using it for years</li>
            <li>Best eyebrows pencil.</li>
            <li>I recommend buying the sharpener , as it works best when nicely sharpened.</li>
            <li>It is a great product.</li>
            <li>This pencil works great and fills in my sparse eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>Very nice pencil.</li>
            <li>Love that the color is perfect for all comlextions</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>My eyebrows and hair are a light brown and the color matches wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a perfect fit for the pencil.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, I discovered that the shade is probably the most natural-looking and flattering brow color I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>This is a nice product.</li>
            <li>I am very fair, and never could find the right color..</li>
            <li>I now never leave the house before doing my brows - strongly recommend!</li>
            <li>Love this eyebrow pencil..does exactly what it says..fills your eyebrows perfectly in your true color..amazing.</li>
            <li>Seems to magically match my hair--how does it know???</li>
            <li>Love the color.</li>
            <li>It works like magic.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t ask that much more from a product.  </li>
            <li>My eyebrows have much better definition and shape when I use the pencil</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad Amazon has the pencil, but I can&#x27;t find the sharpener here on Amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Another thing I love about it is it lasts &amp; lasts...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>but a brush on gel works better for me.</li>
            <li>I love this brow pencil.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>The best universal eyebrow pencil..i have bought for years and never disappointed.</li>
            <li>truly a good quality product which is why I am taking the time to write a review rather than getting my much needed beauty rest.</li>
            <li>;, my expression gets more soft and pleasant.</li>
            <li>however it does rub off easily.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery very pleased</li>
            <li>Another indication for me that it is a good quality product is that it sharpens nicely (unlike 90% of the eyeliners that I own and which crack, sharpen unevenly, or just crumble).  </li>
            <li>all use this exact same pencil perfectly</li>
            <li>Brows are the frame of the expression of your face - they are so important to how you look and how others perceive you.</li>
            <li>It appeared to be way too light as a match for my brunette hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned with warm undertones, blond haired and light green eyes and this indeed is a magical pencil.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for over 12 years and love it so much!  </li>
            <li>my wife says its a great pencil and it lasts a long time</li>
            <li>She originally bought the pencil upon recommendation from a make-up artist and we were both hooked after using it.  </li>
            <li>Another awesome thing is that although I use it everyday, I don&#x27;t have to replace my pencil but every couple years!  </li>
            <li>It is well worth the price and will be a &amp;#34;forever&amp;#34; staple in my makeup bag!</li>
            <li>I have been a loyal customer ever since trying it for the first time many years ago.</li>
            <li>I saw some of the reviews nothing the sharpener is hard to find - I&#x27;ve been using a dual sharpener from S ephora that works perfectly.</li>
            <li>This product was recommended as an easy way to shape a brow once again, without too much concern about matching the color...  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s usually a challenge to find a pencil that is the right color for my fair skin and very light blond eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and looks natural!</li>
            <li>It looks natural, goes on easily and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Now since I have this pencil; cannot live without it!!!  </li>
            <li>And, by the way, the cosmetics industry gets away with hyperinflation because of advertising that makes the average woman feel unattractive when, in fact, most of us look just fine.</li>
            <li>I first purchased this item in a beauty supply along with the sharpener.</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to this product by my esthetician 14 years ago when I was 19.  </li>
            <li>This is the exact match for my hair color.  </li>
            <li>Those who have better vision that I may declare that it is worth $25 for a pencil when one could accomplish much the same thing with an old eyeliner pencil like the one I used before buying \\&quot;BC</li>
            <li>And the crayon is great too, not too soft, not too hard.</li>
            <li>This fills in my sparse eyebrows very well.</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It went on beautifully, is much easier to control than the powder/brush I&#x27;ve used for years</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten older, my eyebrows are pretty sparse in some areas and have also faded considerably.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The color blends in and I found that results look more natural than other pencils I have tried.</li>
            <li>I just bought my new replacement for the pencil</li>
            <li>It truly does create a very natural brow on all of us.</li>
            <li>&quot; At this price, the company could at least provide a sharpener for that precious lead.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural blond.</li>
            <li>They put your natural color on.</li>
            <li>if I didn&#x27;t rub my face so much  .. would likely have a longer application.</li>
            <li>and they are surprised when I say \\&quot;yes.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Looked along time before I found a brow pencil that matched the color of my brows and blended in to look natural.  </li>
            <li>I have light auburn hair, my hairdresser is a platinum blonde and other customers with brunette hair</li>
            <li>I am a fair-skinned, natural red head with blonde eyelashes and eyebrows and never could find a product that looked natural.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tested other pencils over the years and no other comes close to looking as natural as this one.  </li>
            <li>It is much shorter and more expensive than the previous one I had purchased.</li>

            <li> I have light auburn hair, my hairdresser is a platinum blonde and other customers with brunette hair</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tested other pencils over the years and no other comes close to looking as natural as this one.  </li>
            <li> It is much shorter and more expensive than the previous one I had purchased.</li>
            <li> I dye my eyebrows now and use the pencil for definition - but when my brows have been blonde or dark brown, they always look defined and natural after using the pencil.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been a customer so long I&#x27;ve seen the pencil and pencil sharpener design change, but the consistency of the product has always remained the same.  </li>
            <li> Lasts a long time, too.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time and blends well with brow color.</li>
            <li> However, it is too long for someone who has to get close to the mirror because they are so nearsighted!</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> I know this, because my dark brunette sister also uses the same pencil.</li>
            <li> Though I tend to go heavy on the application, the application does fade a little and it looks very natural.  </li>
            <li> The ones that haven&#x27;t turned white are dark brown, but few in number.  </li>
            <li> This pencil allows me to fill in and recreate the eyebrows I once had, which then brings out my eyes, even during those times when I choose to skip other eye makeup!</li>
            <li> I have black eyebrows and the pencil color did not change to black</li>
            <li> I even keep all the little stubs just in case</li>
            <li> She has blonde hair, my sister dirty blond to auburn &amp; I at present time:dyed black hair.</li>
            <li> it stayed a dull brown.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it can work on all people, but it seems to - at least for me.</li>
            <li> Very hard and does not draw on well.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to hear that this one color would work on everyone, but it truly does!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Either way, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Seems to magically match my hair--how does it know??? Lasts a long time, too.</li>
            <li> I accidentally ran into this eye brow pencil by accident and ever since then it&#x27;s all I use.</li>
            <li> The best universal eyebrow pencil..i have bought for years and never disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product has been a life saver for me.  Diagnosed with breast cancer ten years ago, I lost my   hair, eyelashes and eyebrows...my hair and lashes came back, but my eyebrows did not.    This product was recommended as an easy way to shape a brow once again, without too much concern about matching the color...  It sort of blends with your skin tone.  I have used it ever since, as I&#x27;ve never found an eyebrow pencil that quite does what this one does.    I recommend buying the sharpener , as it works best when nicely sharpened.</li>
            <li> This seems to me a boondoggle.Those who have better vision that I may declare that it is worth $25 for a pencil when one could accomplish much the same thing with an old eyeliner pencil like the one I used before buying \\&quot;BC Universal.\\&quot; At this price, the company could at least provide a sharpener for that precious lead. And, by the way, the cosmetics industry gets away with hyperinflation because of advertising that makes the average woman feel unattractive when, in fact, most of us look just fine.</li>
            <li> Very hard and does not draw on well.</li>
            <li> Very nice pencil. Love the color. However, it is too long for someone who has to get close to the mirror because they are so nearsighted! Brenda Christian would do well to offer two shorter pencils for the price. I wish it was an automatic pencil too, so I wouldn&#x27;t have to sharpen.</li>
            <li> It is much shorter and more expensive than the previous one I had purchased.</li>
            <li> Love this eyebrow pencil..does exactly what it says..fills your eyebrows perfectly in your true color..amazing.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 12 years and love it so much!  I just hope they keep making it.  It truly is Universal.........matches all brow colors.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!! Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> I do not find it to do as it says. I have black eyebrows and the pencil color did not change to black it stayed a dull brown.</li>
            <li> my wife says its a great pencil and it lasts a long time</li>
            <li> Now since I have this pencil; cannot live without it!!!  It works like magic.  It matches my brow color perfectly.  Can&#x27;t ask that much more from a product.  I now have ordered 2 pencils in a matter of 2 months.  It is a great product.</li>
            <li> Love that the color is perfect for all comlextions I am very fair, and never could find the right color..</li>
            <li> This pencil works great and fills in my sparse eyebrows.  The color matches the color of my brows.</li>
            <li> This fills in my sparse eyebrows very well. The color blends in and I found that results look more natural than other pencils I have tried. Good product.</li>
            <li> I would like to add my voice to others praising this eyebrow pencil!  I just bought my new replacement for the pencil my Mom gave me over two years ago (it still has some life left in it, but I decided to go ahead and order another).  She originally bought the pencil upon recommendation from a make-up artist and we were both hooked after using it.  My eyebrows and hair are a light brown and the color matches wonderfully.  Though I tend to go heavy on the application, the application does fade a little and it looks very natural.  My eyebrows have much better definition and shape when I use the pencil and I don&#x27;t feel that I have to be so diligent about plucking or waxing because I have it.  Another indication for me that it is a good quality product is that it sharpens nicely (unlike 90% of the eyeliners that I own and which crack, sharpen unevenly, or just crumble).  I now never leave the house before doing my brows - strongly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is a nice product. ..however it does rub off easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural blond. It&#x27;s usually a challenge to find a pencil that is the right color for my fair skin and very light blond eyebrows. This one is perfect. The color is truly universal. I know this, because my dark brunette sister also uses the same pencil. And the crayon is great too, not too soft, not too hard. It lasts a long time! Get the pencil sharpener if you can find it. It&#x27;s a perfect fit for the pencil. I first purchased this item in a beauty supply along with the sharpener. I&#x27;m glad Amazon has the pencil, but I can&#x27;t find the sharpener here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Either way, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Haha. My sister &amp; I have been stealing these pencils from our sweetheart of a mother for years! She has blonde hair, my sister dirty blond to auburn &amp; I at present time:dyed black hair. It truly does create a very natural brow on all of us. Another thing I love about it is it lasts &amp; lasts...seldom breaks....truly a good quality product which is why I am taking the time to write a review rather than getting my much needed beauty rest.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful. Especially if you have sparse brows. They put your natural color on.</li>
            <li> I am learning to use this product ... if I didn&#x27;t rub my face so much  .. would likely have a longer application.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to hear that this one color would work on everyone, but it truly does!  I have light auburn hair, my hairdresser is a platinum blonde and other customers with brunette hair all use this exact same pencil perfectly</li>

I have been a loyal customer ever since trying it for the first time many years ago. I dye my eyebrows now and use the pencil for definition - but when my brows have been blonde or dark brown, they always look defined and natural after using the pencil.  I swear this pencil is somewhat of a miracle - I&#x27;ve even had people ask me if I put anything in my brows and they are surprised when I say \\&quot;yes.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been a customer so long I&#x27;ve seen the pencil and pencil sharpener design change, but the consistency of the product has always remained the same.  I&#x27;ve tested other pencils over the years and no other comes close to looking as natural as this one.  Another awesome thing is that although I use it everyday, I don&#x27;t have to replace my pencil but every couple years!  I even keep all the little stubs just in case the product is discontinued - and I hope it never is!  I saw some of the reviews nothing the sharpener is hard to find - I&#x27;ve been using a dual sharpener from S ephora that works perfectly.</li>
            <li> My brows have turned white and gotten sparse from over-plucking when that was the fashion. The ones that haven&#x27;t turned white are dark brown, but few in number.  If I don&#x27;t fill my brows in, it looks like I&#x27;m making a severe face, but as soon as I&#x27;ve &amp;#34;put my brows on&amp;#34;, my expression gets more soft and pleasant. Brows are the frame of the expression of your face - they are so important to how you look and how others perceive you. I&#x27;ve used this pencil for years - and each one lasts forever. I don&#x27;t know how it can work on all people, but it seems to - at least for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay but a brush on gel works better for me.</li>
            <li> I love this brow pencil.  Stays on all day.  Easy to apply and looks natural! I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This is the exact match for my hair color.  I have been looking for a pencil that will match and last awhile.</li>
            <li> I have always used the Maybelline eyebrow pencils until my coworker told me she uses Brenda Christian Universal pencil. I didn&#x27;t believe it when she said she penciled hers in too. She told me it balances the Ph levels in your body to customize the best color for your skin. I love it! I have ordered another already!</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical about the color when first opening the pencil. It appeared to be way too light as a match for my brunette hair. HOWEVER, I discovered that the shade is probably the most natural-looking and flattering brow color I&#x27;ve ever used! It went on beautifully, is much easier to control than the powder/brush I&#x27;ve used for years and my brows look FABULOUS!!&lt;br /&gt;As I&#x27;ve gotten older, my eyebrows are pretty sparse in some areas and have also faded considerably. This pencil allows me to fill in and recreate the eyebrows I once had, which then brings out my eyes, even during those times when I choose to skip other eye makeup! I highly recommend this product. It is well worth the price and will be a &amp;#34;forever&amp;#34; staple in my makeup bag!</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time and blends well with brow color.</li>
            <li> The best have been using it for years</li>
            <li> Love it.  Looked along time before I found a brow pencil that matched the color of my brows and blended in to look natural.  I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> Best eyebrows pencil.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery very pleased</li>
