    <ol>
            <li>Awesome for the price.</li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Backups and makes a great gift.</li>
            <li>It works good just wish the battery life was longer</li>
            <li>Great , 3 in 1 Talk, Listen and Keep Warm.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice hat works good but need longer battery service</li>
            <li>(I crawl houses for a living) but the sound quality lacks greatly.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m extremely impressed of the quality, sound is close to the quality sound of the iPhone headphones that come with apple products.</li>
            <li>nice hat with bluetooth</li>
            <li>It works but its not the most comfortable or the best fit.</li>
            <li>I like the look and the speakers sound good.  </li>
            <li>The bluetooth was super easy to connect  and range was great.  </li>
            <li>When phone is in my pocket could be the static causing it to skip.  </li>
            <li>Great product, works very well.</li>
            <li>Totally love it...</li>
            <li>get more for sure,,</li>
            <li>but I can hear them pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Lovely sound from this Bluetooth beanie.</li>
            <li>I just recived my hat and love it ,,now i can drive hands free ,,im a tech,geek</li>
            <li>it gets a little warm for indoor use, but the sound is great and it pairs very easily.</li>
            <li>a great idea in a simple two-fold wool hat.</li>
            <li>First of all, this is a beanie with bluetooth, so I would like to hear sound from both sides of the ear, yes.</li>
            <li>So far after a week at use at work I love this thing.</li>
            <li>but, it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>I just wished the speakers were louder though but other than that it&#x27;s a good buy for the money</li>
            <li>Worth the purchase even though it&#x27;s scorching hot here in Florida.</li>
            <li>absolutely no problems with the fit, the sound</li>
            <li>The  volume doesn&#x27;t really work.  </li>
            <li>Works really well with my Nexus 6, I am getting ready for the winter</li>
            <li>, I have 2 of them and now every one wants this product</li>
            <li>Its nice but has trouble staying connected to my device</li>
            <li>It last 4 1/2 hours on full blast.</li>
            <li>Its a nice quality for both the fabric and the sound quality but the battery does not last long and the fabric is a little flimsy if that makes sense.</li>
            <li>Speaker works good as headphones for listening to music but poorly for talking on your phone calls.</li>
            <li>Making calls great but not sure how well the other person can hear me</li>
            <li>Also I think a little more weight is needed for the speaker opposite the bluetooth receiver to allow it to sit tighter to the ear would help.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s loud at work</li>
            <li>and I can hear it loud and clear.</li>
            <li>: I don&#x27;t want to hold my device the whole entire time just to listen to music and take calls, no!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely going to order a few more pairs.</li>
            <li>However, the placement of the sound output on both sides are not placed at the correct location, so it&#x27;s pretty difficult to listen.</li>
            <li>Bass is not great but acceptable, vocals sounds good.</li>
            <li>Bluetooth seems to have a few blind spots to were my music will skip but its cool .. Just need to adjust the sizes Bernie fit a Lil big ..</li>

            <li> Battery talk time,sucks,speakers make ear sore,good idea</li>
            <li> Lovely sound from this Bluetooth beanie. Worth the purchase even though it&#x27;s scorching hot here in Florida.</li>
            <li> The  volume doesn&#x27;t really work.  Too low.  The Hats are extremely too thin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t leave very many reviews and they are usually all bad. I&#x27;m a big amazoner also. This caught my eye  and for 14 bucks I had to try it. So far after a week at use at work I love this thing. It last 4 1/2 hours on full blast. It&#x27;s loud at work so I turn it up and I can hear it loud and clear. So battery pass my test. The bluetooth was super easy to connect  and range was great.  Overall I would pay 30 bucks for this In a heartbeat. If they made a upgraded version of this.</li>
            <li> First of all, this is a beanie with bluetooth, so I would like to hear sound from both sides of the ear, yes. However, the placement of the sound output on both sides are not placed at the correct location, so it&#x27;s pretty difficult to listen. Secondly, the sound keeps cutting off like you&#x27;re losing signal on your phone, but I&#x27;m only listening to music, so I conclude that the bluetooth range is horribly short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S: I don&#x27;t want to hold my device the whole entire time just to listen to music and take calls, no!</li>
            <li> Paid for two hats and never received my other one and it&#x27;s now going on three months</li>
            <li> a great idea in a simple two-fold wool hat. it gets a little warm for indoor use, but the sound is great and it pairs very easily.</li>
            <li> Awesome for the price.</li>
            <li> Nice Bluetooth horrible battery sustainably</li>
            <li> It works good just wish the battery life was longer</li>
            <li> I got my beanie yesterday.  I like the look and the speakers sound good.  Making calls great but not sure how well the other person can hear me but I can hear them pretty good.  When phone is in my pocket could be the static causing it to skip.  But it&#x27;s some I will keep using until it stops working.  For the price, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Great product, works very well.</li>
            <li> Its a nice quality for both the fabric and the sound quality but the battery does not last long and the fabric is a little flimsy if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> My son was disappointed that it was small for his head.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice hat works good but need longer battery service</li>
            <li> Works really well with my Nexus 6, I am getting ready for the winter</li>
            <li> Totally love it... absolutely no problems with the fit, the sound , I have 2 of them and now every one wants this product</li>
            <li> The battery doesnt last but about an hour</li>
            <li> Great , 3 in 1 Talk, Listen and Keep Warm.</li>
            <li> Its nice but has trouble staying connected to my device Bluetooth seems to have a few blind spots to were my music will skip but its cool .. Just need to adjust the sizes Bernie fit a Lil big ..</li>
            <li> My order was back ordered I believe but, it was worth the wait. I&#x27;m a picky person when it comes to how my music sounds. No these are no bose, or beats etc. but I&#x27;m extremely impressed of the quality, sound is close to the quality sound of the iPhone headphones that come with apple products. Bass is not great but acceptable, vocals sounds good. I&#x27;m definitely going to order a few more pairs. Backups and makes a great gift.</li>
            <li> It works but its not the most comfortable or the best fit. It also lacks the volume and bettery life.</li>
            <li> nice hat with bluetooth</li>
            <li> The speakers only work sometimes.</li>
            <li> I just recived my hat and love it ,,now i can drive hands free ,,im a tech,geek and it works perfect,,,,,ill get more for sure,,</li>
            <li> It works! I just wished the speakers were louder though but other than that it&#x27;s a good buy for the money</li>
            <li> Speaker works good as headphones for listening to music but poorly for talking on your phone calls.</li>
            <li> I like it for my purpose  (I crawl houses for a living) but the sound quality lacks greatly. The speakers do not line up with my ears properly. Also I think a little more weight is needed for the speaker opposite the bluetooth receiver to allow it to sit tighter to the ear would help.</li>
