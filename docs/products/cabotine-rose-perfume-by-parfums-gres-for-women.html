            <li>I love Cabotine Rose !</li>

            <li>let the name fool you, even if there is a hint of rose, cherry blossom and mimosa are the stars of this perfume.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>i want to smell like a rose i reach for Stella or  Stella Nude by Stella McCarthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cabotine Rose a try</li>
            <li>kind of fades out.....</li>
            <li>This is an easy going Rose - if you like rose.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this perfume.</li>
            <li>Love this scent.  </li>
            <li>the fleur de passion worked much better for me, but the quality of the product line remained.</li>
            <li>people would remark on how lovely icemelt I just love this fragrance</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments when I wear this perfume.  </li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>this wasn&#x27;t better; maybe it is body chemistry?</li>
            <li>I love this perfume is one of my fav</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this</li>
            <li>I have always liked the original Cabotine scent, so I decided to try this one.</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance for the Summer, quick delivery, light rose scent.  </li>
            <li>it was in good condition when i first received it~</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really get a full on rose scent from it, but it&#x27;s awesome nonetheless, and my boyfriend really likes it as well.</li>
            <li>it has a nice fresh scent but it doesnt seem to stay with you.....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very fresh, like the original, but slightly more floral.</li>
            <li>and I needed some things I told my daughter to bring me the light</li>
            <li>I was expecting a chintzy cheap perfume for the price.</li>
            <li>Fantastic smelling Perfume</li>
            <li>/&gt;This would be a good fragrance for a young woman</li>
            <li>I was so glad to find it on Amazon at a very reasonable price and a size I have never seen before.</li>
            <li>A gentle, fresh rose with a hint of peony and tropical frangipani &amp; mimosa.  </li>
            <li>it has a really clean smell.  </li>
            <li>not fruity sweet</li>
            <li>probably a good fragrance for a teen</li>
            <li>Bought this for my momma, she said its like the original but has a flirty fun edge to it.</li>
            <li>It smells really sexy and it last for most of the day.</li>
            <li>A very light  rose scent to wear everyday.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s floral and smells like fresh roses.</li>
            <li>It is rose with a definite pepper note.  </li>
            <li>as rose perfumes go, this one is above the ordinary.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>if you like fresh floral scents.</li>
            <li>the price, it was worth the adventure.  </li>
            <li>A very different take on a rose fragrance.</li>
            <li>The price was right.  </li>
            <li>is fresh and clean and it last the whole day I get so many complements</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It smells light, elegant, and lasts nearly the entire day on me</li>
            <li>I always love my perfumes and toilet waters</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and sweet.</li>
            <li>The black currant and pear makes this a hint sweeter rose fragrance;</li>
            <li>It smells for all the world like a certain brand of roach killer -- a \\&quot;raid\\&quot; on our sense of smell.</li>
            <li>Would not recommend this product as it certainly does not smell like roses whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>Have been wearing regular Cabotine for years and pleasantly surprised with the soft rose scent.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I looked everywhere for this particular scent by Cabotine.  </li>
            <li>For the great price I figured I couldn&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li>I have the green one to love the fragrance</li>
            <li>Not sure how much I really like this, I need to give it more time to appreciate.</li>
            <li>it smells very natural nd pleasing~nd</li>
            <li>Light, floral scent with a little kick.</li>
            <li>The pepper lasts nearly all the way thru so if you donâ€™t care for pepper notes, you may not like this.  </li>
            <li>so was surprised</li>
            <li>Under all of this is a soft, sweet black currant &amp; pear with sandalwood &amp; jasmine notes.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely unpleasant, and it certainly does not smell like any rose</li>
            <li>Shipping was little high for the size of box, but its arrival made the difference in my aunt&#x27;s life!</li>

            <li> I like pink floral fragrances as opposed to citrus-green tints, or heavy golden perfumes.</li>
            <li> However, toilette scent doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as I would prefer so</li>
            <li> gave 4 stars because it did not last long on me,</li>
            <li> wife put a tiny little bit on her hand, and it was completely overpowering.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: this product was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Just as I remembered it from long ago.</li>
            <li> I plan on buying the other cabotine perfumes too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Vendor did not respond, but I see from other comments that they do not accept returns on opened products.</li>
            <li> Delivered quicker than expected!</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly, but I found it disappointing...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not sickly sweet</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got mine for little money at TJMaxx.  </li>
            <li> Cabotine surrounds you in a delicate floral cloud that brings complements from passersby.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with</li>
            <li> So obsessed.</li>
            <li> its not so bad I won&#x27;t wear it, but its rather medicinal- alcohol&#x27;ish.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase. the fragrance is very good and she has loved my mother. recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;is very good</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume. I literally wear it every day. It&#x27;s soft and sweet. It&#x27;s floral and smells like fresh roses. I plan on buying the other cabotine perfumes too.</li>
            <li> This stuff has a synthetic chemical smell, like a cross between roach spray and oven cleaner. It&#x27;s extremely unpleasant, and it certainly does not smell like any rose I&#x27;ve ever encountered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife put a tiny little bit on her hand, and it was completely overpowering. It smells for all the world like a certain brand of roach killer -- a \\&quot;raid\\&quot; on our sense of smell. Not exactly romantic or alluring...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vendor did not respond, but I see from other comments that they do not accept returns on opened products. As another commenter said -- how can you find out what it smells like without opening it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: this product was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> great great for the price shoppers try it</li>
            <li> This is an easy going Rose - if you like rose.  It is rose with a definite pepper note.  The pepper lasts nearly all the way thru so if you donâ€™t care for pepper notes, you may not like this.  A gentle, fresh rose with a hint of peony and tropical frangipani &amp; mimosa.  Under all of this is a soft, sweet black currant &amp; pear with sandalwood &amp; jasmine notes.  The black currant and pear makes this a hint sweeter rose fragrance; not fruity sweet but you definitely notice the sweetness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has good sillage so use with caution.  This scent lasts until the next day on my skin &amp; even longer if I spray on clothing.  I get hints of it on my clothes even after washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be a good fragrance for a young woman but it&#x27;s not sickly sweet so anyone can wear it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got mine for little money at TJMaxx.  When I buy fragrance at Amazon, I always look for &amp;#34;Sold By &amp; Shipped From Amazon&amp;#34;.  Perfume faking is rampant so know your seller.</li>
            <li> Love this scent.  Have been wearing regular Cabotine for years and pleasantly surprised with the soft rose scent.  However, toilette scent doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as I would prefer so will try finding in the Eau De Parfum.</li>
            <li> it is a great parfum to keep for women! it smells very natural nd pleasing~nd it was in good condition when i first received it~</li>
            <li> as rose perfumes go, this one is above the ordinary.&lt;br /&gt;I gave 4 stars because it did not last long on me, the fleur de passion worked much better for me, but the quality of the product line remained.</li>
            <li> When I suddenly had to go to the hospital and I needed some things I told my daughter to bring me the light is  fragrance I always love my perfumes and toilet waters she brought me this every person that came in my room said oh your room smells wonderful every time I went somewhere people would remark on how lovely icemelt I just love this fragrance</li>
            <li> I have always liked the original Cabotine scent, so I decided to try this one. For the great price I figured I couldn&#x27;t go wrong. It&#x27;s definitely in my short list now. It&#x27;s very fresh, like the original, but slightly more floral. I don&#x27;t really get a full on rose scent from it, but it&#x27;s awesome nonetheless, and my boyfriend really likes it as well. I would definitely buy this cologne again.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my momma, she said its like the original but has a flirty fun edge to it. Great for date nights. Mom always knows best.</li>
            <li> I looked everywhere for this particular scent by Cabotine.  I was so glad to find it on Amazon at a very reasonable price and a size I have never seen before. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I order the bigger size for the summer.  It smell good and it is from France.  Good price for a France  parfums.</li>

            <li> I was expecting a chintzy cheap perfume for the price. It smells light, elegant, and lasts nearly the entire day on me</li>
            <li> A very light  rose scent to wear everyday. Its not at all &amp;#34;heady&amp;#34; so it can be sprayed generously. Cabotine surrounds you in a delicate floral cloud that brings complements from passersby.</li>
            <li> Fantastic smelling Perfume</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really have much of a rose scent, but still smells great! Light, floral scent with a little kick.</li>
            <li> I just received it this evening. Very nice fragrance,&lt;br /&gt;my husband loves it on me. Can&#x27;t go wrong with&lt;br /&gt;roses.</li>

            <li> Oh my gosh! So obsessed. Absolutely love this</li>
            <li> A very different take on a rose fragrance.</li>
            <li> it has a nice fresh scent but it doesnt seem to stay with you.....kind of fades out.....probably a good fragrance for a teen</li>
            <li> Would not recommend this product as it certainly does not smell like roses whatsoever.  Wanted to return item but company refused since I opened package.  How else would one ascertain fragrance???</li>
