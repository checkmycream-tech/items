            <li>OMG - this stuff works great, not as abrasive as a salt scrub, just enought oil and at first I thought too greasy (ugh)</li>
            <li>Love it</li>

            <li>the scrub is divine love it</li>
            <li>I TRIED IT ONCE IN THE SHOWER AND ITS NOW MY FAVORITE PRODUCT</li>
            <li>Coconut is my favorite, but I also love Lime, Grapefruit, and Almond.  </li>
            <li>I have used most of the scents they carry.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more.....</li>
            <li>love love love the smell!&lt;br /&gt;helping</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love the sent.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll wish you can eat your own body, Lavender-the perfect way to de-stress after a long day at work, Eucalyptus- the best way to end a gym session, Green Apple-</li>
            <li>The coconut smells very sweet, almost nauseating.</li>
            <li>My skin has never been better and it feels so smooth.  </li>
            <li>You will absolutely enjoy showering more than ever before, while getting the smooth skin you have always dreamed of.&lt;br /&gt;l</li>
            <li>There is just the right amount of oils mixed in to make your skin flawless and noticeable</li>
            <li>Amazing, for the first time in months, no itch and legs were still moisturized since using the product in the AM.  </li>
            <li>After giving it a good stir, it was still dry and crumbly but the scent was nice and it was usable.  </li>
            <li>Who would have thought that sugar would do such a great job.</li>
            <li>If you do that it will smell and work great for the entire time you have the container.</li>
            <li>Product seems good enough.</li>
            <li>However, be aware that the oils and sugar separate very quickly.  </li>
            <li>It made my skin super smooth and soft and fabulous!</li>
            <li>Not only is the product amazing, but the team at simple sugars are so nice to deal with.  </li>
            <li>It is amazing how many people put harmful toxins into their bodies everyday, and not to mention, spend a fortune doing so.  </li>
            <li>It is a good PR, but she doesn&#x27;t have any medical background to \\&quot;invent\\&quot; any new solution to curve eczema.</li>
            <li>you have to stir it every time you use it but other than that its a great product i have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The scrub exfoliated the dry cuticles and they are nice and moisturized now.  </li>
            <li>She was under a year old &amp; it was perfect on her delicate baby skin, &amp; helped with her eczema</li>
            <li>I love the simple sugars lineup.</li>
            <li>Both my husband and I use the Simple Sugars Scrubs and absolutely LOVE them.</li>
            <li>, regardless,  exfoliation should be something you do daily, and you will notice how SMOOTH you become even after the first use.  </li>
            <li>Little slower than most products getting here but worth the wait.</li>
            <li>I agree that this product left my skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>I used this scrub twice a day for 3 days and it gently cleaned my wounds while moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Once toweled off legs were very moisturized</li>
            <li>Since they contain real fruits I can&#x27;t use the Strawberry cause I&#x27;m allergic.  </li>
            <li>I know you read reviews and wonder if they are really telling the truth,</li>
            <li>the product really makes a difference on your skin.  </li>
            <li>I have recommended this product to all my friends, coworkers, mom, sister-in law...just about anyone who loves skincare as much as I do....</li>
            <li>Item helped my niece out so much.</li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>I have been using a prescription product for a few years that quite honestly has worked well</li>
            <li>It came right in time too, cause Avon stopped selling my old scrub</li>
            <li>We are most fond of the Vanilla and the Gingerbread scents but have used the Coconut, Almond, Coffee and other scents.</li>
            <li>so much decided to have my 12 and 13 year old sons use the scrubs (it was a challenge just getting them to try it the first time).  </li>
            <li>After 3 weeks of use, not only it didn&#x27;t help the situation, it actually caused the skin to be drier and more irritated.</li>
            <li>I have given this scrub as gifts to all my friends and family and would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone.  </li>
            <li>I like the Vanilla &amp; Almond, and for face I LOVE the Avocado and Green Tea.  </li>
            <li>Plus, most sugar scrubs have too much oil in them for my prefence and some (Fresh \\&quot;Sugar\\&quot; products) are too expensive.  </li>
            <li>It makes my dry skin very moist and smooth all day long.</li>
            <li>I am from Pittsburgh where the young founder is also from</li>
            <li>Lani has developed a product that transforms with honesty, integrity, and purity.  </li>
            <li>My only caveat is before you use it each time just mix it up really well</li>
            <li>Just like what Kevin said, it is something like an eleven years old can do.</li>
            <li>I bought this product through their website directly.</li>
            <li>While I like the concept (and probably the product if it were fresh), I will go back to buying scrubs at my local farmer&#x27;s market.  </li>
            <li>Works great for my dry skin, my wife&#x27;s dry hands and my sons eczema behind his knees.</li>
            <li>My 12 year old has ezcema and uses the body and facial scrub.  </li>
            <li>Nice product but way too expensive ($21.95) for this product.</li>
            <li>and I can even throw on my silk clothing right away without worrying any oil will mess them up!  </li>
            <li>but when I rinsed and dried my hands they were very soft and my cuticles - completely cleaned up!  </li>
            <li>By the time I finished the first two jars and opened the third,  it was completely dried out and caked solid in the jar - the scent was totally gone and it smelled a bit rancid.  </li>

            <li> Nice product but way too expensive ($21.95) for this product.</li>
            <li> and I can even throw on my silk clothing right away without worrying any oil will mess them up!  </li>

            <li> When I received them in the mail, the first jar seemed a little bit dry.  </li>
            <li> This item is over priced and took too long to be delivered, it does not appear any different from other sugar scrubs I have bought over the years.</li>
            <li> In winter my legs are so dry and itchy that no amount of even medicated lotion helps with the dryness and itch.  </li>
            <li> I was left with only oil before the jar was half empty.  </li>
            <li> The product left the tub floor very slippery, and it made my ezcema worse than before.</li>
            <li> Such a huge difference in our skin since we began using this product - buy it - you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The price point was too high and the separation too irritating to make this a product that I would buy again.  </li>
            <li> ALSO I SHALL TELL OTHER FRIENDS ABOUT IT.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE:  Used the other day in the shower for my legs.  </li>
            <li> Just a few spoonfuls of Simple Sugars (it comes with a small spoon to get the product out of the jar) when showering and you are on your way to smoothness.</li>
            <li> Legs felt a little greasy but nowhere as greasy as other scrubs.  </li>
            <li> No more dry skin and no more lotions/crèmes.</li>
            <li> My favorites are amond, tangerine, and green tea with tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> and those are just a few of my favorites.  </li>
            <li> The Green Tea with Tea Tree</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money on this product.    </li>
            <li> Since its late in the day I decided to test on my hands since they are also prone to extreme dryness, especiallly my cuticles.  </li>
            <li> Messy and not very effective.</li>
            <li> and I have serious skin issues.  </li>
            <li> i bought it to see if it helped with my sorasis and eczema seemed to make mine worse.</li>
            <li> I seriously am addicted to this product!</li>
            <li> This product was &amp;#34;simply&amp;#34; too expensive to throw out!﻿</li>
            <li> and it has worked miracles on my &amp;#34; chicken skin&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> but unfortunately, I cannot!</li>
            <li> Stop posting fake reviews to sell your product!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Didnt see a differnce on my daughters eczema!  Smells good though</li>
            <li> you have to stir it every time you use it but other than that its a great product i have very sensitive skin and this works great for me with no issues</li>
            <li> I agree that this product left my skin feeling smooth. However, be aware that the oils and sugar separate very quickly.  You have to stir it before every use before you get in the shower (if water gets in the container, it dilutes the product). And even then, it may separate before you open the jar again.  I was left with only oil before the jar was half empty.  The price point was too high and the separation too irritating to make this a product that I would buy again.  I am from Pittsburgh where the young founder is also from and I have serious skin issues.  I had hoped this was a product that I could support but unfortunately, I cannot!</li>
            <li> Saw this on Shark Tank and decided to give it a try.  I have used countless scrubs but what I like about this one is that the scrub doesn&#x27;t leave you oily and you don&#x27;t need to lotion after.  Love it so much decided to have my 12 and 13 year old sons use the scrubs (it was a challenge just getting them to try it the first time).  My 12 year old has ezcema and uses the body and facial scrub.  I saw an improvement immediately and now he uses the scrub every day to control his breakout (his prescription ointment never worked).  Both boys use on a regular basis and especially love strawberry.  My favorites are amond, tangerine, and green tea with tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> OMG! I used this product to help my eczema and it totally worked! It made my skin super smooth and soft and fabulous! I seriously am addicted to this product! The formulation is great and you never have to use lotion after you use this product. Best invention since sliced bread!</li>
            <li> I purchased 3 jars of Simple Sugars (in various scents) online after seeing it on Shark Tank.  When I received them in the mail, the first jar seemed a little bit dry.  After giving it a good stir, it was still dry and crumbly but the scent was nice and it was usable.  By the time I finished the first two jars and opened the third,  it was completely dried out and caked solid in the jar - the scent was totally gone and it smelled a bit rancid.  While I like the concept (and probably the product if it were fresh), I will go back to buying scrubs at my local farmer&#x27;s market.  This product was &amp;#34;simply&amp;#34; too expensive to throw out!﻿</li>
            <li> After seeing this on shark tank I had to have the product smells wonderful and the scrub is divine love it</li>
            <li> I have the strawberry facial scrub and was in a motorcycle accident with road rash on my face.  I used this scrub twice a day for 3 days and it gently cleaned my wounds while moisturizing. Using that with scar cream did wonders for me.  Amazing product.</li>
            <li> I TRIED IT ONCE IN THE SHOWER AND ITS NOW MY FAVORITE PRODUCT AND I WILL ORDER IT AGAIN BUT MAYBE IN A DIFFERENT SCRUB. ALSO I SHALL TELL OTHER FRIENDS ABOUT IT. I FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS SCRUB ON THE TV PROGRAM SHARK TANK.</li>
            <li> I use this every day in the shower. It makes my dry skin very moist and smooth all day long. Coconut is my favorite, but I also love Lime, Grapefruit, and Almond.  I have given this scrub as gifts to all my friends and family and would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love the simple sugars lineup. I have used most of the scents they carry. Works great for my dry skin, my wife&#x27;s dry hands and my sons eczema behind his knees.</li>
            <li> Saw Lani on Shark Tank and her product caught my attention.  In winter my legs are so dry and itchy that no amount of even medicated lotion helps with the dryness and itch.  Plus, most sugar scrubs have too much oil in them for my prefence and some (Fresh \\&quot;Sugar\\&quot; products) are too expensive.  Just received the coconut scrub - wonderful scent, definately smells like you are in the Islands and not too sweet.  Since its late in the day I decided to test on my hands since they are also prone to extreme dryness, especiallly my cuticles.  OMG - this stuff works great, not as abrasive as a salt scrub, just enought oil and at first I thought too greasy (ugh) but when I rinsed and dried my hands they were very soft and my cuticles - completely cleaned up!  The scrub exfoliated the dry cuticles and they are nice and moisturized now.  I should get a jar just for home manicures!  Can&#x27;t wait to try on my legs in the shower in the AM. Great product - Thank You Lani!  I will be ordering more.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Used the other day in the shower for my legs.  Legs felt a little greasy but nowhere as greasy as other scrubs.  Once toweled off legs were very moisturized and I didn&#x27;t need lotion.  The big test - itchy legs at night.  Amazing, for the first time in months, no itch and legs were still moisturized since using the product in the AM.  This product is a winner for me.</li>
            <li> I should have ordered a different scent. The coconut smells very sweet, almost nauseating. Nice product but way too expensive ($21.95) for this product.</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I use the Simple Sugars Scrubs and absolutely LOVE them. We are most fond of the Vanilla and the Gingerbread scents but have used the Coconut, Almond, Coffee and other scents. This product is amazing. No more dry skin and no more lotions/crèmes. Just a few spoonfuls of Simple Sugars (it comes with a small spoon to get the product out of the jar) when showering and you are on your way to smoothness. We would not travel anywhere without it. Such a huge difference in our skin since we began using this product - buy it - you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing scrub! I have finally stopped using the doctor&#x27;s cream for my dermatitis.  I use it before and after I shave.  I like the Vanilla &amp; Almond, and for face I LOVE the Avocado and Green Tea.  The summer citrus ones are great too.  Since they contain real fruits I can&#x27;t use the Strawberry cause I&#x27;m allergic.  My skin has never been better and it feels so smooth.  I know you read reviews and wonder if they are really telling the truth, but I have to tell you this is 100% honest, this is the best scrub on the market.  It came right in time too, cause Avon stopped selling my old scrub and I&#x27;m so glad they did!!  Not only is the product amazing, but the team at simple sugars are so nice to deal with.  They are friendly and helpful and I hope they make brown sugar scrubs soon!!</li>
            <li> Very pleasant smell and the product really makes a difference on your skin.  I highly recommend this product to anyone.  Little slower than most products getting here but worth the wait.</li>
            <li> love love love the smell!&lt;br /&gt;helping my legs that have eczema on them.</li>
            <li> These scrubs are truly divine, and work wonders on your skin. As someone who is dedicated and appreciative to chemical-free skin care, Lani caught my attention immediately during her Shark Tank appearance (now over a year ago), and I have been a member since! It is amazing how many people put harmful toxins into their bodies everyday, and not to mention, spend a fortune doing so.  I cannot imagine showering without these scrubs....so many delicious scents, each with their own perk! Strawberry/Raspberry- Antioxidants, Coffee/Lime- think skin tightening ladies, Chocolate- you&#x27;ll wish you can eat your own body, Lavender-the perfect way to de-stress after a long day at work, Eucalyptus- the best way to end a gym session, Green Apple- vitamin loaded, Coconut- You&#x27;ll feel as if you&#x27;re on the beach in Jamaica.....and those are just a few of my favorites.  The Green Tea with Tea Tree face scrub has calmed my blemish-prone, oily skin, and is loaded with all kinds of anti-inflammatory goodies.  Your skin will GLOW after you emerge from the shower, and throughout the entire day.  And lets face it, who has time to get out of the shower and slap on body lotion when rushing to get to work?  There is just the right amount of oils mixed in to make your skin flawless and noticeable and I can even throw on my silk clothing right away without worrying any oil will mess them up!  I have recommended this product to all my friends, coworkers, mom, sister-in law...just about anyone who loves skincare as much as I do....even purchased the Mens scrubs for my brother last Christmas and he was hooked.  You don&#x27;t need to have eczema or any skin condition to order (but if you do, Id purchase these before even going to the Dermatologist), regardless,  exfoliation should be something you do daily, and you will notice how SMOOTH you become even after the first use.  Don&#x27;t go a day without exfoliation with Simple Sugars...you WILL NOT regret it!  Added Bonus- Their Customer Service is great, and have always been impressed with their packaging.  Lani has developed a product that transforms with honesty, integrity, and purity.  You will absolutely enjoy showering more than ever before, while getting the smooth skin you have always dreamed of.&lt;br /&gt;l</li>
            <li> i bought it to see if it helped with my sorasis and eczema seemed to make mine worse.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help at all on my son&#x27;s psoriasis .........</li>
            <li> Product seems good enough.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work! I bought simple sugars body scrubs in the hope that may help my eczema problem after watching the shark tank episode. After 3 weeks of use, not only it didn&#x27;t help the situation, it actually caused the skin to be drier and more irritated. The product itself is nicely packed and it smells nice, but that won&#x27;t win its sale. I won&#x27;t buy it again and won&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> This item is over priced and took too long to be delivered, it does not appear any different from other sugar scrubs I have bought over the years. I think I can get the same results for my childs ezcema with another brand, cheaper product.</li>
            <li> Item helped my niece out so much. She was under a year old &amp; it was perfect on her delicate baby skin, &amp; helped with her eczema</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff. Who would have thought that sugar would do such a great job. After watching it on shark tank I thought I would give It a shot and it has worked miracles on my &amp;#34; chicken skin&amp;#34; being my arms. I have been using a prescription product for a few years that quite honestly has worked well but the cost has been somewhat of a problem for me. At 16 bucks a jar for Simple Sugars products I couldn&#x27;t resist giving it a try. It works really well and I absolutely love the sent. My only caveat is before you use it each time just mix it up really well so you evenly distribute the oils and sugar. If you do that it will smell and work great for the entire time you have the container. Good stuff..</li>
            <li> Messy and not very effective.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff great sale</li>
            <li> After watched this product on the sharktank couple times, I decided to write this review. Don&#x27;t waste your time and money on this product.    If you are looking for a solution for your eczema, don&#x27;t be fouled by what they said on the sharktank. It is a good PR, but she doesn&#x27;t have any medical background to \\&quot;invent\\&quot; any new solution to curve eczema. Just like what Kevin said, it is something like an eleven years old can do. I bought this product through their website directly. The product left the tub floor very slippery, and it made my ezcema worse than before. Stop posting fake reviews to sell your product!</li>
