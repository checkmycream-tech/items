            <li>it&#x27;s pretty cool brings back childhood memories</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only just now reviewing because I bought a different kind if money soap from another vendor and was given a money-less soap!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> This was a great gift to my brother-in-law. It even smells really good!</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift,  was a hit!  Everyone loved it,  and it smells great.  Can&#x27;t wait to find out how much money is in it!</li>
            <li> $17 including shipping for stinky soap &amp; $1</li>
            <li> My dad is kinda cheap. I got this for him as a gag gift and he loved it.</li>
            <li> I got this for my son at Christmas.  He loves it and can&#x27;t wait until he gets to the money.  The soap has a very pleasant smell that can be used for both men and women.  The actual bill is tucked into a wrapper inside the soap and I told my son that he has to use all the soap before he can open the wrapper to see what denomination he got.  I&#x27;m hoping it will be a good incentive to remember to wash his hands (he&#x27;s seven).</li>
            <li> I got this as a White Elephant gift. It is pretty funny. Only got a $1 inside though...smells pretty good too.</li>
            <li> Son thought this was the coolest. Lots of fun!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just plain fun. My teenage grandsons got the biggest kick out of it.  They are both anxious to get to the money  so actually shower more often. It&#x27;s just a fun little gift that&#x27;s sure to bring a smile!</li>
            <li> This was a great gag gift for my son in law...the bet was he would cut the soap open rather than wait to see what was inside. Lots of fun and smiles with this one!</li>
            <li> cut it open money to get for $5&lt;br /&gt;should I buy it if i cut it open today yea sure</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my husband. He enjoyed the concept, but ended up breaking the soap to get the bill because the scent of the soap was very sweet and strong and gave us both headaches.</li>
            <li> Got this for my stepdad, there was only a $1 bill in it(would&#x27;ve been nice if there was more of course) but the joke on him was worth it.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find this product from my childhood, I gave it as a secret santa gift.  It arrived on time.  The scent is also very pleasant.</li>
            <li> It was funny and I purchased this for my husband. Our bar of soap had a $1 in it. It was comical!</li>
            <li> I ordered 6 of these money soaps for a stocking stuffer for my children and my nieces and nephews for Christmas. They did ship fast, and came attractively packaged, but opening them was another story. I purchased them in hopes of the children washing their hands more often. This was a fail as my brother and husband immediately got out a kitchen knife and cut them in half to get to the money. I was nervous with all of the kids getting to the middle together as I didn&#x27;t want anyone to feel left out if they didn&#x27;t get as much as the next kid, but that didn&#x27;t seem to be a problem. All were encasing a $1 bill which made me feel ripped off. Under the sellers information it states there there is a different donation in each bar. If you were to do the math on this you would find that at least 1 of the bars that I purchased would have had a larger amount than $1 inside. This leads me to believe that there is only $1 bills in these bars of soap and then the price gets jacked up to make a profit of over $9. Yes, it&#x27;s cool to have money in your soap when your a kid. Even as an adult I thought that this was a cool idea and would like to receive one. But in the end, it is a complete rip-off and you would be better to make your own soap with money in it for less than a dollar for each bar.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves the idea of money being in the soap.  She can&#x27;t wait to see how much she got.  I tried to use it, wow is it slippery!!!  Smells good, but made my skin really itchy.  Whatever, it&#x27;s for her, not me.  : )</li>
            <li> This is a very original idea. I gave them out for Christmas and both parties enjoyed them. It&#x27;s like playing the lottery. I bought two and they both had $1 bills in them.</li>
            <li> A great idea to help encourage children to wash their hands. It smells nice and lasts long too.  Good stocking stuffer for Christmas.</li>
            <li> my daughter LOVED getting this for Christmas...and I&#x27;d say that all of the kids had the cleanest hands until that money was finally reached.  It is a great gift...very fun.</li>
            <li> We are waiting to see which bill we get.  Fun idea.</li>
            <li> The perfect gift to keep on hand for that extra person. It&#x27;s perfect for adults to children. I bought 5 just in case someone shows up uninspectantly. And it smells good too.</li>
            <li> It made my hands smell like poop $1 is what I got out of it total rip poop poop poop</li>
            <li> This was an awesome joke gift for my friend. It was incentive to get them to take more showers! They loved it!</li>
            <li> was lots of fun.was something different, I give it as a gift, they love it, made giving the gift fun.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a stocking stuffer, so I won&#x27;t know how much $$ is in there until my son uses it, but it smelled good and looks as advertised.</li>
            <li> you only get 1,5,10$ any more money is a 1/100,000,000,000,000,000 chance</li>
            <li> 5 stars. I love it. I got it as a gift for a friend and my brother. They finally wash their hands now!! Though they haven&#x27;t gotten to the money yet.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a Christmas gift for a little boy, he loved it, and was super excited when he got down to his $</li>
            <li> This was a great gift and it was very entertaining to give to a friend of mine. It worked great!</li>
            <li> Our son like this novelty soap and is trying to figure a way to get the money out without having to shower, .... kids!</li>
            <li> Great stocking stuffer!!</li>
            <li> This is always a hit!!! I give these out for Christmas, Birthdays, Graduation etc.. Its fun to see what amount of money everyone gets inside. So far we&#x27;ve only gotten $1, but so worth it!</li>
            <li> The box actually looks better than it does in the picture. The scent is wonderful, it&#x27;s Pear. Very strong but not obnoxious. I could smell it before I opened the package. I purchased this soap as a stocking stuffer for my son. At first he refused to believe there is money in the middle. He kept telling me it&#x27;s a piece of plastic. Once he understood the dollar is rolled up inside the plastic, he became excited. I have enjoyed watching him wash his hands all day and he was so excited to take his evening shower. Exactly the reaction I hoped for. I recommend!</li>
            <li> My son loved it.  Great gag gift.</li>
            <li> Have been buying this item for gifts for years for kids &amp; adults &amp; everyone loves it!!</li>
            <li> My girls loved the money inside but the soap wasn&#x27;t the best smell.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gag gift for one of my friends and she loves it! I originally meant to buy her a lotto ticket, but this was way better, since it is both a useful product (it smells pretty good) and you are sure to win something! She only won $1, but it&#x27;s way better than not winning anything right?</li>
            <li> Very creative and fun. Got 2 for my husband and my brother in law. Unfortunately both had only $1 in it....but I like the idea tho.</li>
            <li> Fun idea but not a great buy, soap broke with first use (I was trying to get the money out) cheap soap, strong smell, mine had a dollar which most would be disappointed with however I found it cool that there was money. Good but not great.</li>
            <li> Great Stocking stuffer, family really got a kick out of it.  The 2 I ordered both had 1$ in them, however it was still loads of fun.  Not to mention the surprise that the soap actually had a pleasant scent!</li>
            <li> It smells amazing. I bought this as a birthday gift for my dad. I will update when he gets to the money inside.</li>
            <li> I remember these from when I was a kid, and now that I am An adult it&#x27;s still pretty cool they still have the same exact smell and it&#x27;s pretty cool brings back childhood memories</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the wonderful scent. It&#x27;s like a citrus scent. It rinses very clean and I don&#x27;t feel the residue on my skin (compared to other soaps I&#x27;ve used). It&#x27;s a great gift for anyone. My bar of soap had a dollar in the middle. I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much. It was fun wondering what would be in the center.</li>
            <li> I really liked this money soap! I&#x27;m only just now reviewing because I bought a different kind if money soap from another vendor and was given a money-less soap!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From now on, I will only purchase from this vendor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A plus is this soap came clear, so you could see the money in it. The other soap I bought wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Fun gift, smells great.</li>
