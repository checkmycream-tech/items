            <li>Very elegant and classy, a very good buy.</li>
            <li>(though I&#x27;d say it works best for mature guys 30+ in age).  </li>
            <li>Most people don&#x27;t even know what it is, but when they smell it on me I almost always get complimented on how amazing it smells.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this is perfect for a young boy or teenager.</li>
            <li>VERY QUICK DELIVERY!</li>
            <li>good fragrance, very good projection for the first hour (still good after the initial hour, no worries).</li>
            <li>For the money, this stuff is fantastic!</li>
            <li>After reading through many reviews I settled on this one.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li>I have waited over 2 weeks to be sure of the scent before writing review.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>More of an Evening cologne.</li>
            <li>This one has been a go-to for many years.  </li>
            <li>And his teachers and classmates love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t quite like the opening, but after 15 minutes in it&#x27;s really lovely.</li>
            <li>This one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I recommend it to anyone, you are going to love it a lot.</li>
            <li>sure you see the code on the bottom.</li>
            <li>No matter how many times I tried to leave a review, Amazon.com didn&#x27;t allow it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sold in stores in my regional area, so I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m able to order it for him online.</li>
            <li>I love this product Ive been using it for many years.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>Good scent I like white better ,but good for price</li>
            <li>first off, anybody purchasing this fragrance for 20-30$ USD for a 3.4 oz. should be grateful and smiling on their good fortune.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a very nice, sophisticated, sort of softly spicy type fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells great, it has a high end feeling to it even though it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>My first impressions about the perfume is that It smells absolutely fantastic and the bottle has a gorgeous look that adds charm to it.</li>
            <li>A rich and sumptuous cologne that reminds many of Chanel&#x27;s Allure, quite an accomplishment for a cologne in the $20 range.</li>
            <li>It has very mild scent</li>
            <li>Starts off pungent and strong.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite fragances, I use it for special occasions, the girls loves it.</li>
            <li>Very sweet and light aroma.</li>
            <li>Spicy top, sweet bottom.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a sweet scent that pleases most who smell you.</li>
            <li>/&gt;A must buy for cologne collectors, or any1 who wants a nice cologne at a cheap price.</li>
            <li>But overall it&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
            <li>This is a great fragrance and especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Although i really enjoy the scent it might of just been my bottle for me</li>
            <li>Perry Ellis M for MEN is a very affordable nice smelling</li>
            <li>+ free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worth the buy!</li>
            <li>(original is burgundy</li>
            <li>BUT NOT THE ORIGINAL</li>
            <li>If it was to be the original the bottles tops should be interchangeable which this is not.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This smells like a much more classy and sophisticated fragrance than the $20 I paid for it.  </li>
            <li>The reviews were right!  </li>
            <li>Smell: 9/10 (Sweet, woodsy, and done right!)    </li>
            <li>It can be used for any occasion because it&#x27;s not overpowering but more intimate.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s a very inviting scent that I just love on my husband.</li>
            <li>make sure you get a 100% real one buy retail</li>
            <li>a bit too sweet for me...</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a sweet one.</li>
            <li>Simply put, it&#x27;s an awesome night-wear cologne for special occasions, clubbing, romantic encounters, etc</li>
            <li>Clean like freshly laundered cotton.</li>
            <li>I wear it daily and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>Most so called Fragrance &amp;#34;Snobs&amp;#34; give this one high</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful, but masculine scent at the same time.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok to me i little to strong for but still smells good mature women like the way it smells on me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how different they smell very musty and strong.</li>
            <li>drys down to a cool refreshing clean scent,,with a light touch of sweetness...</li>
            <li>Light and clean are what&#x27;s in for adult males.  </li>
            <li>I did a side by side test and the m is right on the money.</li>
            <li>and he is right.</li>
            <li>Chicks love this scent, apparently.</li>
            <li>Has a very calming, soothing, clean smell that is also gentle.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite toilette spray, I we found the spray with much larger containers and a lower price than anywhere we have have be enable to find .</li>
            <li>even the top and scent were different.</li>
            <li>Thanks for everything!</li>
            <li>It smells exactly like Chanel Allure as we know all the Perry Ellis line smells like some well known brand.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very masculine, and smells slightly sweet, and musky.</li>
            <li>Amazing cologne, sharp projection.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s close but far from the original.</li>
            <li>I love the soft yet masculine scent of this perry ellis eau de toilette.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a bit sexy, but still good for any casual occasion</li>
            <li>masculine but sweet scent  </li>
            <li>On the left is the ORIGINAL on the right</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great fragrance which draws a direct parallel to Allure Homme by Chanel, which costs 3x-4x as much for the same size.  </li>
            <li>The scent is very close</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Really, somebody swiped it.  </li>
            <li>It smells really really really close to it.</li>
            <li>And for the price you really can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>I knocked one star off because it reminds me too much of La Nuit De L&#x27;homme by YSL, which i already have in my collection.</li>
            <li>It has a very sensual smell.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!  </li>
            <li>just plain nice.  </li>
            <li>but DEFINITELY NOT  the original &amp;#34;M&amp;#34; scent nor packaging</li>
            <li>Not a romantic smell to me...but a clean soapy smell...Could be worn by woman too..</li>
            <li>Versatility: 7/10 (Formal/ informal...spring, fall, winter, possibly summer on a cool day)  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this cologne for any type of occasion.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like fruity colognes and this has a soft subtle fragrance that always gets comments about how good I smell.</li>
            <li>, smelled the same, but those air bubble where well worth.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok and the shipping was pretty slow but got the item thxs</li>
            <li>I live in the Caribbean and took a risk at purchasing a perfume online for my husband.</li>
            <li>BUT FAR FROM LONG LASTING ON THE BODY AS THE ORIGINAL.</li>
            <li>To me this is great for the evening or formal wear during the cold weather.</li>
            <li>this is far I wo recommend 360 not this</li>
            <li>I think its a professional fragrance for the office and the women I know seem to like it as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong and harsh like Axe Spray, but rather more subtle and inviting.</li>
            <li>Item I received bottle is not original for I have used this item before, the items original case is a metal container, this one arrived in a cardboard container look alike.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is up to you to take this risk but it just not have the same &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; as Allure Homme that other reviewers have suggested and does not seem like the original product.</li>
            <li>This fragrance came up as highly rated for a low cost</li>
            <li>When purchasing this particular item, the item may be an old item fragrance is dull, item is in a fabricated carton and will not be in original container.</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s no other man&#x27;s colonge I would prefer to use than Perry Ellis M.</li>
            <li>My husband, wears burberry, and It&#x27;s too expensive, to have the two of them, using one bottle, and my son wanted his own cologne.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that i have a very hard time finding it any more</li>
            <li>I own a few more expensive scents but for everyday wear</li>
            <li>It really does smell like a much more expensive and sheik fragrance!</li>
            <li>But the notes settle down and become much smoother.</li>
            <li>Fresh but not crisp or sharp.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kinda light though, projection might be weak.</li>
            <li>It smells alright, does not seem to last long; I blind bought it due to good reviews and similarities to Allure Homme.</li>
            <li>Might be a little too much for work, but definitely works for date night.</li>

            <li> But overall it&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
            <li> This is a great fragrance and especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Although i really enjoy the scent it might of just been my bottle for me</li>
            <li> Perry Ellis M for MEN is a very affordable nice smelling</li>
            <li> + free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worth the buy!</li>
            <li> (original is burgundy</li>
            <li> BUT NOT THE ORIGINAL</li>
            <li> If it was to be the original the bottles tops should be interchangeable which this is not.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This smells like a much more classy and sophisticated fragrance than the $20 I paid for it.  </li>
            <li> The reviews were right!  </li>
            <li> Smell: 9/10 (Sweet, woodsy, and done right!)    </li>
            <li> It can be used for any occasion because it&#x27;s not overpowering but more intimate.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s a very inviting scent that I just love on my husband.</li>
            <li> make sure you get a 100% real one buy retail</li>
            <li> a bit too sweet for me...</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a sweet one.</li>
            <li> Simply put, it&#x27;s an awesome night-wear cologne for special occasions, clubbing, romantic encounters, etc</li>
            <li> Clean like freshly laundered cotton.</li>
            <li> I wear it daily and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> Most so called Fragrance &amp;#34;Snobs&amp;#34; give this one high</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful, but masculine scent at the same time.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok to me i little to strong for but still smells good mature women like the way it smells on me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how different they smell very musty and strong.</li>
            <li> drys down to a cool refreshing clean scent,,with a light touch of sweetness...</li>
            <li> Light and clean are what&#x27;s in for adult males.  </li>
            <li> I did a side by side test and the m is right on the money.</li>
            <li> and he is right.</li>
            <li> Chicks love this scent, apparently.</li>
            <li> Has a very calming, soothing, clean smell that is also gentle.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite toilette spray, I we found the spray with much larger containers and a lower price than anywhere we have have be enable to find .</li>
            <li> even the top and scent were different.</li>
            <li> Thanks for everything!</li>
            <li> It smells exactly like Chanel Allure as we know all the Perry Ellis line smells like some well known brand.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is very masculine, and smells slightly sweet, and musky.</li>
            <li> Amazing cologne, sharp projection.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s close but far from the original.</li>
            <li> I love the soft yet masculine scent of this perry ellis eau de toilette.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a bit sexy, but still good for any casual occasion</li>
            <li> masculine but sweet scent  </li>
            <li> On the left is the ORIGINAL on the right</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great fragrance which draws a direct parallel to Allure Homme by Chanel, which costs 3x-4x as much for the same size.  </li>
            <li> The scent is very close</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Really, somebody swiped it.  </li>
            <li> It smells really really really close to it.</li>
            <li> And for the price you really can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> I knocked one star off because it reminds me too much of La Nuit De L&#x27;homme by YSL, which i already have in my collection.</li>
            <li> It has a very sensual smell.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!  </li>
            <li> just plain nice.  </li>
            <li> but DEFINITELY NOT  the original &amp;#34;M&amp;#34; scent nor packaging</li>
            <li> Not a romantic smell to me...but a clean soapy smell...Could be worn by woman too..</li>
            <li> Versatility: 7/10 (Formal/ informal...spring, fall, winter, possibly summer on a cool day)  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this cologne for any type of occasion.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like fruity colognes and this has a soft subtle fragrance that always gets comments about how good I smell.</li>
            <li> , smelled the same, but those air bubble where well worth.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok and the shipping was pretty slow but got the item thxs</li>
            <li> I live in the Caribbean and took a risk at purchasing a perfume online for my husband.</li>
            <li> BUT FAR FROM LONG LASTING ON THE BODY AS THE ORIGINAL.</li>
            <li> To me this is great for the evening or formal wear during the cold weather.</li>
            <li> this is far I wo recommend 360 not this</li>
            <li> I think its a professional fragrance for the office and the women I know seem to like it as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too strong and harsh like Axe Spray, but rather more subtle and inviting.</li>
            <li> Item I received bottle is not original for I have used this item before, the items original case is a metal container, this one arrived in a cardboard container look alike.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is up to you to take this risk but it just not have the same &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; as Allure Homme that other reviewers have suggested and does not seem like the original product.</li>
            <li> This fragrance came up as highly rated for a low cost</li>
            <li> When purchasing this particular item, the item may be an old item fragrance is dull, item is in a fabricated carton and will not be in original container.</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s no other man&#x27;s colonge I would prefer to use than Perry Ellis M.</li>
            <li> My husband, wears burberry, and It&#x27;s too expensive, to have the two of them, using one bottle, and my son wanted his own cologne.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that i have a very hard time finding it any more</li>
            <li> I own a few more expensive scents but for everyday wear</li>
            <li> It really does smell like a much more expensive and sheik fragrance!</li>
            <li> But the notes settle down and become much smoother.</li>
            <li> Fresh but not crisp or sharp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda light though, projection might be weak.</li>
            <li> It smells alright, does not seem to last long; I blind bought it due to good reviews and similarities to Allure Homme.</li>
            <li> Might be a little too much for work, but definitely works for date night.</li>
            <li> Killer smell, last all day long.</li>
            <li> Drys down soft spicy.</li>
            <li> Its one of those scents that work with your body long after youve put it on until you wash it off in the shower.</li>
            <li> I had to trash it because there was a long hair floating in the juice even to</li>
            <li> After using my christmass vacations popping every single one of them without sleeping or eating</li>
            <li> Powdery, casual, sweet but still manly.</li>
            <li> it did not last enough sadly enough ,  and the projection is weak .</li>
            <li> CAREFUL----</li>
            <li> Not really a grown man</li>
            <li> Too many reviews made me feel this one is &amp;#34;Good&amp;#34;,  Disappointed ..</li>
            <li> Have tried other colognes didn&#x27;t like them.</li>
            <li> I think this makes the smell last even longer, usually 12 hours</li>
            <li> It opens with a sharp lemon smell...</li>
            <li> Opening is a little harsh, especially if you overspray.</li>
            <li> what arrived was a dark brown)</li>
            <li> Sweetens as it wears down.</li>
            <li> Longevity is a little weaker than the other fragrances I&#x27;ve used, 4-6 hours.</li>
            <li> It does seem to go away about half way though the day.</li>
            <li> Even in the Fragrance Community this is known as a hidden gem.</li>
            <li> All in all I definitely recommend this for a sweeter masculine cologne for nights out or cold winter days.</li>
            <li> I dress my son, like a little man every day.</li>
            <li> Another issue is that this one is a little iffy around someone with allergies.</li>
            <li> only thing worse than this is the BLACK.</li>
            <li> I found this fragrance a few years ago when a saleswoman at a Perfume Store suggested it to me.  </li>
            <li> I have a few scents that I wear.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I am not sure if this is the correct/current product, I am skeptical like the same reviewer here:</li>
            <li> I like the smell not love</li>
            <li> But even though I like it not sure that I&#x27;d buy it again....</li>
            <li> Definitely a winter, cold weather fragrance.</li>
            <li> I am just tired of spending $80 for colognes like Yves Saint Laurent, Gucci, etc.so</li>
            <li> Sorry Perry Ellis</li>
            <li> I was not happy!</li>
            <li> Hey everyone I just what to let everybody know that this Cologne smells like Gucci guilty</li>
            <li> it stinks so bad</li>
            <li> However, it smells really bad</li>
            <li> Terrible perfume.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Too many reviews made me feel this one is &amp;#34;Good&amp;#34;,  Disappointed ..</li>
            <li> While Perry Ellis is not that well known compared to a lot of colognes they seem to make a quality product.</li>
            <li> Starts off pungent and strong. Drys down soft spicy.</li>
            <li> The best cologne I have ever used.  Its AWESOME!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too strong and harsh like Axe Spray, but rather more subtle and inviting. Chicks love this scent, apparently. They kept coming in closer to sniff it--isn&#x27;t that the purpose, after all?</li>
            <li> This is my favorite toilette spray, I we found the spray with much larger containers and a lower price than anywhere we have have be enable to find .</li>
            <li> VERY QUICK DELIVERY! THANK YOU&lt;br /&gt;Pretty good fragrance, very good projection for the first hour (still good after the initial hour, no worries). Powdery, casual, sweet but still manly. Give it a try guys</li>
            <li> A rich and sumptuous cologne that reminds many of Chanel&#x27;s Allure, quite an accomplishment for a cologne in the $20 range. To me this is great for the evening or formal wear during the cold weather. Very elegant and classy, a very good buy.</li>
            <li> For the money, this stuff is fantastic! It does seem to go away about half way though the day. Worth the buy!</li>
            <li> Smells great on him. Have tried other colognes didn&#x27;t like them. Came back to Perry Ellis. Would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I live in the Caribbean and took a risk at purchasing a perfume online for my husband. After reading through many reviews I settled on this one. Although we have Perry Ellis we&#x27;ve never seen this one. Even going to our retailers, they&#x27;ve never seen it. We&#x27;re satisfied with the purchase. No complaints. It can be used for any occasion because it&#x27;s not overpowering but more intimate.</li>
            <li> Good scent I like white better ,but good for price</li>
            <li> This is definitely sexiness in a bottle! It&#x27;s a beautiful, but masculine scent at the same time. Guys, or ladies, this is a fragrance to buy! Perry Ellis, you have really done a great job with this cologne!</li>
            <li> CAREFUL---- When purchasing this particular item, the item may be an old item fragrance is dull, item is in a fabricated carton and will not be in original container. Item I received bottle is not original for I have used this item before, the items original case is a metal container, this one arrived in a cardboard container look alike. As i removed the bottle, it too was different in shape, color (original is burgundy what arrived was a dark brown) even the top and scent were different. The scent is very close but DEFINITELY NOT  the original &amp;#34;M&amp;#34; scent nor packaging it&#x27;s close but far from the original. I have waited over 2 weeks to be sure of the scent before writing review. REMEMBER CLOSE BUT NOT THE ORIGINAL, SCENT IS CLOSE BUT FAR FROM LONG LASTING ON THE BODY AS THE ORIGINAL. If it was to be the original the bottles tops should be interchangeable which this is not.  On the left is the ORIGINAL on the right is the one purchased VIA Amazon.</li>
            <li> I found this fragrance a few years ago when a saleswoman at a Perfume Store suggested it to me.  I told her that I had been wearing PS by Paul Sebastian and Obsession for years but wanted something similar.  I don&#x27;t like fruity colognes and this has a soft subtle fragrance that always gets comments about how good I smell.</li>
            <li> first off, anybody purchasing this fragrance for 20-30$ USD for a 3.4 oz. should be grateful and smiling on their good fortune.  It&#x27;s a great fragrance which draws a direct parallel to Allure Homme by Chanel, which costs 3x-4x as much for the same size.  Simply put, it&#x27;s an awesome night-wear cologne for special occasions, clubbing, romantic encounters, etc.... and it totally rocks (though I&#x27;d say it works best for mature guys 30+ in age).  I love this stuff.  I only have the 0.25oz. edt spray, but definitely ordering a bigger size soon.</li>
            <li> A different scent. Not the Perry Ellis that I am accustomed to.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing cologne! He&#x27;s a very inviting scent that I just love on my husband. I would recommend this to any guy.</li>
            <li> Came on a box with thousands, millions, billions of air bubbles. After using my christmass vacations popping every single one of them without sleeping or eating i remembered i&#x27;d bought a fragrance and tried it, smelled the same, but those air bubble where well worth. 10/10 would pop again.</li>
            <li> This scent is of delicious chocolate,  love..love!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the same as the Perry Ellis I have bought before. More of an Evening cologne.</li>
            <li> Clean like freshly laundered cotton. Fresh but not crisp or sharp. Has a very calming, soothing, clean smell that is also gentle. I bought another one almost immediately.</li>
            <li> I love the soft yet masculine scent of this perry ellis eau de toilette. My wife loves the scent on me as well. Its one of those scents that work with your body long after youve put it on until you wash it off in the shower.</li>
            <li> My first impressions about the perfume is that It smells absolutely fantastic and the bottle has a gorgeous look that adds charm to it. Package delivered on time. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Stuck on 360 for men and women this is far I wo recommend 360 not this</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this cologne for 10 years.  Most people don&#x27;t even know what it is, but when they smell it on me I almost always get complimented on how amazing it smells.</li>
            <li> I have a few scents that I wear.  This one has been a go-to for many years.  Works for both day and night.  I think its a professional fragrance for the office and the women I know seem to like it as well.</li>
            <li> Terrible perfume. I took it to work to use as a bathroom &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34;air eliminator.</li>
            <li> One of the very best for PE. This is truly a gentlemen in a bottle. Great for going out, or on a date.</li>
            <li> It smells alright, does not seem to last long; I blind bought it due to good reviews and similarities to Allure Homme. The item I received has a &amp;#34;not for individual sale&amp;#34; sticker on the side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if this is the correct/current product, I am skeptical like the same reviewer here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HM35CPB14C5O/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rdp_perm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is up to you to take this risk but it just not have the same &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; as Allure Homme that other reviewers have suggested and does not seem like the original product.</li>
            <li> I dress my son, like a little man every day. He loves to wear ties and khaki&#x27;s. To look just like his dad. and tops off with cologne. My husband, wears burberry, and It&#x27;s too expensive, to have the two of them, using one bottle, and my son wanted his own cologne. I purchased CUBA, AND NAUTICA, and it disappeared, out our house. Really, somebody swiped it.  Friends of nephew or something. I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So purchased, this after they were banned,from our house. The fragrance is very masculine, and smells slightly sweet, and musky. But not overpowering. My son&#x27; loves it. He says it smells delicious. And his teachers and classmates love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is perfect for a young boy or teenager. Not really a grown man, it&#x27;s not what&#x27;s in style. Light and clean are what&#x27;s in for adult males.  But nice starter, and good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I DO NOT SPRAY ON HIS SKIN. ONLY HIS UNDERSHIRTS or Topshirts( ON THE BACK). 4-5 pulses. I think this makes the smell last even longer, usually 12 hours</li>
            <li> I ordered this cologne as a father&#x27;s day gift. It was packaged well, received before the delivery date which was great since the person I ordered it for gave me a hint that he wanted it for father&#x27;s day. He liked the Perry Ellis 360 cologne but hadn&#x27;t tried this one before. Upon trying the cologne he liked the way the cologne smelled so I will give it five stars. It&#x27;s 3.4oz and you get it for a great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving it the one star because it was delivered in a timely manner. However, it smells really bad I thought I was ordering Perry Ellis Man so it is my fault. It&#x27;s amazing how different they smell very musty and strong. Sorry Perry Ellis but I had to be candid.</li>
            <li> a gift for my father... he loves it</li>
            <li> One of my favorite fragances, I use it for special occasions, the girls loves it.</li>
            <li> Yes it is the best I have ever had, the reason I guess, and I have to be honest is that the ladies just love the way it smells on me! Thanks for everything!</li>
            <li> It smells great, it has a high end feeling to it even though it&#x27;s cheap. It&#x27;s kinda light though, projection might be weak. But overall it&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
            <li> Guys stop spending 100 plus on channel allure and pick this up!!! Now! It smells really really really close to it. I did a side by side test and the m is right on the money. And for the price you really can&#x27;t beat it. Pick this up you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I get so many good compliments at school and when i go out to party since i started to use this perry Ellis cologne definitely buying again after i run out.</li>
            <li> It has very mild scent and this allows for it not to be over-bearing.  I would highly recommend this cologne for any type of occasion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and there&#x27;s no other man&#x27;s colonge I would prefer to use than Perry Ellis M.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t quite like the opening, but after 15 minutes in it&#x27;s really lovely. It&#x27;s also a bit sexy, but still good for any casual occasion</li>
            <li> Simply amazing! This one is my favorite. I recommend it to anyone, you are going to love it a lot.</li>
            <li> This is a suave perfume for night .not for day run</li>
            <li> This is a great scent, I got this great product because of a guy on YouTube called coachrob619. He called this a believe the hype Cologne and he is right. If you do buy this go ob YouTube and search Perry Ellis M and get a full review on this great cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also make sure you get a 100% real one buy retail If you can and If you buy online make sure you see the code on the bottom.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok to me i little to strong for but still smells good mature women like the way it smells on me.</li>
            <li> I am just tired of spending $80 for colognes like Yves Saint Laurent, Gucci, etc.so I asked the Google for low cost alternatives.  This fragrance came up as highly rated for a low cost so I ordered it.  The reviews were right!  It has a very nice scent - not perfumey - more toward musky - just plain nice.  I wear it daily and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> No matter how many times I tried to leave a review, Amazon.com didn&#x27;t allow it. am gonna try again. It smelled very pleasant but guess what? I had to trash it because there was a long hair floating in the juice even to it was sealed properly. I was not happy!</li>
            <li> smell great,huele riquisimo de los mejores perfumes,me encanta!!!!ademas el precio esta bueno,aunque si le bajaran un poco mas estaria mejor,recomiendo mucho este perfume el olor es sino el mejor de perry ellis de los mejores,esta sera una de mis favoritas...</li>
            <li> Nice, cheaper fragrance. Opening is a little harsh, especially if you overspray. But the notes settle down and become much smoother. Spicy top, sweet bottom. Reminds me of a spice cabinet in a bakery with the cinnamon and vanilla. Maybe with a hint of Christmas-time candy. Sweetens as it wears down. Definitely a winter, cold weather fragrance. Longevity is a little weaker than the other fragrances I&#x27;ve used, 4-6 hours. Another issue is that this one is a little iffy around someone with allergies. Otherwise, great aromatic scent for work or formal occasions.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend and he loved it. I too have some perry Ellis perfumes and they all smell great. Great price, came on time, and was as described.</li>
            <li> Smells great and the price is very good. My husband has requested this for Christmas for the last several years. It&#x27;s not sold in stores in my regional area, so I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m able to order it for him online.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my hubbie for v-day...I like the smell not love but like it....It opens with a sharp lemon smell...drys down to a cool refreshing clean scent,,with a light touch of sweetness...a bit too sweet for me...Not a romantic smell to me...but a clean soapy smell...Could be worn by woman too..Good price for the size and scent...But even though I like it not sure that I&#x27;d buy it again....looking for a cologne that makes you want to move in close for another smell.... and this just didnt do it for me...</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift. The packaging was good. I did not smell it because it was for someone. i&#x27;ll know when they put it on</li>
            <li> Killer smell, last all day long. Projection monster.  Quality juice for the price.</li>
            <li> Great longlasting smell</li>
            <li> Good product. I love to smell good and this one is very good. I buy alot of Perry Ellis products and&lt;br /&gt;I am never disapointed.</li>
            <li> This is a great fragrance and especially for the price. I own a few more expensive scents but for everyday wear this is great. Even in the Fragrance Community this is known as a hidden gem. Most so called Fragrance &amp;#34;Snobs&amp;#34; give this one high praise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s scent reminds me of a cinnamon sugar cookie so it&#x27;s a sweet one. Very sexy too. I highly recommend trying it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, very good fragrance, I am very happy with the purchase and the price is pretty good.In my next purchase I&#x27;ll have in mind.</li>
            <li> Nice aroma, really good</li>
            <li> I just dont like it. very strong smell. only thing worse than this is the BLACK. they should take that off the site it stinks so bad</li>
            <li> The order arrived on time, smells good! The downside is that it is not impregnated or clothes on the skin either, looks like it&#x27;s diluted ...</li>
            <li> I love this product Ive been using it for many years.The only problem is that i have a very hard time finding it any more</li>
            <li> I knocked one star off because it reminds me too much of La Nuit De L&#x27;homme by YSL, which i already have in my collection. If you don&#x27;t have L&#x27;homme then by all means pick this up. It&#x27;s a sweet scent that pleases most who smell you.</li>
            <li> It has a very sensual smell. Makes you wear it all the time.</li>
            <li> Amazing cologne, sharp projection. Might be a little too much for work, but definitely works for date night. It smells exactly like Chanel Allure as we know all the Perry Ellis line smells like some well known brand. All in all I definitely recommend this for a sweeter masculine cologne for nights out or cold winter days.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift for a friend -- they loved it. It smells really good@</li>
            <li> Hey everyone I just what to let everybody know that this Cologne smells like Gucci guilty it&#x27;s ok but oh we&#x27;ll i like it it&#x27;s ok and the shipping was pretty slow but got the item thxs</li>
            <li> cinnamon  warm spicy  vanilla  woody  masculine but sweet scent  Sort of smells like cookies  Longevity: 4/10 (4+ hours)  Projection: 5/10  Versatility: 7/10 (Formal/ informal...spring, fall, winter, possibly summer on a cool day)  Smell: 9/10 (Sweet, woodsy, and done right!)    Although i really enjoy the scent it might of just been my bottle for me it did not last enough sadly enough ,  and the projection is weak .</li>
            <li> Perry Ellis M for MEN is a very affordable nice smelling cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good price at around $20 for a 3.4oz Bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Strong Masculine/sweet smell.&lt;br /&gt;Lasting power at around 3-5 hrs.&lt;br /&gt;Fast Shipping from Amazon !!!&lt;br /&gt;A must buy for cologne collectors, or any1 who wants a nice cologne at a cheap price.</li>
            <li> I just got this last night, so it arrived quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very nice, sophisticated, sort of softly spicy type fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This smells like a much more classy and sophisticated fragrance than the $20 I paid for it.  + free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t beat it.  Highly recommend!  It really does smell like a much more expensive and sheik fragrance!</li>
            <li> Smells soo good! Quality juice at a bargain price.</li>
            <li> This smells like candles.  I dont recomend this at all.</li>
            <li> Very sweet and light aroma. For 20 dollars this is a good every day perfume.</li>
            <li> muy exquisito y la presentaci&amp;oacute;n es fenomenal, lo recomiendo para toda ocasion 100% recomendado tanto para dama como caballero de seguro le va a gustar</li>
            <li> smells good I will order again.</li>
            <li> excellent product recommend</li>
