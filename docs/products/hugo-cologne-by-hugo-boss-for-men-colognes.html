            <li>Other than that, an excellent cologne.</li>
            <li>Fragrance Hugo Boss original for the most part.</li>
            <li>This has a clean non musky scent, more like an ocean breeze.</li>
            <li>It has a spicy clean scent that lasts most of the day.</li>
            <li>Easy to wear.</li>
            <li>What great top and middle notes!</li>
            <li>but I found it to smell of a strong cedar tree.</li>
            <li>All is fine...</li>
            <li>It smells fine to us after he puts it on which is a plus.</li>
            <li>just what i expected, is get on time and is just beautiful and original botton line i love it</li>
            <li>When you are working, you want something light.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth its price, in fact much more.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this cologne.</li>
            <li>This is a cheap price for a mid-grade/cheap cologne.</li>
            <li>and I REALLY enjoy the smell it leaves on me.</li>
            <li>I liked a lot this product, Thanks for all and for a faster shippment.</li>
            <li>The ladies love this smell and the price is just right.</li>
            <li>Genuine packaging and the original perfume..</li>
            <li>Good smell, looks great, backage and bottle is exactly like original but some times i think that is not the original, when you use it smells great, but few hours later you dont smels nothing, even on your clothes</li>
            <li>It came in the original box and sealed.</li>
            <li>The women also enjoy being around me because of the sweet scent of this perfume.</li>
            <li>It came in its original box.</li>
            <li>This is not an original item.</li>
            <li>This is first time I tried Hugo Boss, I liked it very much.</li>
            <li>To be perfectly honest, I am completely blown away!</li>
            <li>Specially my wife.</li>
            <li>This smell reminds me of a bright sunny Autumn day in the mountains with a cool breeze and all the different colors of the trees.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good quality  same as in the picture  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why all the comment threads on cologne on Amazon are full of accusations of the product being counterfeit.</li>
            <li>I bought it as a present for my husband and he simply loved it.....</li>
            <li>Occasionally, I&#x27;ll get the &#x27;mmm... you smell good&#x27; comment,</li>
            <li>The item description said this item was to be boss cologne which I really wanted and was very excited to order for my husbands birthday.  </li>
            <li>it smell, so clean, fresh</li>
            <li>Smells fresh and clean, husband loves it.  </li>
            <li>I love it, and everyone that comes in contact with me seems to love it as well (especially the ladies).</li>
            <li>... check the products they sell to unsuspecting consumers and loyal ..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s NOT  knock off, it&#x27;s very genuine, smell is long lasting and even packaging is great.</li>
            <li>A long time favorite; light and unique.</li>
            <li>It has a nice musky smooth smell but not to rough.</li>
            <li>I would strongly suggest this for a normal daily use (sicne its very cheap) and Acqa di gio for special occasions.</li>
            <li>, he is pretty lucky with women</li>
            <li>It has a very clean feeling to it and stays on long for easy four to five hours.</li>
            <li>price is right.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a sweet, classy scent, and I haven&#x27;t met a lady yet who didn&#x27;t enjoy it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the real deal I just don&#x27;t like the sweet musky smell.</li>
            <li>Also package was wrapped the right way and showed up very fast.</li>
            <li>I got this for my husband and he likes it very much and wears it every day.</li>
            <li>This is a light scent, clean, not too sweet and not much spice.  </li>
            <li>This was the first time I used Hugo.</li>
            <li>Most definitely recommend for others to purchase.</li>
            <li>This is not the real product!  </li>
            <li>The smell does not last more than 3 minutes.  </li>
            <li>thank you so much for your atention on time all!</li>
            <li>This has been my significant other&#x27;s favorite cologne for years and years.  </li>
            <li>Seems to last most of the day.</li>
            <li>The delivery was fast, too!</li>
            <li>first i didnt like the smell because it almost hurt my nose, so I didnt use it for a while.</li>
            <li>my shirt from the first spray</li>
            <li>This is my first cologne I have ever bought</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if anyone might need to know (if anyone else is a first time buyer)</li>
            <li>Try it first.</li>
            <li>I bought this because it was on the top ten colognes for men on some site i went too on google.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing this cologne for years and it never fails to please.  </li>
            <li>If people can smell you from more than about 2-3 feet, you&#x27;ve abused your cologne and should give to someone who knows how to properly wear it, i.e. me.  </li>
            <li>bottle I bought here seems to be the same as what I used to buy at Macy&#x27;s for a lot more money.  </li>
            <li>What is pictured isn&#x27;t exactly how it looks when you receive it</li>
            <li>Warning: you dont need a lot of sprays for this, a few well placed squirts around the neck and the wrists and your good to go.</li>
            <li>, I use it to dialy to go work, it is very soft and pleasant of aroma, I recommend it, their aroma pleases to other people and overalls to the women.</li>
            <li>Well I was actually expecting a potent scent, but apparently this is not that strong.</li>
            <li>Based on the positive reviews, I decided to pick up some Hugo Boss for the first time.</li>
            <li>shipped fast.</li>
            <li>It was the real thing not some knock off.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>It is the real thing.</li>
            <li>and I was very upset by the error.</li>
            <li>The price matched my needs and the shipping process was fast.</li>
            <li>This product is very well.</li>
            <li>, thanks for all.</li>
            <li>Thanks amazon</li>
            <li>The scent is long lasting and starts smelling more sweet with time.  </li>
            <li>but i really like this Hugo Boss Cologne</li>
            <li>I like it but perfumes are very subjective.  </li>
            <li>the smells gone fast</li>
            <li>Hahaha...</li>
            <li>i want other more q</li>
            <li>It works like a charm, and does not overpower the nose like many Axe sprays or other spray deodorants.</li>
            <li>Forgot how much I and others liked this stuff...nice and  light..  a little musky.... but earthy.... have already had numerous compliments... some from complete strangers...</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have used this product since I was in Jr. High</li>
            <li>I have used Hugo before and really like the smell and that it lasts longer than most products I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>since the day i have bought it almost everyday he wears Hugoboss and evryday asks me to get another one saying i love it....</li>
            <li>So happy to find it here - getting tough to find in local stores.</li>
            <li>would definitely reccommend this, but if you do not like it at first I would definitly suggest that try it again</li>
            <li>So what I received was exactly what I wanted; and I found this large bottle cheaper here on Amazon then the other websites I visited.</li>
            <li>My other fave was Cool Water</li>
            <li>He works next door to a perfume shop is a fragrance maven, he says this is the real thing.  </li>
            <li>We purchased this directly through Amazon (NOT a reseller) and received the legit product.  </li>
            <li>Even many of the expensive colognes have an obvious cheap alcohol smell but not this one.  </li>
            <li>you should be able to get at least 1-2 years of use out of this one bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The most common description I hear is that I smell &amp;#34;delicious.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>the only downside is it doesn&#x27;t seem to last more than a few hours.</li>
            <li>but I live outside of USA ....</li>
            <li>.. check the old container that had saved and compared it with the new and not have the same label so do not hesitate to qualify as an imitation even though on the outside box is very well-made and even says made ​​in the UK ...</li>
            <li>Buy this mens spray and you will be at the top of your game.</li>
            <li>I really will by with you other product.</li>
            <li>3.3oz is apparently a lot bigger than I thought.</li>
            <li>When I read that the first note was green apple, I knew that&#x27;s what I smelled</li>
            <li>The only complaint is that now I wear a little more than when I bought it at twice the price.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This Cologne has always been a favorite of mine, it has a great smell, it lasts a long time and ladies love it!</li>
            <li> Other than that, an excellent cologne.</li>
            <li> Fragrance Hugo Boss original for the most part.</li>
            <li> This has a clean non musky scent, more like an ocean breeze.</li>
            <li> It has a spicy clean scent that lasts most of the day.</li>
            <li> Easy to wear.</li>
            <li> What great top and middle notes!</li>
            <li> but I found it to smell of a strong cedar tree.</li>
            <li> All is fine...</li>
            <li> It smells fine to us after he puts it on which is a plus.</li>
            <li> just what i expected, is get on time and is just beautiful and original botton line i love it</li>
            <li> When you are working, you want something light.  </li>
            <li> Totally worth its price, in fact much more.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this cologne.</li>
            <li> This is a cheap price for a mid-grade/cheap cologne.</li>
            <li> and I REALLY enjoy the smell it leaves on me.</li>
            <li> I liked a lot this product, Thanks for all and for a faster shippment.</li>
            <li> The ladies love this smell and the price is just right.</li>
            <li> Genuine packaging and the original perfume..</li>
            <li> Good smell, looks great, backage and bottle is exactly like original but some times i think that is not the original, when you use it smells great, but few hours later you dont smels nothing, even on your clothes</li>
            <li> It came in the original box and sealed.</li>
            <li> The women also enjoy being around me because of the sweet scent of this perfume.</li>
            <li> It came in its original box.</li>
            <li> This is not an original item.</li>
            <li> This is first time I tried Hugo Boss, I liked it very much.</li>
            <li> To be perfectly honest, I am completely blown away!</li>
            <li> Specially my wife.</li>
            <li> This smell reminds me of a bright sunny Autumn day in the mountains with a cool breeze and all the different colors of the trees.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good quality  same as in the picture  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why all the comment threads on cologne on Amazon are full of accusations of the product being counterfeit.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a present for my husband and he simply loved it.....</li>
            <li> Occasionally, I&#x27;ll get the &#x27;mmm... you smell good&#x27; comment,</li>
            <li> The item description said this item was to be boss cologne which I really wanted and was very excited to order for my husbands birthday.  </li>
            <li> it smell, so clean, fresh</li>
            <li> Smells fresh and clean, husband loves it.  </li>
            <li> I love it, and everyone that comes in contact with me seems to love it as well (especially the ladies).</li>
            <li> ... check the products they sell to unsuspecting consumers and loyal ..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s NOT  knock off, it&#x27;s very genuine, smell is long lasting and even packaging is great.</li>
            <li> A long time favorite; light and unique.</li>
            <li> It has a nice musky smooth smell but not to rough.</li>
            <li> I would strongly suggest this for a normal daily use (sicne its very cheap) and Acqa di gio for special occasions.</li>
            <li> , he is pretty lucky with women</li>
            <li> It has a very clean feeling to it and stays on long for easy four to five hours.</li>
            <li> price is right.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sweet, classy scent, and I haven&#x27;t met a lady yet who didn&#x27;t enjoy it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real deal I just don&#x27;t like the sweet musky smell.</li>
            <li> Also package was wrapped the right way and showed up very fast.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband and he likes it very much and wears it every day.</li>
            <li> This is a light scent, clean, not too sweet and not much spice.  </li>
            <li> This was the first time I used Hugo.</li>
            <li> Most definitely recommend for others to purchase.</li>
            <li> This is not the real product!  </li>
            <li> The smell does not last more than 3 minutes.  </li>
            <li> thank you so much for your atention on time all!</li>
            <li> This has been my significant other&#x27;s favorite cologne for years and years.  </li>
            <li> Seems to last most of the day.</li>
            <li> The delivery was fast, too!</li>
            <li> first i didnt like the smell because it almost hurt my nose, so I didnt use it for a while.</li>
            <li> my shirt from the first spray</li>
            <li> This is my first cologne I have ever bought</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if anyone might need to know (if anyone else is a first time buyer)</li>
            <li> Try it first.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was on the top ten colognes for men on some site i went too on google.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this cologne for years and it never fails to please.  </li>
            <li> If people can smell you from more than about 2-3 feet, you&#x27;ve abused your cologne and should give to someone who knows how to properly wear it, i.e. me.  </li>
            <li> bottle I bought here seems to be the same as what I used to buy at Macy&#x27;s for a lot more money.  </li>
            <li> What is pictured isn&#x27;t exactly how it looks when you receive it</li>
            <li> Warning: you dont need a lot of sprays for this, a few well placed squirts around the neck and the wrists and your good to go.</li>
            <li> , I use it to dialy to go work, it is very soft and pleasant of aroma, I recommend it, their aroma pleases to other people and overalls to the women.</li>
            <li> Well I was actually expecting a potent scent, but apparently this is not that strong.</li>
            <li> Based on the positive reviews, I decided to pick up some Hugo Boss for the first time.</li>
            <li> shipped fast.</li>
            <li> It was the real thing not some knock off.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> It is the real thing.</li>
            <li> and I was very upset by the error.</li>
            <li> The price matched my needs and the shipping process was fast.</li>
            <li> This product is very well.</li>
            <li> , thanks for all.</li>
            <li> Thanks amazon</li>
            <li> The scent is long lasting and starts smelling more sweet with time.  </li>
            <li> but i really like this Hugo Boss Cologne</li>
            <li> I like it but perfumes are very subjective.  </li>
            <li> the smells gone fast</li>
            <li> Hahaha...</li>
            <li> i want other more q</li>
            <li> It works like a charm, and does not overpower the nose like many Axe sprays or other spray deodorants.</li>
            <li> Forgot how much I and others liked this stuff...nice and  light..  a little musky.... but earthy.... have already had numerous compliments... some from complete strangers...</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product since I was in Jr. High</li>
            <li> I have used Hugo before and really like the smell and that it lasts longer than most products I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> since the day i have bought it almost everyday he wears Hugoboss and evryday asks me to get another one saying i love it....</li>
            <li> So happy to find it here - getting tough to find in local stores.</li>
            <li> would definitely reccommend this, but if you do not like it at first I would definitly suggest that try it again</li>
            <li> So what I received was exactly what I wanted; and I found this large bottle cheaper here on Amazon then the other websites I visited.</li>
            <li> My other fave was Cool Water</li>
            <li> He works next door to a perfume shop is a fragrance maven, he says this is the real thing.  </li>
            <li> We purchased this directly through Amazon (NOT a reseller) and received the legit product.  </li>
            <li> Even many of the expensive colognes have an obvious cheap alcohol smell but not this one.  </li>
            <li> you should be able to get at least 1-2 years of use out of this one bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The most common description I hear is that I smell &amp;#34;delicious.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> the only downside is it doesn&#x27;t seem to last more than a few hours.</li>
            <li> but I live outside of USA ....</li>
            <li> .. check the old container that had saved and compared it with the new and not have the same label so do not hesitate to qualify as an imitation even though on the outside box is very well-made and even says made ​​in the UK ...</li>
            <li> Buy this mens spray and you will be at the top of your game.</li>
            <li> I really will by with you other product.</li>
            <li> 3.3oz is apparently a lot bigger than I thought.</li>
            <li> When I read that the first note was green apple, I knew that&#x27;s what I smelled</li>
            <li> The only complaint is that now I wear a little more than when I bought it at twice the price.</li>
            <li> It has a sweet scent and is not too overpowering nor weak.</li>
            <li> Would have to reapply again in the evening if you wanted the smell to last all day long</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because a lot of reviewers here said it was good.</li>
            <li> What a major let down.</li>
            <li> never really got a chance to wear it ,box was damage with the product before i could open it ...</li>
            <li> It is long lasting and has a piney yet slightly citrus musky smell that will remind you of being in a deep mossy forest.  </li>
            <li> But Amazon will ship you an inferior product all day long!  </li>
            <li> and I was VERY confused because it smelled a lot better after I let the cologne bottle sit for a few days on my shelf.</li>
            <li> (I believe a previous buyer uploaded a picture of what it actually looks like); but it is the Hugo by Hugo Boss.</li>
            <li> Since it came it just wasn&#x27;t what he expected.</li>
            <li> ( i guess i had to let it sit for a few days in order to actually like it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As with all colognes, it fades somewhat after application, but that doesn&#x27;t give you license to empty the bottle in your pants in the morning.  </li>
            <li> But the dry down on my skin leaves a cloying musky smell.</li>
            <li> I usually wear it during the day before I go to work since it will last a about 6-8 hours.</li>
            <li> just i want and expected!</li>
            <li> Contrary to other reviews, he has not noticed any change in the product&#x27;s scent or strength.  </li>
            <li> The price can&#x27;t be beat and after checking various online options (like Sephora), I was not able to find the legitimate product for a lower price.</li>
            <li> Also, I sprayed some on my pillow for a longevity test when  I first bought it (weird</li>
            <li> There were no packaging anomalies as noted by other reviewers, and I don&#x27;t think this is a knock-off from Istanbul, China, etc.  </li>
            <li> Target sells it for twice the price and half the size.</li>
            <li> This version smells like alcohol and doesn&#x27;t resemble my previous purchases.</li>
            <li> yes, but I wanted to test if it was one of those fake colognes that only last 10 mminutes)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a 2 day break from Hugo I decided to try it again, since I didnt want to think that i lost 30 dollars for nothing.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> My Hugo showed up missing a sprayer cap.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t have problems ordering from Amazon</li>
            <li> I have looked around in the past but haven&#x27;t found anything that came close.</li>
            <li> I received a small bottle of Hugo as a gift a couple years ago, and it lasted me ages, but I ran out.</li>
            <li> I am very hard to please when it comes to scents.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> Unfortunately when the item arrived it was the wrong cologne</li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with Hugo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This cologne is as fake as fake can be.</li>
            <li> Box is wrong.</li>
            <li> im sad because i wanted to know wht</li>
            <li> you cant go wrong with this one!</li>
            <li> Too bad.  </li>
            <li> Grrrr!</li>
            <li> This smells awful!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> very good this service and the product</li>
            <li> This was the first time I used Hugo. I really love it. I use it everyday. The price was good. You get a good size bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> shipped fast. It was the real thing not some knock off. Just some buying advice - If you are buying cologne online go to a store and smell it before you buy online. BTW this stuff smells great and my wife loves it</li>
            <li> I usually wear it during the day before I go to work since it will last a about 6-8 hours. Other than that, an excellent cologne. It was delivered on time and as promised. Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> excellent perfume, I use it to dialy to go work, it is very soft and pleasant of aroma, I recommend it, their aroma pleases to other people and overalls to the women.</li>
            <li> When you are working, you want something light.  This has a clean non musky scent, more like an ocean breeze.</li>
            <li> Excellent for day-to-day use. Totally worth its price, in fact much more. I would strongly suggest this for a normal daily use (sicne its very cheap) and Acqa di gio for special occasions.</li>
            <li> I get this often for my grown sons...they love it and so do their spouses.  It&#x27;s always a favorite.</li>
            <li> This cologne was just like the store at 1/2 the cost. It came in the original box and sealed. It is the real thing. I am so relieved that I can find it online at 1/2 the cost. The only complaint is that now I wear a little more than when I bought it at twice the price. I would recommend this seller to any one. I know I will be back. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Bought item in a deal, only for 33 bucks plus shipping.  Just love the scent of this lotion.  Girls love it.  Most definitely recommend for others to purchase.</li>
            <li> Well I was actually expecting a potent scent, but apparently this is not that strong. I am not happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this purchase. A great product for a great price,and what is better, It didn&#x27;t take much to get to me!</li>
            <li> excellent product I use regularly,gives a very good flavor, this is the best rate, 100% recommended for all users running amazon.com</li>
            <li> The item description said this item was to be boss cologne which I really wanted and was very excited to order for my husbands birthday.  Unfortunately when the item arrived it was the wrong cologne it was Hugo.  Everything in the description and the picture led me to believe I would be purchasing boss not Hugo.  So I guess I am stuck with this cologne unless I want the hassle of sending it back, which I don&#x27;t.  I usually don&#x27;t have problems ordering from Amazon but this one was specifically intended for a gift and I was very upset by the error.</li>
            <li> EL  ENVIO  FUE  MUY  RAPIDO,  Y  EL  PRODUCTO  EXCELENTE! !  LO  RECOMIENDO . FUE EXACTAMENTE LO QUE PEDI, GRACIAS SALUDOS  DESDE  CCS - VENEZUELA.</li>
            <li> i been rocking this scent since 96. i always get compliments on this fragrance. price is right. smell is better. i would recommend.</li>
            <li> This smell reminds me of a bright sunny Autumn day in the mountains with a cool breeze and all the different colors of the trees.&lt;br /&gt; Thats what it smells like!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of Hugo Boss! I have used it previously, my only concern was legitimacy. I found it perfectly legit and original. Smell lasts for more than 24 hours. What else you want.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m doing this review for my boyfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for him as a present, cause he was running out of his 5.0 ounce bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the 3.3oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THIS COLOGNE!!!!! I love the smell, aroma, whatever. It&#x27;s sexy!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want my Man to smell delicious!</li>
            <li> I have used Hugo before and really like the smell and that it lasts longer than most products I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I am very hard to please when it comes to scents. Others might love this but I found it to smell of a strong cedar tree. my suggestion would be find it in a store so you can smell it before you buy it.</li>
            <li> BUYER BEWARE!!!  This is not the real product!  The smell does not last more than 3 minutes.  I have used this product before and this one is not the same.  The packaging was a bit off too... It is a knock-off for sure.  I wish I could return it but Amazon doesn&#x27;t take returns on flammable substances.  But Amazon will ship you an inferior product all day long!  Please give me my money back!</li>
            <li> Women likes how I smell with this cologne. Specially my wife. So I use this for her. She loves how I smell.</li>
            <li> perfect everything it was good!! just i want and expected! thank you so much for your atention on time all!</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. The price matched my needs and the shipping process was fast. Fragrance Hugo Boss original for the most part.</li>
            <li> Every man must have this cologne! it smell, so clean, fresh, I&#x27;m in love with this cologne, buy it! you won&#x27;t regret!</li>
            <li> Good quality  same as in the picture  exactly what i need it , good price and deal .i like it</li>
            <li> This product is very well. Recomend. All is fine... i love it., thanks for all. i want other more q</li>
            <li> Forgot how much I and others liked this stuff...nice and  light..  a little musky.... but earthy.... have already had numerous compliments... some from complete strangers...</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband because he liked the one my son-in-law had. Since it came it just wasn&#x27;t what he expected. He won&#x27;t wear it so I&#x27;ll be passing it along to the grandson. That is if he likes.</li>
            <li> Ive had this fragrance several times before. I love it, and everyone that comes in contact with me seems to love it as well (especially the ladies). the only downside is it doesn&#x27;t seem to last more than a few hours.</li>
            <li> I literally just sprayed this Hugo Boss cologne and had to write a review. Based on the positive reviews, I decided to pick up some Hugo Boss for the first time. To be perfectly honest, I am completely blown away! I love the way it smells. It has a sweet scent and is not too overpowering nor weak. I am very confident that this will bring lots of compliments from the ladies. I encourage you to give Hugo Boss a shot. It definitely deserves 5 stars!</li>
            <li> This Cologne has always been a favorite of mine, it has a great smell, it lasts a long time and ladies love it!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume. The women also enjoy being around me because of the sweet scent of this perfume. I fully recommend it.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this cologne. It has a spicy clean scent that lasts most of the day. It came in its original box. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Smells fresh and clean, husband loves it.  He works next door to a perfume shop is a fragrance maven, he says this is the real thing.  I don&#x27;t know why all the comment threads on cologne on Amazon are full of accusations of the product being counterfeit.</li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with Hugo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has perfect smell, not to strong neither light. It has a very clean feeling to it and stays on long for easy four to five hours.</li>
            <li> Of course it smells good, its HUGO boss!!!! come on man. Yes I would recommend. Over and over and over again!</li>
            <li> You wear no cologne; you go home alone. I wore this stuff all the time back in the day and I still love it!</li>
            <li> i receive the item more than 2 weeks.. mm but i have it so nice :D&lt;br /&gt;the product is new&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> This has been my significant other&#x27;s favorite cologne for years and years.  We purchased this directly through Amazon (NOT a reseller) and received the legit product.  Contrary to other reviews, he has not noticed any change in the product&#x27;s scent or strength.  The price can&#x27;t be beat and after checking various online options (like Sephora), I was not able to find the legitimate product for a lower price.</li>
            <li> The box was opened and it was used. Didn&#x27;t smell the same as the one I got from Macys.</li>
            <li> It was upto the mark.. Made it in time.. Genuine packaging and the original perfume.. Had ordered as a gift for my husband who thoroughly enjoyed it! Thanks amazon</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume as a gift for someone and I didn&#x27;t regret it. The person says it&#x27;s one of the best perfume for men.</li>
            <li> the fragrance is not what I would buy in the future .. has a very different (not soothing) smell and keep in mind perfumes are very personal and this one is not for me</li>
            <li> I bought this for Christmas for my husband.. I actually asked one of my customers at work what he was wearing and he told me it was Hugo Boss... I love this smell. A very sexy but clean scent.  I would recommend this to any man. I will buy this every Christmas for my husband.</li>
            <li> No wonder this is Hugo Boss&#x27;s #1 seller.. so many notes in the fragrance makes it very unique. Quite a bit of citrus with a side of woods. Would definitely recommend to others.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a good daytime cologne this is it. It has a nice musky smooth smell but not to rough. Noticed allot of attention from the girls always getting complements on the cologne.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite cologne. I purchased it as a christmas gift. Amazon sells it at a great price!</li>
            <li> Takes me back to my senior prom</li>
            <li> This was the best deal I found for Hugo Boss. This is my sons&#x27; favorite, so it was a great gift at a good price.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for over 20 years and received many compliments on it. I have looked around in the past but haven&#x27;t found anything that came close. Now I just stick with it</li>
            <li> Excellent product and price. Target sells it for twice the price and half the size.</li>
            <li> It is the third time I buy a Hugo Boss fragrance and the perfume you like all 2 chances received was excellent and durable ... this time I received a fragrance Hugo Boss 3.3 Oz and the place feels the scent but the 3-5 minutes you perceived the fragrance disappears .. check the old container that had saved and compared it with the new and not have the same label so do not hesitate to qualify as an imitation even though on the outside box is very well-made and even says made ​​in the UK ... would return it if I could but I live outside of USA .... Beware of imitations Amazon ... check the products they sell to unsuspecting consumers and loyal ..</li>
            <li> After smelling many fragrances at the mall, I chose to go with this one.  Even many of the expensive colognes have an obvious cheap alcohol smell but not this one.  It is long lasting and has a piney yet slightly citrus musky smell that will remind you of being in a deep mossy forest.  The scent is long lasting and starts smelling more sweet with time.  I&#x27;m 24, and I would say its best for older men and ideal for evening use.</li>
            <li> This is a cheap price for a mid-grade/cheap cologne. I keep this in my glovebox. What else is there to say? Fair price, would buy again.</li>
            <li> I have used this product since I was in Jr. High it has served its purpose since then so I will probably not switch to a different one.</li>
            <li> Smells great; husband loves it. Easy to wear. Seems to last most of the day. Would have to reapply again in the evening if you wanted the smell to last all day long</li>
            <li> I question the authenticity of this cologne.  I have worn this scent for years and have always purchased it from the department store.  This version smells like alcohol and doesn&#x27;t resemble my previous purchases.</li>
            <li> This is not an original item. This cologne is as fake as fake can be. This smells awful!! Packaging was open! Box is wrong. This is a total rip off!&amp;#34;  Please refund my credit card.</li>
            <li> I love this! This makes for an ideal everyday/casual/back-up/ goto cologne. you cant go wrong with this one! Buy it!</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband and he likes it very much and wears it every day. Also, relatively affordable. The delivery was fast, too!</li>
            <li> It is excellent. I bought it as a present for my husband and he simply loved it..... since the day i have bought it almost everyday he wears Hugoboss and evryday asks me to get another one saying i love it....</li>
            <li> what a great price for this cologne and I am so glad I found it. Also package was wrapped the right way and showed up very fast.</li>
            <li> 5/5 Stars. I received a small bottle of Hugo as a gift a couple years ago, and it lasted me ages, but I ran out. I ordered this, and the bottle is huge! 3.3oz is apparently a lot bigger than I thought. If you use it only for dates, business, dinners, etc. you should be able to get at least 1-2 years of use out of this one bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness:&lt;br /&gt;Any time I wear Hugo when I go out or spend time around girls or women, I receive compliments on the scent. It works like a charm, and does not overpower the nose like many Axe sprays or other spray deodorants. It&#x27;s a sweet, classy scent, and I haven&#x27;t met a lady yet who didn&#x27;t enjoy it. The most common description I hear is that I smell &amp;#34;delicious.&amp;#34; Thank you, Hugo Boss!</li>
            <li> Excelente producto, cumple totalmente con el requerimiento, escelente entrega, buen negocio, muy agradecido.  Llego en buen estado y perfectas condiciones</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance on my husband. So happy to find it here - getting tough to find in local stores.</li>
            <li> the shipment arrived on time, the price was good and hugo boss is always OK&lt;br /&gt;this is where amazon shows its best value</li>
            <li> this cologne has went from \\&quot;eh\\&quot; to \\&quot;yuuuuuuum\\&quot; in the span of a couple of days&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;at first i didnt like the smell because it almost hurt my nose, so I didnt use it for a while. I was disappointed because a lot of reviewers here said it was good. Also, I sprayed some on my pillow for a longevity test when  I first bought it (weird yes, but I wanted to test if it was one of those fake colognes that only last 10 mminutes)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a 2 day break from Hugo I decided to try it again, since I didnt want to think that i lost 30 dollars for nothing. when i sprayed it again the smell was great and I was VERY confused because it smelled a lot better after I let the cologne bottle sit for a few days on my shelf. When I read that the first note was green apple, I knew that&#x27;s what I smelled like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The length of time this thing stays on you is crazu (I sprayed it on my pillow around 2 in the afternoon and could still smell it after I woke up) my shirt from the first spray I didnt like also retained the scent ( i guess i had to let it sit for a few days in order to actually like it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely reccommend this, but if you do not like it at first I would definitly suggest that try it again</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s and my favorite fragrance.  Love that I can order as difficult to find in stores.  LOVE!</li>
            <li> another great product.  if you want to turn some heads then this is one of the best ways to go.</li>
            <li> This is my first cologne I have ever bought and I REALLY enjoy the smell it leaves on me. I don&#x27;t know if anyone might need to know (if anyone else is a first time buyer) I spray once onto my shirt, and once onto the back of my neck and it works great.</li>
            <li> Justo lo que ofrecen. La descropcion concuerda con el producto recibido. Recomendado. Lo volver&amp;iacute;a a comprar. a a a a</li>
            <li> gracias buen producto me gusta la calidad y las cosas buenas se puede confiar en ellos recomendados a toda la comuinidad</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my dad for Christmas. He absolutely LOVED the scent! And what a great price! I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this cologne</li>
            <li> My son has been using Hugo for many years and it&#x27;s the only mens cologne that he will wear. It smells fine to us after he puts it on which is a plus.</li>
            <li> I was&#x27;n sure if I would buy this but i really like this Hugo Boss Cologne but is still a great one</li>
            <li> Used this product before and was very satisfied. It arrived promptly when I reordered and is all I expected.[[ASIN:B000R6TP7G Hugo by Hugo Boss For Men. Aftershave 3.4-Ounces]]</li>
            <li> really good product and just what i expected, is get on time and is just beautiful and original botton line i love it</li>
            <li> Muy desilusionada con el perfume, no dura nada el aroma, se aplica y en menos de 30 hr se pierde el perfume, no lo volver&amp;iacute;a a comprar</li>
            <li> never really got a chance to wear it ,box was damage with the product before i could open it ...im sad because i wanted to know wht it smelled like without the box smell taking over it</li>
            <li> Una excelente fragancia, muy fresca y se puede usar en toda ocasi&amp;oacute;n, el env&amp;iacute;o fue empacado muy bien y el estuche llego en perfecto estado.</li>
            <li> A long time favorite; light and unique.</li>
            <li> Perfect gift for my son as he wears this scent.  The price was better than what you can pay at a dept. store if you can find it.</li>
            <li> Excelente producto de acuerdo a lo esperado, el env&amp;iacute;o fue acorde a la fecha se&amp;ntilde;alada, estoy muy satisfecha con el producto, lo recomiendo</li>
            <li> My brother wears it, I guess it is okay, he is pretty lucky with women so It could be this scent or the fact that he is 6&#x27;4&amp;#34; and a body builder.</li>
            <li> I like it but perfumes are very subjective.  Try it first. If you like it, buy it here.  Happy shopping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great gift for men. Smell is very solid and manly. It&#x27;s NOT  knock off, it&#x27;s very genuine, smell is long lasting and even packaging is great. Nothing is damage and price is just so affordable and great</li>
            <li> good price good product good presentation i recommend the product you can buy it several times excellent bran and you can be confident</li>
            <li> Its intensity and flavor are delicious. It keeps all the time and even after washing the garments retain the nuances of perfume.</li>
            <li> Smells great how a man should smell would buy again</li>
            <li> my favorite. one of the best all my family were it. very nice price. great place to get it from. will recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> My husband LOVES it. I got it for him for Christmas. For this price, this is a great deal. Great, Classic smell.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was on the top ten colognes for men on some site i went too on google. Anyways, it smells really great and lasts all day. I work in a corporate office and its 8 hour days and this scent lasts well pass the time i get home. Warning: you dont need a lot of sprays for this, a few well placed squirts around the neck and the wrists and your good to go. I recommend this, it came well before the estimated delivery time, nothing was tampered with and it smells really great. Get this fragrance and smell like a BOSS!</li>
            <li> El articulo perfecto. Me gusto bastante. Lo recomiendo 100%. Es de buena calidad. Si volver&amp;iacute;a a comprarle a este vendedor.</li>
            <li> love the this perfume</li>
            <li> Just as described. arrived on time.</li>
            <li> muy bueno el perfume. el olor es ideal para los hombres que les agrade oler rico. lo recomiendo. el vendedor muy puntual</li>
            <li> I love this product, really good for any kind of men.&lt;br /&gt;Hugo Boss is the best for women and men!!</li>
            <li> Definately a great smelling cologne!  My other fave was Cool Water and I loved it but this is a great, sexy, clean smell!  Yum.</li>
            <li> I liked a lot this product, Thanks for all and for a faster shippment. I really will by with you other product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this cologne for years and it never fails to please.  Occasionally, I&#x27;ll get the &#x27;mmm... you smell good&#x27; comment, inevitably followed by the &#x27;hey, you know you can buy razors in a 10 pack for about seven bucks&#x27; comment.  This is a light scent, clean, not too sweet and not much spice.  As with all colognes, it fades somewhat after application, but that doesn&#x27;t give you license to empty the bottle in your pants in the morning.  A shot on the neck, one on the chest, and one on the wrist will fully cover you for the day.  If people can smell you from more than about 2-3 feet, you&#x27;ve abused your cologne and should give to someone who knows how to properly wear it, i.e. me.  Either that or you just need a bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle I bought here seems to be the same as what I used to buy at Macy&#x27;s for a lot more money.  There were no packaging anomalies as noted by other reviewers, and I don&#x27;t think this is a knock-off from Istanbul, China, etc.  I am personally delighted, as are those who share the elevator with me.</li>
            <li> What is pictured isn&#x27;t exactly how it looks when you receive it (I believe a previous buyer uploaded a picture of what it actually looks like); but it is the Hugo by Hugo Boss. So what I received was exactly what I wanted; and I found this large bottle cheaper here on Amazon then the other websites I visited.</li>
            <li> muy serios con el env&amp;iacute;o, todo lleg&amp;oacute; al lugar de destino sin ninguna novedad, recomiendo este art&amp;iacute;culo a todos, muy seria la tienda a la que le hice la compra</li>
            <li> What great top and middle notes! But the dry down on my skin leaves a cloying musky smell. Meh.  Too bad.  Love the bottle design.</li>
            <li> This is first time I tried Hugo Boss, I liked it very much. I guess I will recommend to my friends too.</li>
            <li> excellent product reached me in time</li>
            <li> EXCELENCIA EN CALIDAD, TIEMPO Y RESPUESTA INMEDIATA&lt;br /&gt;RECOMENDABLE A TODOS LOS USUARIOS Y FUTUROS COMPRADORES DE PRODUCTOS..&lt;br /&gt;TIENDA SERIA Y RESPONSABLE.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Hubby smells great. Love it. This is probably the second time I&#x27;ve ordered it in the last couple of years.</li>
            <li> What a major let down. My Hugo showed up missing a sprayer cap. It is non refundable. So I am left with a $45 paperweight ...UUUGGHHHHHH&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update! Amazon made everything AOK. They sent a replacement bottle no questions asked.</li>
            <li> You want to be a boss? Buy this mens spray and you will be at the top of your game. The ladies love this smell and the price is just right.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real deal I just don&#x27;t like the sweet musky smell. I like the price because it saves you from buying the same thing at a department store plus you save on gas and time. I will use it but I probably won&#x27;t wait for it to run out before getting something else.</li>
            <li> Good smell, looks great, backage and bottle is exactly like original but some times i think that is not the original, when you use it smells great, but few hours later you dont smels nothing, even on your clothes the smells gone fast</li>
            <li> buen d&amp;iacute;a con todos . . . . .Las fragancias llegaron en el tiempo estimado y  en perfectas condiciones , se los recomiendo muy excelente  gracias .</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and it made that to love him more! Hahaha... I recommend it for to do more sexiest men! Grrrr!</li>
