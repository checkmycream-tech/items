            <li> Lover the shampoo and conditioner so far.  Love the Matrix Biolage line and the volume bloom line does give me some volume to a person with very fine and no curl hair.  My hair seems to hold the style better.  Would purchase this or any of the Matrix Biolage line.  Also shipped very fast and did the slowest possible.  Got it in the mail 5 days before expected.</li>
            <li> this is by far the best product if you have thin fly away hair it does give you more volume to your bounce</li>
            <li> do not like this at all</li>

            <li> Great shampoo! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Dries out my hair.  I didn&#x27;t expect that from a salon quality product.</li>
            <li> Good product...fast shipment</li>
            <li> This is a mixed review.  I love the shampoo.  It&#x27;s concentrated, does a great job, and is easy to rinse out.  My hair actually did seem a little fuller, light, fluffy and clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like the conditioner at all.  It didn&#x27;t seem to have any de-tangling properties at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:  After using this shampoo for a month I realized that the constant itchy scalp problem (not dandruff) that I had been dealing with for over a year and tried many shampoos for has gone away. This is a GREAT shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a different conditioner (Aveeno Nourish &amp; Shine) that what came in this set.</li>
