            <li>It&#x27;s good n not too strong.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!  </li>
            <li>this is perfect for maintenance of my professional peels.</li>
            <li>also like the ingredients, and so far I am very happy with my the product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just very important that you take caution when using this product.</li>
            <li>My skin Is so much more brighter and softer.</li>
            <li>Was able to use twice a week and then with a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I love the ease of use because the of the pads.</li>
            <li>I love this product and would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li>Love these pads.</li>
            <li>May not be ideal for sensitive, virgin peel skin.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the peel pads for about a month now; I have noticed much more even skin tone and more brightness (</li>
            <li>I love the idea these are pads, and not a liquid that squirts out of a bottle.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Love this...</li>
            <li>I love it and will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>But my skin feels so much better than it has in ages.</li>
            <li>My skin is so much better</li>
            <li>and I get tempted to use them more than I should.</li>
            <li>I just love easy products that work.</li>
            <li>The peel isn&#x27;t strong at all.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe people actual compliment me on how beautiful my skin is.</li>
            <li>but I tried it on my wrist and it was fine.</li>
            <li>any good peel, there’s an element of discomfort upon application and redness for an hour or two afterward, but it certainly tolerable, and IMHO, absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li>My husband is very picky with these kind of things as well and won&#x27;t put on just any product on his face either.</li>
            <li>I feel comfortable leaving the house without any</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it makes my skin smooth.</li>
            <li>have sensitive skin and did not want significant peeling, so applied the product with a light hand and removed fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is more of an exact and a precise way of targeting the spot you want to peel.  </li>
            <li>This is my new favorite product!</li>
            <li>After several applications, I’ve noticed a remarkable difference in the texture and tone of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Super fantastic results.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin, and all those fabulous days at the beach are unfortunately starting to show.</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend this product!!!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>Using these peel pads is really helping to smooth and even out my hyperpigmented areas.</li>
            <li>The professional quality of this peel gives even more to the quality of this peel along with the convenience of using pads to apply this peel.</li>
            <li>I use these about once to twice a week and have now very infrequent breakouts and much lighter and more even skin tone.  </li>
            <li>These are well worth the price</li>
            <li>really enjoyed this peel and found it to be comparable to professional peels that I have had done.</li>
            <li>This is so much easier, it.s more gentle</li>
            <li>Very easy to use: grab a pad and rub it on face, neck, décolleté, and for me also back of hands and shoulder tops.</li>
            <li>I intend to use the peels several more times, but am very excited about the progress thus far.</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews but this one was really needed.  </li>
            <li>This left my skin feeling SO smooth!</li>
            <li>I bought this peel a few months ago and have really loved the results it has provided.</li>
            <li>I mostly use a light powder to cover any issues with uneven skin tones or shiny spots on my forehead/nose/chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes my complexion look more smooth and is one of the few things that helps with my acne.</li>
            <li>If I do see positive results I will update my review</li>
            <li>Then when I tried it on my face it was ok too, I felt some tingling and that&#x27;s it, no burning or anything more serious.</li>
            <li>I think the application would have less irritation if a soft brush was used, so I probably would not highly recommend this product as I think lactic acid skin peels applied with a fan brush would be more effective to those with more sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Be very careful when you first start to use these,  they are strong!  </li>
            <li>I was worried about getting too light, but it doesn&#x27;t look funny like a swipe of white standing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get to try them because they leaked into the package they came in and don&#x27;t really trust buying them again .</li>
            <li>Really brightens my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>You can always do another peel, but you really don&#x27;t want to deal with chemical burns on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the liquid peel and this is much easier to do.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used them much because I&#x27;ve started Uni</li>
            <li>It is just so much easier to apply with pads.  </li>
            <li>I really like the product.</li>
            <li>Works just as it claims but for the love of whatever creator you may or may not worship please follow instructions carefully and get a decent moisturizer and sunblock</li>
            <li>I have used a lot of high end products, and this one fits right in with them as far as quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wash it off very gently with a cleanser, then use a rich, comforting moisturizer on that first day (and of course, sunblock everyday, regardless).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have mild Malasma and was hoping to use this as a compliment to my current regimen.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li>After trying many products for both issues over a period of several years, I have finally found something that works for both!  </li>
            <li>Better safe than sorry.</li>
            <li>I have adult acne and melasma and this has significantly and FINALLY helped with both.  </li>
            <li>I have been using these pads once a week for about a month and my breakouts are less frequent and more controllable.</li>
            <li>--they are rough like the acne scrub pads, so it does cause a bit of irritation and I did experience some red bumps, but my skin felt very smooth.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin new again, that&#x27;s what it feels like.</li>
            <li>and since I live on campus</li>
            <li>This is a serious peel; a really nice alternative to pricey peels at your dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>I am new to using this product, but so far, so good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Honestly, I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m going to see any lightening results with this, as I&#x27;ve tried pretty much everything on the market for melasma with no long term success.</li>
            <li>The marks on my chin are completely gone.</li>
            <li>I am 30 years old</li>
            <li>I have had lots of experience with both professional and at home peels.</li>
            <li>and my skin is sensitive</li>
            <li>My chocolate skin is glowing and baby soft.</li>
            <li>These are helping me keep my adult acne in check.</li>
            <li>You can use Vaseline to protect the sensitive areas of your face (eyes, around mouth, around nostrils) from the acid.</li>
            <li>/&gt;All-in-all, a good product for beginners who may be skeptical of lactic acid peels.  </li>
            <li>There may be other companies but none that are paraben free, which is one of my big product concerns.</li>
            <li>I also found the pads are quick to dry out during application, which can be frustrating when you are trying to get more coverage and have to grab another pad to finish your application!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many lactic acid products, this one just seems weak and not like a 30%.</li>
            <li>This immediately makes your skin feel tight but toned and soft after using it and luminous after the first time using it.</li>
            <li>and I have not had clear skin on my arms and back since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li>My skin only peeled slightly after the first use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really making a difference with my skin, I have dry flakey skin and this just smooths all my dry patches away.</li>
            <li>buying this if u have a dry or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I only waited a minute to rinse off the first few times, until my skin got accustomed to these.  </li>
            <li>I really am liking this stuff, I was a little nervous because the smell was a bit chemically</li>

            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m going to see any lightening results with this, as I&#x27;ve tried pretty much everything on the market for melasma with no long term success.</li>
            <li> The marks on my chin are completely gone.</li>
            <li> I am 30 years old</li>

            <li> These are helping me keep my adult acne in check.</li>
            <li> You can use Vaseline to protect the sensitive areas of your face (eyes, around mouth, around nostrils) from the acid.</li>
            <li> /&gt;All-in-all, a good product for beginners who may be skeptical of lactic acid peels.  </li>
            <li> There may be other companies but none that are paraben free, which is one of my big product concerns.</li>
            <li> I also found the pads are quick to dry out during application, which can be frustrating when you are trying to get more coverage and have to grab another pad to finish your application!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many lactic acid products, this one just seems weak and not like a 30%.</li>
            <li> This immediately makes your skin feel tight but toned and soft after using it and luminous after the first time using it.</li>
            <li> and I have not had clear skin on my arms and back since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li> My skin only peeled slightly after the first use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really making a difference with my skin, I have dry flakey skin and this just smooths all my dry patches away.</li>
            <li> buying this if u have a dry or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I only waited a minute to rinse off the first few times, until my skin got accustomed to these.  </li>
            <li> I really am liking this stuff, I was a little nervous because the smell was a bit chemically</li>
            <li> Using this over a short period of time not only faded them down to my natural skin and evened out the tone to blend it in like they were never there.</li>
            <li> It helped face some old acne scars but not right away</li>
            <li> The natural ingredients toned down my splotchy skin and made it radiant and youthful.</li>
            <li> Additionally, due to years of wondering around without sunblock on in relentless sun, my face and hands are several shades darker than the rest of my body.</li>
            <li> I have been using on the dark spots on my arms and see a big difference.</li>
            <li> It left the skin raw and, weeks later (again...WEEKS), the skin is still irritated.</li>
            <li> They did not work instantly, but after each treatment I could see a slight improvement and after a period of a few weeks a big one.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget to prep your skin by not using anything with retinol or an exfoliator for a few days prior.</li>
            <li> I saw that some people had burned their face, and literally my ONLY complaint about this product is that I wish it gave better instructions for how to neutralize the acid, other than using cold water alone.</li>
            <li> and it actually made my pores small and made it too dry</li>
            <li> I had a few dark spots on my arm from accumulated sun damage from working outside over the years.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product every other week.</li>
            <li> I use it every other week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to give some other products a try from this line.</li>
            <li> I have the other liquid peels in the bottle and they are no joke.</li>
            <li> Looking at the other comments I still believe this can work for some people but DO NOT waist ur time money and energy</li>
            <li> Very minimal peeling</li>
            <li> There are also two competing smells in this product, one absolutely lovely and the other a bit rank.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve used these on my face and body and I&#x27;m only halfway though the jar and my legs are brighter and at least a shade lighter.</li>
            <li> It made my skin have 2-3 dark spots after use.</li>
            <li> I purchased to help with dark spots on my face, no visible results after once</li>
            <li> Other peels require a brush and can be a bit messy.</li>
            <li> You can purchase a neutralizer; however, a mixture of half a cup of baking soda with two cups of water works just as well.</li>
            <li> Start out with a minute, or even less, and work your way up.</li>
            <li> and I can leave it on a little longer.</li>
            <li> It stings a little</li>
            <li> I use this about once a week on my trouble areas like my nose and forehead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it even peeled anything.</li>
            <li> Usually feels like fire is on your face..</li>
            <li> First of all, the base of this is Lactic acid, which doesn&#x27;t cause a &#x27;peel off&#x27; sort of peel.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what has come over me lately, but I found the situation unaccepatble.</li>
            <li> I have random breakouts due to stress and hormones.  </li>
            <li> This stuff smells pretty bad, not just a chemical smell, but just a bad smell.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any ill effects from using it.</li>
            <li> and I did have to rinse with cold water at 2 minutes, which is the recommended time.</li>
            <li> time!I literally got burn, my skin look worst than ever uneven and darker.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I see any bad changes in this product I will updates.</li>
            <li> Omg this is the worst product I ever used in my life</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have mild Malasma and was hoping to use this as a compliment to my current regimen. I followed the directions to the letter, but still these pads burned my skin something fierce, especially around my cheek bones where the skin is thinner. It left the skin raw and, weeks later (again...WEEKS), the skin is still irritated. I fear it will never heal. I would never recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get to try them because they leaked into the package they came in and don&#x27;t really trust buying them again . Amazon is great tho:)</li>
            <li> I am african american with acne prone skin. I have been using this product every other week.I had alot of hyperpigmentation on my cheeks and chin. The marks on my cheeks have lightend up a lot. The marks on my chin are completely gone. My skin Is so much more brighter and softer.I highly reccomend this product!!!</li>
            <li> Great product. Works just as it claims but for the love of whatever creator you may or may not worship please follow instructions carefully and get a decent moisturizer and sunblock</li>
            <li> Super fantastic results. First of all, the base of this is Lactic acid, which doesn&#x27;t cause a &#x27;peel off&#x27; sort of peel. Don&#x27;t expect that. However, I&#x27;ve used these on my face and body and I&#x27;m only halfway though the jar and my legs are brighter and at least a shade lighter. Same for my face, and my acne scars have faded. Going to use this all over my body now. THis is the only product line I&#x27;ve used that has given me results. There may be other companies but none that are paraben free, which is one of my big product concerns.</li>
            <li> This did sting but it did the job. Very minimal peeling if any but it brightened my face. Was able to use twice a week and then with a moisturizer. It helped face some old acne scars but not right away</li>
            <li> This product delivered what it claims. I have been using on the dark spots on my arms and see a big difference.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite product! Very easy to use: grab a pad and rub it on face, neck, décolleté, and for me also back of hands and shoulder tops. I have fair skin, and all those fabulous days at the beach are unfortunately starting to show. I use these pads about once a week, and definitely can see and feel a difference. I wash it off very gently with a cleanser, then use a rich, comforting moisturizer on that first day (and of course, sunblock everyday, regardless).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My décolleté area blends in with the rest of my body now, so I&#x27;m not embarrassed to wear low shirts. Texture on face and neck, and yes, the tops of my shoulders, are instantly smoother. I was worried about getting too light, but it doesn&#x27;t look funny like a swipe of white standing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear a nitrile glove on the hand I hold the pad in, as I don&#x27;t need the acid peel on finger tips. There are also two competing smells in this product, one absolutely lovely and the other a bit rank. However, since the product is rinsed off within minutes, it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> My skin only peeled slightly after the first use.  Now I can leave it on for 5 minutes and have no issues.  Really brightens my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Perfect Image!</li>
            <li> Does what it claims.  Would recommend.  Good at refining pores and clearing skin, texture, and tone.  Good for use on the body as well.</li>
            <li> I am 30 years old and I have not had clear skin on my arms and back since I was a teenager. This line of skin care has changed my life! I can&#x27;t believe people actual compliment me on how beautiful my skin is. #DarkSkinGirlApproved</li>
            <li> I have random breakouts due to stress and hormones.  I have been using these pads once a week for about a month and my breakouts are less frequent and more controllable. I feel that it has been helpful to even out my skin tone as well.</li>
            <li> This immediately makes your skin feel tight but toned and soft after using it and luminous after the first time using it. My husband is very picky with these kind of things as well and won&#x27;t put on just any product on his face either. So I applied some of this on his face and he ended up loving it as well. Will definitely be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> I bought this peel a few months ago and have really loved the results it has provided. I have had lots of experience with both professional and at home peels. My skin has done great with the Luminex pads and it has caused no irritation. I look glowing and radiant after using this product. I love the ease of use because the of the pads. Other peels require a brush and can be a bit messy. I love this product and would buy from this seller again. Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I had a few dark spots on my arm from accumulated sun damage from working outside over the years. Using this over a short period of time not only faded them down to my natural skin and evened out the tone to blend it in like they were never there.</li>
            <li> Love these pads. May not be ideal for sensitive, virgin peel skin. I have been peeling with 35% beta acids for awhile.</li>
            <li> I really am liking this stuff, I was a little nervous because the smell was a bit chemically and my skin is sensitive but I tried it on my wrist and it was fine. Then when I tried it on my face it was ok too, I felt some tingling and that&#x27;s it, no burning or anything more serious. I have to tell you though I was scared and left it on for maybe 30 seconds and rinsed it off, I couldn&#x27;t believe it make a difference in that short of a time. I was going to build up to 1min. but I just went for it the next time I used the pads which was like 3 days later since I had used it for such a short time before. It&#x27;s really making a difference with my skin, I have dry flakey skin and this just smooths all my dry patches away. Makes my skin new again, that&#x27;s what it feels like. I&#x27;d definitely recommend trying this!</li>
            <li> The professional quality of this peel gives even more to the quality of this peel along with the convenience of using pads to apply this peel. The natural ingredients toned down my splotchy skin and made it radiant and youthful.</li>
            <li> I have done my second peel with these and couldnt wait to share! Using these peel pads is really helping to smooth and even out my hyperpigmented areas. Additionally, due to years of wondering around without sunblock on in relentless sun, my face and hands are several shades darker than the rest of my body. I never cared until after I turned 30... I am not sure what has come over me lately, but I found the situation unaccepatble. In steps the Luminex peel pads to save the day! I intend to use the peels several more times, but am very excited about the progress thus far.</li>
            <li> this is perfect for maintenance of my professional peels. I use this about once a week on my trouble areas like my nose and forehead.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it every other week. My chocolate skin is glowing and baby soft. I don&#x27;t over use the pads and my neck loves it.</li>
            <li> I am still using the pads...</li>
            <li> I have a fairly simply skin care regimen: wash and put on day cream in the a.m. / wash and put on night cream in the p.m.  I mostly use a light powder to cover any issues with uneven skin tones or shiny spots on my forehead/nose/chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the peel pads for about a month now; I have noticed much more even skin tone and more brightness (some of the age-related sallowness is gone). I feel comfortable leaving the house without any powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just last week I got carded at Walmart, and the checkout lady could NOT believe my driver&#x27;s license was telling the truth! LOL</li>
            <li> I am new to using this product, but so far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s start with the fact I love the idea these are pads, and not a liquid that squirts out of a bottle. I can just wear a glove while applying it. Very nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the ingredients, and so far I am very happy with my the product. I have used a lot of high end products, and this one fits right in with them as far as quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, for the best results, get plenty of rest, always drink LOTS of water and please STAY OUT OF THE SUN!! Also, do not leave your house without sunscreen. Good luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I see any bad changes in this product I will updates.</li>
            <li> I do like the convenience of pads, but I almost think they interfere with my skin--they are rough like the acne scrub pads, so it does cause a bit of irritation and I did experience some red bumps, but my skin felt very smooth.  I think the application would have less irritation if a soft brush was used, so I probably would not highly recommend this product as I think lactic acid skin peels applied with a fan brush would be more effective to those with more sensitive skin.  I also found the pads are quick to dry out during application, which can be frustrating when you are trying to get more coverage and have to grab another pad to finish your application!&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, a good product for beginners who may be skeptical of lactic acid peels.  I probably would NOT purchase again, unless they used softer pads for application.</li>
            <li> I love it this product help me a lot</li>
            <li> This is amazing. Makes my complexion look more smooth and is one of the few things that helps with my acne.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews but this one was really needed.  I have adult acne and melasma and this has significantly and FINALLY helped with both.  After trying many products for both issues over a period of several years, I have finally found something that works for both!  I use these about once to twice a week and have now very infrequent breakouts and much lighter and more even skin tone.  They did not work instantly, but after each treatment I could see a slight improvement and after a period of a few weeks a big one.  I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!  These are well worth the price and I will be ordering another set soon!</li>
            <li> Great product!  Great service!  Great price!  Highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> Good at exfoliating my skin.  Be very careful when you first start to use these,  they are strong!  I only waited a minute to rinse off the first few times, until my skin got accustomed to these.  Now I wait two or three minutes, and that is enough for my skin.  These are helping me keep my adult acne in check.</li>
            <li> The peel isn&#x27;t strong at all. I&#x27;m not sure it even peeled anything. Left it on for 5 minutes and didn&#x27;t feel anything</li>
            <li> i have some pigmentation and it didn&#x27;t do anything for me..don&#x27;t expect any visual results.</li>
            <li> I saw that some people had burned their face, and literally my ONLY complaint about this product is that I wish it gave better instructions for how to neutralize the acid, other than using cold water alone. This is a serious peel; a really nice alternative to pricey peels at your dermatologist&#x27;s office. It&#x27;s just very important that you take caution when using this product. Please do not forget to neutralize the acid or you could burn your skin. You can purchase a neutralizer; however, a mixture of half a cup of baking soda with two cups of water works just as well. Don&#x27;t forget to prep your skin by not using anything with retinol or an exfoliator for a few days prior. Use an alcohol wipe to remove all the oil from your skin before applying. You can use Vaseline to protect the sensitive areas of your face (eyes, around mouth, around nostrils) from the acid. Start out with a minute, or even less, and work your way up. Better safe than sorry. You can always do another peel, but you really don&#x27;t want to deal with chemical burns on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoyed this peel and found it to be comparable to professional peels that I have had done. I like the concept of the &#x27;peel pad&#x27; as it&#x27;s easier to apply to yourself. Overall, this is a great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a discount on this item in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> I am an esthetician and have a daughter with cystic acne. I have been doing salycilic peels to so so results. I wanted to try the mandelic and thought this was perfect. After one treatment her skin looks so much better! I&#x27;m going to give some other products a try from this line.</li>
            <li> Love this...I have the other liquid peels in the bottle and they are no joke. Usually feels like fire is on your face..This is so much easier, it.s more gentle and I can leave it on a little longer. I love it and will be ordering more. I just love easy products that work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good n not too strong.</li>
            <li> Consult doctor before use! It made my skin have 2-3 dark spots after use. This is not for everyone.</li>
            <li> This left my skin feeling SO smooth! I purchased to help with dark spots on my face, no visible results after once use, which I don&#x27;t expect. But my skin feels so much better than it has in ages. It stings a little and I did have to rinse with cold water at 2 minutes, which is the recommended time. Then followed up with a hydrating serum as directed. Great results, will continue using.</li>
            <li> The product works well to remove spot and scars and to even out complexion. It seems to be helping my acne.  I use it in combination with the Salicylic acid peel.</li>
            <li> It´s done nothing to my skin.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.  I&#x27;ve used the liquid peel and this is much easier to do.  However, I haven&#x27;t experienced any skin lightening yet.  I use the peels to treat my melasma.  Honestly, I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m going to see any lightening results with this, as I&#x27;ve tried pretty much everything on the market for melasma with no long term success. If I do see positive results I will update my review</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used them much because I&#x27;ve started Uni and since I live on campus I don&#x27;t have the time needed for a peel, nor the confidence needed to walk around with peeled skin. But I did use one along with a salicylic 20% peel before and the results were very very nice.</li>
            <li> Omg this is the worst product I ever used in my life time!I literally got burn, my skin look worst than ever uneven and darker.&lt;br /&gt;I got this plus its body lotion. Looking at the other comments I still believe this can work for some people but DO NOT waist ur time money and energy buying this if u have a dry or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells pretty bad, not just a chemical smell, but just a bad smell.  I&#x27;ve used many lactic acid products, this one just seems weak and not like a 30%. I would not buy this again</li>
            <li> What attracted me to this peel system above others was not just all the all-natural ingredients but was also the pads.  It is just so much easier to apply with pads.  It is more of an exact and a precise way of targeting the spot you want to peel.  And of course, all the wonderful ingredients like the papaya fruit extract, the Konjic Acid, all of which are all beneficial to brightening your skin during the peel.</li>
            <li> These pads worked as advertised to remove some sunspots off my nose and one off my elbow. I really like the product. I didn&#x27;t have any ill effects from using it.</li>
            <li> I am so impressed with this brand. I’d buy a vat of their Hydrating Repair Peptide Wrinkle Cream if I could, and now that I’ve tried the Luminex Peel Pads, can attest to their quality and effectiveness too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and did not want significant peeling, so applied the product with a light hand and removed fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like any good peel, there’s an element of discomfort upon application and redness for an hour or two afterward, but it certainly tolerable, and IMHO, absolutely worth it. After several applications, I’ve noticed a remarkable difference in the texture and tone of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended! I’ll buy again.</li>
            <li> I use it once a week, it is been 4 weeks, did not see any brightening effect yet, but I like it. it makes my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> My skin is so much better and I get tempted to use them more than I should. I have acne prone oily skin and it actually made my pores small and made it too dry lol but I like them</li>
    </ol>
