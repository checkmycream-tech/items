            <li>like  good  </li>
            <li>does a good job.</li>
            <li>good product</li>
            <li>&amp;quot;Seemed like a good idea at the time.&amp;quot; The clipper part spins on the handle/engage part.  </li>
            <li>Love these clippers!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice idea but lacks in the practicality for someone with limits as I have.</li>
            <li>nice item</li>
            <li>Honestly, the best nail clippers I have used so far.</li>
            <li>This really is an excellent toe nail clipper....much better than the typical style most people use, and easily the best I have tried.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable to use,</li>
            <li>This one has very comfortable handles.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Service was fast and I was very pleased with the product!</li>
            <li>Best clipper so far for my son with fine motor skill challenges.</li>
            <li>Most  people would like them.</li>
            <li>I really love this nail clipper.</li>
            <li>and I love the design</li>
            <li>Excellent toenail clippers until they broke a year later.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better suited  for clipping toenails than fingernails.</li>
            <li>My faves for sure.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to replace another rotating clipper because it had thinner handles, and one of them curved upward at the gripping end</li>
            <li>Shape of handle increases gripping ability and access.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li>: handle on top is slippery.</li>
            <li>Love these clippers.</li>
            <li>The grippers are large and comfortable for your hands and the swivel top is a great idea.</li>
            <li>the fact that they have a swiveling head is awesome, plus the handles are big and textured which make them easy to grip.  </li>
            <li>For someone with stronger grip and more flexible hip, I think the item would work fine.</li>
            <li>I so love these, they&#x27;re easy to use whether a lefty or righty, and the grip is extremely comfortable either hand.</li>
            <li>Good  enough, pro is very steady, and has a good grip as well as very easy to move referring to the rotary part of it.</li>
            <li>I have arthritis and some difficulty reaching and trimming my toenails - this provides an easy reach and ability to get the job done</li>
            <li>It is really easy to grip and to make a cut.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>So easy to use.</li>
            <li>NOT AS STRONG AS I THOUGHT</li>
            <li>Clean, easy cut, seems well made.</li>
            <li>It is also fairly light weight</li>
            <li>So thank you for having them available</li>
            <li>Comfortable to use and not having to adjust your body to use .</li>
            <li>Bigger handle works great for me.</li>
            <li>These have a unique way about them to adjust to almost anyone&#x27;s needs.</li>
            <li>Cuts cleanly</li>
            <li>Great for getting the right angle of attack and the proper leverage to clip a nail.  </li>
            <li>The rotating head allows you to get the right angle without having to contort your body (not so easy as you age).</li>
            <li>The ease of use is excellent, but the actual clippers are not very sharp and do not leave clean edges.</li>
            <li>love,love, love it ---cool item for reasonable price</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if the price was more reasonable.</li>
            <li>It dooes not slip from your fingers, and vary sharp, For me it works Great, I would recomand it.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>I have a hard time with my right hand and these clippers were perfect for me! !</li>
            <li>Good price and product long delivery time.</li>
            <li>It takes more clips than a big clipper and then there is not an even curve so it takes using an emery board to smooth it.</li>
            <li>I threw away my old clippers and will buy more of these.</li>
            <li>Love these clippers - work great with little pressure which helps my arthritic thumbs - bought second pair as gift!</li>
            <li>They are light weight, sharp, and I can easily hold the clippers and it swivals!</li>
            <li>For those needing a little more gripping power and pressure to finish the clip, these are a must.</li>
            <li>Very sharp and good to have.  </li>
            <li>so while a bit bulkier than the old one, still easy to pack.  </li>
            <li>I very much recommend these clippers.</li>
            <li>Finally nail clippers older people can hold and get enough leverage to get a good clean cut.</li>
            <li>Sharp jaws, stable and handy, but the plastic hinge post holding the handle broke off.</li>
            <li>Poviting blades allow smooth transition from right to left hand clipping.</li>
            <li>Very little pressure is needed to clip so good to use even when my hands are hurting.  </li>
            <li>So they&#x27;re usable, but before long I&#x27;ll look for something better.</li>
            <li>Lightweight yet well made and easy to use especially for those who are elderly and/or have arthritis.</li>
            <li>Does not seem to have enough force to clip toenails easily</li>
            <li>Very convenient.  </li>
            <li>Trimming is much easier than with a straight clipper.</li>
            <li>The swivel really helps plus this clipper is much easier to hold with the plastic grips.</li>
            <li>You can rotate the blade to any angle you like which really helps with my toes.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this clipper!</li>
            <li>My husband loves these clippers, they are much easier for him to use.</li>
            <li>Got this for my 83 y/o Mom, but, I can see the difference in quality as it was sooooo much easier to use even for myself.</li>
            <li>I think I would like this if it had a straight blade.</li>
            <li>Well engineered and seems very sturdy.</li>
            <li>I have the the opening should be larger to fit the toe nails</li>
            <li>This clipper makes it so much easier to clip my toenails.  </li>
            <li>I could not apply  much pressure because it hurt.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Suggestion: Top needs traction surface or ridge to prevent slipping.</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it would make that much of a difference, but it does.</li>
            <li>Clippers are nice and sharp and the handle is wide for a comfortable grip.</li>
            <li>Easy to use for those with limited strength.</li>
            <li>Love the quality and the different angles...will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>Many were too small, too large, or cumbersome.</li>
            <li>This product is easy to hold and is quite sharp.</li>
            <li>This is one of the rare times that I have ever found something that totally exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because I have arthritis in my right thumb, and it hurts to use a regular fingernail clipper.  </li>
            <li>I have a bad hand and can use this type of clipper more effectively.</li>
            <li>Being able to rotate the cutting area makes it all the more convenient.</li>
            <li>Gripping ordinary fingernail clippers has become a problem.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll check the manufacturer to see if they make the same large style but with a metal hinge prong post</li>
            <li>much easier to use than a regular nail clipper</li>
            <li>I reccomend them to everyone, young and old alike.</li>
            <li>It is like most of the similar ones: the jaw doesn&#x27;t open very wide so</li>
            <li>Got exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>This is not for thick toe nails, but okay for regular use.</li>
            <li>Not good for strong nails.</li>
            <li>My old smaller metal clipper constantly slipped out of my grasp.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little large.  </li>
            <li>Device is too large for finger nails, but shines on big toe nails and suffices on all but the little toe, definitely magnifies leverage.</li>
            <li>; They were a little smaller and curved a little more than I expected.</li>

            <li> This is not for thick toe nails, but okay for regular use.</li>
            <li> Not good for strong nails.</li>
            <li> My old smaller metal clipper constantly slipped out of my grasp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little large.  </li>
            <li> Device is too large for finger nails, but shines on big toe nails and suffices on all but the little toe, definitely magnifies leverage.</li>
            <li> ; They were a little smaller and curved a little more than I expected.</li>
            <li> The handles are wide and easy to hold and the cutter can handle fairly tough nails.</li>
            <li> Even with the easily gripped handles and the wide revolving clipping head it&#x27;s still difficult to cut my toenails on my &amp;#34;bum&amp;#34; hip foot.</li>
            <li> The long-handled small scissors-on-the-end type are hard to use and often do not cut cleanly and easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have several medical issues that make it difficult to use a normal nail clipper.</li>
            <li> These have given me a little piece of my independence back.</li>
            <li> but the only problem is that while arranging it onto toenail it sometimes slips out of place, but once you get it attached onto nail the cutting is easy with very little pressure needed.  </li>
            <li> so it only clips a small part of the nail at a time.</li>
            <li> I end up having to hold the head with some part of my other hand.  </li>
            <li> Other than that...</li>
            <li> love the rotary clipper, with a very bad back</li>
            <li> Yep, my old arthritic hands can grip and squeeze with no problem due to the large handle and formed base plate.</li>
            <li> The black handle needs roughing up</li>
            <li> the average person, however, I&#x27;m not sure I would recommend it for fingernails, since it can leave a bit of a rough edge.</li>
            <li> I have have strength issues and other medical issues that make cutting my toe nails hard particularly.  </li>
            <li> Worked well but looks a little flimsy.</li>
            <li> Makes the job of nail cutting much easier.</li>
            <li> heavy duty.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Rotates but blade is too narrow</li>
            <li> I bought these and like both the thick wide handles and the rotating clipper.</li>
            <li> Unable to get complete grip to utilize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;the rotation of the cutting head in relation to the levers works very well, no more odd ball angles trying to cut the toe nails.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m hoping that these will be easier to use for my dad who has less strength than he used to.these open wide enough for my terrible yellow toenails.reccomend.</li>
            <li> The head swivels around so you don&#x27;t have to awkwardly angle your hand to get at your nails - especially if you are not particularly dexterous.</li>
            <li> Works well, but a little clumsy to maneuver.</li>
            <li> I have MS and it&#x27;s hard to reach my toe nails.</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is the size of the cutting mechanism.  </li>
            <li> It has the power to clip without any issue, through thick nails.</li>
            <li> The plastic handles are thick and sturdy but I feel they might eventually break.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disabled so getting to all the toes is difficult, this was worse.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t now my toenails were that tough.</li>
            <li> Over the years, it has been frustrating to find a pair of nail clippers that do the job the way I hoped.</li>
            <li> I find the curved cutting edge clumsy.</li>
            <li> Helps you cut nails without having to put hands in difficult positions to cut</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s difficult to bend and twist into position to cut your toe nails .</li>
            <li> It may work for some people, but I find it too awkward to use.  </li>
            <li> toe nail cutting is a bit of a problem.</li>

            <li> Very nice and inexpensive piece of machinery. It met all my needs, and expectations.</li>
            <li> Very convenient.  The black handle needs roughing up so your thumb doesn&#x27;t slip.</li>
            <li> Whoever invented these deserves a medal.  I have Multiple Sclerosis, and the swivel design allows me to cut my fingernails on nails on BOTH hands.  I can cut problem, too-long toenails some of the time.  I never dreamed I&#x27;d be in a situation where I needed help trimming my fingernails, but here I am.  These have given me a little piece of my independence back. Clean, easy cut, seems well made.</li>
            <li> heavy duty.&lt;br /&gt;sharp.&lt;br /&gt;the rotation of the cutting head in relation to the levers works very well, no more odd ball angles trying to cut the toe nails.</li>
            <li> I no longer have the strength in my hands to use the regular clippers.  These work great using your palm for leverage.</li>
            <li> This is one of the rare times that I have ever found something that totally exceeded my expectations.  This design has finally, in it&#x27;s ingenuity and simplicity, made something mush easier in my life. Kudos.</li>
            <li> This is not for thick toe nails, but okay for regular use.</li>
            <li> Good  enough, pro is very steady, and has a good grip as well as very easy to move referring to the rotary part of it. Most  people would like them.</li>
            <li> I so love these, they&#x27;re easy to use whether a lefty or righty, and the grip is extremely comfortable either hand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 74. Bought 2. 1 for me and 1 for my daughter who has various mobility problems. Trimming is much easier than with a straight clipper. The swivel really helps plus this clipper is much easier to hold with the plastic grips. My old smaller metal clipper constantly slipped out of my grasp. We both like them. I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if the price was more reasonable.</li>
            <li> Product works well as advertised. For those needing a little more gripping power and pressure to finish the clip, these are a must. Poviting blades allow smooth transition from right to left hand clipping.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work on my toenails.  It may work for some people, but I find it too awkward to use.  At times, it starts to swivel when I&#x27;m about to cut a nail.</li>
            <li> Excellent product; very easy to use!</li>
            <li> best clippers I have ever seen or used</li>
            <li> I give these a &amp;#34;pretty good.&amp;#34; They were a little smaller and curved a little more than I expected. So they&#x27;re usable, but before long I&#x27;ll look for something better.</li>
            <li> All  it  looks  like  good  product.</li>
            <li> NOT AS STRONG AS I THOUGHT</li>
            <li> This fits my hand and doesn&#x27;t flip out across the room.  Very little pressure is needed to clip so good to use even when my hands are hurting.  You can rotate the blade to any angle you like which really helps with my toes.  It is also fairly light weight so while a bit bulkier than the old one, still easy to pack.  I highly recommend this clipper!</li>
            <li> I really love this nail clipper. Very comfortable to use, and I love the design</li>
            <li> My husband loves these clippers, they are much easier for him to use. So thank you for having them available</li>
            <li> Lightweight yet well made and easy to use especially for those who are elderly and/or have arthritis. Got this for my 83 y/o Mom, but, I can see the difference in quality as it was sooooo much easier to use even for myself. Clippers are nice and sharp and the handle is wide for a comfortable grip.</li>
            <li> Good price and product long delivery time.</li>
            <li> love,love, love it ---cool item for reasonable price</li>
            <li> Even with the easily gripped handles and the wide revolving clipping head it&#x27;s still difficult to cut my toenails on my &amp;#34;bum&amp;#34; hip foot. For someone with stronger grip and more flexible hip, I think the item would work fine.</li>
            <li> Excellent toenail clippers until they broke a year later. Sharp jaws, stable and handy, but the plastic hinge post holding the handle broke off. I didn&#x27;t now my toenails were that tough. I&#x27;ll check the manufacturer to see if they make the same large style but with a metal hinge prong post (i don&#x27;t know what to call it)</li>
            <li> Rotates but blade is too narrow so it only clips a small part of the nail at a time. It takes more clips than a big clipper and then there is not an even curve so it takes using an emery board to smooth it. It&#x27;s a nice idea but lacks in the practicality for someone with limits as I have. I have MS and it&#x27;s hard to reach my toe nails. This did not make it easier.</li>
            <li> I have arthritis and some difficulty reaching and trimming my toenails - this provides an easy reach and ability to get the job done</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have arthritis in my right thumb, and it hurts to use a regular fingernail clipper.  I can effortlessly cup my nails.  It&#x27;s such a relief!  The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is the size of the cutting mechanism.  It&#x27;s a little large.  It&#x27;s better suited  for clipping toenails than fingernails.</li>
            <li> Makes the job of nail cutting much easier.</li>
            <li> much easier to use than a regular nail clipper</li>
            <li> does a good job. I have a bad hand and can use this type of clipper more effectively. nice item and it&#x27;s adjustable.</li>
            <li> Love the quality and the different angles...will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I have have strength issues and other medical issues that make cutting my toe nails hard particularly.  These are great.  the fact that they have a swiveling head is awesome, plus the handles are big and textured which make them easy to grip.  I reccomend them to everyone, young and old alike.</li>
            <li> Device is too large for finger nails, but shines on big toe nails and suffices on all but the little toe, definitely magnifies leverage.</li>
            <li> performed as advertised. good product</li>
            <li> Helps you cut nails without having to put hands in difficult positions to cut</li>
            <li> very good, work nicely,easy to use,light wight and look very nice</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t impressed.  Didn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped.  I&#x27;m disabled so getting to all the toes is difficult, this was worse.</li>
            <li> The handle is great. It is really easy to grip and to make a cut. It is like most of the similar ones: the jaw doesn&#x27;t open very wide so toe nail cutting is a bit of a problem.</li>
            <li> I find the curved cutting edge clumsy. I think I would like this if it had a straight blade.</li>
            <li> Honestly, the best nail clippers I have used so far. Over the years, it has been frustrating to find a pair of nail clippers that do the job the way I hoped. Many were too small, too large, or cumbersome. These have a unique way about them to adjust to almost anyone&#x27;s needs. The head swivels around so you don&#x27;t have to awkwardly angle your hand to get at your nails - especially if you are not particularly dexterous. It has the power to clip without any issue, through thick nails. And the swivel head turns to either side. I very much recommend these clippers. My faves for sure.</li>
            <li> This really is an excellent toe nail clipper....much better than the typical style most people use, and easily the best I have tried. The long-handled small scissors-on-the-end type are hard to use and often do not cut cleanly and easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the average person, however, I&#x27;m not sure I would recommend it for fingernails, since it can leave a bit of a rough edge.</li>
            <li> Great product. Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> Yep, my old arthritic hands can grip and squeeze with no problem due to the large handle and formed base plate.</li>
            <li> Love these clippers!  Great for getting the right angle of attack and the proper leverage to clip a nail.  I threw away my old clippers and will buy more of these.</li>
            <li> The ease of use is excellent, but the actual clippers are not very sharp and do not leave clean edges.</li>
            <li> These clippers are terrific.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and good to have.  Works well</li>
            <li> Received on time. Worked well but looks a little flimsy.</li>
            <li> I already owned a pair &amp; was ordering another for my dad.  the rotary head turns easily to 4 different angles it clicks into place but the only problem is that while arranging it onto toenail it sometimes slips out of place, but once you get it attached onto nail the cutting is easy with very little pressure needed.  i&#x27;m hoping that these will be easier to use for my dad who has less strength than he used to.these open wide enough for my terrible yellow toenails.reccomend.</li>
            <li> Love these clippers - work great with little pressure which helps my arthritic thumbs - bought second pair as gift!</li>
            <li> What I have been looking for.</li>
            <li> Service was fast and I was very pleased with the product!</li>
            <li> An excellent tool. The grippers are large and comfortable for your hands and the swivel top is a great idea.</li>
            <li> The nail clippers were perfect for me. They are light weight, sharp, and I can easily hold the clippers and it swivals! I have a hard time with my right hand and these clippers were perfect for me! !</li>
            <li> Well engineered and seems very sturdy. Cuts cleanly</li>
            <li> Solidly made. Works well, but a little clumsy to maneuver.</li>
            <li> love the rotary clipper, with a very bad back it&#x27;s difficult to bend and twist into position to cut your toe nails . with the rotary  just bend find the angle you can do and rotate the cutter and cut .  only CON I have the the opening should be larger to fit the toe nails</li>
            <li> This clipper makes it so much easier to clip my toenails.  The rotating head allows you to get the right angle without having to contort your body (not so easy as you age). The handles are wide and easy to hold and the cutter can handle fairly tough nails. I purchased this to replace another rotating clipper because it had thinner handles, and one of them curved upward at the gripping end and  would gouge my thumb as I squeezed it. Ouch! I could not apply  much pressure because it hurt.  This one has very comfortable handles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that I wish it were all metal. The plastic handles are thick and sturdy but I feel they might eventually break. Of course metal handles would probably increase the price.</li>
            <li> I have several medical issues that make it difficult to use a normal nail clipper. I bought these and like both the thick wide handles and the rotating clipper. I must admit, it does take some getting used to.</li>
            <li> Plastic feels a bit &amp;#34;weak&amp;#34; but it cuts.</li>
            <li> Finally nail clippers older people can hold and get enough leverage to get a good clean cut.</li>
            <li> Does not seem to have enough force to clip toenails easily</li>
            <li> Not good for strong nails.</li>
            <li> These are great nail clippers . Comfortable to use and not having to adjust your body to use .</li>
            <li> &amp;quot;Seemed like a good idea at the time.&amp;quot; The clipper part spins on the handle/engage part.  Except how do you make it STOP spinning?  I end up having to hold the head with some part of my other hand.  Other than that...</li>
            <li> Pro: swivel head allows access and cuts well. Shape of handle increases gripping ability and access.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: handle on top is slippery. Unable to get complete grip to utilize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggestion: Top needs traction surface or ridge to prevent slipping. Also longer handle would increase cutting ability.</li>
            <li> Easy to use for those with limited strength.</li>
            <li> Got exactly what I expected. No fuss, no muss. It is working as it should. No complaints about the seller.</li>
            <li> Best clipper so far for my son with fine motor skill challenges.</li>
            <li> I have only used it once But will buy another one just to keep in my Van. It dooes not slip from your fingers, and vary sharp, For me it works Great, I would recomand it.</li>
            <li> I really like this. great concept.</li>
            <li> I have arthritis, which my doctor described as &amp;#34;age appropriate&amp;#34;. Gripping ordinary fingernail clippers has become a problem. This product is easy to hold and is quite sharp. Being able to rotate the cutting area makes it all the more convenient. I didn&#x27;t think it would make that much of a difference, but it does. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like this nail clipper. Bigger handle works great for me.</li>
            <li> Excellent clippers!  They work great, I am very pleased with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Love these clippers. So easy to use. I have arthritis in both hands and at times didn&#x27;t have the strength to use regular nail clippers. No problem with these!!!</li>
