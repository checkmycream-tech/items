            <li> Honestly, the mirror is fine - it works fine. It probably weighs about 1 pound and probably cost about $1 to make - Way overpriced IMO.  I see now it&#x27;s $20 - it was $25 when I bought it a couple months ago.  For the quality, it should be like $5.  &amp;#34;Vintage Bronze&amp;#34; lol.</li>
            <li> Very cheep quality.  Thin and flimsy.  Mirror even has ripples</li>
