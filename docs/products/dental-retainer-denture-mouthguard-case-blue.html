            <li>Perfect!  </li>
            <li>perfect size for mouthguard.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t close very good.  </li>
            <li>They are as good as what I get from orthodontist!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>

            <li>Shipping time was great.</li>
            <li>works great for my wife&#x27;s mouth guard.  </li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>Good price, hold dental appliances.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I would prefer if there was an ownership label like the one we got from the orthodontist&#x27;s, and one case has a tricky catch on the lid (which may cause a kid to accidentally eject the retainer from the case...not good).  </li>
            <li>Its discrete , slim and good quality.</li>
            <li>good product.</li>
            <li>Works good looks nice, good price</li>
            <li>This one works much better!</li>
            <li>It was great for my mouth guard and for my mom&#x27;s dentures fit in it too.</li>
            <li>I would have liked to have had some room to cushion the guard when traveling.</li>
            <li>Perfect for partials..take them anywhere,put in take out always a safe place...without taking much room.</li>
            <li>There are holes on both side of the case, so water leaks out very easily.</li>
            <li>This is an awesome case - a little deeper then my original which I think is awesome.  </li>
            <li>These will make sure the retainers are not put in a napkin or Kleenex and thrown away by mistake.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t want anything to happen to my costly lower bridge and most folks want to get a break from the bridge (that is supported on pins in the jawbone)</li>
            <li>--they&#x27;re STURDY, which is most important.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, price was good and it fits the mouth guard well.</li>
            <li>My retainer fits easily inside, and the case fits more comfortably in my purse.  </li>
            <li>Arrived very quickly too.</li>
            <li>However, we&#x27;re happy since most other places sell these for so much more</li>
            <li>It fits perfectly In this case but if you tip even slightly the water will leak out.</li>
            <li>This unit should be fine if you don&#x27;t need to soak your mouth guard.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t beat the price and arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>It locks securely.  </li>
            <li>Buy these or enjoy going through a trash basket trying to find lost retainers.</li>
            <li>Small-ish retainer/mouthguard case, should fit just about anything.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Great, has saved m retainers multiple times.</li>
            <li>This container is very useful.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s comes in a variety of colors that you can choose from which makes it fun!</li>
            <li>The &#x27;Retainer Brite&#x27; is the brand that makes the tab to put in water to clean retainer, but they offered no container (case) to use with it.  </li>
            <li>For traveling I use a different one with a nice press-fit top.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not a lot of innovation in the retainer case sector, so it&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s anything special about this case.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re brightly colored so nobody will be likely to lose her retainer case in the garbage.  </li>
            <li>Gets the job done but a bit to large to fit comfortably in jean pockets.</li>
            <li>The hinge connecting the flaps is super flimsy.</li>
            <li>Not as nice as my prior case that lasted over 10 years, but it does keep the retainer out of harms way and clean during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very durable and easy to use</li>
            <li>the mouthgard case is fine for just keeping all ready cleaned retainers.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and item is exactly as described and pictured.</li>
            <li>(if you&#x27;re familiar with how retainer cases decompose, you&#x27;ll know that this is a HIGH compliment).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s was new and it is very useful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Could use a drain hole or two, but honestly sometimes you want a fully sealed case, and this is a decent one, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I have a partial plate and it fits nice.</li>
            <li>pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But it works well and seems pretty durable.</li>
            <li>came on time, does the job, now just need daughter to use it&lt;br /&gt;good to have more than one for different locations, school, work, etc</li>
            <li>bought this one hoping that it wouldn’t be as tall as the one I was given by my dentist and that has proven to be the case (haa haa :) – only on rereading did I see the pun</li>
            <li>;).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a few years since I made this purchase, but the mouthguard case has held up strong –– it still works and looks okay</li>
            <li>The case is supposed to be one piece, now it is pretty much in two...</li>
            <li>small and good for children&#x27;s pocket.&lt;br /&gt;It´s like on the photo (size and colour).</li>
            <li>I purchased the Dental Retainer Mouthguard Blue for my wife because I wanted a strong place for her to store a bit of jewelry for when we travel.</li>
            <li>Very compact which makes it convenient.</li>
            <li>I really like this dental case.</li>
            <li>The product was just as described and the shipment arrived incredibly fast.</li>
            <li>Very well constructed and durable.  </li>
            <li>Very well priced as well.</li>
            <li>I wish this thing closed more securely, which is sort of the point, so I only use it in the medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li>the product looked good and what we expected, however when we placed mouthguard (the upper part)</li>
            <li>Nice and decent case for a few bucks.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a deeper container that I could put my retainers in to clean them daily.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Really high quality mouth guard case that does the trick.</li>
            <li>The size of the case makes fitting the mouth guard very tight with no room to spare.</li>
            <li>case is sturdy and it opens easily, and stays closed when you close it...and many other cases won&#x27;t stay closed, which annoys me to no</li>
            <li>The true test will be after some use to see if the plastic hinges last after opening and closing numerous times.</li>
            <li>I needed an extra case so I could place my night guard on my nightstand while I read, and then it would be right at hand to place in mouth when I felt too sleepy to hold my eyes open and did not have to go to my bathroom to fetch it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick and sturdy and it stays closed, he can also find the bright blue easily in the bottom of his giant black dark duffle bag.</li>

            <li> Small in size and fits into your purse without taking up too much space.</li>
            <li> Strange that the same company didn&#x27;t display any on the website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see it lasting very long</li>
            <li> not nearly large enough for even my upper teeth, and that is what I have ordered it for, so there you are.</li>
            <li> Height external when closed: 1 &amp; 1/16 inches or 27mm</li>
            <li> Also less likely to bang about.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry what to put my partial plate in when I have to take it out.</li>
            <li> Turns to be the product not as we expected</li>
            <li> The product came to me faster than expected.</li>
            <li> Not large for dentures.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Practical to have a retainer case again after the other one died.</li>
            <li> Not quite as small as I&#x27;d like-- found some even smaller ones a few years</li>
            <li> Too shallow to hold upper and lower dentures simultaneously</li>
            <li> It is a little thinner and lower profile than others, which I do like.</li>
            <li> Just like the orthodontist gave us, maybe even a little thicker plastic.  </li>
            <li> He throws this in his duffle bag with kleets, football equip etc... and has broken several.</li>
            <li> My current cleaning container is broken and I can&#x27;t find a replacement.  </li>
            <li> Tired</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t go wrong with &amp;#60;$5.</li>
            <li> Anyone who buys retainers for kids knows how expensive they can be.</li>
            <li> It has already split at the hinge part and is worthless.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> my retainer case broke after 10 years.  this one seems solid and i hope it lives up to the last one.  can&#x27;t go wrong with &amp;#60;$5.</li>
            <li> Works great for my sons retainers. The one the orthodontist gave us broke within 2 days. This one works much better!</li>
            <li> My mouth guard needs to be kept in a combination of water and mouthwash. It fits perfectly In this case but if you tip even slightly the water will leak out. Not exactly what I was looking for. This unit should be fine if you don&#x27;t need to soak your mouth guard.</li>
            <li> There are holes on both side of the case, so water leaks out very easily. The hinge connecting the flaps is super flimsy.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and item is exactly as described and pictured.</li>
            <li> It was great for my mouth guard and for my mom&#x27;s dentures fit in it too. Multi use product.</li>
            <li> Nice and decent case for a few bucks.  Seems like it will hold up well for awhile.  It is a little thinner and lower profile than others, which I do like.</li>
            <li> My son plays football and needed this for his mouth guard. The ones I found in the store were flimsy. He throws this in his duffle bag with kleets, football equip etc... and has broken several. I found this one and it&#x27;s perfect. It&#x27;s thick and sturdy and it stays closed, he can also find the bright blue easily in the bottom of his giant black dark duffle bag. It&#x27;s a win for us!</li>
            <li> Good quality. Very compact which makes it convenient. I plan to order another one in the future. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Not as nice as my prior case that lasted over 10 years, but it does keep the retainer out of harms way and clean during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lid to body connection is flimsy and can twist.  I don&#x27;t see it lasting very long but we&#x27;ll see</li>
            <li> This container is very useful.  It locks securely.  Small in size and fits into your purse without taking up too much space.</li>
            <li> Anyone who buys retainers for kids knows how expensive they can be. These will make sure the retainers are not put in a napkin or Kleenex and thrown away by mistake.  Buy these or enjoy going through a trash basket trying to find lost retainers.</li>
            <li> I really like this dental case. I have a partial plate and it fits nice. I don&#x27;t have to worry what to put my partial plate in when I have to take it out.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done but a bit to large to fit comfortably in jean pockets. Also there aren&#x27;t any holes so you get a bit of a smell when you open it up.</li>
            <li> What can I say, I bought this to store my mouth guard when not using it.  Shipping was fast, price was good and it fits the mouth guard well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few years since I made this purchase, but the mouthguard case has held up strong –– it still works and looks okay (if you&#x27;re familiar with how retainer cases decompose, you&#x27;ll know that this is a HIGH compliment). I would recommend buying one from this seller.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a deeper container that I could put my retainers in to clean them daily.  The &#x27;Retainer Brite&#x27; is the brand that makes the tab to put in water to clean retainer, but they offered no container (case) to use with it.  My current cleaning container is broken and I can&#x27;t find a replacement.  Strange that the same company didn&#x27;t display any on the website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the mouthgard case is fine for just keeping all ready cleaned retainers.  If anyone knows of a retainer cleaning container to buy online please let me know.  (They look like the mouthguard case but are deeper for cleaning.</li>
            <li> I ordered a red one and, then, a blue one!  Happy with both!  They are as good as what I get from orthodontist!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> Too shallow to hold upper and lower dentures simultaneously</li>
            <li> Small-ish retainer/mouthguard case, should fit just about anything. Not quite as small as I&#x27;d like-- found some even smaller ones a few years back-- but this one works pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could use a drain hole or two, but honestly sometimes you want a fully sealed case, and this is a decent one, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I ranked this item a 5 because I thought I ordered one and ended up with 4! All in different colors as well.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not a lot of innovation in the retainer case sector, so it&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s anything special about this case. But it works well and seems pretty durable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very durable and easy to use and it&#x27;s comes in a variety of colors that you can choose from which makes it fun!</li>
            <li> The case has been only opened a couple times and the section in the back that holds the case together nearly split half way through. The case is supposed to be one piece, now it is pretty much in two...</li>
            <li> Great for kids retainers</li>
            <li> I purchased the Dental Retainer Mouthguard Blue for my wife because I wanted a strong place for her to store a bit of jewelry for when we travel. Tired oh hearing say she lost her earrings. And guess what? It suits the bill perfectly. The product was just as described and the shipment arrived incredibly fast. So all in all, this was an excellent purchase, because I don&#x27;t have to hear her complain anymore,lol!</li>
            <li> came on time, does the job, now just need daughter to use it&lt;br /&gt;good to have more than one for different locations, school, work, etc</li>
            <li> I purchased several of these and they are just what I needed. My grandson takes his retainer out to eat and this is perfect to take with us to restaurants.</li>
            <li> I do recommend this product. It´s small and good for children&#x27;s pocket.&lt;br /&gt;It´s like on the photo (size and colour).</li>
            <li> Perfect!  My container from the dentist broke years ago and I could never find a replacement...then it dawned on me, AMAZON!  This is an awesome case - a little deeper then my original which I think is awesome.  Now I can hide my retainers and I don&#x27;t have to listen to my husband complain how gross they are.  LOL</li>
            <li> Good price, hold dental appliances. Worked as described. Would definitely buy again but it is just a piece of plastic.</li>
            <li> perfect size for mouthguard. Not large for dentures.</li>
            <li> the product looked good and what we expected, however when we placed mouthguard (the upper part) it was too big for the case, further, when we placed some water/liquid in the case, it came from all over the case. it didn&#x27;t close very good.  Turns to be the product not as we expected</li>
            <li> We bought 2 of these cases, one in red and one in blue so they&#x27;d be noticable.  They&#x27;re brightly colored so nobody will be likely to lose her retainer case in the garbage.  (!!!)  Anyway, I would prefer if there was an ownership label like the one we got from the orthodontist&#x27;s, and one case has a tricky catch on the lid (which may cause a kid to accidentally eject the retainer from the case...not good).  However, we&#x27;re happy since most other places sell these for so much more--they&#x27;re STURDY, which is most important.  Arrived very quickly too.</li>
            <li> Really high quality mouth guard case that does the trick. Very well constructed and durable.  Very well priced as well.</li>
            <li> Just like the orthodontist gave us, maybe even a little thicker plastic.  The true test will be after some use to see if the plastic hinges last after opening and closing numerous times.</li>
            <li> I wish this thing closed more securely, which is sort of the point, so I only use it in the medicine cabinet. For traveling I use a different one with a nice press-fit top.</li>
            <li> not nearly large enough for even my upper teeth, and that is what I have ordered it for, so there you are.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t want anything to happen to my costly lower bridge and most folks want to get a break from the bridge (that is supported on pins in the jawbone) after a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean. Compact. As pictured. As described.</li>
            <li> Great, has saved m retainers multiple times. Its discrete , slim and good quality. Liquids will leak tho. Its not fully sealed</li>
            <li> I needed an extra case so I could place my night guard on my nightstand while I read, and then it would be right at hand to place in mouth when I felt too sleepy to hold my eyes open and did not have to go to my bathroom to fetch it.  LOL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This case is sturdy and it opens easily, and stays closed when you close it...and many other cases won&#x27;t stay closed, which annoys me to no end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a simple object that you simply cannot rave about, but makes life easier.</li>
            <li> The size of the case makes fitting the mouth guard very tight with no room to spare. I would have liked to have had some room to cushion the guard when traveling.</li>
            <li> I like my dental retainer. The product came to me faster than expected. The quality is great. It&#x27;s was new and it is very useful.</li>
            <li> After my son&#x27;s retainer holder broke, I found these online and had to order an extra one. can&#x27;t beat the price and arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> Height external when closed: 1 &amp; 1/16 inches or 27mm&lt;br /&gt;I bought this one hoping that it wouldn’t be as tall as the one I was given by my dentist and that has proven to be the case (haa haa :) – only on rereading did I see the pun ;).  My retainer fits easily inside, and the case fits more comfortably in my purse.  It’s not as big and bulky as the one I was given.</li>
            <li> What is there to say? It is what it is. Shipping time was great.</li>
            <li> The item that arrived looked nothing like the item pictured. It has already split at the hinge part and is worthless. Stay away.</li>
            <li> Works good looks nice, good price</li>
            <li> holds 2 retainers with ease</li>
            <li> Practical to have a retainer case again after the other one died.</li>
            <li> Perfect for partials..take them anywhere,put in take out always a safe place...without taking much room. Also less likely to bang about.</li>
            <li> works great for my wife&#x27;s mouth guard.  she and soak it in mouthwash and transport the guard on trips. good product.</li>
