            <li> Im really aggravated that my order contained 0 tongue barbells which was half the reason I purchased this set to begin with. Aside from that the quality of the other jewelry is decent. This is the only reason im giving two stars and of course I can find no way to contact the company. *sigh</li>
            <li> One piece of my jewelry split in half. Other then that it&#x27;s a good price, and they got here on time.</li>
            <li> They only came with tongue and belly rings. No other assorted piercings. The tongue rings are longer than standard tongue rings. Pretty disappointing.</li>
            <li> Way too many pot leaf tongue and belly button rings. But for the most part love them</li>

            <li> I was feeling a little up in the air about these. The reason why is the amount for the price, but it worked out. The way they look in the picture is the way they look when you get them.</li>
            <li> The balls were pretty small and the bigger ones were hard to get onto the piercing itself. It was a frustrating time.</li>
            <li> I Like the variety of the piercings you get and the colors. They do feel cheap, however they are worth the price instead of paying 10 dollars for 1 single ring at the mall . Whole set of 90 for 11 bucks? I&#x27;m happy!</li>
