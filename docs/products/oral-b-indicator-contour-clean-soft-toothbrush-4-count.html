            <li>#34;add on&amp;#34; to qualify for free shipping and this was a perfect choice.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also good for cleaning gold clubs.</li>

            <li>This toothbrush is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Good deal, been using these for years, what more can I say?</li>
            <li>99% of my family all died with their own teeth and they never had electric toothbrushes or any of these &amp;#34;techie&amp;#34; things to take care of our teeth.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Kind of anal like that.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice.  </li>
            <li>These are the best toothbrushes, my whole family loves them.</li>
            <li>Soft tooth brushes are the best.  </li>
            <li>If your looking for a comfortable toothbrush this is really good.</li>
            <li>A GOOD FIT FOR BRACES.</li>
            <li>Not as soft as I was expecting but work great, teeth feel clean and good value!</li>
            <li>It does clean well and feels good on my teeth.  </li>
            <li>The soft is so much better for happy teeth!</li>
            <li>These toothbrushes are nice and easy to hold, and buying in bulk just makes sense.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it is a great chance for you to get these little items in a very good price</li>
            <li>just okay by me.</li>
            <li>This is our favorite brand.  </li>
            <li>My favorite toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>I love these Oral-B brushes.</li>
            <li>These were just okay</li>
            <li>Maybe they don&#x27;t make it any more?</li>
            <li>I love the head size.</li>
            <li>I love the size of the toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>I think you will be glad you did.</li>
            <li>I love the Oral B Toothbrush indicator,I never had any problem&#x27;s with Oral B</li>
            <li>would recommened Oral B to Family&#x27;s,you will love the Toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>It does it&#x27;s job, and I&#x27;m satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>I Love them all.</li>
            <li>what more could I ask for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love these brushes.  </li>
            <li>What more is there say?</li>
            <li>Perhaps what most amazes me is the bristle&#x27;s inability to clump together and stick.  </li>
            <li>Water perfectly washes off all the excess toothpaste left after the brushing procedure.  </li>
            <li>Great price and really well made</li>
            <li>and I love having packs of toothbrushes in my car, at work and in my overnight bag.</li>
            <li>Glad I purchased them</li>
            <li>These toothbrushes feel more like medium toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>i may get more of these because i can&#x27;t find any i like better.</li>
            <li>What more can I say?</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that I LOVE a toothbrush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i love the color indicator with the oral b toothbrushes</li>
            <li>There is no comfort in the bristle head, and the &#x27;grip&#x27; is more for looks than anything.</li>
            <li>Good quality and no issues, arrives right to the front stoop.  </li>
            <li>Their long-lasting, yet effective, and the indicator is a good reminder to start using a new toothbrush.</li>
            <li>And I find that my teeth and gums feel very clean.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good deal if you ask me.</li>
            <li>I love the rubberish grip which makes use easy with no slip ups.  </li>
            <li>Great toothbrushes.. nice firm bristles and the colors are nice for our family of four to determine whose it whose. :)</li>
            <li>and I had to hit each tooth many more times than I normally do to clean each tooth.</li>
            <li>Very good for teenage girls.</li>
            <li>Additionally, the &amp;#34;attachments&amp;#34; that they put on the teeth cause more wear and tear to the toothbrushes faster than just brushing smooth teeth.</li>
            <li>They are great soft toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>I love the free shipping.  </li>
            <li>And was happy to see that they are rated the SOFT type of bristles.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m going through toothbrushes very quickly.</li>
            <li>Its handle isn&#x27;t easy to grip.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would easily create a recurring transaction for this product.</li>
            <li>Very happy about this as I have very fussy gums (sensitive) and they have responded well to my using this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>We like the comfort and the cleaning effect also the handle with the easy grip for our hands</li>
            <li>Oral-B is usually good, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this particular product again.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent toothbrush particularly for those who prefer soft brushes.</li>
            <li>It has finely tuned bristles with enamel retardant fibers, along with plaque removing sharpness.  </li>
            <li>this model is seriously the best, brush is nice and smooth but gets in there</li>
            <li>Very soft and good brush.</li>
            <li>I thought it was pretty cool to be able to buy my toothbrushes online!</li>
            <li>Feels a little lightweight and not the best quality.</li>
            <li>Rum, gin, and vodka are best, as scotch and bourbon &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; less clean.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t tell by the picture that they are HUGE.</li>
            <li>Great option if you are looking for something similar to what your dentist gives you!</li>
            <li>Of course, I should recommend something cheap, like anything with the Aristocrat label, or whatever the locals have.  </li>
            <li>I am happy with the quality of these toothbrushes, overall.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These were relatively cheap</li>
            <li>If you brush on a regular basis and just want some quality brushes, these are great.  </li>
            <li>There cheap</li>
            <li>as well it fit in my hand well</li>
            <li>this is not the case, these are just what I thought CHEAP</li>
            <li>I like it because it&#x27;s cheap and within expectation.</li>
            <li>Nice toothbrushes, reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I trust the brand name Oral B, however - these brushes were cheaply made.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice that they are in different colors so everyone in the family can have their own color out of the pack.</li>
            <li>These toothbrushes are very gentle with your gums, so it&#x27;s a great choice for people with sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>Even brushing as often (and long) as I do, I have no problems with this toothbrush – and it is great quality</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t scrape your gum, but they get between your teeth just fine for a good daily brushing.</li>
            <li>Got these because of the price being nice and needed soft bristle brushes.</li>
            <li>I like a more square head that brushes the whole tooth all at once.  </li>
            <li>Commenters describe these as having a full sized head.  </li>
            <li>Good for brushing and the different colors allows you to tell the difference in whose toothbrush is whose.</li>
            <li>This four-pack is priced right, they work well for me, the brush is comfortable in my hand, and the heads don&#x27;t fall apart in the six to eight weeks that I use them...</li>
            <li>If you are looking for an ideal soft toothbrush look no further.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s just to quick in my book.  </li>
            <li>The item was shipped quickly and was what it showed online</li>
            <li>For the same price, I&#x27;m sure there is better out there.</li>
            <li>An average toothbrush, nothing absolutely great.</li>
            <li>Some days this is my only &amp;#34;me time&amp;#34; and I don&#x27;t want more noise going on in my mouth!</li>
            <li>and I am brushing my teeth a lot more frequently, as well as brushing the trays,</li>
            <li>ended up purchasing Colgate which is better when it comes to sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>so it was nice to find a pack of basic ones.</li>
            <li>and this will be worth the buy.  </li>
            <li>these are listed as soft, but the handle flexes more than the bristles.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They are good, but don&#x27;t stand out in any way other than price.</li>
            <li>It is the right size and right level of firmness.</li>
            <li>price was right.</li>
            <li>They work really well clean your teeth.</li>
            <li>The Oral-B Indicator Contour Clean Soft Toothbrush is a cheap, basic, toothbrush from one of the most trusted names in the business.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying these tooth brushes monthly for a year for the family -&lt;br /&gt;they&#x27;re decent, affordable - just right!</li>
            <li>For me, these are the right size, the right level of firmness, and a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Cleans your teeth great with the hard bristles.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Pretty colors.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Definitely thought I w as getting more for my money</li>
            <li>What I find is the most helpful is brushing at moderate pressure for 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>I could get 4 toothbrushes at the dollar store for a buck, but these are a better quality, and last longer.  </li>
            <li>But oral B is great and last long.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are reasonably priced and Amazon sent them right to our mail box.</li>
            <li>just too soft to clean the way I wanted them too.</li>
            <li>These work as expected and were very cost effective.  </li>
            <li>With even toothbrushes becoming a commodity full of silly bells and whistles, many of which don&#x27;t even make your teeth feel clean, the classic Oral B Indicator Contour Clean Soft Toothbrush feels like home!  </li>
            <li>I like the brushing part that this item is used for the price is decent and it was shipped right to my door.....</li>
            <li>They are also very we&#x27;ll-made and pretty for a toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I am 27 years young and just had a full set of braces put on.</li>
            <li>The different colors make it easy to leave two out one for you and another for your spouse.</li>
            <li>Item is easy to order online than going to a big box store.  </li>
            <li>Also the head is on the large side.</li>
            <li>I will certainly order again</li>
            <li>I really like the feel of these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>At about a buck and quarter a piece, they are a real bargain.</li>
            <li>so I got them for my whole family</li>
            <li>thanks to oral b</li>
            <li>Really?  </li>
            <li>Below I will share how I use this toothbrush on my very finicky gums...</li>
            <li>But it is the real Oral-B brand.</li>
            <li>Got here fast.</li>
            <li>My husband has sensitive teeth and he likes it better than the one we had with the bigger head.</li>
            <li>Nice standard toothbrush in various colors.</li>
            <li>Only problem is the soft is more of a medium.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brushed and they seem too soft or stiff, these are perfect for feeling like going to clean your teeth without taking out your gums.  </li>
            <li>These clean my teef and don&#x27;t tear my gums to heck and back.</li>
            <li>These are basic well made toothbrushes that clean your teeth just fne.</li>
            <li>They really aren&#x27;t that high quality.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special, actually.</li>
            <li>While the head is long like the good old reliable tooth brushes of the 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s, it&#x27;s not as wide as those brushes were.</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended these to me (really!); having 4 soft toothbrushes on hand is convenient and makes it easier to remember to swap them out for a new one as recommended.  </li>
            <li>If there was ever a brush that needed a new classification it would be these -- I think they should be called &#x27;Medium Soft&#x27; bristles, and that is exactly what I was searching for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Long-lasting and high quality.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it if you need a simple/to the point/inexpensive/good brand toothbrush that does the job.</li>
            <li>colors are not always great - for example, we got two brushes that were green and two of two other colors.</li>
            <li>They are okay as Oral-B toothbrushes go, but a bit on the firm side to what I have been used to.</li>
            <li>Four basic toothbrushes for someone who was too lazy to go to the store that day at a good price.</li>
            <li>It arrived very quickly and is the genuine product (not some knockoff or bootleg version).</li>
            <li>I would prefer that this brush were a wee bit larger, but it&#x27;s still quite usable and the price is right,  </li>
            <li>We didn&#x27;t even have to go to the store, which, at our age is not easy any more.</li>
            <li>There were no problems other than the fit.</li>
            <li>But I plan to keep trying new and new.</li>
            <li>I take a new one with me and throw it out when I&#x27;m heading home.</li>
            <li>and with the new appliance in my mouth, the brush felt like a rock.</li>
            <li>With my new braces, I am ALWAYS brushing my teeth, sometimes 5 times a day.</li>
            <li>and I believe it will last longer than the cheap generic types of toothbrushes do.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Maybe I just have really sensitive gums, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be able to use them because they are too firm.</li>
            <li>They are also soft enough and the right shape to use on my dog, 30lb Corgi.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I used to buy these exclusively because the handle of the toothbrush is narrow and actually fit into one of those built in toothbrush holders that some older houses have.</li>
            <li>you have similar conditions and are looking for a decent, economical toothbrush for daily use, I recommend these.</li>
            <li>The thistles are soft but firm enough to scrub your tongue and it leaves you feeling clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive teeth and am lucky to have no problems with gums or cavities, and really like a toothbrush with bristles that get in and around each tooth with a little scrubbing power.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend them but always get the soft bristles.</li>
            <li>That isn&#x27;t far from the truth.</li>
            <li>I have no idea why they&#x27;d even describe it as soft.</li>
            <li>While I like to use a toothbrush with a medium bristle, our family dentist keeps harping on switching to brushes with a soft bristle...</li>
            <li>and it says soft on the packaging!).&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I kept searching for compact, soft bristle and ended up ordering these when they kept coming up.  </li>
            <li>These are soft just as indicated.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>However, I am finding that two weeks later, and even brushing over 2 minutes, my very fussy gums DO NOT BLEED.</li>
            <li>i got a soft.</li>
            <li>So, I bought this pack of four soft bristle brushes.</li>
            <li>They seem to be well designed but they do not last more than a few weeks.</li>
            <li>The handle is too thin to get a grasp on, and the bristles fall out pretty easily.</li>
            <li>I purchased the soft version and the bristles are super sharp!  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll likely switch back to my previous brand or buy them in stores like most folks do.</li>
            <li>They last a decent amount of time before needing changing too.</li>
            <li>A tooth brush is a personal choice, but I normally buy Oral-B.  </li>
            <li>I used a new one out of the pack today and left my house.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is labled Soft, but does not feel soft enough.</li>
            <li>this is a much smaller head than the old soft 60 tooth brush.</li>
            <li>I actually like the firmness of the bristles and hadn&#x27;t realized they were supposed to be &#x27;soft&#x27; until after I ordered.</li>
            <li>These brushes seem to last well and are soft on the teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>My orthodontist cousin tells me to only buy soft bristles.</li>
            <li>and I now ordered extra so that we always have them for trips and to replace old ones with or for a guest</li>
            <li>Well I began brushing with these toothbrushes and was somewhat taken back the first time that I brushed as these are NOT SOFT bristles, they are MEDIUM bristles.</li>
            <li>This brush is okay but not great.  </li>
            <li>Exact same quality as any toothbrush I&#x27;d buy from Wal-mart or any other department store.  </li>
            <li>It is getting hard to find toothbrushes that you have to provide the elbow grease to clean your teeth.</li>
            <li>Other than that, they&#x27;re very normal toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>I can use one for brushing my teeth, one for scrubbing my feet, one for cleaning the hard to reach areas on the toilet, and finally I can clean my baseboards!</li>
            <li>At first, I was using my medium brush and found it was just too stiff for my gum line...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s average soft, not SOFT soft.  </li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>

            <li> I won&#x27;t be using this toothbrush in my mouth any longer, but I bet it would be great for cleaning jewelry or the bathroom sink!</li>

            <li> I think that this is a great value for your money.  </li>
            <li> Feels like it is doing a great job of cleaning teeth.</li>
            <li> The bristles are great</li>
            <li> Nice!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, everyones breath is good and these work out to be cheaper (including shipping) than running to the drug store to grab someone a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Nice touch with the colors!</li>
            <li> This was a good price for a great toothbrush.</li>

            <li> I felt like I wasn&#x27;t doing as good a job with these also.</li>
            <li> #34;add on&amp;#34; to qualify for free shipping and this was a perfect choice.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also good for cleaning gold clubs.</li>
            <li> and I really loved the color palette in this set.</li>
            <li> It is fairly priced and has quite durable bristles.</li>
            <li> The price is always good too.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Good price.</li>
            <li> These were a good price</li>
            <li> Pros: good value for the money</li>
            <li> These are good quality and a good buy.</li>
            <li> Good set of toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Then I use a antiseptic rinse and my teeth, mouth and gums are good to go for hours.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Of course its a good toothbrush its made by Oral B</li>
            <li> Good value otherwise.</li>

            <li> Cute and bright.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Good deal, been using these for years, what more can I say?</li>
            <li> 99% of my family all died with their own teeth and they never had electric toothbrushes or any of these &amp;#34;techie&amp;#34; things to take care of our teeth.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Kind of anal like that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice.  </li>
            <li> These are the best toothbrushes, my whole family loves them.</li>
            <li> Soft tooth brushes are the best.  </li>
            <li> If your looking for a comfortable toothbrush this is really good.</li>
            <li> A GOOD FIT FOR BRACES.</li>
            <li> Not as soft as I was expecting but work great, teeth feel clean and good value!</li>
            <li> It does clean well and feels good on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> The soft is so much better for happy teeth!</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are nice and easy to hold, and buying in bulk just makes sense.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it is a great chance for you to get these little items in a very good price</li>
            <li> just okay by me.</li>
            <li> This is our favorite brand.  </li>
            <li> My favorite toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I love these Oral-B brushes.</li>
            <li> These were just okay</li>
            <li> Maybe they don&#x27;t make it any more?</li>
            <li> I love the head size.</li>
            <li> I love the size of the toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I think you will be glad you did.</li>
            <li> I love the Oral B Toothbrush indicator,I never had any problem&#x27;s with Oral B</li>
            <li> would recommened Oral B to Family&#x27;s,you will love the Toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> It does it&#x27;s job, and I&#x27;m satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li> I Love them all.</li>
            <li> what more could I ask for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love these brushes.  </li>
            <li> What more is there say?</li>
            <li> Perhaps what most amazes me is the bristle&#x27;s inability to clump together and stick.  </li>
            <li> Water perfectly washes off all the excess toothpaste left after the brushing procedure.  </li>
            <li> Great price and really well made</li>
            <li> and I love having packs of toothbrushes in my car, at work and in my overnight bag.</li>
            <li> Glad I purchased them</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes feel more like medium toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> i may get more of these because i can&#x27;t find any i like better.</li>
            <li> What more can I say?</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I LOVE a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i love the color indicator with the oral b toothbrushes</li>
            <li> There is no comfort in the bristle head, and the &#x27;grip&#x27; is more for looks than anything.</li>
            <li> Good quality and no issues, arrives right to the front stoop.  </li>
            <li> Their long-lasting, yet effective, and the indicator is a good reminder to start using a new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> And I find that my teeth and gums feel very clean.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good deal if you ask me.</li>
            <li> I love the rubberish grip which makes use easy with no slip ups.  </li>
            <li> Great toothbrushes.. nice firm bristles and the colors are nice for our family of four to determine whose it whose. :)</li>
            <li> and I had to hit each tooth many more times than I normally do to clean each tooth.</li>
            <li> Very good for teenage girls.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the &amp;#34;attachments&amp;#34; that they put on the teeth cause more wear and tear to the toothbrushes faster than just brushing smooth teeth.</li>
            <li> They are great soft toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> I love the free shipping.  </li>
            <li> And was happy to see that they are rated the SOFT type of bristles.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m going through toothbrushes very quickly.</li>
            <li> Its handle isn&#x27;t easy to grip.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would easily create a recurring transaction for this product.</li>
            <li> Very happy about this as I have very fussy gums (sensitive) and they have responded well to my using this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> We like the comfort and the cleaning effect also the handle with the easy grip for our hands</li>
            <li> Oral-B is usually good, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this particular product again.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent toothbrush particularly for those who prefer soft brushes.</li>
            <li> It has finely tuned bristles with enamel retardant fibers, along with plaque removing sharpness.  </li>
            <li> this model is seriously the best, brush is nice and smooth but gets in there</li>
            <li> Very soft and good brush.</li>
            <li> I thought it was pretty cool to be able to buy my toothbrushes online!</li>
            <li> Feels a little lightweight and not the best quality.</li>
            <li> Rum, gin, and vodka are best, as scotch and bourbon &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; less clean.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell by the picture that they are HUGE.</li>
            <li> Great option if you are looking for something similar to what your dentist gives you!</li>
            <li> Of course, I should recommend something cheap, like anything with the Aristocrat label, or whatever the locals have.  </li>
            <li> I am happy with the quality of these toothbrushes, overall.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These were relatively cheap</li>
            <li> If you brush on a regular basis and just want some quality brushes, these are great.  </li>
            <li> There cheap</li>
            <li> as well it fit in my hand well</li>
            <li> this is not the case, these are just what I thought CHEAP</li>
            <li> I like it because it&#x27;s cheap and within expectation.</li>
            <li> Nice toothbrushes, reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I trust the brand name Oral B, however - these brushes were cheaply made.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also nice that they are in different colors so everyone in the family can have their own color out of the pack.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are very gentle with your gums, so it&#x27;s a great choice for people with sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> Even brushing as often (and long) as I do, I have no problems with this toothbrush – and it is great quality</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t scrape your gum, but they get between your teeth just fine for a good daily brushing.</li>
            <li> Got these because of the price being nice and needed soft bristle brushes.</li>
            <li> I like a more square head that brushes the whole tooth all at once.  </li>
            <li> Commenters describe these as having a full sized head.  </li>
            <li> Good for brushing and the different colors allows you to tell the difference in whose toothbrush is whose.</li>
            <li> This four-pack is priced right, they work well for me, the brush is comfortable in my hand, and the heads don&#x27;t fall apart in the six to eight weeks that I use them...</li>
            <li> If you are looking for an ideal soft toothbrush look no further.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s just to quick in my book.  </li>
            <li> The item was shipped quickly and was what it showed online</li>
            <li> For the same price, I&#x27;m sure there is better out there.</li>
            <li> An average toothbrush, nothing absolutely great.</li>
            <li> Some days this is my only &amp;#34;me time&amp;#34; and I don&#x27;t want more noise going on in my mouth!</li>
            <li> and I am brushing my teeth a lot more frequently, as well as brushing the trays,</li>
            <li> ended up purchasing Colgate which is better when it comes to sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> so it was nice to find a pack of basic ones.</li>
            <li> and this will be worth the buy.  </li>
            <li> these are listed as soft, but the handle flexes more than the bristles.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They are good, but don&#x27;t stand out in any way other than price.</li>
            <li> It is the right size and right level of firmness.</li>
            <li> price was right.</li>
            <li> They work really well clean your teeth.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Indicator Contour Clean Soft Toothbrush is a cheap, basic, toothbrush from one of the most trusted names in the business.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying these tooth brushes monthly for a year for the family -&lt;br /&gt;they&#x27;re decent, affordable - just right!</li>
            <li> For me, these are the right size, the right level of firmness, and a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> Cleans your teeth great with the hard bristles.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Pretty colors.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Definitely thought I w as getting more for my money</li>
            <li> What I find is the most helpful is brushing at moderate pressure for 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> I could get 4 toothbrushes at the dollar store for a buck, but these are a better quality, and last longer.  </li>
            <li> But oral B is great and last long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are reasonably priced and Amazon sent them right to our mail box.</li>
            <li> just too soft to clean the way I wanted them too.</li>
            <li> These work as expected and were very cost effective.  </li>
            <li> With even toothbrushes becoming a commodity full of silly bells and whistles, many of which don&#x27;t even make your teeth feel clean, the classic Oral B Indicator Contour Clean Soft Toothbrush feels like home!  </li>
            <li> I like the brushing part that this item is used for the price is decent and it was shipped right to my door.....</li>
            <li> They are also very we&#x27;ll-made and pretty for a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I am 27 years young and just had a full set of braces put on.</li>
            <li> The different colors make it easy to leave two out one for you and another for your spouse.</li>
            <li> Item is easy to order online than going to a big box store.  </li>
            <li> Also the head is on the large side.</li>
            <li> I will certainly order again</li>
            <li> I really like the feel of these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> fast shipping.</li>
            <li> At about a buck and quarter a piece, they are a real bargain.</li>
            <li> so I got them for my whole family</li>
            <li> thanks to oral b</li>
            <li> Really?  </li>
            <li> Below I will share how I use this toothbrush on my very finicky gums...</li>
            <li> But it is the real Oral-B brand.</li>
            <li> Got here fast.</li>
            <li> My husband has sensitive teeth and he likes it better than the one we had with the bigger head.</li>
            <li> Nice standard toothbrush in various colors.</li>
            <li> Only problem is the soft is more of a medium.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brushed and they seem too soft or stiff, these are perfect for feeling like going to clean your teeth without taking out your gums.  </li>
            <li> These clean my teef and don&#x27;t tear my gums to heck and back.</li>
            <li> These are basic well made toothbrushes that clean your teeth just fne.</li>
            <li> They really aren&#x27;t that high quality.  </li>
            <li> Nothing special, actually.</li>
            <li> While the head is long like the good old reliable tooth brushes of the 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s, it&#x27;s not as wide as those brushes were.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended these to me (really!); having 4 soft toothbrushes on hand is convenient and makes it easier to remember to swap them out for a new one as recommended.  </li>
            <li> If there was ever a brush that needed a new classification it would be these -- I think they should be called &#x27;Medium Soft&#x27; bristles, and that is exactly what I was searching for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Long-lasting and high quality.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it if you need a simple/to the point/inexpensive/good brand toothbrush that does the job.</li>
            <li> colors are not always great - for example, we got two brushes that were green and two of two other colors.</li>
            <li> They are okay as Oral-B toothbrushes go, but a bit on the firm side to what I have been used to.</li>
            <li> Four basic toothbrushes for someone who was too lazy to go to the store that day at a good price.</li>
            <li> It arrived very quickly and is the genuine product (not some knockoff or bootleg version).</li>
            <li> I would prefer that this brush were a wee bit larger, but it&#x27;s still quite usable and the price is right,  </li>
            <li> We didn&#x27;t even have to go to the store, which, at our age is not easy any more.</li>
            <li> There were no problems other than the fit.</li>
            <li> But I plan to keep trying new and new.</li>
            <li> I take a new one with me and throw it out when I&#x27;m heading home.</li>
            <li> and with the new appliance in my mouth, the brush felt like a rock.</li>
            <li> With my new braces, I am ALWAYS brushing my teeth, sometimes 5 times a day.</li>
            <li> and I believe it will last longer than the cheap generic types of toothbrushes do.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just have really sensitive gums, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be able to use them because they are too firm.</li>
            <li> They are also soft enough and the right shape to use on my dog, 30lb Corgi.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I used to buy these exclusively because the handle of the toothbrush is narrow and actually fit into one of those built in toothbrush holders that some older houses have.</li>
            <li> you have similar conditions and are looking for a decent, economical toothbrush for daily use, I recommend these.</li>
            <li> The thistles are soft but firm enough to scrub your tongue and it leaves you feeling clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive teeth and am lucky to have no problems with gums or cavities, and really like a toothbrush with bristles that get in and around each tooth with a little scrubbing power.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend them but always get the soft bristles.</li>
            <li> That isn&#x27;t far from the truth.</li>
            <li> I have no idea why they&#x27;d even describe it as soft.</li>
            <li> While I like to use a toothbrush with a medium bristle, our family dentist keeps harping on switching to brushes with a soft bristle...</li>
            <li> and it says soft on the packaging!).&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I kept searching for compact, soft bristle and ended up ordering these when they kept coming up.  </li>
            <li> These are soft just as indicated.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> However, I am finding that two weeks later, and even brushing over 2 minutes, my very fussy gums DO NOT BLEED.</li>
            <li> i got a soft.</li>
            <li> So, I bought this pack of four soft bristle brushes.</li>
            <li> They seem to be well designed but they do not last more than a few weeks.</li>
            <li> The handle is too thin to get a grasp on, and the bristles fall out pretty easily.</li>
            <li> I purchased the soft version and the bristles are super sharp!  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll likely switch back to my previous brand or buy them in stores like most folks do.</li>
            <li> They last a decent amount of time before needing changing too.</li>
            <li> A tooth brush is a personal choice, but I normally buy Oral-B.  </li>
            <li> I used a new one out of the pack today and left my house.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is labled Soft, but does not feel soft enough.</li>
            <li> this is a much smaller head than the old soft 60 tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I actually like the firmness of the bristles and hadn&#x27;t realized they were supposed to be &#x27;soft&#x27; until after I ordered.</li>
            <li> These brushes seem to last well and are soft on the teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> My orthodontist cousin tells me to only buy soft bristles.</li>
            <li> and I now ordered extra so that we always have them for trips and to replace old ones with or for a guest</li>
            <li> Well I began brushing with these toothbrushes and was somewhat taken back the first time that I brushed as these are NOT SOFT bristles, they are MEDIUM bristles.</li>
            <li> This brush is okay but not great.  </li>
            <li> Exact same quality as any toothbrush I&#x27;d buy from Wal-mart or any other department store.  </li>
            <li> It is getting hard to find toothbrushes that you have to provide the elbow grease to clean your teeth.</li>
            <li> Other than that, they&#x27;re very normal toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I can use one for brushing my teeth, one for scrubbing my feet, one for cleaning the hard to reach areas on the toilet, and finally I can clean my baseboards!</li>
            <li> At first, I was using my medium brush and found it was just too stiff for my gum line...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s average soft, not SOFT soft.  </li>
            <li> This is a pretty hard toothbrush.</li>
            <li> All of those other &#x27;soft&#x27; style toothbrushes felt like I was trying to brush with a wet paper towel...</li>
            <li> Bristles are NOT soft.</li>
            <li> : it is not soft  as indicated in the description of the toothbrush</li>
            <li> These claim to be soft, but are fairly stiff.  </li>
            <li> These toothbrushes have a flat spot on the handle, so that they do not not slip out of your grip when wet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Oral-B toothbrushes for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> Its plenty soft, don&#x27;t love it and don&#x27;t hate it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am single, however, I like to have extras in case of company that forgot their hygiene products.</li>
            <li> I usually prefer medium bristles but soft is dentist recommended.</li>
            <li> Given how frequently I am brushing (4 times a day, usually, based on my eating patterns), my gums are not irritated at all by them.</li>
            <li> I brush with this toothbrush: I brush (twice a day or more) for 2 to 3 minutes, however, I do not press down too hard with this toothbrush, press down too hard on the gums</li>
            <li> I have a hard time spending more money on a smaller toothbrush just because it was made for canine teeth, but this toothbrush is soft enough that my dog likes it, his gums don&#x27;t bleed, and it&#x27;s cheaper than the stupid dog tooth brushes you get at PetCo/Smart.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having a hard time finding the basic Oral B manual toothbrush -- small head, soft bristles all the same length.</li>
            <li> This is not the fault of the toothbrush, as the are delicate soft bristles, but it is the reason I chose to purchase them in bulk.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is ths product did not come in 4 different colors...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently in college and often have guests stay in my apartment for a few days.</li>
            <li> This leaves the slippery plastic to cause you to lose control of the brush if your fingers are wet.</li>
            <li> If you have trouble reaching your back teeth or find that</li>
            <li> , they are simple everyday toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I expected these toothbrushes to be softer than they were.  </li>
            <li> Its a toothbrush so not much going on here.</li>
            <li> Besides the bristles being sharp, the head of the toothbrush is very narrow and it&#x27;s hard to brush your whole tooth when the head is long and narrow.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush is much harder than what it says on the label (harder than my previous Oral-B medium</li>
            <li> with other oral-b toothbrushes i have no problem.</li>
            <li> I am the sort of person that replaces a toothbrush every other month.  </li>
            <li> The head is thinner than on any other toothbrush I have ever used.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m saving the other package for a scrubbing tool around the house.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> No complaints about it, other than the no cleaner.</li>
            <li> Maybe it is half the width of my current small head toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> This pack is not ideal for families because duplicate colors obviously don&#x27;t work well to assign each user a different color.</li>
            <li> The handle of the toothbrush is also very narrow and hard to hold, especially if you have arthritis or other problems with your grip.  </li>
            <li> The problem with this one is that it is too narrow.  </li>
            <li> I needed to have a few items to &amp;</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> It saves me a lot of trouble and money.</li>
            <li> The bristles are a little firmer than usual for a \\&quot;soft\\&quot; toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The uneven ridges of the Indicator Contour are really hard on my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Does not measure up to the usual OralB quality.</li>
            <li> Past that, there&#x27;s not a lot to say here; they&#x27;re toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> If you have small jaw and teeth, get this size of tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> the bristles are very firm....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Also, as a Biochemistry student, I can tell you that if you run out of toothpaste and mouthwash (like if your in the Caribbean), you can use hard liquor to brush your teeth.  </li>
            <li> Some products are hard to gauge buying online, this is one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller and shipping all get 5 stars A+ rating however</li>
            <li> People have mentioned the bristles being too hard.</li>
            <li> and it reaches all my  hard to reach spots in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Hard to keep up with</li>
            <li> I used to never have a toothbrush to offer them because they are often expensive and just plain hard to remember to get when you yourself are not in need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> even the body of the brush is very thin and not comfortable to hold</li>
            <li> They are hard to find!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rating this at 3 stars, which I don&#x27;t consider a bad rating, but I would say that these are not very soft if that is what you&#x27;re expecting.</li>
            <li> Not a deal breaker, but still not great.</li>
            <li> Poor to handle....</li>
            <li> It took me longer to brush my teeth because the head was too thin</li>
            <li> These are very bad for someone with soft gums.</li>
            <li> Quite possibly the worst toothbrush I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I received a wrong color set and decided to keep it.  </li>
            <li> So sorry I ordered two packages.</li>
            <li> I dislike the overly complicated toothbrushes they sell in stores</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with Oral-B.  </li>
            <li> They do the job well and aren&#x27;t too expensive.</li>
            <li> The bristle heads can&#x27;t keep up... sad to say.</li>
            <li> If you are a family of four, this may be inconvenient as you can&#x27;t distinguish which brush belongs to whom by color alone.</li>
            <li> so I can get rid of a toothbrush when I get a cold or respiratory infection (or soak them in high-alcohol mouthwash for 4-6 hours).  </li>
            <li> That may not be a bad thing since it could save your gums from being ripped apart bt those bristles.</li>
            <li> I hate having to buy toothbrushes one at a time</li>
            <li> The brushes have been fraying horribly.</li>
            <li> it thought it was a piece of hair and was instantly disgusted..</li>
            <li> Horrible experience,</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I put toothpaste on it, insert into mouth and move in circular motion...and it works!&lt;br /&gt;also, it comes with 4 of them!</li>
            <li> This brush is okay but not great.  I am sold on Oral B but not this brush.  You might like it but just okay by me.</li>
            <li> This product is Ok.  The head is smaller than the last toothbrush that I used.  I will get used to it.  It does clean well and feels good on my teeth.  My husband has sensitive teeth and he likes it better than the one we had with the bigger head.</li>
            <li> Good deal, been using these for years, what more can I say? I&#x27;d recommend them but always get the soft bristles.</li>
            <li> I like Oral-B products.  I would prefer that this brush were a wee bit larger, but it&#x27;s still quite usable and the price is right,  It does a good job and the &amp;#34;force&amp;#34; is with it.  Enough said.  Good products speak for themselves.</li>
            <li> This is a good brand of toothbrush and it made for a great stocking stuffer this Christmas season too! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Good price for the amount of toothbrushes you get. Every so often, one bristle will fall off in my mouth. Not a deal breaker, but still not great.</li>
            <li> Received product as advertised, packaged well, at fair price and in a timely manner.  I would use this merchant again.</li>
            <li> The bristles do not provide enough friction.  Feels like they are just gliding over teeth.  Will not buy  this again.</li>
            <li> Not as advertised. Bristles are NOT soft. Also the head is on the large side. Does not measure up to the usual OralB quality.</li>
            <li> I really like the feel of these toothbrushes. They are color coded so you know which one you are using. Great option if you are looking for something similar to what your dentist gives you!</li>
            <li> These are the toothbrushes I keep on hand for guests. Nice standard toothbrush in various colors. I usually prefer medium bristles but soft is dentist recommended.</li>
            <li> This is our favorite brand.  Their long-lasting, yet effective, and the indicator is a good reminder to start using a new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Poor to handle....but costs less.&lt;br /&gt;So, if you are looking only for a cheaper one, go for it.&lt;br /&gt;If you want to consider comfort and others....please refrain.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this purchase. It is getting hard to find toothbrushes that you have to provide the elbow grease to clean your teeth. Some days this is my only &amp;#34;me time&amp;#34; and I don&#x27;t want more noise going on in my mouth! 99% of my family all died with their own teeth and they never had electric toothbrushes or any of these &amp;#34;techie&amp;#34; things to take care of our teeth.&lt;br /&gt;The delivery time was great and I had no problems with this order.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended these to me (really!); having 4 soft toothbrushes on hand is convenient and makes it easier to remember to swap them out for a new one as recommended.  Pretty colors.  Oral-B works.</li>
            <li> My favorite toothbrushes. I love these Oral-B brushes. I just wish they came in larger packs! Keeping my dentist at bay!</li>
            <li> A tooth brush is a personal choice, but I normally buy Oral-B.  The problem with this one is that it is too narrow.  Maybe it is half the width of my current small head toothbrush.  I used it 3 times then tossed them in the trash.  There were no problems other than the fit.</li>
            <li> This is a very good toothbrush. Only problem is the soft is more of a medium. But it still works for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Oral-B toothbrushes for a very long time.  These work as expected and were very cost effective.  I would recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrushes.. nice firm bristles and the colors are nice for our family of four to determine whose it whose. :)</li>
            <li> This is an excellent toothbrush particularly for those who prefer soft brushes. The thistles are soft but firm enough to scrub your tongue and it leaves you feeling clean and fresh.  I love the rubberish grip which makes use easy with no slip ups.  If you are looking for an ideal soft toothbrush look no further.  This is it.</li>
            <li> Not as soft as I was expecting but work great, teeth feel clean and good value! I actually like the firmness of the bristles and hadn&#x27;t realized they were supposed to be &#x27;soft&#x27; until after I ordered.</li>
            <li> Not one of the &amp;#34;snazzy&amp;#34; Oral-B models, just does the job perfectly.  Get rave reviews from 2 different hygienists at quarterly check-ups.</li>
            <li> 5 Stars &#x3D; all expectations met.  These work great as toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, as a Biochemistry student, I can tell you that if you run out of toothpaste and mouthwash (like if your in the Caribbean), you can use hard liquor to brush your teeth.  Of course, I should recommend something cheap, like anything with the Aristocrat label, or whatever the locals have.  Rum, gin, and vodka are best, as scotch and bourbon &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; less clean.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works for me. It is the right size and right level of firmness. I like getting the multi pack because I change my toothbrush every three months as suggested.</li>
            <li> These clean my teef and don&#x27;t tear my gums to heck and back. Past that, there&#x27;s not a lot to say here; they&#x27;re toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I purchased these toothbrushes in bulk because I am doing Invisalign and I am brushing my teeth a lot more frequently, as well as brushing the trays, so I&#x27;m going through toothbrushes very quickly. Additionally, the &amp;#34;attachments&amp;#34; that they put on the teeth cause more wear and tear to the toothbrushes faster than just brushing smooth teeth. This is not the fault of the toothbrush, as the are delicate soft bristles, but it is the reason I chose to purchase them in bulk. I am happy with the quality of these toothbrushes, overall. Given how frequently I am brushing (4 times a day, usually, based on my eating patterns), my gums are not irritated at all by them.</li>
            <li> These claim to be soft, but are fairly stiff.  I have ordered 2 packs and both came with duplicate colors.  This pack is not ideal for families because duplicate colors obviously don&#x27;t work well to assign each user a different color.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to like about toothbrushes that work! These are basic well made toothbrushes that clean your teeth just fne.</li>
            <li> This is the softest and best toothbrush I have found. They are also very we&#x27;ll-made and pretty for a toothbrush. I will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time in the condition advertised.  With even toothbrushes becoming a commodity full of silly bells and whistles, many of which don&#x27;t even make your teeth feel clean, the classic Oral B Indicator Contour Clean Soft Toothbrush feels like home!  I will certainly order again</li>
            <li> with other oral-b toothbrushes i have no problem. but the brush bristles keep falling off and stuck in my braces.</li>
            <li> Got these because of the price being nice and needed soft bristle brushes. They are okay as Oral-B toothbrushes go, but a bit on the firm side to what I have been used to. Perhaps Colgate and others have a different scale of toothbrush bristle firmness? These were just okay and I&#x27;ll likely switch back to my previous brand or buy them in stores like most folks do. Some products are hard to gauge buying online, this is one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller and shipping all get 5 stars A+ rating however, they were spot on and honored the coupon clipped on Amazon. Nice!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having a hard time finding the basic Oral B manual toothbrush -- small head, soft bristles all the same length. Maybe they don&#x27;t make it any more? The uneven ridges of the Indicator Contour are really hard on my teeth and gums. Guess it&#x27;s time to change brands.</li>
            <li> A screamer of a deal.  4 pack of tooth brushes.  I am the sort of person that replaces a toothbrush every other month.  Kind of anal like that.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3DBLSRBH6K845]]My kids use them - they say they like them. Nothing special, actually. Looking nice, feels good in hand. But I plan to keep trying new and new. I do not stop on this. These are very simple- next time there will be more expensive, just this.</li>
            <li> I gave these toothbrushes a try. I don&#x27;t like them. The head is thinner than on any other toothbrush I have ever used. It took me longer to brush my teeth because the head was too thin and I had to hit each tooth many more times than I normally do to clean each tooth. I felt like I wasn&#x27;t doing as good a job with these also. I&#x27;ve never tried a generic toothbrush, but I imagine this is what they are like. I&#x27;m going back to Reach.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently in college and often have guests stay in my apartment for a few days. I used to never have a toothbrush to offer them because they are often expensive and just plain hard to remember to get when you yourself are not in need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These were relatively cheap and I could get a regular delivery of them (every 6 months). It&#x27;s great, everyones breath is good and these work out to be cheaper (including shipping) than running to the drug store to grab someone a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying these tooth brushes monthly for a year for the family -&lt;br /&gt;they&#x27;re decent, affordable - just right!</li>
            <li> These brushes seem to last well and are soft on the teeth and gums. I recommend these, especially when they are on sale.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes have a larger head. I don&#x27;t think I would order these again because they are a larger size.</li>
            <li> Quite possibly the worst toothbrush I have ever used.  I purchased the soft version and the bristles are super sharp!  I felt discomfort along my gum line after using it and when I looked in my mouth, this toothbrush had cut my gums!  Besides the bristles being sharp, the head of the toothbrush is very narrow and it&#x27;s hard to brush your whole tooth when the head is long and narrow.  I like a more square head that brushes the whole tooth all at once.  The handle of the toothbrush is also very narrow and hard to hold, especially if you have arthritis or other problems with your grip.  I won&#x27;t be using this toothbrush in my mouth any longer, but I bet it would be great for cleaning jewelry or the bathroom sink!</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes lose their shape in about 2 weeks.  That&#x27;s just to quick in my book.  Otherwise I like them but that&#x27;s enough for me to drop the stars to 2.</li>
            <li> Theses brushes are the finest I have ever used. They don&#x27;t scrape your gum, but they get between your teeth just fine for a good daily brushing. The different colors make it easy to leave two out one for you and another for your spouse. No confusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are reasonably priced and Amazon sent them right to our mail box. We didn&#x27;t even have to go to the store, which, at our age is not easy any more.</li>
            <li> The item was shipped quickly and was what it showed online</li>
            <li> price was right. fast shipping. oral-b always has the quality and recommend products for brushing teeth. very satisfied with this buy. will shop again</li>
            <li> I love the head size. You cannot find this item at your local drugstores.  I found out this size from my dentist who gave out as a thank you gift after each teeth cleaning.  If you have small jaw and teeth, get this size of tooth brush.  Very good for teenage girls.</li>
            <li> Another reviewer compared the bristles to a wire brush. That isn&#x27;t far from the truth. These bristles will rip your gums a[part if you don&#x27;t ease off the pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another problem is that Oral B put the grips along the sides of the handle instead of where your fingers and thumb contact it. This leaves the slippery plastic to cause you to lose control of the brush if your fingers are wet. That may not be a bad thing since it could save your gums from being ripped apart bt those bristles.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good deal if you ask me. I needed to have a few items to &amp;#34;add on&amp;#34; to qualify for free shipping and this was a perfect choice.  I thought it was pretty cool to be able to buy my toothbrushes online!</li>
            <li> I love the size of the toothbrushes. If you have trouble reaching your back teeth or find that you over brush your gums with bugger brushes give these a shot. I think you will be glad you did.</li>
            <li> I love the Oral B Toothbrush indicator,I never had any problem&#x27;s with Oral B and it is a great brand.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommened Oral B to Family&#x27;s,you will love the Toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice.  It&#x27;s average soft, not SOFT soft.  It does it&#x27;s job, and I&#x27;m satisfied with it.  Nice touch with the colors!</li>
            <li> I received a wrong color set and decided to keep it.  They are great soft toothbrushes.  I Love them all.</li>
            <li> I have used Oral-B indicator for a while now. They seem to be well designed but they do not last more than a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rating this at 3 stars, which I don&#x27;t consider a bad rating, but I would say that these are not very soft if that is what you&#x27;re expecting. Other than that, they&#x27;re very normal toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Indicator Contour Clean Soft Toothbrush is a cheap, basic, toothbrush from one of the most trusted names in the business. At about a buck and quarter a piece, they are a real bargain. They last a decent amount of time before needing changing too. The bristles are a little firmer than usual for a \\&quot;soft\\&quot; toothbrush. I&#x27;d say they are somewhere in between \\&quot;soft\\&quot; and \\&quot;medium\\&quot;. I like these brushes when I go on vacation. I take a new one with me and throw it out when I&#x27;m heading home. They&#x27;re also good for cleaning gold clubs. ;)</li>
            <li> Feels a little lightweight and not the best quality. Oral-B is usually good, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this particular product again.</li>
            <li> An average toothbrush, nothing absolutely great. We purchased these to put in the guest bathroom. I used one and wasn&#x27;t overly impressed, but the price is good and I believe it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty hard toothbrush. I have no idea why they&#x27;d even describe it as soft. Not what the dentist ordered.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are nice and easy to hold, and buying in bulk just makes sense. My orthodontist cousin tells me to only buy soft bristles. Great price point.</li>
            <li> I hate having to buy toothbrushes one at a time so when I saw this, it was a no-brainer. Oral-B is my go to brand and I really loved the color palette in this set. Cute and bright. It arrived very quickly and is the genuine product (not some knockoff or bootleg version).</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush. It is fairly priced and has quite durable bristles. Great product. I highly recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> great tooth brushes, great deal on the 4 count so I got them for my whole family and I now ordered extra so that we always have them for trips and to replace old ones with or for a guest, I do recommend these!</li>
            <li> While I like to use a toothbrush with a medium bristle, our family dentist keeps harping on switching to brushes with a soft bristle... so we did, and I could not stand them until we found these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before getting these Oral-B brushes, we tried a few others with &#x27;soft&#x27; bristles and they were all way too soft. I do not have sensitive teeth and am lucky to have no problems with gums or cavities, and really like a toothbrush with bristles that get in and around each tooth with a little scrubbing power. All of those other &#x27;soft&#x27; style toothbrushes felt like I was trying to brush with a wet paper towel... just too soft to clean the way I wanted them too. Not these! If there was ever a brush that needed a new classification it would be these -- I think they should be called &#x27;Medium Soft&#x27; bristles, and that is exactly what I was searching for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I go through a toothbrush about every six weeks, functionality and cost are the two biggest factors in my toothbrush purchase decision. This four-pack is priced right, they work well for me, the brush is comfortable in my hand, and the heads don&#x27;t fall apart in the six to eight weeks that I use them... what more could I ask for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have similar conditions and are looking for a decent, economical toothbrush for daily use, I recommend these.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes.  I&#x27;ve been using them for years.  I&#x27;ve tried other brushed and they seem too soft or stiff, these are perfect for feeling like going to clean your teeth without taking out your gums.  The price is always good too.  They aren&#x27;t fancy, but who needs something fancy.  If you brush on a regular basis and just want some quality brushes, these are great.  It&#x27;s also nice that they are in different colors so everyone in the family can have their own color out of the pack.</li>
            <li> i liked the product.its good to use. thanks to oral b :) :) i am very happy with the product</li>
            <li> I used to buy these exclusively because the handle of the toothbrush is narrow and actually fit into one of those built in toothbrush holders that some older houses have. Ya know, the one with the circle indent for the cup that no one has, it has 3 holes on each side of the cup spot. Anyway, I don&#x27;t have one of those ancient toothbrush holders built into my bathroom wall but I still buy these because I like &#x27;em.</li>
            <li> Prices changed dramatically on re-order</li>
            <li> Very soft and good brush. Works great.</li>
            <li> Like these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I use them, have been using them for years. They are also soft enough and the right shape to use on my dog, 30lb Corgi. I have a hard time spending more money on a smaller toothbrush just because it was made for canine teeth, but this toothbrush is soft enough that my dog likes it, his gums don&#x27;t bleed, and it&#x27;s cheaper than the stupid dog tooth brushes you get at PetCo/Smart.</li>
            <li> Great price for these top of the line manual toothbrushes.  Long-lasting and high quality.</li>
            <li> WOW! This set comes with a set of 4! They are COLOR coded. I can use one for brushing my teeth, one for scrubbing my feet, one for cleaning the hard to reach areas on the toilet, and finally I can clean my baseboards!</li>
            <li> Four basic toothbrushes for someone who was too lazy to go to the store that day at a good price. What more is there say?</li>
            <li> Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- This toothbrush is much harder than what it says on the label (harder than my previous Oral-B medium and it says soft on the packaging!).&lt;br /&gt;- It doesn&#x27;t seem to do a thorough scrubbing even though it is ADA certified.&lt;br /&gt;- Its handle isn&#x27;t easy to grip.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Good price.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  I kept searching for compact, soft bristle and ended up ordering these when they kept coming up.  I couldn&#x27;t tell by the picture that they are HUGE. I would have to unhinge my jaw to use them. So sorry I ordered two packages. I gave one to a family with 9 kids and I&#x27;m saving the other package for a scrubbing tool around the house. Hey, King Kong, I found your toothbrush.</li>
            <li> These were a good price and I like them, cheaper than at the store. I would purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> They work really well clean your teeth.Priced these in the store you can pay up to two times the price.</li>
            <li> Oral B is the best.  Soft tooth brushes are the best.  My teeth were very happy to start using these again.  I had purchased some mediums because they were on sale.  The soft is so much better for happy teeth!</li>
            <li> These are soft just as indicated.&lt;br /&gt; Wonderful not to have to visit CVS to get them.&lt;br /&gt;  A 6 month supply in one sitting</li>
            <li> Pros: good value for the money&lt;br /&gt;Cons: it is not soft  as indicated in the description of the toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;I ended up purchasing Colgate which is better when it comes to sensitive teeth (Colgate toothbrushes are more expensive)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good. I like its simple design and it is convenient to hold and use. I plan to continue using it.</li>
            <li> Commenters describe these as having a full sized head.  While the head is long like the good old reliable tooth brushes of the 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s, it&#x27;s not as wide as those brushes were.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is amazing.  It has finely tuned bristles with enamel retardant fibers, along with plaque removing sharpness.  The handle has an exquisite wax coating with nicely spaced gaps to allow for the finest grip, regardless of hand size.  Perhaps what most amazes me is the bristle&#x27;s inability to clump together and stick.  Water perfectly washes off all the excess toothpaste left after the brushing procedure.  I would recommend this toothbrush to anyone who fancies the finest of brushes with the utmost durability.  Indeed, I would use this toothbrush as the Christmas present for every one on my gift list.  Happy brushing!</li>
            <li> This was a good price for a great toothbrush. Adding it on to an existing $25 order its what clinched the deal for me.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t buy another brand.. this model is seriously the best, brush is nice and smooth but gets in there</li>
            <li> I dislike the overly complicated toothbrushes they sell in stores so it was nice to find a pack of basic ones. They are hard to find! These are good quality and a good buy.</li>
            <li> still using them so they are doing there job</li>
            <li> Good for brushing and the different colors allows you to tell the difference in whose toothbrush is whose. Cleans your teeth great with the hard bristles.</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with Oral-B.  Just keep looking for a great deal and clip the coupons and this will be worth the buy.  I love the free shipping.  Other than that, they are simple everyday toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> People have mentioned the bristles being too hard. Really?  This toothbrush is no different than what&#x27;s standard on the market.  I highly recommend it if you need a simple/to the point/inexpensive/good brand toothbrush that does the job.</li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t be buying these again.  They really aren&#x27;t that high quality.  For the same price, I&#x27;m sure there is better out there.</li>
            <li> Great brushes. There cheap and they work well. I like the shape of the brush as well it fit in my hand well and it reaches all my  hard to reach spots in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Great price and really well made and I love having packs of toothbrushes in my car, at work and in my overnight bag. Great buy.</li>
            <li> Good set of toothbrushes. They do the job well and aren&#x27;t too expensive. I will probably buy these again in the future.</li>
            <li> Definitely thought I w as getting more for my money herebut this is not the case, these are just what I thought CHEAP</li>
            <li> I use to purchase these and a bulk discount store. I am happy to have found them at Amazon for a great price. These are the best toothbrushes, my whole family loves them.</li>
            <li> At a fraction of the cost!  Packaging was sealed to perfection.  Exact same quality as any toothbrush I&#x27;d buy from Wal-mart or any other department store.  I would easily create a recurring transaction for this product.</li>
            <li> Its plenty soft, don&#x27;t love it and don&#x27;t hate it.&lt;br /&gt;They are good, but don&#x27;t stand out in any way other than price.</li>
            <li> Well I spotted the Oral-B Indicator Toothbrushes on sale in a local store and decided to try them out. And was happy to see that they are rated the SOFT type of bristles. Well I began brushing with these toothbrushes and was somewhat taken back the first time that I brushed as these are NOT SOFT bristles, they are MEDIUM bristles. However, I am finding that two weeks later, and even brushing over 2 minutes, my very fussy gums DO NOT BLEED. And I find that my teeth and gums feel very clean. Very happy about this as I have very fussy gums (sensitive) and they have responded well to my using this toothbrush. Below I will share how I use this toothbrush on my very finicky gums...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I brush with this toothbrush: I brush (twice a day or more) for 2 to 3 minutes, however, I do not press down too hard with this toothbrush, press down too hard on the gums can cause irritation I found. What I find is the most helpful is brushing at moderate pressure for 2 to 3 minutes. Then I use a antiseptic rinse and my teeth, mouth and gums are good to go for hours.&lt;br /&gt;Also I brush at night before bedtime (and sometimes after lunch), so this toothbrush gets a great workout. Even brushing as often (and long) as I do, I have no problems with this toothbrush – and it is great quality and I believe it will last longer than the cheap generic types of toothbrushes do.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not soft as indicated in the description, they&#x27;re medium soft to not soft. But it is the real Oral-B brand. Glad I purchased them</li>
            <li> For me, these are the right size, the right level of firmness, and a reasonable price.  I am in the process of ordering them again.</li>
            <li> I think that this is a great value for your money.  I am single, however, I like to have extras in case of company that forgot their hygiene products.</li>
            <li> Excellent handle, design and bristle configuration. Feels like it is doing a great job of cleaning teeth. Plenty of brushes in pack for everyone in family.</li>
            <li> They must be good because Dr. Tooth told me I really do an excellent of brushing...must be those Oral B&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> I expected these toothbrushes to be softer than they were.  Maybe I just have really sensitive gums, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be able to use them because they are too firm.</li>
            <li> I like it because it&#x27;s cheap and within expectation. I can split it with my family. It saves me a lot of trouble and money.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are very gentle with your gums, so it&#x27;s a great choice for people with sensitive gums. They also have a very pleasant handle with a good grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are not always great - for example, we got two brushes that were green and two of two other colors. If you are a family of four, this may be inconvenient as you can&#x27;t distinguish which brush belongs to whom by color alone. For me and my husband (2 people), this is obviously not a problem.</li>
            <li> these are listed as soft, but the handle flexes more than the bristles.  These are very bad for someone with soft gums.</li>
            <li> Even though these brushes aren&#x27;t nearly as soft as I would have expected, I do like the construction of them. They seem to be sensibly desiqned.</li>
            <li> I could get 4 toothbrushes at the dollar store for a buck, but these are a better quality, and last longer.  I keep extras around so I can get rid of a toothbrush when I get a cold or respiratory infection (or soak them in high-alcohol mouthwash for 4-6 hours).  I got what I wanted.</li>
            <li> What can I say? Nice toothbrushes, reasonable price. I will buy them again. I am in the process of ordering them again.</li>
            <li> Of course its a good toothbrush its made by Oral B but I was hoping it had a tounge cleaner on the head and it does not. The bristles are great i got a soft. I have teeth issues. If your looking for a comfortable toothbrush this is really good. No complaints about it, other than the no cleaner. Got here fast. Just what I ordered.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes have a flat spot on the handle, so that they do not not slip out of your grip when wet. The price is excellent.</li>
            <li> Its a toothbrush so not much going on here. But oral B is great and last long. I would buy these again.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is labled Soft, but does not feel soft enough. These toothbrushes feel more like medium toothbrush.  Good value otherwise.</li>
            <li> this is a much smaller head than the old soft 60 tooth brush. if i could find those i would buy them. i may get more of these because i can&#x27;t find any i like better.</li>
            <li> Price and conveniance We like the comfort and the cleaning effect also the handle with the easy grip for our hands</li>
            <li> the bristles are very firm....and I did not like how it feels when brushing....even the body of the brush is very thin and not comfortable to hold</li>
            <li> I like the brushing part that this item is used for the price is decent and it was shipped right to my door.....</li>
            <li> I like to brush me teeth. This item helps. What more can I say? I can&#x27;t say that I LOVE a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Item is easy to order online than going to a big box store.  Good quality and no issues, arrives right to the front stoop.  Buy with confidence.</li>
            <li> add on items are awesome&lt;br /&gt;it is a great chance for you to get these little items in a very good price&lt;br /&gt;i love the color indicator with the oral b toothbrushes</li>
            <li> My only complaint is ths product did not come in 4 different colors...only three. Hard to keep up with whos is whos toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I am 27 years young and just had a full set of braces put on. At first, I was using my medium brush and found it was just too stiff for my gum line... and with the new appliance in my mouth, the brush felt like a rock. So, I bought this pack of four soft bristle brushes. I trust the brand name Oral B, however - these brushes were cheaply made. There is no comfort in the bristle head, and the &#x27;grip&#x27; is more for looks than anything. The handle is too thin to get a grasp on, and the bristles fall out pretty easily. With my new braces, I am ALWAYS brushing my teeth, sometimes 5 times a day. The bristle heads can&#x27;t keep up... sad to say. I will stick with Oral B for the next pack I buy (I go through toothbrushes a lot), but will try a different model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** UPDATE 6/17/13 **&lt;br /&gt;NOT A GOOD FIT FOR BRACES. The brushes have been fraying horribly. I used a new one out of the pack today and left my house. I was on the highway and felt something in my mouth.. it thought it was a piece of hair and was instantly disgusted.. but the mirror proved to be a bristle from the toothbrush. It was caught in my bracket.. if I didn&#x27;t have a wire cutter device in my car (from when I broke a wire) then I would have had to either purchase one or wait till I got home. Horrible experience, but I guess I got what I paid for.</li>
