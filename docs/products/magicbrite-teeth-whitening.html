            <li>Love the light ..</li>
            <li>Amazing results for a good price and customer service was above and beyond</li>
            <li>The product was just fine.</li>
            <li>Love it and it works quick too</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a couple weeks now and can see a huge difference in my teeth</li>
            <li>There is a reason this product is cheap.</li>
            <li>formula.i received mine free as part of a promotion for testing and evaluation purposes</li>
            <li>In a few uses I&#x27;ll have pearly whites and everyone will be jealous :D</li>
            <li>You will get a syringe filled withe the whitening gel.  </li>
            <li>You will also get a n led light , to hold in front of your teeth that starts the whiting process.  </li>
            <li>I was given a discount for providing honest and unbiased feedback on this product based on my own personal experience</li>
            <li>I received this product at a deep discount  for testing of review of my own honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>This is super easy to use.</li>
            <li>A difference I can smile about!</li>
            <li>works great just be careful not to burn your gums</li>
            <li>They are SPLOTCHY bright white!</li>
            <li>I compared this to other custom made dental trays and decided based on other reviews that this one would best suit my needs, as it covers more teeth and appeared to be a more quality product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The instructions might scare you at first because it seems like a lot of steps, but this kit is beyond easy.</li>
            <li>received  this product for free or discount  for an honest  review as stated above</li>
            <li>Everything came quickly.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>but I like a white smile more!</li>
            <li>I am scared to smile.</li>
            <li>An economical alternative to much higher priced  teeth whitening kits out there.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to see how much brighter my smile gets once I use the whole gel I have !!</li>
            <li>The kit includes 2 swabs to prepare your gums , a pre-filled syringe filled with the teeth whitening gel , a set of trays for the upper and teeth ,a chart to compare the results of the whitening effects and an LED light to help accelerate the effects of the gel.</li>
            <li>If you want a whiter smile, this is certainly the product for you, I am so thankful I was offered this at a lower rate for my review.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t use it all the first application at all.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be using this again because I really love my coffee, and I smoke</li>
            <li>What do I do if my blue light does not work?!</li>
            <li>and I cannot really notice them in anymore!  </li>
            <li>Worked the first try.</li>
            <li>When that is complete, you add your gel according to directions, and then hold the led light over your teeth for the time stated,  Remove the molds and wipe off any access gel.  </li>
            <li>I brush my teeth, put on the gel and trays, sometimes I use the light for a few minutes and then sit and write or watch a show while the magic gel does it&#x27;s thing.</li>
            <li>Very simple and easy to use, put the molds in hot water and then put into your mouth to mold the impression of your teeth.  </li>
            <li>Like many people have said, you really do not want to use that much gel in each tooth, as even my first time I squeezed the syringe too much and had a large goop of gel come out</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t taste like sunshine and rainbows, but even this is much preferable to some of the gag-inducing tastes of others I have</li>
            <li>I can tell this, it does NOT take as much as you might think</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t get all punchy and squeeze out a whole syringe of gel.</li>
            <li>It works really well and did not cause my teeth or gums any sensitivity.</li>
            <li>Everything shown in the picture came, the light worked, my teeth are actually whiter!</li>
            <li>This is a very cost saving kit that you would expect to pay at a dental office.  </li>
            <li>So brighten your smile today by using the MagicBrite Complete Teeth Whitening Kit.  </li>
            <li>my teeth are so much whiter</li>
            <li>I was excited to have the opportunity to review the MagicBrite and as somebody that has tried out numerous teeth whitening products I found this one to truly be the simplest.</li>
            <li>Overall not a bad purchase.</li>
            <li>The first time I used the trays, they were a bit stiff, but as I used them a few more times, they became more flexible and soft.</li>
            <li>so I thought it was normal</li>
            <li>It has easily become a part of my daily routine and because of the noticeable difference I have already seen I would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even wear it for 10 minutes because it hurts my teeth, and then makes them very sensitive..</li>
            <li>Super sharp pain in my teeth.</li>
            <li>really well you will notice a big change</li>
            <li>This messy little-to-no-results cheap kit is just not working for me..</li>
            <li>The mouth molds are a dental grade and the whitening gel is a professional grade.  </li>
            <li>Finally an affordable solution to a not so sparkling smile that actually WORKS!</li>
            <li>The same usage with other products will net better results - and this comes from someone who has whitened their teeth for years.</li>
            <li>I am just starting to use this product, I will update review in a few weeks!  :)</li>
            <li>Simply take a few moments and follow the directions to mold the teeth trays to your teeth for a custom fit that will ensure the whitening gel stays where it is supposed to</li>
            <li>For $5 less I would say it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>and I freaked out, which led to a large quantity of gel coming out of the trays when I bit down.</li>
            <li>At first I was a bit skeptical about doing a home whitening system, but I decided why not give it a try, since teeth are one of the things I am very self conscious about.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if this is due to having them around my teeth or maybe just using them breaks them in, but after about 4 uses they fit my teeth like a glove</li>
            <li>/&gt;It wasn&#x27;t a waste but with the price I expected a little more.</li>

            <li> On a rare occasion I&#x27;d have a brief sharp pain in my teeth from it which is pretty scary.</li>
            <li> Use this kit as needed and less if you have sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> After years of trying other kits and products, I am finally seeing a difference!</li>
            <li> Not only was this EXTREMELY messy and made me look like a rabid animal while using it, it simply doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I have really bad teeth sadly , and have been dying to try one of these whitening kits and honestly have always kind of skeptical about them</li>
            <li> I saw little to no improvement no matter how long I used them.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I can use the rest later</li>
            <li> Doesnt work as well as some of the other store bought brands ive used.</li>
            <li> I read in the other reviews that .it burns, but I had no discomfort at all.</li>
            <li> Its not good to use peroxide on your teeth regularly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a slight difference in color of teeth but not a huge one.</li>
            <li> And don&#x27;t toss the little cap.</li>
            <li> It says in the instructions that it will burn a little no matter what you do</li>
            <li> it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few 30 minute sessions and 1 or 2 hour sessions and literally, NO results.</li>
            <li> You form the molding tray like a mouth guard, a few seconds in boiling water.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had the product for a few days..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a not strong material.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s messy and tastes pretty bad.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using this for about 5 days I believe and it has worked wonder within those little days!</li>
            <li> I usually do my whitening in the evening.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little confused as I was told that I would receive an email with instructions on how to use this whitening system.</li>
            <li> its a slow process.</li>
            <li> slow contact.</li>
            <li> these gels are all useless, just peroxide in a past form.</li>
            <li> So, annoyed!.</li>
            <li> Slightly weird feeling when using them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so mad and upset.</li>
            <li> I received the MagicBrite Teeth Whitening Kit to review and I will admit to being very skeptical.</li>
            <li> but DON&#x27;T USE IF YOU HAVE ANY CAVITY&#x27;S. its tremendously painful.</li>
            <li> Horrible and burned my gums.</li>
            <li> AWFUL!</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Used 3 times now and haven&#x27;t noticed a difference yet.  Will keep using to find out...</li>
            <li> There is a reason this product is cheap. It&#x27;s a not strong material. The same usage with other products will net better results - and this comes from someone who has whitened their teeth for years. Spend the extra money and avoid this garbage..</li>
            <li> It did NOT work. it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t give good direction and basically didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> This product work perfectly for me!!! Use 3 times and i see results</li>
            <li> used this product once before works really well you will notice a big change</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this product  4 stars as i didn&#x27;t receive a booklet or instructions on how to use it. as for the results i got after figuring it out was pretty good. its a slow process. but you can see them,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received  this product for free or discount  for an honest  review as stated above</li>
            <li> I did not like this at all. Not only was this EXTREMELY messy and made me look like a rabid animal while using it, it simply doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ve tried a few 30 minute sessions and 1 or 2 hour sessions and literally, NO results. On a rare occasion I&#x27;d have a brief sharp pain in my teeth from it which is pretty scary. I honestly should have just used whitening strips and would suggest others use them as well. This messy little-to-no-results cheap kit is just not working for me..</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me...</li>
            <li> Finally an affordable solution to a not so sparkling smile that actually WORKS! This is super easy to use. You form the molding tray like a mouth guard, a few seconds in boiling water. Be sure to mold it well against your teeth shape. Put a little gel in the trays (not too much or you could really hurt your gums) and wear the tray for no more than 15 minutes. Rinse your mouth and lightly brush your teeth to remove any remaining whitening gel and voila! your done. There is one application per syringe but I didn&#x27;t use it all the first application at all. I&#x27;m not sure if I can use the rest later but I&#x27;m going to try. These really worked great and according to the shade guide I went from about an 11 to an 7 in one session. Awesome! I will definitely be using this again because I really love my coffee, and I smoke but I like a white smile more! I do recommend this whitening formula.i received mine free as part of a promotion for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on the results I achieved using this and the ease and quickness of use! Great whitener!</li>
            <li> It came super fast, great product!</li>
            <li> Love the light ..speeds up process did see a difference .</li>
            <li> I am just starting to use this product, I will update review in a few weeks!  :)</li>
            <li> I just received the product. I&#x27;m a little confused as I was told that I would receive an email with instructions on how to use this whitening system. I have yet to see any email and I&#x27;ve had the product for a few days..</li>
            <li> Love it and it works quick too</li>
            <li> I used it religiously every day since i received it. I see no difference in the color ofmy teeth.</li>
            <li> The machine doesn&#x27;t work. Very cheap quality.</li>
            <li> Doesnt work as well as some of the other store bought brands ive used. burned my gums. ouchie</li>
            <li> good product but DON&#x27;T USE IF YOU HAVE ANY CAVITY&#x27;S. its tremendously painful.</li>
            <li> What do I do if my blue light does not work?! So, annoyed!.</li>
            <li> Would not purchase this again. I can&#x27;t even wear it for 10 minutes because it hurts my teeth, and then makes them very sensitive..</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using this for about 5 days I believe and it has worked wonder within those little days! I have really bad teeth sadly , and have been dying to try one of these whitening kits and honestly have always kind of skeptical about them but after this I definitely recommend and believe they work! Can&#x27;t wait to see how much brighter my smile gets once I use the whole gel I have !! Thanks!!</li>
            <li> The product was just fine. It is below the standards of the similar type of teeth whitening kit products.&lt;br /&gt;Very slow contact. I have contacted the business but never get a reply.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product. I got multiple uses out of it and there is a noticable difference in the color of my teeth.  I read in the other reviews that .it burns, but I had no discomfort at all. I am rating it four stars only because the tray would not form to my bottom teeth.</li>
            <li> FINALLY!! A Teeth whitening system that actually works! I received the MagicBrite Teeth Whitening Kit to review and I will admit to being very skeptical. VERY!&lt;br /&gt;I have tried several different kinds of &amp;#34;paint-on&amp;#34; whiteners, numerous brands of whitening toothpaste and strips that stick to teeth. I saw little to no improvement no matter how long I used them.&lt;br /&gt;This MagicBrite kit is everything you want a whitening system to be! Well almost everything. It doesn&#x27;t taste like sunshine and rainbows, but even this is much preferable to some of the gag-inducing tastes of others I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;The instructions might scare you at first because it seems like a lot of steps, but this kit is beyond easy. Simply take a few moments and follow the directions to mold the teeth trays to your teeth for a custom fit that will ensure the whitening gel stays where it is supposed to and then every time you use it after that it is a breeze.I usually do my whitening in the evening. I brush my teeth, put on the gel and trays, sometimes I use the light for a few minutes and then sit and write or watch a show while the magic gel does it&#x27;s thing.This kit has enough for plenty applications. I can tell this, it does NOT take as much as you might think so don&#x27;t get all punchy and squeeze out a whole syringe of gel. And don&#x27;t toss the little cap. You&#x27;ll need them to recap the syringe.I am very happy with the results I have seen with this kit. It has more than exceeded my expectations. After years of trying other kits and products, I am finally seeing a difference! A difference I can smile about!</li>
            <li> Everything came quickly. The light works great!  Make sure you follow the directions and you will see great results!</li>
            <li> This did NOT whiten my teeth it did however whiten and burn the s*** out of my gums! It says in the instructions that it will burn a little no matter what you do so I thought it was normal but no. It hurts and doesn&#x27;t do jack squat.</li>
            <li> these gels are all useless, just peroxide in a past form. Its not good to use peroxide on your teeth regularly.</li>
            <li> Horrible and burned my gums.</li>
            <li> Slightly weird feeling when using them. I am used to making mouth guards for sports though and this felt similar to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a slight difference in color of teeth but not a huge one. Maybe i should habe left it longer. For $5 less I would say it&#x27;s worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t a waste but with the price I expected a little more. Overall not a bad purchase. I don&#x27;t regret it. I just don&#x27;t know if I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> At first I was a bit skeptical about doing a home whitening system, but I decided why not give it a try, since teeth are one of the things I am very self conscious about. I compared this to other custom made dental trays and decided based on other reviews that this one would best suit my needs, as it covers more teeth and appeared to be a more quality product.  After placing the mold in hot water, it formed to my teeth perfectly and was so easy to use!  The first time I used the trays, they were a bit stiff, but as I used them a few more times, they became more flexible and soft. I am not sure if this is due to having them around my teeth or maybe just using them breaks them in, but after about 4 uses they fit my teeth like a glove and I cannot really notice them in anymore!  Like many people have said, you really do not want to use that much gel in each tooth, as even my first time I squeezed the syringe too much and had a large goop of gel come out and I freaked out, which led to a large quantity of gel coming out of the trays when I bit down. Once you get the hang of it though, it is a great product. After about two weeks I noticed great results! You can look up a teeth shade guide online, my teeth went from about a 3.5 to a 1 in just around 15 uses, and I was ecstatic!  If you want a whiter smile, this is certainly the product for you, I am so thankful I was offered this at a lower rate for my review.</li>
            <li> An economical alternative to much higher priced  teeth whitening kits out there. It works really well and did not cause my teeth or gums any sensitivity.The kit includes 2 swabs to prepare your gums , a pre-filled syringe filled with the teeth whitening gel , a set of trays for the upper and teeth ,a chart to compare the results of the whitening effects and an LED light to help accelerate the effects of the gel. I was happy with the kit and results.My teeth did look whiter after using this product.  * I was given a discount for providing honest and unbiased feedback on this product based on my own personal experience *</li>
            <li> works great just be careful not to burn your gums</li>
            <li> Worked the first try. I noticed my teeth whiter. Still need more installments</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!! Everything shown in the picture came, the light worked, my teeth are actually whiter! In a few uses I&#x27;ll have pearly whites and everyone will be jealous :D</li>
            <li> Comes with everything seen 🙌 and instructions</li>
            <li> The magic brite  complete teeth whitening kits is awesome.  I have been using it for a couple weeks now and can see a huge difference in my teeth, I have even had people ask me what I have been doing to make my teeth whiter.  In this kit you will get a teeth coloring chart so you can determine the amount of whitening that you want or need.  You will get 2 molds, one for your upper and one for your lower teeth.  You will get a syringe filled withe the whitening gel.  You will also get a n led light , to hold in front of your teeth that starts the whiting process.  Very simple and easy to use, put the molds in hot water and then put into your mouth to mold the impression of your teeth.  When that is complete, you add your gel according to directions, and then hold the led light over your teeth for the time stated,  Remove the molds and wipe off any access gel.  The mouth molds are a dental grade and the whitening gel is a professional grade.  Use this kit as needed and less if you have sensitive teeth.  This is a very cost saving kit that you would expect to pay at a dental office.  It saves you time by being able to use it at your own convenience hence another money saver . So brighten your smile today by using the MagicBrite Complete Teeth Whitening Kit.  This product is sold by National Distributors .  I received this product at a deep discount  for testing of review of my own honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Pearl Enterprise MagicBrite teeth whitening kit for over a week now and have already seen a notable difference. It has a very pleasant taste and the ultra-violet light is super easy to use. I was excited to have the opportunity to review the MagicBrite and as somebody that has tried out numerous teeth whitening products I found this one to truly be the simplest. It has easily become a part of my daily routine and because of the noticeable difference I have already seen I would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> AWFUL! Super sharp pain in my teeth. They are SPLOTCHY bright white! Hideous to look at! I am scared to smile. I&#x27;ve never wrote a review for anything on here before and I HAVE to with this! DO NOT BUY. I will probably have to make an appointment to see what I can do about this. I have only used it once for probably 20 minutes total. It&#x27;s messy and tastes pretty bad. I&#x27;m so mad and upset.</li>
            <li> I love it I wish I would have took a before picture</li>
            <li> Amazing results for a good price and customer service was above and beyond i will be purchasing from them again but for under $12 u can not beat this deal my teeth are so much whiter I&#x27;m happy with my results</li>
