            <li>Enjoy..</li>
            <li>It is a light oil.  </li>
            <li>So I tried it on my hair and it made it so smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>if it works i haven&#x27;t noticed a significant change in my hair</li>
            <li>works great for frizzy hair, dry hair and color treated hair.</li>
            <li>And the smell is very musky and sexy.</li>
            <li>I thought this would smell like cookies or sweet.</li>
            <li>I am in the process of treating my own hair naturally.</li>
            <li>i would buy this product in full size.</li>
            <li>Ideal to tame the tresses.</li>
            <li>I am very glad I didn&#x27;t spend more or buy any of the other products like I intended too.</li>
            <li>The shipping was super fast!!</li>
            <li>I bought this product at ULTA after hearing great reviews, the one from this seller is exactly the same as the one from ULTA and itÂ´s a lot cheaper, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>If I could afford to buy it more frequently, I&#x27;d smear it all over my hair.</li>
            <li>, it has a nice deep &amp; musky scent to it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really worth it.</li>
            <li>I am returning it right away.</li>
            <li>It smells good, does not weight down hair or leave it feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>And i was so surprised at how nice soft and moisturized this product made my hair feel.</li>
            <li>I bought my first 1 oz bottle in December</li>
            <li>I use it every day, and it allows me to go straight or curly without frizz!  </li>
            <li>It could be ok to be put in a handbag or for short travel.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using this product.</li>
            <li>I have tried other products and this not only makes my hair silky smooth, but it smells really good.</li>
            <li>Great at fighting frizz; really helpful for getting your hair smooth (especially when braiding) or just adding a little shine.</li>
            <li>So if you have relaxed hair then give this a try, but would probably work way better if you get your hair relaxed and flat ironed first.</li>
            <li>I recommend trying this out, I had a really good experience, but you could always start with a smaller bottle since everyone&#x27;s hair is different!</li>
            <li>Amazon has the best price that I have found so far, and the little bottle really does last for a quite a while.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair super soft</li>
            <li>it was silky, smooth and not dry or brittle at all.  </li>
            <li>Are satisfied to soften dry hair quickly.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>This thing helps to keep my hair looking, feeling, and actually being great WITHOUT weighing my hair down</li>
            <li>Only a little dab of the product helps with control and produces a great shine on ones tresses.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle when I purchased this product for my frizzy hair but it worked really well.</li>
            <li>this oil has really truly helped save it from breaking off..</li>
            <li>My wife used it and found it really helpful.</li>
            <li>and it really worked well on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this oil.</li>
            <li>generally don&#x27;t like strong scents and this product has a masculine scent that lingers</li>
            <li>I am of indian decent my hair is between straight and wavy...</li>
            <li>It made me feel like my puffball of a head had hope to be normal, haha.</li>
            <li>Even though this thing is supposed to revive dry hair, I think it&#x27;s too light to do that for my hair since it&#x27;s relaxed.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this over John Frieda Frizz Ease, Shine, or Argan oil.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>It helps the control the frizzes, which are the result of high humidity in our area.  </li>
            <li>It smells good and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>The cost versus the actual results weren&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>and I got so many compliments that my hair looks healthier when I blow dried it.</li>
            <li>This oil leaves your my hair soft and shiny and genuinely makes my hair dry faster.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product first in a different store 0.34 oz.</li>
            <li>smells better than the previous more expensive brand i was using, makes hair soft and shiny, but easily gets limp and greasy if you use too much</li>
            <li>i applied this product over the leave in conditioner and it made sooooo unbelievably soft.</li>
            <li>i am Cuba-Haitian of Caribbean descent with natural.</li>
            <li>My hair turns out really soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>it leaves your hair so soft and shiny with just one drop.</li>
            <li>I opened the bottle and was surprised to notice a moldy smell.</li>
            <li>It makes it so soft</li>
            <li>It leaves me hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>My hair feels really soft every time I use this product</li>
            <li>I was surprised.</li>
            <li>It definitely makes my hair smoother, softer, and much easier to comb and brush through.</li>
            <li>It made it feel so hydrated and moisturized yet not heavy.</li>
            <li>It does come out of the bottle fast; only a dime size is needed.  </li>
            <li>Although it doesn&#x27;t necessarily add shine, I do see that my hair is much softer and silky.</li>
            <li>A small amount of this stuff moisturizes my hair smoth, soft, shiny and easily manageable.  </li>
            <li>This helps keep my hair from frizzing without making it look greasy (as long as I don&#x27;t use too much).</li>
            <li>I was hesitant because it&#x27;s such a thick oil, but it really does work fantastic.</li>
            <li>If I use it when my hair is dry and damaged it won&#x27;t work, it just dissolves too much into my hair.</li>
            <li>, I use just a little of this in the palm of my hand and rub it through the ends of my hair (not on the scalp or your hair will feel greasy), it makes it soft and silky and really helps with damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>and I barely ran out of it last week.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t weigh hair down much.  </li>
            <li>My hair is dry and this completely helps it.</li>
            <li>I have thick but baby fine hair that gets very dry and staticky, especially in the winter.  </li>

            <li> So if you have relaxed hair then give this a try, but would probably work way better if you get your hair relaxed and flat ironed first.</li>
            <li> I recommend trying this out, I had a really good experience, but you could always start with a smaller bottle since everyone&#x27;s hair is different!</li>
            <li> Amazon has the best price that I have found so far, and the little bottle really does last for a quite a while.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair super soft</li>
            <li> it was silky, smooth and not dry or brittle at all.  </li>
            <li> Are satisfied to soften dry hair quickly.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> This thing helps to keep my hair looking, feeling, and actually being great WITHOUT weighing my hair down</li>
            <li> Only a little dab of the product helps with control and produces a great shine on ones tresses.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle when I purchased this product for my frizzy hair but it worked really well.</li>
            <li> this oil has really truly helped save it from breaking off..</li>
            <li> My wife used it and found it really helpful.</li>
            <li> and it really worked well on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this oil.</li>
            <li> generally don&#x27;t like strong scents and this product has a masculine scent that lingers</li>
            <li> I am of indian decent my hair is between straight and wavy...</li>
            <li> It made me feel like my puffball of a head had hope to be normal, haha.</li>
            <li> Even though this thing is supposed to revive dry hair, I think it&#x27;s too light to do that for my hair since it&#x27;s relaxed.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this over John Frieda Frizz Ease, Shine, or Argan oil.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> It helps the control the frizzes, which are the result of high humidity in our area.  </li>
            <li> It smells good and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The cost versus the actual results weren&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> and I got so many compliments that my hair looks healthier when I blow dried it.</li>
            <li> This oil leaves your my hair soft and shiny and genuinely makes my hair dry faster.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product first in a different store 0.34 oz.</li>
            <li> smells better than the previous more expensive brand i was using, makes hair soft and shiny, but easily gets limp and greasy if you use too much</li>
            <li> i applied this product over the leave in conditioner and it made sooooo unbelievably soft.</li>
            <li> i am Cuba-Haitian of Caribbean descent with natural.</li>
            <li> My hair turns out really soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> it leaves your hair so soft and shiny with just one drop.</li>
            <li> I opened the bottle and was surprised to notice a moldy smell.</li>
            <li> It makes it so soft</li>
            <li> It leaves me hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> My hair feels really soft every time I use this product</li>
            <li> I was surprised.</li>
            <li> It definitely makes my hair smoother, softer, and much easier to comb and brush through.</li>
            <li> It made it feel so hydrated and moisturized yet not heavy.</li>
            <li> It does come out of the bottle fast; only a dime size is needed.  </li>
            <li> Although it doesn&#x27;t necessarily add shine, I do see that my hair is much softer and silky.</li>
            <li> A small amount of this stuff moisturizes my hair smoth, soft, shiny and easily manageable.  </li>
            <li> This helps keep my hair from frizzing without making it look greasy (as long as I don&#x27;t use too much).</li>
            <li> I was hesitant because it&#x27;s such a thick oil, but it really does work fantastic.</li>
            <li> If I use it when my hair is dry and damaged it won&#x27;t work, it just dissolves too much into my hair.</li>
            <li> , I use just a little of this in the palm of my hand and rub it through the ends of my hair (not on the scalp or your hair will feel greasy), it makes it soft and silky and really helps with damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> and I barely ran out of it last week.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t weigh hair down much.  </li>
            <li> My hair is dry and this completely helps it.</li>
            <li> I have thick but baby fine hair that gets very dry and staticky, especially in the winter.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very pricey for such a small container, but it lasts a while.</li>
            <li> I get my hair relaxed/ or get it washed and flat ironed and then a day passes</li>
            <li> The product only last 2 weeks as to other products lasting close to 2 months for the same price.</li>
            <li> a lil product goes a long way, so this will last forever.</li>
            <li> and it still has that freshly flat ironed look!</li>
            <li> My hair was dry and needed to go get relaxed and flat ironed, but I hadn&#x27;t gone to the salon as yet.</li>
            <li> Long, curly hair.</li>
            <li> have used it for a long time now</li>
            <li> But, due to the cost, I limit its use to the ends of my hair prior to blowdrying.</li>
            <li> mixed with other hair oils</li>
            <li> I thought it was just my sense of smell, so I went ahead and put it in my still dry hair.</li>
            <li> After I towel dry my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it ever since after each blow dry.</li>
            <li> I colored my hair and my hair was brittle and dry.  </li>
            <li> Even though it feels pretty thick coming out of the bottle, it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair or make it greasy</li>
            <li> You only need a tiny bit of product per use so my small bottle has lasted a really long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way and this bottle will last you a longgg time.</li>
            <li> I work it through my hair while it is still wet and just let it air dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other types of hair oils that work just well and were much more expensive, so I&#x27;m a huge fan of this less expensive option!</li>
            <li> I washed my hair and then put some of the oil in while it was still wet.  </li>
            <li> For some unknown reasons, I thought it&#x27;s bigger.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this after bleaching parts of my dark hair because I found that my hair was extremely dry and prone to tangles.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> but i guess a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and consistency of this, and I find that even this little bottle lasts me a long time.</li>
            <li> only complain that the bottle is too small.</li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t like it because it smelled weird.</li>
            <li> , a little goes a long way,  it does not weight down my hair nor does it get my hair oily...  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult for me to find products that do much of a difference</li>
            <li> But not worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I have very coarse, thick transitioning hair.</li>
            <li> It never weighs my hair down.</li>
            <li> usually put a little bit of the oil on my comb and comb through my wet hair after a shower.</li>
            <li> bad .. hard Strong Man knockoff.&lt;br /&gt;Used</li>
            <li> i know a lot us dark girls have that problem!</li>
            <li> it feel a little bit softer but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> When my husband came home, he stopped a few feet from me and asked what that horrid smell was..</li>
            <li> My hair is kind of treated real bad with heating tools, hair coloring and all</li>
            <li> After I blow dried my hair</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not strong so</li>
            <li> the smell of shampoo usually covers it.</li>
            <li> The bottle is small</li>
            <li> i put a small amount in before blow drying on my damp hair and although i dont see SHINE..</li>
            <li> Usually, my hair is a bit fuzzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t like is the small amount of oil.</li>
            <li> I put a small dab on my hand and then rub into each side of my hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair, so some people may want to use less.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product thinking it was natural but the ingredient list is really bad, tons of chemicals and even petroleum derived dyes.</li>
            <li> Lolz sounds confusing, but</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this bottle is so small.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this to me and I&#x27;m totally addicted!</li>
            <li> , maybe I just got a bad bottle.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this brand</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This helps keep my hair from frizzing without making it look greasy (as long as I don&#x27;t use too much). It doesn&#x27;t have the best smell but it&#x27;s not strong so the smell of shampoo usually covers it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! If I could afford to buy it more frequently, I&#x27;d smear it all over my hair. But, due to the cost, I limit its use to the ends of my hair prior to blowdrying. It makes my hair smell so lovely all day, and it helps protect my hair from damage.</li>
            <li> I have alot of hair. Alot. Long, curly hair. It&#x27;s difficult for me to find products that do much of a difference and I heard great reviews on this, so I wanted to give it a whirl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it made my hair softer and more manageable and silkier. It made me feel like my puffball of a head had hope to be normal, haha. I recommend trying this out, I had a really good experience, but you could always start with a smaller bottle since everyone&#x27;s hair is different!</li>
            <li> It smells amazing, it is lovely on the hair, doesn&#x27;t make it greasy, it only hydrates and leaves it whiny and smooth and great smelling! Please make a perfume that smells like this!!!</li>
            <li> i applied this product over the leave in conditioner and it made sooooo unbelievably soft. i am Cuba-Haitian of Caribbean descent with natural. And i was so surprised at how nice soft and moisturized this product made my hair feel.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle when I purchased this product for my frizzy hair but it worked really well. I work it through my hair while it is still wet and just let it air dry. My hair turns out really soft and manageable. It never weighs my hair down. It smells good and a little bit goes a long way. I bought my first 1 oz bottle in December and I barely ran out of it last week. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different products and this one blows them all away. I highly recommend this over John Frieda Frizz Ease, Shine, or Argan oil. The shampoo and conditioner work equally as well although you don&#x27;t HAVE to use them in conjunction with this product.</li>
            <li> i love this oil.. you dont even need a dime size amount, just rub it in between your hands to warm it up and work into your ends.. i had a dying mishap and my hair got fried..this oil has really truly helped save it from breaking off.. totally worth it :)</li>
            <li> boy oh boy...this is like a miracle for my hair...its light, non greasy, smells yummy &amp; leaves my hair feeling silky &amp; soft...speedy delivery &amp; much pleased with this product...will use it like forever</li>
            <li> I started using this product about six months ago, and LOVE the way it makes my hair look and feel.  I use it every day, and it allows me to go straight or curly without frizz!  It&#x27;s fantastic! Amazon has the best price that I have found so far, and the little bottle really does last for a quite a while.</li>
            <li> this is a great product! it leaves your hair so soft and shiny with just one drop. a little goes a long way and this bottle will last you a longgg time.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: I found another brand of Argan oil that is way better! It&#x27;s [[ASIN:B001U9M2EW Agadir  Argan Oil Treatment, 4-Ounce]] and it&#x27;s amazing! It absorbs way better than Macadamia and I just love it! Try them both and see what you like but Agadir I feel is easier to spread in my hair and I just like it better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the travel pack with the 1 ounce version of this to test it out. My hair was dry and needed to go get relaxed and flat ironed, but I hadn&#x27;t gone to the salon as yet. Even though this thing is supposed to revive dry hair, I think it&#x27;s too light to do that for my hair since it&#x27;s relaxed. If I use it when my hair is dry and damaged it won&#x27;t work, it just dissolves too much into my hair. It doesn&#x27;t work to \\&quot;bring back\\&quot; my hair like it&#x27;s purpose, but rather it maintains the moisture &amp; good look, so I get my hair relaxed/ or get it washed and flat ironed and then a day passes and then I&#x27;d use the oil for like 3 days in a row after, and after that my hair keeps moisturized and I won&#x27;t have to apply it until maybe 2 days after or until after I wash it. Lolz sounds confusing, but yeah, &amp; oh it smells great too, it has a nice deep &amp; musky scent to it. This thing helps to keep my hair looking, feeling, and actually being great WITHOUT weighing my hair down -cuz i know a lot us dark girls have that problem! But my hair can still move and all and it still has that freshly flat ironed look! So if you have relaxed hair then give this a try, but would probably work way better if you get your hair relaxed and flat ironed first. This has been a God send for me :D</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing!!!I love it so much!It smells like angel perfume by theory Mugler &amp; this price is fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I really liked the product. But not worth the cost. The product only last 2 weeks as to other products lasting close to 2 months for the same price. For this reason I will not be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an excellent oil for hair treatment. My wife used it and found it really helpful. Unfortunately, this bottle is so small. It could be ok to be put in a handbag or for short travel. Next time the wife asks for it, I&#x27;m going for a bigger bottle. Enjoy..</li>
            <li> I have thick but baby fine hair that gets very dry and staticky, especially in the winter.  A small amount of this stuff moisturizes my hair smoth, soft, shiny and easily manageable.  This is my one must-have hair product.  I&#x27;ve used other types of hair oils that work just well and were much more expensive, so I&#x27;m a huge fan of this less expensive option!</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this to me and I&#x27;m totally addicted! I put it on before and after blow-drying my hair. Even though it feels pretty thick coming out of the bottle, it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair or make it greasy (make sure to start from ends and work towards roots). I have also mixed it with my conditioner to give my regular conditioner a boost. And the smell is very musky and sexy. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is amazing. My hair is dry and this completely helps it. I combine it also with the masque and it works wonders</li>
            <li> This oil leaves your my hair soft and shiny and genuinely makes my hair dry faster.  Not &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; feel.  Ideal to tame the tresses.</li>
            <li> I had heard nothing but great things about this oil and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. As soon as it got here I opened the bottle and was surprised to notice a moldy smell. I thought it was just my sense of smell, so I went ahead and put it in my still dry hair. When my husband came home, he stopped a few feet from me and asked what that horrid smell was..I asked what it smelled like and he said mold. I thought this would smell like cookies or sweet. I don&#x27;t know what I thought it would smell like, maybe I just got a bad bottle. I am very glad I didn&#x27;t spend more or buy any of the other products like I intended too. Very disappointed with this brand and I do not recommend it if you are looking for something that doesn&#x27;t smell like mold.</li>
            <li> Great product, good price (I paid way more at ulta) and this store had pretty fast delivery! this stuff is the best, all my friends who have tried mine have bought their own!</li>
            <li> I love this oil, it nice and smooth you can put it in your deep conditioner or shampoo or your conditioner to give it that extra pull that your hair needs.</li>
            <li> This oils smells glorious, goes on smoothly, and is a great treatment for skin and hair. I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> love this product. a lil product goes a long way, so this will last forever. all the macadamia product i have tried are awesome!</li>
            <li> I use this oil almost every night. It has really helped with the breakage, and it really smells awesome. The size is great for travel.</li>
            <li> Best. Product. Ever. I have tried other products and this not only makes my hair silky smooth, but it smells really good.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair super soft</li>
            <li> Yes I absolutely love it ! It does wonders for all the new growth and it moisturize my ends very good</li>
            <li> Bought this for my Hubby&#x27;s mustache and beard. It has worked well and has a great smell to it.  Great for dryness!</li>
            <li> I am of indian decent my hair is between straight and wavy... It is very fine... I have only used this product twice since I received it... I like how it feels on my hair, a little goes a long way,  it does not weight down my hair nor does it get my hair oily...  Over all I like it and will repurchase this product...</li>
            <li> I have cancer and have lost my hair twice now, soon to be 3 times. I get this product and rub it on the hair that I do have. It makes it so soft and I think when it grew back some after the 2nd time bald it was not as frizzy. It has a lovely smell. I will use it now forever.</li>
            <li> Macadamia healing oil it is so amazing that made my hair smooth with sweet smell,&lt;br /&gt;for me I readly love it. my boyfriend alway smell my hair and said you smell so good.&lt;br /&gt;It is a very very good deal before I bought it from outside store, it was so expenstive.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this product. I am in the process of treating my own hair naturally. Works great!</li>
            <li> Well I have been using this oil for a couple of months now and I am really happy with it from my first use. My hair is kind of treated real bad with heating tools, hair coloring and all and I use a lot of conditioners to make it look healthy., and in this process this oil has to be in my hair makeover list. Trust you will love the smell it has and it really worked well on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t say it will be the same for all hair types but I would atleast recommend you to give a try.</li>
            <li> Just didn&#x27;t hydrate my hair like I had hoped. The cost versus the actual results weren&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> I will never stop purchasing Macadamia products. A little goes a long way. It lasts a good three months. It leaves me hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> The product arrived sooner than the time promised.&lt;br /&gt;The product is in great shape and looks like what the picture and the description shows.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was nice.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for a long time now and it is works.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for making me happy.</li>
            <li> My hair feels really soft every time I use this product and I like the smell. I have used it for a week. I bought the repair treatment but I haven&#x27;t use it yet</li>
            <li> I mix this with the hair masque by this company and my hair feels great. I have not tried the oil on its own to rate it separately.</li>
            <li> I love this oil , smells so good and makes my hair shinny without a greasy look not matter how much I put on :) shipping was super fast and it was definitely worth the cheap amount I paid :)</li>
            <li> Im unsure if it works i haven&#x27;t noticed a significant change in my hair it feel a little bit softer but that&#x27;s about it. The bottle is small but i guess a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> this product is basically just what it says..i put a small amount in before blow drying on my damp hair and although i dont see SHINE..i do feel like my hair has become alot more silkier and softer..i would buy this product in full size.</li>
            <li> I love love LOVE this.&lt;br /&gt;It is very pricey for such a small container, but it lasts a while. After I towel dry my hair and it is damp, I use just a little of this in the palm of my hand and rub it through the ends of my hair (not on the scalp or your hair will feel greasy), it makes it soft and silky and really helps with damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;This is a must-have.</li>
            <li> Love this for my hair. It smells good, does not weight down hair or leave it feeling greasy. I need to buy a bigger size.</li>
            <li> I bought this product first in a different store 0.34 oz. Surprisingly it lasted longer than I thought it would (over 2 months). I&#x27;ve been using it ever since after each blow dry. It has an amazing smell (very important to me), the hair feels so silky and does not look greasy after I apply the product. What can I say? They got me! I have to have it!</li>
            <li> Great at fighting frizz; really helpful for getting your hair smooth (especially when braiding) or just adding a little shine.</li>
            <li> works great for frizzy hair, dry hair and color treated hair. I was hesitant because it&#x27;s such a thick oil, but it really does work fantastic. I was surprised. I colored my hair and my hair was brittle and dry.  I washed my hair and then put some of the oil in while it was still wet.  After I blow dried my hair it was silky, smooth and not dry or brittle at all.  Really great product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product thinking it was natural but the ingredient list is really bad, tons of chemicals and even petroleum derived dyes. I am returning it right away. Don&#x27;t want to have this on my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> I bought this after bleaching parts of my dark hair because I found that my hair was extremely dry and prone to tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually put a little bit of the oil on my comb and comb through my wet hair after a shower. It definitely makes my hair smoother, softer, and much easier to comb and brush through. You only need a tiny bit of product per use so my small bottle has lasted a really long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I generally don&#x27;t like strong scents and this product has a masculine scent that lingers so that&#x27;s one downside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this has helped my hair a lot so I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it only once and I got so many compliments that my hair looks healthier when I blow dried it. Usually, my hair is a bit fuzzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complain that the bottle is too small. For some unknown reasons, I thought it&#x27;s bigger.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely gonna buy a bigger size of it. It&#x27;s really worth it.</li>
            <li> It is a light oil.  It won&#x27;t weigh hair down much.  But when you want extra care for the ends of your hair, you&#x27;ll have to reapply.</li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t like it because it smelled weird. So I tried it on my hair and it made it so smooth and silky. I have very coarse, thick transitioning hair. It made it feel so hydrated and moisturized yet not heavy. What I don&#x27;t like is the small amount of oil. I will definitely buy the bigger bottle. Simply, I LOVE THIS OIL!</li>
            <li> I really like this oil. I put a small dab on my hand and then rub into each side of my hair. I have very thick hair, so some people may want to use less. It gives a great shine.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and it work wonderfully!</li>
            <li> Good product!! love it!</li>
            <li> Are satisfied to soften dry hair quickly.&lt;br /&gt;But the unbearable smell .. bad .. hard Strong Man knockoff.&lt;br /&gt;Used mixed with other hair oils do an awful smell disappears.</li>
            <li> I do like this hair oil especially for the price I paid.  It does come out of the bottle fast; only a dime size is needed.  The shipping was super fast!!</li>
            <li> smells better than the previous more expensive brand i was using, makes hair soft and shiny, but easily gets limp and greasy if you use too much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product. Although it doesn&#x27;t necessarily add shine, I do see that my hair is much softer and silky. The smell is somewhat along the line of cologne, but in a good way. I like the smell and consistency of this, and I find that even this little bottle lasts me a long time.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It helps the control the frizzes, which are the result of high humidity in our area.  Only a little dab of the product helps with control and produces a great shine on ones tresses.  Great product!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product at ULTA after hearing great reviews, the one from this seller is exactly the same as the one from ULTA and itÂ´s a lot cheaper, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Awesome. Been using for over a year. I have thick wavy hair this is great for frizzies and humidity. Better than morrocon oil</li>
