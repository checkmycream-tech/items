            <li>am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Smells ok, not too girlie.</li>
            <li>I love love thisðŸ’œ</li>
            <li>I have roscea and have tried MANY products to help control it.</li>
            <li>This product, like many others, has helped somewhat</li>
            <li>works better than  many of prescripiton  meds.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best for skin problems especially roseacia.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and really helps moisturize the skin.</li>
            <li>I have always liked Skin Medica products and was excited to try this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product as a moisturizer; it&#x27;s great on my extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I flush easy.</li>
            <li>After 3 weeks, I see some improvement; it stings when you first put it on, but absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li>I have been fighting mild rosacea and have tried many creams that say they will reduce or get rid of redness.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>After using this product for 3 days I noticed a huge difference in the skin on my face.</li>
            <li>Most places sell this product for $80 dollars (which is how much I paid at my dermatologist)</li>
            <li>Love it, cleared up my skin quickly and is a very high quality product, well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>I have mild rosacea.</li>
            <li>really great, so glad I found it at such a terrific price!!</li>
            <li>The ladies gave me some samples and I am very pleased and would gladly be one of what I am sure are little to no black spokespersons.</li>
            <li>It looks softer and feels cool all the time (when I would have a flare-up, my face would get extremely hot to the touch).</li>
            <li>I only use it at night or if I am staying at home because it is kind of waxy &amp; does not do well under my makeup.</li>
            <li>worth trying.  </li>
            <li>It is one of the major lines of skincare at my dermatologist office, but I get it at a more reasonable price online.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for about two years, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased it on Amazon instead of at my dermatologist&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li>redness\\&quot; instead it burned his skin the first time he used it.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews first</li>
            <li>After the first month of using this product I have stopped using all the prescriptions</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first because of the cost but at that point, I was willing to try anything.</li>
            <li>Better than being red in the face all the time.</li>
            <li>LOVE this product after a laser resurfacing, very red and blotchy...</li>
            <li>and he said this was normal, to give it a few more tries and in 2 months I have noticed a remarkable difference in my redness and Rosacea.  </li>
            <li>and then I tried laser treatment, but that also didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>It has really bother me that I have had redness around my nose for years and nothing work.</li>
            <li>Nourishes the areas that need it without being too much on my oily skin.</li>
            <li>I am strict about the care of my skin and use this is conjunction with good cleansing, a Clairisonic and other topical vitamin therapy.</li>
            <li>The only lotion I have found to calm my skin!</li>
            <li>I have big time rosacea, and I originally purchased this item in the hopes that with continued use, it would take some of the redness away.  </li>
            <li>read many of the other reviews before I bought yet another</li>
            <li>Unlike many other products this moisturizes without causing breakouts.</li>
            <li>cause I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>have been really bothered by the red dry peeling areas on both sides of nose tried many products</li>
            <li>In other words, it may work just fine to relieve redness in others with milder cases of rosacea; it just doesn&#x27;t work for that purpose for me.  </li>
            <li>Much to my surprise I found four different parabens listed on the label.</li>
            <li>I recommend virtually all of the SkinMedica products to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended this product and the first few uses, it REALLY burned, especially after a hot shower.  </li>
            <li>I can get the same results with much cheaper products.</li>
            <li>When it first goes on it may seem like your skin is actually reddening more, but within a short time the skin is cooler and less red.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone that has that ruddy, rosy, dry and sensitive prone skin!!!</li>
            <li>As described by others it does occasionally burn upon application, but only for a short time, the relief is totally worth it!</li>
            <li>Sometimes there is a slight burning sensation, but overall it is easy to use and it works.</li>
            <li>If you are dry, red and irritated, this will soothe and calm your skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin was better on the medication, but still red, and flair ups were common.</li>
            <li>I have not used any of my skin medicine or those \\&quot;natural\\&quot; facial scrubs in two weeks so far!</li>
            <li>I tried several applications to see if my sensitive skin would get used to it -- ever determined to end the redness.</li>
            <li>I do continue to use it, though, because it is literally the only moisturizer I can use on my extremely sensitive skin that doesn&#x27;t make me break out.  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product for someone who has Rosacea or if someone just normally has red, irritated skin.</li>
            <li>Within the first few weeks I started noticing a difference and couldn&#x27;t believe something was actually working.</li>

            <li> Within the first few weeks I started noticing a difference and couldn&#x27;t believe something was actually working.</li>
            <li> Went for a facial last week, and they commented about red areas in cheeks and dry red area on side of nose.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My face is no longer red, and the dry, flakey patches are gone.</li>
            <li> It actually seemed to be making the redness worse for the first four or five nights of use, but after that it started clearing up.</li>
            <li> I use alot of Retin A products that dry my skin out in some areas</li>
            <li> so I use this on those when they get too dry.</li>
            <li> I have read the reviews from other customers where they said that this product burns, it DOES initially burn, but only slightly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has only been one week and no more dry red on cheeks or nose.</li>
            <li> By using this cream, twice daily, my skin is less red.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also was half the price of my local spa.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until my dermatologist recommended SkinMedica Redness Relief Complex that completely changed my life!</li>
            <li> I have used this product and similar products from the same line (e.g., hydra complex and retinol complex)and</li>
            <li> I came across this skin care shop in my campus&#x27; rec center.</li>
            <li> It burned my face and did not help my neck at all,mad that I spent the money.</li>
            <li> She also said no hot water or steam on face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also have had no burning with cream maybe others were not informed about the no hot water.</li>
            <li> And I only use it when I get it for a few days and very very little amount and it goes away.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price to even try out unless if you&#x27;re desperate.</li>
            <li> I very rarely give a bad review, but felt this was warranted for both of the reasons stated.</li>
            <li> Amazon price is half of what plastic surgeon office charged.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, which is normal for me, and did not believe that the products would work on my black skin.</li>
            <li> It is a little greasy-looking on your skin</li>
            <li> I tried medication for a few years but it didn&#x27;t do anything</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It seems to lessen the redness in just a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Very greasy, unpleasant smell and didn&#x27;t help with my redness problem at all.  </li>
            <li> My dermotologist recommended this in conjuction with laser treatments, and I&#x27;m not sure either are working well for me.</li>
            <li> She suggested that I try this redness relief complex</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> It made the redness worse as soon as you put it on</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it irritating to my skin at all.</li>
            <li> I have struggle with Rosacea for manyy years and absolutely hated dealing with it.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and was very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the best product for rosacea. It not only helps with the redness but also with the inflammation. It is one of the major lines of skincare at my dermatologist office, but I get it at a more reasonable price online. Great product !!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful moisturizer.  The residual oil bothered me but doesn&#x27;t seem to make a difference in effectiveness. Amazon price is half of what plastic surgeon office charged.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended CalmPlex for my rosacea to help reduce the redness. It burned when I put it on. I tried several applications to see if my sensitive skin would get used to it -- ever determined to end the redness. Finally, I stopped using it because the burning never went away and because I read the ingredients. Much to my surprise I found four different parabens listed on the label. I can&#x27;t believe my \\&quot;ex\\&quot; dermatologist recommended it and I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t read the label before buying it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product and similar products from the same line (e.g., hydra complex and retinol complex)and have had no problems. I have not used any of my skin medicine or those \\&quot;natural\\&quot; facial scrubs in two weeks so far! My skin is softer, smoother, and more even in terms of \\&quot;color.\\&quot;  I came across this skin care shop in my campus&#x27; rec center. I was skeptical, which is normal for me, and did not believe that the products would work on my black skin. The ladies gave me some samples and I am very pleased and would gladly be one of what I am sure are little to no black spokespersons.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this. Love it, cleared up my skin quickly and is a very high quality product, well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to work. My dermotologist recommended this in conjuction with laser treatments, and I&#x27;m not sure either are working well for me. I flush easy.</li>
            <li> I had this prescibed by a skin clinic and has absolutly transformed the texture and tone of my skin. They sell the product for $80 plus tax so what a savings. I am strict about the care of my skin and use this is conjunction with good cleansing, a Clairisonic and other topical vitamin therapy. I can&#x27;t imagine this being a one product quick fix for anyone, but my results have been very good.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about two years, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased it on Amazon instead of at my dermatologist&#x27;s office.  I love this product as a moisturizer; it&#x27;s great on my extremely sensitive skin.  However, it does not relieve redness as the product promises it will.  I have big time rosacea, and I originally purchased this item in the hopes that with continued use, it would take some of the redness away.  It doesn&#x27;t work for that at all.  Having said that, I also use a prescription gel for rosacea and while it (the prescription gel) does keep the rosacea bumps away, it doesn&#x27;t take away the redness either, so it may just be me.  Or it may be that my redness is related to a food allergy or something.  In other words, it may work just fine to relieve redness in others with milder cases of rosacea; it just doesn&#x27;t work for that purpose for me.  I do continue to use it, though, because it is literally the only moisturizer I can use on my extremely sensitive skin that doesn&#x27;t make me break out.  So I have repurchased it several times and will continue to do so.  I recommend virtually all of the SkinMedica products to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I ended up feeling like my face was on fire, red, and some hives.  Obviously I was allergic to something in it, but not quite the reaction I was going for.  :)</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my husband for his roseascea. The product was supposed to help \\&quot;relieve redness\\&quot; instead it burned his skin the first time he used it. I tried to contact the seller to ask for a refund, but I have not received a response back. I very rarely give a bad review, but felt this was warranted for both of the reasons stated. So buyer beware.</li>
            <li> I found this stuff by chance one afternoon when I was feeling depressed about my rosacea, I was diagnosed with rosacea at the age of 16 and in the last 11 years I have tried tons of different things... Nothing has given me results like this. I read the reviews first so I knew that it might burn some and it did. It actually seemed to be making the redness worse for the first four or five nights of use, but after that it started clearing up.</li>
            <li> I have mild rosacea. I have seen 3 dermatologists and tried over 2 dozen creams, both prescription and OTC.  SkinMedica made my rosacea flare-up and turn beet red.  I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I use it because I have rosacea and it takes the red out. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Used it for awhile. Does not burn my face</li>
            <li> Graissy on the face, not a lot of resolt after a month.</li>
            <li> Not good. I tried it for a week but burning didn&#x27;t go away even after a week. It made the redness worse as soon as you put it on and it never made it better.</li>
            <li> I have suffered with Rosacea for years. I was using medication prescribed by my Dermatologist (expensive) for most of that time. My skin was better on the medication, but still red, and flair ups were common. I was talked into a facial by a friend and this product was recommended to me during the treatment.  After 3 weeks my symptoms all but disappeared, and going on a year I have not had any flair ups. My face is no longer red, and the dry, flakey patches are gone. I am totally sold on this product. After the first month of using this product I have stopped using all the prescriptions and my face looks great. I do not work for them, just a happy customer. As described by others it does occasionally burn upon application, but only for a short time, the relief is totally worth it!</li>
            <li> I have struggle with Rosacea for manyy years and absolutely hated dealing with it. The flare-ups were so embarrassing and I couldn&#x27;t deal with it anymore. I tried medication for a few years but it didn&#x27;t do anything and then I tried laser treatment, but that also didn&#x27;t do much. It wasn&#x27;t until my dermatologist recommended SkinMedica Redness Relief Complex that completely changed my life! I was hesitant at first because of the cost but at that point, I was willing to try anything. Within the first few weeks I started noticing a difference and couldn&#x27;t believe something was actually working. Now, I have been using this product for 10 months and I cannot believe how better my skin looks! My nose and cheeks used to get really red and it would still show through even with make-up on but with product, my skin color stays the same and doesn&#x27;t get red! It looks softer and feels cool all the time (when I would have a flare-up, my face would get extremely hot to the touch). I am so happy with this product that I have to order more of it cause I can&#x27;t live without it! There&#x27;s fiinally a solution for those who struggle with Rosacea :)   I definitely recommend this product for someone who has Rosacea or if someone just normally has red, irritated skin. Most places sell this product for $80 dollars (which is how much I paid at my dermatologist) so this is a bargain!</li>
            <li> I have been fighting mild rosacea and have tried many creams that say they will reduce or get rid of redness.&lt;br /&gt;I read many of the other reviews before I bought yet another cream.&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I did.  By using this cream, twice daily, my skin is less red.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe it either but it is true.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again and if you are struggling with redness give it a try.</li>
            <li> It helps to reduce the redness on my cheeks from Rosacea. I don&#x27;t find it irritating to my skin at all.</li>
            <li> Went for a facial last week, and they commented about red areas in cheeks and dry red area on side of nose.&lt;br /&gt;I have been really bothered by the red dry peeling areas on both sides of nose tried many products none worked.&lt;br /&gt;She asked if I had rosacea and stated that looked like it. She suggested that I try this redness relief complex&lt;br /&gt;and I was a bit weary especialy when told the price $80.00 ! She also said no hot water or steam on face.&lt;br /&gt;It has only been one week and no more dry red on cheeks or nose. I also have had no burning with cream maybe others were not informed about the no hot water.</li>
            <li> Very greasy, unpleasant smell and didn&#x27;t help with my redness problem at all.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price to even try out unless if you&#x27;re desperate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my face since my dermatologist recommended it.  I just like the way my face and skin feels and looks.</li>
            <li> I use this on advice from my doctor (the one who did the laser surgery for rosacea) and it does what its supposed to do. It is a little greasy-looking on your skin and I have to explain to some of the guys I ride with &amp;#34;it ain&#x27;t makeup, dude&amp;#34; but they&#x27;re not too bright anyway. Smells ok, not too girlie. Better than being red in the face all the time.</li>
            <li> It has really bother me that I have had redness around my nose for years and nothing work. This work! And I only use it when I get it for a few days and very very little amount and it goes away. I love love thisðŸ’œ</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks, I see some improvement; it stings when you first put it on, but absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product and the first few uses, it REALLY burned, especially after a hot shower.  I spoke to him about it and he said this was normal, to give it a few more tries and in 2 months I have noticed a remarkable difference in my redness and Rosacea.  The burning is now gone as well (thankfully).</li>
            <li> Controls my rosesia and makes my skin feel great. Also was half the price of my local spa. Great product</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me. Caused redness and opposite of claims. I have always liked Skin Medica products and was excited to try this product. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Nourishes the areas that need it without being too much on my oily skin. I use alot of Retin A products that dry my skin out in some areas so I use this on those when they get too dry. Unlike many other products this moisturizes without causing breakouts.</li>
            <li> The only lotion I have found to calm my skin! When it first goes on it may seem like your skin is actually reddening more, but within a short time the skin is cooler and less red. Nothing works perfectly, but I have been using this product for two years and will not switch!</li>
            <li> Finally something that seems to helps!  I use it twice - morning and night.  It seems to lessen the redness in just a few weeks.  Sometimes there is a slight burning sensation, but overall it is easy to use and it works.</li>
            <li> I have a very red chest and neck and would do any thing to help! I bought this product and was very disappointed. Please don&#x27;t waist your money like I did. It burned my face and did not help my neck at all,mad that I spent the money.</li>
            <li> Received with no problem&#x27;s</li>
            <li> This product does help relieve my redness some.  I only use it at night or if I am staying at home because it is kind of waxy &amp; does not do well under my makeup.</li>
            <li> I have read the reviews from other customers where they said that this product burns, it DOES initially burn, but only slightly. After using this product for 3 days I noticed a huge difference in the skin on my face. I would recommend this to people with red marks and patchy looking skin on the face.</li>
            <li> It works well to keep my red cheeks and chin under control. Use it once a day at bedtime.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product after a laser resurfacing, very red and blotchy...really great, so glad I found it at such a terrific price!!</li>
            <li> if this is used faithfully....it works!  plus, i like the smell of it!  will buy again when this one that i have runs out!</li>
            <li> This is a miracle cream!  If you are dry, red and irritated, this will soothe and calm your skin.  I highly recommend this to anyone that has that ruddy, rosy, dry and sensitive prone skin!!!</li>
            <li> Skin has never looked more even or dewy!! Great cinnamon scent.</li>
            <li> I have roscea and have tried MANY products to help control it. This product, like many others, has helped somewhat but I&#x27;ve not gotten the results I was hoping for. I can get the same results with much cheaper products.</li>
            <li> ...it did wonders for my sisters skin, who I gave it to, after not liking it myself. My skin is very finicky, this product was too harsh for me, stung like a bee. But, my sister loves it. So, I can be a hit and miss, but you&#x27;ll never know, if you&#x27;ll never try. My sister would have rated it 5 stars!</li>
            <li> works better than  many of prescripiton  meds. i have tried.  will order again.  worth trying.  i have very red cheeks and burns.worse at times .  use every day. helps lot.</li>
            <li> I Always stay with the product.  It&#x27;s the best for skin problems especially roseacia.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and really helps moisturize the skin.</li>
