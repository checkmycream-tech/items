            <li>highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It does Not get my hair straight, but it does make it more soft after using that dry shampoo.</li>

            <li>Recommend highly.</li>
            <li>It makes it so silky and soft!  </li>

            <li> My hair is not course, it is fine but, very thick.  </li>
            <li> It left her hair soft silky and has kept her perm spirals tight.</li>
            <li> It smooths out rough cuticles, especially at the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> makes it feel soft without leaving any heavy residue.  </li>
            <li> I got my hair smoothening done as my hair had got too rough and the beautician suggested me to use Wella products.</li>
            <li> They already get enough of my money (I have long, thick, wavy/curly hair) and this shampoo/conditioner makes it so that I don&#x27;t have to go to the salon so often for hair cuts.</li>
            <li> Works well but contains alcohol and other chemicals I prefer to keep out of my hair.</li>
            <li> And secondly, the smell of the products is not pleasant at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s half my salon&#x27;s price!</li>
            <li> I have also purchased Wella styling oil which I usually apply after my wash.</li>
            <li> My friend who is a beautician recommended this for my hair (really thick and heavy).</li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t need their hair looking any worse than it already may...  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried all of the expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in the shammpoo because it is not sulfate-free, so I couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I hate the way my hair smells.</li>

            <li> Love this product. Amazon have the best prices.</li>
            <li> I am super happy with the conditioner, but I gave it 4 stars due to the shampoo. Shampoo is fine but it won&#x27;t be of any use without the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in the shammpoo because it is not sulfate-free, so I couldn&#x27;t use it. It would strip the color out of my hair. And secondly, the smell of the products is not pleasant at all. They are very perfumey and harsh. I hate the way my hair smells. I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> Does not work as well as the red one</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo smells good</li>
            <li> I love that Amazon sells this. It&#x27;s half my salon&#x27;s price!

            <li> I LOVE this stuff. Great for thick hair</li>
            <li> I got my hair smoothening done as my hair had got too rough and the beautician suggested me to use Wella products.That&#x27;s what got me here at Amazon for purchasing this product. When it first arrived, I was kinda wondering how it would turn out to be after use as it was my first time using this shampoo and conditioner. After the first wash, believe me my hair turned out to be really smooth and frizz free. Since, I usually wash my hair every alternate day as it turns oily too fast, I absolutely love my hair after the wash.

            <li> Love them. Works. Great smell.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and works great!!</li>
            <li> I notice my hair growth</li>
            <li> My friend who is a beautician recommended this for my hair (really thick and heavy). It is cheaper on here than in her salon. Purchased several times and love the results.</li>
            <li> Favorite product ever!!</li>
            <li> Works well but contains alcohol and other chemicals I prefer to keep out of my hair. Also not a fan of the smell.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is wonderful for my heavy thick hair.  It makes it so silky and soft!  My hair has never been happier!</li>
            <li> Product came quickly and an am happy with the product</li>
            <li> I just love it really good</li>
            <li> Have allergic reaction to some hair care products but not this one.  Love these products.  My hair is not course, it is fine but, very thick.  This product tames my hair and the conditioner makes it feel soft without leaving any heavy residue.  This is my second order of this product and it will not be my last.</li>
            <li> love this shampoo &amp; conditioner- huge bottles for super cheap. highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The Shampoo dries my hair out. The condone is ok. There is nothing special about either of these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: the Straight Leave In Cream is Awesome. It does Not get my hair straight, but it does make it more soft after using that dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo there is. I have course hair and I&#x27;ve tried all of the expensive brands. This one is best. I swear by it.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo for coarse hair!</li>
            <li> honestly it doesn&#x27;t really work for me or my girlfriend and in fact makes her hair dryer and feel more coarse... It&#x27;s not the seller&#x27;s fault they delivered it quickly and at a reasonable value but we cant use this so I guess we will just hide it under the sink ,or donate it to a homeless shelter or something but they don&#x27;t need their hair looking any worse than it already may...  I&#x27;d ask for a refund (95% is left! in the bottle) but we didn&#x27;t want to inconvenience the seller as they did not make this stuff -Wella did...  The seller is good!  This product is not...</li>
            <li> Valentine&#x27;s Day 2015 I got my wife a make over. Her hair trimmed &amp; spiral permed 12/03. 9 days later a uniform coloring in a Chestnut brown. The salon recommended the course formula Wella product. So she tried it on her treated hair, and loved it. It left her hair soft silky and has kept her perm spirals tight. The color of her hair shines with the use of the Wella. Finding these 33.8oz bottle sets here on Amazon was the best deal.</li>
            <li> Great product...will be buy it again, and from this supplier too.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo. Smells good. Makes my hair feel great.</li>
            <li> awesome combo...really works well with my curly hair</li>
