            <li> With the heat of summer soon arriving,Shower to Shower,is a Body Powder that refreshes and softens and cools your skin.  Heat can be harsh on anyones skin,and this is a quick picker upper when there isn&#x27;t time to shower or after you have showered. Wonderful fresh fragrances to choose from as well.</li>
            <li> I cannot find varieties in body powder where I live.  This is very nice and light.  This is good for summer.</li>

            <li> I have bee using this powder for years and all of a sudden I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores!  What was that about?  Just recently found it again in K-Mart and bought all of them out!!!</li>
            <li> Nice powder!  The fragrance is not overpowering. . . Doesn&#x27;t clash with my perfume.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this powder for years, but I frequently can&#x27;t find it in the stores around here.  The powder is great and I love this scent.</li>
            <li> Brings back the smell of Hawaii. Thanks so much. Very happy.</li>
            <li> I finally found it this is hard to find in the store anymore near me. This is just right in texture and fragrance and wearability&lt;br /&gt;no comparison I have to get another one I don&#x27;t plan running out.</li>
            <li> Smaller bottle than what I usually can buy when available in the stores, for same price. The scent smelled very old. The scent was very faint. Not impressed. I guess I will wait til my stores start carrying it again. Won&#x27;t buyit again from Amazon</li>

            <li> You can&#x27;t usually find this nice-smelling powder in stores- I buy several at a time! it just smells great, and is a daily part of my shower regimen.</li>
