            <li>They don&#x27;t fit my nails as well as I would like..</li>
            <li>the only plus on this is that the seller did a great job in shipping</li>
            <li>Happy with product, will be ordering from in the future.</li>

            <li>Love the sturdy box great size range for all nail sizes very sturdy but not too thick easy to apply we all use these in our nail salon I will order more when I get</li>
            <li>For the price its not a bad purchase.</li>
            <li>Product shipped quickly and was correct item ordered.  </li>
            <li>purchased this product along with the clear, both durable and fun to play with!!</li>
            <li>The case they come in is pretty durable and has the tip sizes labeled on the lid.</li>
            <li>What was interesting to note, however, is that the tip does not have a deep nail well to place glue in.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;) I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>And they only took 3 days to get here :)</li>
            <li>(I still have diapers to change), so unless you have great acrylic, or never use your hands, I would seriously consider stronger tips.</li>
            <li>need more of sizes 4 and 5,, 5hese are most common..</li>
            <li>Its not a problem for me because I never really gauge the amount of glue and fitting of the nail on this factor.</li>

            <li>Majority of the tips that come with the acrylic set are very rounded (from the left to the right of the nail).</li>
            <li>,I don&#x27;t know why I keep forgetting that fact, but I bought these tips because of their price, which was great, but now all I have is a case of expensive practice nails....</li>
            <li>She said these are comparable to the hot pink tips.</li>
            <li>Where I live I can only get 150 tips for 13 dollars.</li>
            <li>, I would say it&#x27;s NORMAL use, and I don&#x27;t wear my nails long</li>
            <li>that even after several coats of hard shellac they bend and break easily.</li>

            <li> The product arrived before the estimated delivery date which is great considering the delivery date was almost a month out. Everything arrived in good condition. The nails were in individual little zip lock bags that were numbered by size. I didn&#x27;t count them but it look like 550 pieces. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I didnt use the nails as I could see them through the box, tried to return them and was told I couldnt because they are disposable tips. The box is unopened and I have wasted 10.00, will not use this vendor again.</li>
            <li> NAILS ARE WEAK,NOT CUT, RIGHT AND JUST CHEAP!..I HATE THEM. I ADVICE YOU TO LOOK AROUND THIS ONE...SO NOT WORTH THE MONEY.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my wife who started doing her nails at home.  She said these are comparable to the hot pink tips. They are well-less and a bit thin but seem to last under all the pressure she puts on her hands. The case they come in is pretty durable and has the tip sizes labeled on the lid. For the price its not a bad purchase.</li>
            <li> Theses are a little flimsy and thin but they work and i love them and they feel like there made of like the type of plastic made for I.D&#x27;s</li>

            <li> I have been searching for a great set of tips that suit me! I found them! Majority of the tips that come with the acrylic set are very rounded (from the left to the right of the nail). I do not like the rounded tips! These tips are not as rounded and fit my nail a lot better. What was interesting to note, however, is that the tip does not have a deep nail well to place glue in. Its not a problem for me because I never really gauge the amount of glue and fitting of the nail on this factor. I would recommend these tips to anyone.</li>
            <li> Cheaper then the store or salon and it works good been trying to save money by doing my own nails</li>

            <li> I am a self taught nail artist. These tips are perfect for price and quantity. Where I live I can only get 150 tips for 13 dollars. These are a MUCH better deal and I like them better then the ones sold at the beauty shop!</li>
            <li> I bought these thinking that they are the same from the salon but they are NOT they are to thin and flimsy, the box is small and doesn&#x27;t fit much,I don&#x27;t recommend it the only plus on this is that the seller did a great job in shipping I received it almost a week and a half early.</li>
            <li> I got a box with no tips?</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t tips at all ... When I received it they were full coverage nails not tips :-( not what I ordered at al</li>

            <li> I love these nails. They are easy to cut and file to the shape that you desire. Also, they are easy to fit to your fingers. Only one thing they have issues sticking to your finger. Only info I can give is that you have to scatch the area that the glue goes a little before putting them on.</li>
            <li> They are cheap for a reason, that is because they will not stay on your nails, do not buy this crap product.</li>

            <li> ,I don&#x27;t know why I keep forgetting that fact, but I bought these tips because of their price, which was great, but now all I have is a case of expensive practice nails.... these tips are so thin that even after several coats of hard shellac they bend and break easily. In the last two weeks, I&#x27;ve had to repair three broke nails. I am a stay at home mom, so I would say I&#x27;m not overly hard on my hands, I would say it&#x27;s NORMAL use, and I don&#x27;t wear my nails long (I still have diapers to change), so unless you have great acrylic, or never use your hands, I would seriously consider stronger tips. But hey, at least I have new practice nails for art!!</li>
