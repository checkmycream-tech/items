    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>works great, lashes stay conditioned so they grow longer!</li>
            <li>Not losing eyelashes as much, so happy.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>This product is good</li>
            <li>I knew it was too good to be true to get it for the cheaper price here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I love this product; been using it for a couple of years.  </li>
            <li>I took more a month to review this product as I wanted to see results.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite products but WAY overpriced in the salon</li>
            <li>Love the product, love the price.</li>
            <li>I saw a difference for sure.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It goes on like a liquid liner so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This experience was my first time using any kind of lash growth product</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s made a huge difference on my lashes.</li>
            <li>If you are trying to strengthen your lashes and grow them, this stuff is absolutely fabulous.</li>
            <li>My friend had great success with this product so we&#x27;ll see it&#x27;s been about a month and a half as I had another before this one that I just purchased.</li>
            <li>There is no way I will get even a couple weeks worth from this purchase.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;For what it is worth, the formulation did not cause any eye irritation.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting a whole lot from LashFood, but I had the opportunity to try it for free and I was pleasantly surprised that I noticed a difference in the thickness of my lashes after 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li>My daughter uses it, too, and it has filled her brows in and gives them the shape and hint of darkening that her fair gold/blonde eyebrows unfortunately don&#x27;t have (would disappear on her face before this came along).</li>
            <li>I used Lashfood faithfully twice per day for eight weeks straight</li>
            <li>so I really can&#x27;t compare it to anything else.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now I even use on my eyebrows and it has also worked so be careful not to put it on anything you dont want hair growing from :).</li>
            <li>I wanted this to work, I really did.  </li>
            <li>I do my research on high ticket items like this.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money!  </li>
            <li>When I received it, it was in the cute little net bag, the tube was even wrapped in plastic.  </li>
            <li>When I unscrewed the top to look at the product, there was hardly any product coming out on the brush from the bottle.  </li>
            <li>When I received my Haute Lash Food tube and opened it, there was so much product that I had to scrape some off back in the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I brush my brows, apply my eyebrow pencil and then use this over it, allow it to dry, do another quick brush: keeps them in line all day and they are finally not a wisp.  </li>
            <li>I should have listened to the article by the chemist who reviewed this product and said that there were no active ingredients in the product that would produce growth or density in eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>A little pricey but worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I opened it to compare to my other Lash Food (same exact size and type)</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I doesn&#x27;t irritate your eyes but it is a serious waste of money, highly priced with no results.</li>

            <li> I was very unhappy when I opened the package. This is what I found.  When I received it, it was in the cute little net bag, the tube was even wrapped in plastic.  I opened it to compare to my other Lash Food (same exact size and type) I purchased on Haute for a very low price.  When I unscrewed the top to look at the product, there was hardly any product coming out on the brush from the bottle.  I shook it thinking maybe it settled during shipping, but nothing.  When I received my Haute Lash Food tube and opened it, there was so much product that I had to scrape some off back in the bottle.  I feel like I was ripped off with a used product with a little left inside. There is no way I will get even a couple weeks worth from this purchase.  I knew it was too good to be true to get it for the cheaper price here on Amazon.  Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> I bought this on groupon along with the mascara, and I was very disappointed, as I noticed no growth (though the mascara is good, just not for growing eyelashes). Buy Latisse and save yourself the trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicole (Author of PRETTY GIRLS MAKE GRAVES: a pretty girl&#x27;s ugly story told in borrowed voices)</li>
            <li> I used Lashfood faithfully twice per day for eight weeks straight and if my lashes changed at all, it was undetectable. This experience was my first time using any kind of lash growth product so I really can&#x27;t compare it to anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what it is worth, the formulation did not cause any eye irritation. It just didn&#x27;t do anything at all.</li>
            <li> If you are trying to strengthen your lashes and grow them, this stuff is absolutely fabulous. You will see a difference in 30 days.  You dont have to use a lot and this bottle will last you at least 6 months if you use it right.  It goes on like a liquid liner so easy to use.  Now I even use on my eyebrows and it has also worked so be careful not to put it on anything you dont want hair growing from :).</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting a whole lot from LashFood, but I had the opportunity to try it for free and I was pleasantly surprised that I noticed a difference in the thickness of my lashes after 4 weeks.  I can&#x27;t to see what happens with continued use.</li>
            <li> I love this product; been using it for a couple of years.  My eyesbrows have noticeably thickened up.  Yes; you read eyebrows.  I use it on them, not my eyelashes.  I brush my brows, apply my eyebrow pencil and then use this over it, allow it to dry, do another quick brush: keeps them in line all day and they are finally not a wisp.  My daughter uses it, too, and it has filled her brows in and gives them the shape and hint of darkening that her fair gold/blonde eyebrows unfortunately don&#x27;t have (would disappear on her face before this came along).</li>
            <li> I noticed it helped my lashes grow healthier, longer and thicker. Also I think they got darker. I had eyelash extensions removed before I got the lashfood and it helped a lot.</li>
            <li> It didnt cause itchiness or redness. No change after 6 weeks. It doesnt do anything.  Dont spend the money for it.</li>
            <li> works great, lashes stay conditioned so they grow longer!</li>
            <li> I took more a month to review this product as I wanted to see results. I must say it did not work for me and will not purchase this again . I doesn&#x27;t irritate your eyes but it is a serious waste of money, highly priced with no results. I think we only buying organic name.</li>
            <li> This product is good but you have to use it for a long long time and w/ consistency of twice a day to see results.</li>
            <li> After two weeks of application I see definite improvement of my lashes.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite products but WAY overpriced in the salon so I checked Amazon and Bingo! Love the product, love the price. I saw a difference for sure. Especially when I put mascara on. My lashes are longer than they were and thicker. I use it every night before bed.</li>
            <li> Not losing eyelashes as much, so happy.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see the difference. Been using it for a month.</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the article by the chemist who reviewed this product and said that there were no active ingredients in the product that would produce growth or density in eyelashes.  I&#x27;ve used it for 4 weeks, as instructed, 2 times a day, and NOTHING HAPPENED!!!  So disappointing. I wanted this to work, I really did.  Do not waste your money!  I took pictures every week so have evidence that it did not work.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in length or thickness yet but I&#x27;m not giving up.  Sometimes I find it slightly irritating to the eye, some itchiness but not always and I do put it on AFTER I cleanse my face.  My friend had great success with this product so we&#x27;ll see it&#x27;s been about a month and a half as I had another before this one that I just purchased.</li>
            <li> I have used it faithfully for weeks and nothings has changed.  My eyelashes are just as short and thin as they were when I started.  Totally waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> Great product. A little pricey but worth every penny. Use it everyday you&#x27;ll see such a difference. Latecee will change your eye color, this WILL NOT! I have blue eyes and it&#x27;s made a huge difference on my lashes. I love it. 1 tube lasted me over a year. Get some today. Here is the cheapest place. I do my research on high ticket items like this.</li>
