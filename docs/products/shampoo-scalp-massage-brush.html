            <li>They are made of plastic and even though the teeth are flexible they can still hurt my scalp if used with too much pressure.</li>
            <li>thanks amazon.com popel3@columbus.rr.com</li>
            <li>Just what I was looking for.only 4 stars because they are stiffer than I expected, would prefer something a bit more pliable.</li>
            <li>Thank-you for such quick delivery</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The quality is fine and the seller was fine but the &amp;#34;assorted colors&amp;#34; of purple, gold, green, and blue meant all 4 were purple in my case.</li>
            <li>Many years ago I had a firm rubber massager like this</li>
            <li>Probably my least favorite color.</li>

            <li> These are good when I use them GENTLY. They are made of plastic and even though the teeth are flexible they can still hurt my scalp if used with too much pressure. After a good shampoo but before rinsing out, a 30 second scalp massage with this will make your scalp feel really good - and healthier. Many years ago I had a firm rubber massager like this but it looks like they aren&#x27;t made anymore. This is the next best thing. Also, with short hair, I can use this as a hairbrush too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 4-pack is much more economical than just buying a single one. I keep one in the shower, one on the shelf to use as a hairbrush, one in a travel kit, and one as a spare.</li>

            <li> My order arrived sooner than I expected.And I have always used these brushes.They are waaaaay cheaper than other detangling brushes or combs out there .I just had to buy quite a few of these all the time because I keep on misplacing these brushes.</li>
            <li> Exactly as presented!</li>
            <li> Shared them all with my family. They luv it!!</li>
            <li> It helps my hair to have more nature oil from my skull. My hair is more healthy now. Highly recommended.</li>

            <li> Not as firm as 1 I buy sometimes before. They did not come in different colors as advertised</li>
