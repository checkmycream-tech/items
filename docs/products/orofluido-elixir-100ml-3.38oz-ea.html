            <li>I went online to the Orofluido website and was shaking my head at how wonderful they made their product sound.  </li>

            <li>get compliemts all the time about how nice my hair</li>

            <li>May be good to have a spare container around to transfer the oil to if you&#x27;re looking for something more durable.</li>
            <li>This is a nice finishing product on your hair supposedly to help ease frizz and boost shine.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve found this to be an effective way to eliminate frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This particular kit is the best price I&#x27;ve found</li>
            <li>is my new best friend!</li>
            <li>Orofluido is my hair&#x27;s new best friend.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, pleasantly scented and makes your hair feel like satin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best product my hair&#x27;s ever had, it made my hair soft, shiny, and silky.</li>
            <li>The Orofluido leaves my hair silky and soft and smelling wonderful!  </li>
            <li>it was so soft and felt wonderful.  </li>
            <li>It also works great at moisturizing freshly shaved legs.</li>
            <li>I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>THE best product for giving hair a natural, healthy texture and shine.  </li>
            <li>I immediately transferred mine into a plastic bottle with a shampoo-type &#x27;push&#x27; top.</li>
            <li>and I get so many compliments on my hair now.  </li>
            <li>I got a sample of this and fell in love.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too fond of the Macadamia Oil scent and it felt slightly more greasy in my hair compared to the others.</li>
            <li>Enjoy felt nice in my hair, but I wasn&#x27;t too fond of the citrus scent.</li>
            <li>Best of all is that i only need to apply it now once every three days.</li>
            <li>But also this product is phenomenal on your skin.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t keep from touching my hair</li>
            <li>I use it on many clients and find that it leaves the hair</li>
            <li>It Keeps my hair smooth and silky all day!</li>
            <li>my hair remains smooth and manageable, even in Texas humidity!</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily looking, but shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>The smell is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love the product, but I did not receive the Gift Set.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the way it smells.....</li>
            <li>I really love this product</li>
            <li>and it comes with 3 smaller vials which are perfect for travel or keeping in your purse to keep your hair superfly on the go.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff, however this is NOT a gift set like the description says.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many others including morrocanoil</li>
            <li>What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li>and I just love this elixir.</li>
            <li>but they were nothing magical.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS</li>
            <li>I LOVE HOW MY HAIR FEELS AND SMELLS.</li>
            <li>Love the scent (not too strong).  </li>
            <li>Perfect solution for dry hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair stylist (at one of those super trendy high-end salons in LA) explained how to use this (or any product) like this:  </li>
            <li>So happy Amazon offers it!</li>
            <li>Love the fact that they give you free samples with the product so that you can share with friends and family.  </li>
            <li>Glad it is available here.</li>
            <li>I got a free sample of this Orofluido hair oil, and was instantly in love.  </li>
            <li>It was smooth, shiny, and looked and felt healthy.</li>
            <li>and I loved it so much that I decided to purchase it.  </li>
            <li>Let me first say this is a wonderful product which provides major silkiness, softness and shine.</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful, leaves my hair so soft and shiny and really moisturizes my curls.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it makes my hair look amazing and feel super soft and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;highly recomned this to anyone with curly, fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have extremely fine, curly hair.  </li>
            <li>While this product also has silicone as the first ingredient it contains three different oils and has a wonderful smell.</li>
            <li>I have medium/long hair, and it looks even better after a quick flat-iron as well.</li>
            <li>For the price, this product contains natural oils comparable to, but better than, most argan oils!...and the SMELL...makes you want to put it on EVERYTHING!</li>
            <li>the little hint of vanilla is perfect!</li>
            <li>Since my own hair is fine and straight</li>
            <li>The smaller bottles are perfect if you travel so you aren&#x27;t packing a large glass</li>
            <li>and it helps keep it shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair silky smooth and even improves the color/luster.  </li>
            <li>It smells fantastic also.</li>
            <li>It will make your hair shinny and smoothly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different brands and have to say this, by far, is the best.</li>
            <li>I use it every morning before I leave the house &amp; it is fabulous.</li>
            <li>They are all fantastic products</li>
            <li>My hair can magically have static and this really helps.</li>
            <li>I hope they keep making this forever because I love it so much. :)</li>
            <li>The smell is soft, smells good.</li>
            <li>but the fragrance is very powerful and longlasting.  </li>
            <li>but, if you do happen to knock it over, you&#x27;re pretty much guaranteed to spill a good portion of the product.</li>
            <li>Pretty sure heaven smells just like this..</li>
            <li>But something completely unique to Orofluido (aside from the intoxicating scent) is the mixture of organic oils-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li>It was definitely worth the purchase!</li>
            <li>The small glass bottles are perfect travel sizes / weekend sizes.  </li>
            <li>It smells amazing and leaves my hair so soft and shiny!  </li>
            <li>easy right?</li>
            <li>The smell is nothing special...</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny, soft and amazing when I use it.</li>
            <li>it smell similar to moroccanoil but not as good.  </li>
            <li>I love this oil, providing I don&#x27;t apply too much.</li>
            <li>I am sure that it is very helpfull.</li>
            <li>The latest shampoos including the low sudsing options may be better for my hair but require that i reach for a de-tangling  product to keep my hair from breaking  off and to regain a silky feel.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy that I found the same product at Amazon and much cheaper price.</li>
            <li>It leaves the hair feeling super silky without adding any weight.  </li>
            <li>The smell seems to fade away quickly.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;&#x27;S PERFECTLY MILD SCENTED..</li>
            <li>After doing some research I found it here on Amazon for a great price and it included 3 small bottles along with the full size bottle!  </li>
            <li>it smells wonderful and makes your hair very soft and shiny without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>It felt great in my hair, didn&#x27;t feel greasy or weigh it down at all.</li>
            <li>I went to a new stylist and she couldn&#x27;t believe I color my hair because it was so healthy.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>what is a girl to do but buy a hot oil treatment!</li>
            <li>if I don&#x27;t blow dry) for an important meeting or just to kind of feel unstoppable, I do use the Orofluido</li>
            <li>This is such an amazing product.  </li>
            <li>The Item arrived within a few days of my order and was packaged great.</li>
            <li>but this is worth every dime.</li>
            <li>I was almost set on buying Moroccanoil, because overall, I liked how it felt in my hair</li>
            <li>It also absorbed into my hair well.</li>
            <li>This really is absorbed into the hair shaft.</li>
            <li>Plus, the next day my hair still looks great, no greasiness even near the roots.  </li>
            <li>Not only does my hair smell good, but it feels soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>but this one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>I like Orofluido as a great way to tame my frizzy, curly hair.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what is says: leaves hair healthy, shiny and soft!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The nice thing about Orofluido compared to other products is that it&#x27;s really light</li>
            <li>The gift set is great because it comes with a few travel sized bottles -- you won&#x27;t want to leave home without Orofluido!</li>
            <li>My hair looks nice as long as it does not rain and there is no humidity.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, so I use it sparingly - but it makes my hair so soft, shiny and gets rid of the frizzy fly-aways!  </li>
            <li>It absorbs very quickly leaving my face soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I will certainly continue to buy this item, and the [2] accompanying small bottles with this offer are great for purse/travel/desk.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin straight hair and this product is great.</li>
            <li>and since I&#x27;m paranoid I watch it pretty closely.</li>
            <li>Not often do I find a product that actually does what it says and more.</li>
            <li>I just use a nickel or a quarter size amount, warm it up between my hands and spread on wet hair.</li>
            <li>I love this product for my hair and especially my skin.</li>
            <li>After the first use I was hooked.  </li>
            <li>bouncy yet really controlling unwanted frizz!  </li>
            <li>While I wasn&#x27;t willing to pay the $40</li>
            <li>At first I thought Kpak didn&#x27;t work well</li>
            <li>Love to use this in the hair instead of wearing perfume because it&#x27;s just enough scent without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li>, I FIRST GOT IT IN ENGLAND</li>
            <li>It is a good conditioner for dry, split ends, and it makes my hair curl up softly, instead of with fly-away frizz.</li>
            <li>Now when I want sleek and smooth hair (my hair is pretty straight naturally</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey but the bottle lasts a long time and the smell is lovely (like vanilla) but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I still use good shampoo and conditioner, but a small amount of this elixer makes all the difference.  </li>
            <li>While Orofluido is much more expensive than the other two mentioned products, it has an excellent scent that the others are lacking-</li>
            <li>Because it does not impart \\&quot;extreme\\&quot; moisturization, I use it more as a finishing oil on my hair [which is somewhat dry from process color.]  </li>
            <li>Living in a dry climate for most of my life, I didn&#x27;t experience any problems with frizz, etc.</li>
            <li>My only frustration is that the large bottle of oil breaks incredibly easily.</li>
            <li>The large bottle lasted over 3 months.</li>
            <li>It has the large bottle and that&#x27;s it.  </li>
            <li>I live in Europe, and my stylist put this on me, and I instantly fell in love..</li>
            <li>I found the reviews were good for anything containing argan but there were very few brands with it listed as a main ingredient including Moroccan.  </li>
            <li>No going back to argan oil, when this oil imparts almost as much moisture with a huge plus - its heavenly sent.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It really is.</li>
            <li>My hair dries much faster through using this product as well.</li>
            <li>I discovered that with the Kpak I had to use about three times as much than orofluido.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do much for softness or anything.</li>
            <li>It was too much for my sinuses and ended up giving me a headache.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This product makes my long hair easy to manage and takes away the frizz.  </li>
            <li>I have used Morrocan Oil, in my opinion OROFLUIDO is better in that the Argan oil (and other active oil ingredients) are listed among the top, meaning there is more of it than other products that have a lot of fillers like dimethicone (the stuff that makes your hair have that \\&quot;silky\\&quot; feel).      </li>
            <li>I have fine hair that I used to blow dry straight every day, until I found this product.  </li>
            <li>considering how much you need to use (or don&#x27;t need, I should say) versus the price, I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>which is very important as I have thin, fine hair.  </li>
            <li>When she got pregnant and moved to a new salon, that was too far for me, I decided to go on the hunt for someone new.</li>
            <li>I think the full bottle will last a year or longer.  </li>
            <li>I had received a small free sample with another product and quickly ordered the large bottle when I saw the results.  </li>
            <li>Just remember that less is more when it comes to using oil products.  </li>
            <li>A big big plus is that is smells Fantastic!</li>
            <li>The main problem being moisturizing and conditioning.</li>
            <li>My older daughter recommend me to use this oil for hear.</li>
            <li>I have the most simple hair- uncolored, straight, fine yet thick...</li>
            <li>it leaves my long, straight hair feeling silky and smooth and definitely not heavy.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I am a hairstylist, and I highly recommend this product for anyone who has curly hair, that tends to be course and frizzy.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>A little more at night helps heal damage.  </li>
            <li>Also I LOVE the little sample jars it comes with</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to beat for how nice it is.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s because you only need a little bit on your hair and still have a natural, beautiful shine until the next shampoo!!!</li>
            <li>product itself is amazing on my frizzy curly thick hair and does not leave a greasy feeling either on my hands or in my hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is SHINY, SOFT, SMOOTH in any weather, shows off my natural curl pattern and is totally touchable.</li>
            <li>The One N Only left my hair greasy, the Moroccan Oil is nice just isn&#x27;t quite the same.  </li>
            <li>and I normally don&#x27;t do anything with my hair but wash it and put it in a ponytail.  </li>
            <li>Only brand left my hair feeling heavy and greasy which isn&#x27;t surprising since the first ingredients are silicone based.</li>
            <li>Until then, pretty much all products were the same for me.  </li>
            <li>I live in South Texas</li>
            <li>My stylist tried this new product on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I finished out that bottle and ordered new Orofluido.</li>
            <li>She sold me this product and some new shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>and I will never change to something new.</li>
            <li>Then, maybe 2 years ago, a trip to a new hair stylist changed my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s top-heavy with a wide mouth, which not only makes it easy to dispense too much</li>
            <li>therefore if that is an important factor to you, stick with Orofluido; if not, I say save yourself $20 and go with a different brand because as stated, all three work the same.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair.</li>
            <li>Even my fine hair is not weighted down by the oil.  </li>
            <li>It made my hair completely tangled and oily!  </li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair with a slight wave.</li>
            <li>I narrowed my choices down to Macadamia Oil, Enjoy, and MoroccanOil.</li>
            <li>I have long, color-treated (but with a base of blonde), fine, stick-straight hair and get the greasies pretty easily, so I wasn&#x27;t sure how I&#x27;d do with hair oil.</li>
            <li>Love this product as it is not oily and it does not make your hair dull or greasy.  </li>
            <li>My ends never split, my hair is soft, soft, soft.</li>
            <li>I feel like its fixed all the dryness and frizziness</li>
            <li>, My hair dried quicker and was so smooth in appearance.</li>
            <li>I am am a professional in the beauty industry and have a lot of products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got naturally curly hair and Orofluido</li>
            <li>It looses it&#x27;s natural luster and shine so</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, and use this product to add shine as well as moisturize.  </li>
            <li>I put maybe a nickel-sized amount in my palm and work it through my hair; my hair goes nearly to my waist though.</li>
            <li>I rarely have to buy products and certainly not at retail pricing</li>
            <li>As far as texturizing and control go, none of these oils tame frizzy&#x27;s or define curls imo; these oils are more meant to penetrate work to repair deeply as well as soften.</li>
            <li>Moroccan oils are definitely the way to go to achieve ultimate softness-they certainly beat the \\&quot;old oils\\&quot;, such as jojoba hot treatments and the like.  </li>
            <li>This was originally recommended to me by my hairstylist, and although I was a little taken aback by the price, I tried it.</li>
            <li>The smell is also really nice and very subtle; it is a natural, soft smell and won&#x27;t make you smell like chemicals.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel soft, look healthy in the harsh dry winter.  </li>
            <li>Once it&#x27;s dry and before I go out at night I put a little more in to texturize and define my waves.  </li>
            <li>It has a very lovely scent, it last a very long time, and you only need a few drops at a time.</li>
            <li>I use it when I first wash my hair, and then each morning when I wake up, after I wet my hair and comb it through.  </li>
            <li>It does NOT weigh your hair down like so many other products.</li>
            <li>and I was worried I woudn&#x27;t find it in the US; this is the same stuff I purchased there - a little cheaper and came with free samples I now have shared with friends.</li>
            <li>I appreciated the three samples of the elixir that came in the box - they are essential because I travel a lot for work and don&#x27;t want to bring the big bottle with me in case it breaks in my bag or security steals it.</li>
            <li>I have limp, straight hair in the very humid Florida climate.</li>
            <li>Morrocan never did anything for my hair other than make it smell funny.</li>
            <li>My hair gets dried out VERY easily (from coloring and health issues) but a little of this out of the shower, and it keeps the dryness at bay.  </li>
            <li>It does seem to work a little better if your hair isn&#x27;t sopping wet, so I&#x27;d recommend drying it off just a little bit first.</li>
            <li>Not only does she know how to cut my ton of naturally curly hair, she is a wealth of knowledge.</li>
            <li>It has leaked on me during a trip though, so be careful to tighten the cap really well and use a couple Ziploc bags for protection.</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny, soft, and lays flat.  </li>
            <li>I have to be very careful not to weigh my hair with too much product.</li>
            <li>pour a small amount into you hand and then rub it all over your hands like you&#x27;re putting on lotion, then start applying it to the middle of your damp strands down to the ends, and finally get up near the crown after most of the product is already onto your hair.  </li>
            <li>saw my hair stylist pour a small amount of golden liquid into his palm, and massage it into my hair.</li>
            <li>My first experience with it was a sample that last me a few months.  </li>
            <li>I have thin hair that breaks easily at the ends and must be trimmed every 6-8 weeks.  </li>
            <li>I have very thick, fine hair.</li>
            <li>While I initially loved the Moroccan Oil brand I tried something less expensive</li>

            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> THE best product for giving hair a natural, healthy texture and shine.  </li>
            <li> I immediately transferred mine into a plastic bottle with a shampoo-type &#x27;push&#x27; top.</li>
            <li> and I get so many compliments on my hair now.  </li>
            <li> I got a sample of this and fell in love.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too fond of the Macadamia Oil scent and it felt slightly more greasy in my hair compared to the others.</li>
            <li> Enjoy felt nice in my hair, but I wasn&#x27;t too fond of the citrus scent.</li>
            <li> Best of all is that i only need to apply it now once every three days.</li>
            <li> But also this product is phenomenal on your skin.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t keep from touching my hair</li>
            <li> I use it on many clients and find that it leaves the hair</li>
            <li> It Keeps my hair smooth and silky all day!</li>
            <li> my hair remains smooth and manageable, even in Texas humidity!</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily looking, but shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> The smell is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love the product, but I did not receive the Gift Set.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love the way it smells.....</li>
            <li> I really love this product</li>
            <li> and it comes with 3 smaller vials which are perfect for travel or keeping in your purse to keep your hair superfly on the go.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff, however this is NOT a gift set like the description says.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many others including morrocanoil</li>
            <li> What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> and I just love this elixir.</li>
            <li> but they were nothing magical.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS</li>
            <li> I LOVE HOW MY HAIR FEELS AND SMELLS.</li>
            <li> Love the scent (not too strong).  </li>
            <li> Perfect solution for dry hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair stylist (at one of those super trendy high-end salons in LA) explained how to use this (or any product) like this:  </li>
            <li> So happy Amazon offers it!</li>
            <li> Love the fact that they give you free samples with the product so that you can share with friends and family.  </li>
            <li> Glad it is available here.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of this Orofluido hair oil, and was instantly in love.  </li>
            <li> It was smooth, shiny, and looked and felt healthy.</li>
            <li> and I loved it so much that I decided to purchase it.  </li>
            <li> Let me first say this is a wonderful product which provides major silkiness, softness and shine.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, leaves my hair so soft and shiny and really moisturizes my curls.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it makes my hair look amazing and feel super soft and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;highly recomned this to anyone with curly, fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have extremely fine, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> While this product also has silicone as the first ingredient it contains three different oils and has a wonderful smell.</li>
            <li> I have medium/long hair, and it looks even better after a quick flat-iron as well.</li>
            <li> For the price, this product contains natural oils comparable to, but better than, most argan oils!...and the SMELL...makes you want to put it on EVERYTHING!</li>
            <li> the little hint of vanilla is perfect!</li>
            <li> Since my own hair is fine and straight</li>
            <li> The smaller bottles are perfect if you travel so you aren&#x27;t packing a large glass</li>
            <li> and it helps keep it shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair silky smooth and even improves the color/luster.  </li>
            <li> It smells fantastic also.</li>
            <li> It will make your hair shinny and smoothly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different brands and have to say this, by far, is the best.</li>
            <li> I use it every morning before I leave the house &amp; it is fabulous.</li>
            <li> They are all fantastic products</li>
            <li> My hair can magically have static and this really helps.</li>
            <li> I hope they keep making this forever because I love it so much. :)</li>
            <li> The smell is soft, smells good.</li>
            <li> but the fragrance is very powerful and longlasting.  </li>
            <li> but, if you do happen to knock it over, you&#x27;re pretty much guaranteed to spill a good portion of the product.</li>
            <li> Pretty sure heaven smells just like this..</li>
            <li> But something completely unique to Orofluido (aside from the intoxicating scent) is the mixture of organic oils-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> It was definitely worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> The small glass bottles are perfect travel sizes / weekend sizes.  </li>
            <li> It smells amazing and leaves my hair so soft and shiny!  </li>
            <li> easy right?</li>
            <li> The smell is nothing special...</li>
            <li> My hair is shiny, soft and amazing when I use it.</li>
            <li> it smell similar to moroccanoil but not as good.  </li>
            <li> I love this oil, providing I don&#x27;t apply too much.</li>
            <li> I am sure that it is very helpfull.</li>
            <li> The latest shampoos including the low sudsing options may be better for my hair but require that i reach for a de-tangling  product to keep my hair from breaking  off and to regain a silky feel.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy that I found the same product at Amazon and much cheaper price.</li>
            <li> It leaves the hair feeling super silky without adding any weight.  </li>
            <li> The smell seems to fade away quickly.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;&#x27;S PERFECTLY MILD SCENTED..</li>
            <li> After doing some research I found it here on Amazon for a great price and it included 3 small bottles along with the full size bottle!  </li>
            <li> it smells wonderful and makes your hair very soft and shiny without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> It felt great in my hair, didn&#x27;t feel greasy or weigh it down at all.</li>
            <li> I went to a new stylist and she couldn&#x27;t believe I color my hair because it was so healthy.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> what is a girl to do but buy a hot oil treatment!</li>
            <li> if I don&#x27;t blow dry) for an important meeting or just to kind of feel unstoppable, I do use the Orofluido</li>
            <li> This is such an amazing product.  </li>
            <li> The Item arrived within a few days of my order and was packaged great.</li>
            <li> but this is worth every dime.</li>
            <li> I was almost set on buying Moroccanoil, because overall, I liked how it felt in my hair</li>
            <li> It also absorbed into my hair well.</li>
            <li> This really is absorbed into the hair shaft.</li>
            <li> Plus, the next day my hair still looks great, no greasiness even near the roots.  </li>
            <li> Not only does my hair smell good, but it feels soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> but this one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> I like Orofluido as a great way to tame my frizzy, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what is says: leaves hair healthy, shiny and soft!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The nice thing about Orofluido compared to other products is that it&#x27;s really light</li>
            <li> The gift set is great because it comes with a few travel sized bottles -- you won&#x27;t want to leave home without Orofluido!</li>
            <li> My hair looks nice as long as it does not rain and there is no humidity.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, so I use it sparingly - but it makes my hair so soft, shiny and gets rid of the frizzy fly-aways!  </li>
            <li> It absorbs very quickly leaving my face soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I will certainly continue to buy this item, and the [2] accompanying small bottles with this offer are great for purse/travel/desk.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin straight hair and this product is great.</li>
            <li> and since I&#x27;m paranoid I watch it pretty closely.</li>
            <li> Not often do I find a product that actually does what it says and more.</li>
            <li> I just use a nickel or a quarter size amount, warm it up between my hands and spread on wet hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product for my hair and especially my skin.</li>
            <li> After the first use I was hooked.  </li>
            <li> bouncy yet really controlling unwanted frizz!  </li>
            <li> While I wasn&#x27;t willing to pay the $40</li>
            <li> At first I thought Kpak didn&#x27;t work well</li>
            <li> Love to use this in the hair instead of wearing perfume because it&#x27;s just enough scent without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li> , I FIRST GOT IT IN ENGLAND</li>
            <li> It is a good conditioner for dry, split ends, and it makes my hair curl up softly, instead of with fly-away frizz.</li>
            <li> Now when I want sleek and smooth hair (my hair is pretty straight naturally</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey but the bottle lasts a long time and the smell is lovely (like vanilla) but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> I still use good shampoo and conditioner, but a small amount of this elixer makes all the difference.  </li>
            <li> While Orofluido is much more expensive than the other two mentioned products, it has an excellent scent that the others are lacking-</li>
            <li> Because it does not impart \\&quot;extreme\\&quot; moisturization, I use it more as a finishing oil on my hair [which is somewhat dry from process color.]  </li>
            <li> Living in a dry climate for most of my life, I didn&#x27;t experience any problems with frizz, etc.</li>
            <li> My only frustration is that the large bottle of oil breaks incredibly easily.</li>
            <li> The large bottle lasted over 3 months.</li>
            <li> It has the large bottle and that&#x27;s it.  </li>
            <li> I live in Europe, and my stylist put this on me, and I instantly fell in love..</li>
            <li> I found the reviews were good for anything containing argan but there were very few brands with it listed as a main ingredient including Moroccan.  </li>
            <li> No going back to argan oil, when this oil imparts almost as much moisture with a huge plus - its heavenly sent.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It really is.</li>
            <li> My hair dries much faster through using this product as well.</li>
            <li> I discovered that with the Kpak I had to use about three times as much than orofluido.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do much for softness or anything.</li>
            <li> It was too much for my sinuses and ended up giving me a headache.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> This product makes my long hair easy to manage and takes away the frizz.  </li>
            <li> I have used Morrocan Oil, in my opinion OROFLUIDO is better in that the Argan oil (and other active oil ingredients) are listed among the top, meaning there is more of it than other products that have a lot of fillers like dimethicone (the stuff that makes your hair have that \\&quot;silky\\&quot; feel).      </li>
            <li> I have fine hair that I used to blow dry straight every day, until I found this product.  </li>
            <li> considering how much you need to use (or don&#x27;t need, I should say) versus the price, I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> which is very important as I have thin, fine hair.  </li>
            <li> When she got pregnant and moved to a new salon, that was too far for me, I decided to go on the hunt for someone new.</li>
            <li> I think the full bottle will last a year or longer.  </li>
            <li> I had received a small free sample with another product and quickly ordered the large bottle when I saw the results.  </li>
            <li> Just remember that less is more when it comes to using oil products.  </li>
            <li> A big big plus is that is smells Fantastic!</li>
            <li> The main problem being moisturizing and conditioning.</li>
            <li> My older daughter recommend me to use this oil for hear.</li>
            <li> I have the most simple hair- uncolored, straight, fine yet thick...</li>
            <li> it leaves my long, straight hair feeling silky and smooth and definitely not heavy.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I am a hairstylist, and I highly recommend this product for anyone who has curly hair, that tends to be course and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> A little more at night helps heal damage.  </li>
            <li> Also I LOVE the little sample jars it comes with</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to beat for how nice it is.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s because you only need a little bit on your hair and still have a natural, beautiful shine until the next shampoo!!!</li>
            <li> product itself is amazing on my frizzy curly thick hair and does not leave a greasy feeling either on my hands or in my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is SHINY, SOFT, SMOOTH in any weather, shows off my natural curl pattern and is totally touchable.</li>
            <li> The One N Only left my hair greasy, the Moroccan Oil is nice just isn&#x27;t quite the same.  </li>
            <li> and I normally don&#x27;t do anything with my hair but wash it and put it in a ponytail.  </li>
            <li> Only brand left my hair feeling heavy and greasy which isn&#x27;t surprising since the first ingredients are silicone based.</li>
            <li> Until then, pretty much all products were the same for me.  </li>
            <li> I live in South Texas</li>
            <li> My stylist tried this new product on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I finished out that bottle and ordered new Orofluido.</li>
            <li> She sold me this product and some new shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> and I will never change to something new.</li>
            <li> Then, maybe 2 years ago, a trip to a new hair stylist changed my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s top-heavy with a wide mouth, which not only makes it easy to dispense too much</li>
            <li> therefore if that is an important factor to you, stick with Orofluido; if not, I say save yourself $20 and go with a different brand because as stated, all three work the same.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Even my fine hair is not weighted down by the oil.  </li>
            <li> It made my hair completely tangled and oily!  </li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair with a slight wave.</li>
            <li> I narrowed my choices down to Macadamia Oil, Enjoy, and MoroccanOil.</li>
            <li> I have long, color-treated (but with a base of blonde), fine, stick-straight hair and get the greasies pretty easily, so I wasn&#x27;t sure how I&#x27;d do with hair oil.</li>
            <li> Love this product as it is not oily and it does not make your hair dull or greasy.  </li>
            <li> My ends never split, my hair is soft, soft, soft.</li>
            <li> I feel like its fixed all the dryness and frizziness</li>
            <li> , My hair dried quicker and was so smooth in appearance.</li>
            <li> I am am a professional in the beauty industry and have a lot of products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got naturally curly hair and Orofluido</li>
            <li> It looses it&#x27;s natural luster and shine so</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, and use this product to add shine as well as moisturize.  </li>
            <li> I put maybe a nickel-sized amount in my palm and work it through my hair; my hair goes nearly to my waist though.</li>
            <li> I rarely have to buy products and certainly not at retail pricing</li>
            <li> As far as texturizing and control go, none of these oils tame frizzy&#x27;s or define curls imo; these oils are more meant to penetrate work to repair deeply as well as soften.</li>
            <li> Moroccan oils are definitely the way to go to achieve ultimate softness-they certainly beat the \\&quot;old oils\\&quot;, such as jojoba hot treatments and the like.  </li>
            <li> This was originally recommended to me by my hairstylist, and although I was a little taken aback by the price, I tried it.</li>
            <li> The smell is also really nice and very subtle; it is a natural, soft smell and won&#x27;t make you smell like chemicals.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel soft, look healthy in the harsh dry winter.  </li>
            <li> Once it&#x27;s dry and before I go out at night I put a little more in to texturize and define my waves.  </li>
            <li> It has a very lovely scent, it last a very long time, and you only need a few drops at a time.</li>
            <li> I use it when I first wash my hair, and then each morning when I wake up, after I wet my hair and comb it through.  </li>
            <li> It does NOT weigh your hair down like so many other products.</li>
            <li> and I was worried I woudn&#x27;t find it in the US; this is the same stuff I purchased there - a little cheaper and came with free samples I now have shared with friends.</li>
            <li> I appreciated the three samples of the elixir that came in the box - they are essential because I travel a lot for work and don&#x27;t want to bring the big bottle with me in case it breaks in my bag or security steals it.</li>
            <li> I have limp, straight hair in the very humid Florida climate.</li>
            <li> Morrocan never did anything for my hair other than make it smell funny.</li>
            <li> My hair gets dried out VERY easily (from coloring and health issues) but a little of this out of the shower, and it keeps the dryness at bay.  </li>
            <li> It does seem to work a little better if your hair isn&#x27;t sopping wet, so I&#x27;d recommend drying it off just a little bit first.</li>
            <li> Not only does she know how to cut my ton of naturally curly hair, she is a wealth of knowledge.</li>
            <li> It has leaked on me during a trip though, so be careful to tighten the cap really well and use a couple Ziploc bags for protection.</li>
            <li> My hair is shiny, soft, and lays flat.  </li>
            <li> I have to be very careful not to weigh my hair with too much product.</li>
            <li> pour a small amount into you hand and then rub it all over your hands like you&#x27;re putting on lotion, then start applying it to the middle of your damp strands down to the ends, and finally get up near the crown after most of the product is already onto your hair.  </li>
            <li> saw my hair stylist pour a small amount of golden liquid into his palm, and massage it into my hair.</li>
            <li> My first experience with it was a sample that last me a few months.  </li>
            <li> I have thin hair that breaks easily at the ends and must be trimmed every 6-8 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, fine hair.</li>
            <li> While I initially loved the Moroccan Oil brand I tried something less expensive</li>
            <li> I recently changed salons after my previous stylist just wasn&#x27;t doing a good job cutting and coloring my hair anymore.</li>
            <li> If you put too much in when your hair is dry, it can look a little oily, so use sparingly.</li>
            <li> Not only did it curb some of the breakage, but it makes my hair feel soft and not weighed down like the Morroccan Oil did.  </li>
            <li> My hair is  very straight and thin so even the lightest product weights my hair down and makes it look very greasy.  </li>
            <li> but before I flat iron it.  </li>
            <li> gives a natural shine without weighing my hair down and my hair doesn&#x27;t look greasy.  </li>
            <li> As an african american female with coarse tight frizzy hair it has been a struggle to find products that work for my hair type.</li>
            <li> This way you don&#x27;t get one spot of tons of goop and bare spots in other places.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few months and have barely made a dent in the amount of product left in the bottle.</li>
            <li> I am a life long user now!</li>
            <li> Now I put a dime size of Orofluido in my hair and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> This product will prevent the dry look I sometimes get....</li>
            <li> Also, whether I&#x27;m letting my hair air dry or blow drying it, this product reduces drying time as well.</li>
            <li> Makes it feel silky, helps with dry ends,</li>
            <li> Even though i never apply heat to curl or dry it my hair</li>
            <li> Use this oil when you dry your hair after shampooing.</li>
            <li> As for frizz control, it helped, but so did a blow dry.</li>
            <li> I rub a nickel-sized amount into the ends after I wash before I blow dry.</li>
            <li> On really dry days I may add some after it&#x27;s dry to control my wispy bits.</li>
            <li> Then blow dry.  </li>
            <li> If I take a shower at night, I still use Orofluido both after my shower and in the morning when my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m white with thin straight hair.</li>
            <li> and it seriously looked like I had just left the salon with a professional blow-out.  </li>
            <li> I use it when my hair is wet (just before I blowdry it) and hold my hair in a low ponytail to evenly distribute among my ends (from the ponytail down</li>
            <li> While he didn&#x27;t offer to sell me any Orofluido, I was certain it was the secret ingredient to my hair</li>
            <li> A little further research lead me to Orofluido .</li>
            <li> Once a moved to a (slightly) more humid climate, every day was a bad hair day.</li>
            <li> my long, super-dry colored hair usually doesn&#x27;t like hair oils, ironically they make my hair too greasy, especially if I skip a day of washing.  </li>
            <li> I never appreciated my waves until now</li>
            <li> I expected \\&quot;amazing\\&quot; results as others have raved about the product.</li>
            <li> like i said i have been using the oil for a little over a year and still have over a half of a bottom left.</li>
            <li> oh and a bottle lasts quite long since so little is needed.</li>
            <li> And a single bottle seems like it will last me at least three months - probably longer.  </li>
            <li> It comes with three small caps, so its possible to carry on easier on travels.    </li>
            <li> Only takes a very small amount so the bottle lasts for a long time.  </li>
            <li> a combination of amber, vanilla, and some other things.  </li>
            <li> I love how soft, shiny, and tangle-resistant this serum makes my hair, but the bottle design is horrible.</li>
            <li> I hate that i spent $40 in the salon for this product but love the fact</li>
            <li> The weather in Minnesota in the winter is dry and harsh on my hair and skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey but a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> : it&#x27;s been a year and my bottle isn&#x27;t even half empty!</li>
            <li> I travel a lot for work, so I went ahead and got the gift set, which also include three small bottles, which have been a blessing after long plane rides.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was not blessed with thick, full hair like some of my friends.  </li>
            <li> Hands down, if you have thick curly or coarse hair</li>
            <li> It does not in any way weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li> Does not weight my hair down...</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> like it&#x27;s weighed down.</li>
            <li> I have also found that i use less of all my products and my hair dries faster.</li>
            <li> I have really thick long hair</li>
            <li> I am a black woman with thick, unrelaxed, colored hair and I use this product after I blow dry my hair</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase my 1sy bottle with slight hesitation because it looks like heavy oil.</li>
            <li> BORING is more like it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a little over a year now...</li>
            <li> I just put a little on the ends of my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair gal turned me on to this with a little sample she was given at a hair convention.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a total of 5 bottles, which have all broken after a slight knock on my bathroom counter (salvaged the oil</li>
            <li> Forget struggling with the round brush every morning.  </li>
            <li> the salon was charging I figured I could find it cheaper on Amazon...which I did for half the cost!</li>
            <li> With dry hair, I dab a very, very small amount (I put my finger over the bottle, turn it upside down, and then take my finger off so there&#x27;s hardly any) and then dab my fingers over any flyaway strands.</li>
            <li> One thing I was disappointed is that it didn&#x27;t come with three mini sample bottles that are useful for traveling.</li>
            <li> I have long hair which tends to be thin, although I have a lot of it.</li>
            <li> Although expensive, just a little bit goes a long way, and this package lasted me over 6 months.  </li>
            <li> had to return , did not include small travel bottles as advertised</li>
            <li> Well I was amazed when I used just a small dime size amount and spread thru my hair</li>
            <li> Not sure it regrows hair</li>
            <li> I also like the small samples it comes with.</li>
            <li> so the weather can be very harsh on my hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair that tend to look like a mass.</li>
            <li> After moving to the desert, I was seriously considering cutting off my long hair because it was so frizzy and unattractive.  </li>
            <li> I have dry hair (tips) because I swim like 4 times a week and the salt and chlor is awful for the hair... while I dry my hair</li>
            <li> that its here on amazon for half the cost!!!!  </li>
            <li> I use just a small amount on damp dry hair and my boring locks look and FEEL like I just walked out of the salon,</li>
            <li> Well let me tell you this made it all worse!  </li>
            <li> This is a much much worse version of Moroccanoil!  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use ANYTHING oily so was skeptical when given a sample of this..</li>
            <li> I was skeptical -</li>
            <li> I received a sample of Orofluido in a Birch Box and was extremely skeptical.  </li>
            <li> Usually I hate vanilla smell, but this oil has no strong smell.</li>
            <li> I hate to be without it.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely awful!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> had to return , did not include small travel bottles as advertised</li>
            <li> I am such a fan of this elixir.  It is light-weight and adds good hydration and shine to the hair.  A big big plus is that is smells Fantastic!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, so I use it sparingly - but it makes my hair so soft, shiny and gets rid of the frizzy fly-aways!  I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I love how soft, shiny, and tangle-resistant this serum makes my hair, but the bottle design is horrible. It&#x27;s top-heavy with a wide mouth, which not only makes it easy to dispense too much but, if you do happen to knock it over, you&#x27;re pretty much guaranteed to spill a good portion of the product. I immediately transferred mine into a plastic bottle with a shampoo-type &#x27;push&#x27; top.</li>
            <li> This stuff rocks and I like the smell too.  I have really thick long hair and it helps keep it shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> this smells so good if you like vanilla..&lt;br /&gt;my hair always smells nice. When ever I curl my hair&lt;br /&gt;I use this after my hair cools off and it holds my hair in the curls&lt;br /&gt;I get compliemts all the time about how nice my hair looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;highly recomned this to anyone with curly, fine hair.</li>
            <li> Orofluido is amazing!! I live in South Texas so the weather can be very harsh on my hair. This product does wonders...my hair is silky, managable and looks awesome! I feel like its fixed all the dryness and frizziness the humidity has caused. My hair smells glorious as well...the little hint of vanilla is perfect!</li>
            <li> No going back to argan oil, when this oil imparts almost as much moisture with a huge plus - its heavenly sent. Doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair. Because it does not impart \\&quot;extreme\\&quot; moisturization, I use it more as a finishing oil on my hair [which is somewhat dry from process color.]  I rub any residual oil remaining on my palms onto arms and elbows. I will certainly continue to buy this item, and the [2] accompanying small bottles with this offer are great for purse/travel/desk.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser initially told me about this product and used it in my hair. I decided to purchase my 1sy bottle with slight hesitation because it looks like heavy oil. Well I was amazed when I used just a small dime size amount and spread thru my hair, My hair dried quicker and was so smooth in appearance. It does NOT weigh your hair down like so many other products. Try it!!! I am on my 4th bottle... oh and a bottle lasts quite long since so little is needed.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely awful!  I was hoping to find something that eliminated some of the frizz and created a bit of softness to my hair.  I recently had a baby and my hair has not been the same since.  Well let me tell you this made it all worse!  It made my hair completely tangled and oily!  This is a much much worse version of Moroccanoil!  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!  The smell is nothing special... it smell similar to moroccanoil but not as good.  I wanted to return this as I do not see myself ever using it again but can not.  Will not be buying anything like this from amazon moving forward... I&#x27;ll stick with sephora!</li>
            <li> Love this hair product! It gives my hair shine, enhances my curls, and my hair has never been softer. It also smells great. I would recommend this product without hesitation!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair with a slight wave. I have to be very careful not to weigh my hair with too much product. I love this oil, providing I don&#x27;t apply too much. My hair is shiny and silky. I have a friend now hooked on it also and she has hair that has been over processed and damaged. She feels her hair shines and is smoother.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that I used to blow dry straight every day, until I found this product.  Now I put a dime size of Orofluido in my hair and let it air dry. Once it&#x27;s dry and before I go out at night I put a little more in to texturize and define my waves.  I never appreciated my waves until now and I get so many compliments on my hair now.  Forget struggling with the round brush every morning.  Now it takes me about 90 seconds to do my hair!!!</li>
            <li> I have extremely fine, curly hair.  I have tried lots of products to help give my hair some structure and humidity resistance.  This product will prevent the dry look I sometimes get....but it does not lock out humidity. My hair looks nice as long as it does not rain and there is no humidity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m white with thin straight hair. I can&#x27;t use ANYTHING oily so was skeptical when given a sample of this.. But I love it! I got it to help re-grow thinning hair so I can&#x27;t comment on that for months till I see if it works.. BUT, my hair is softer, not oily at ALL and it smells SOOO good! Pretty sure heaven smells just like this..&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE: it&#x27;s been a year and my bottle isn&#x27;t even half empty! (I only use it in the corners of my scalp) Not sure it regrows hair but I haven&#x27;t noticed it any thinner.. and since I&#x27;m paranoid I watch it pretty closely. Fantastic product!!</li>
            <li> My stylist tried this new product on my hair.  The rep had just sold her some while I was sitting there.  It has MADE THE DIFFERENCE in the shine and texture of my hair.  I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, with a nice price. It comes with three small caps, so its possible to carry on easier on travels.    Came well packed. I recommend it, and buy again.    Thanks</li>
            <li> Love this product as it is not oily and it does not make your hair dull or greasy.  It has a very lovely scent, it last a very long time, and you only need a few drops at a time.</li>
            <li> I am am a professional in the beauty industry and have a lot of products. I got a sample of this and fell in love. I rarely have to buy products and certainly not at retail pricing but this is worth every dime. My hair is shiny, soft and amazing when I use it.</li>
            <li> I like Orofluido as a great way to tame my frizzy, curly hair.  I use it when I first wash my hair, and then each morning when I wake up, after I wet my hair and comb it through.  It is a good conditioner for dry, split ends, and it makes my hair curl up softly, instead of with fly-away frizz.</li>
            <li> I have the most simple hair- uncolored, straight, fine yet thick...easy right? BORING is more like it! And as I creep into my 30&#x27;s the texture of my hair has changed esp. after children.. I live in Europe, and my stylist put this on me, and I instantly fell in love.. I use just a small amount on damp dry hair and my boring locks look and FEEL like I just walked out of the salon, no joke. I have medium/long hair, and it looks even better after a quick flat-iron as well. I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> Let me first say this is a wonderful product which provides major silkiness, softness and shine. Hands down, if you have thick curly or coarse hair Moroccan oils are definitely the way to go to achieve ultimate softness-they certainly beat the \\&quot;old oils\\&quot;, such as jojoba hot treatments and the like.  With that said, I admit that Orofluido works and achieves the same results as one would get from using MOROCCANOIL brand (abt $12)and also One &#x27;n Only Argan Oil Treatment ($10). While Orofluido is much more expensive than the other two mentioned products, it has an excellent scent that the others are lacking- therefore if that is an important factor to you, stick with Orofluido; if not, I say save yourself $20 and go with a different brand because as stated, all three work the same. But something completely unique to Orofluido (aside from the intoxicating scent) is the mixture of organic oils- Lindseed, Cyperus and Argan oil (Argan being in in One and Only oil as well). As far as texturizing and control go, none of these oils tame frizzy&#x27;s or define curls imo; these oils are more meant to penetrate work to repair deeply as well as soften.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of the Orofluido Hair serum in my Birchbox one month and I loved it so much that I decided to purchase it.  After doing some research I found it here on Amazon for a great price and it included 3 small bottles along with the full size bottle!  I was able to share some with my daughter and my  stylist!  It smells amazing and leaves my hair so soft and shiny!  I look forward to using it every day.  Also the shipping was great....received my order within a couple of days!  Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I bought this on a blog recommendation - and based on the information that it&#x27;s good for all hair types. It really is. I have fine, thin straight hair and this product is great. It does not in any way weigh down my hair. My hair can magically have static and this really helps. It does not make my hair look greasy, and adds a great shine. My hair dries much faster through using this product as well.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it makes my hair look amazing and feel super soft and it smells amazing. My mom has even become a fan and she is not purchasing this product as well! Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d received a sample of OROFLUIDO in my BIRCHBOX Monthly Subscription and fell in LOOOVE. It&#x27;s the best product my hair&#x27;s ever had, it made my hair soft, shiny, and silky. For the price, this product contains natural oils comparable to, but better than, most argan oils!...and the SMELL...makes you want to put it on EVERYTHING!</li>
            <li> This product is the best!  It smells so great and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling oily!  I am a life long user now!</li>
            <li> THE best product for giving hair a natural, healthy texture and shine.  I&#x27;ve got naturally curly hair and Orofluido is my new best friend! a dime size amount in the morning, crimped into the ends then fingered through my hair and I&#x27;m set to go.  I had received a small free sample with another product and quickly ordered the large bottle when I saw the results.  Try it - you&#x27;ll love it too!</li>
            <li> Although expensive, just a little bit goes a long way, and this package lasted me over 6 months.  It feels and smells amazing, and speeds up the blow-dry process.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I was in the market for a good hair oil and did some research on some popular brands. I narrowed my choices down to Macadamia Oil, Enjoy, and MoroccanOil. I wasn&#x27;t too fond of the Macadamia Oil scent and it felt slightly more greasy in my hair compared to the others. Enjoy felt nice in my hair, but I wasn&#x27;t too fond of the citrus scent. I was almost set on buying Moroccanoil, because overall, I liked how it felt in my hair and I liked the fragrance. Then I came across Orofluido, and instantly changed my mind. It felt great in my hair, didn&#x27;t feel greasy or weigh it down at all. It also absorbed into my hair well. An best of all, it smells great! Also, whether I&#x27;m letting my hair air dry or blow drying it, this product reduces drying time as well. I also like the small samples it comes with. I keep one in the office for whenever I feel my hair needs some extra smoothing out and silkiness.</li>
            <li> This has got to be the best product I have EVER found for hair.  Even my fine hair is not weighted down by the oil.  Makes it feel silky, helps with dry ends, no frizz, smells wonderful. Only takes a very small amount so the bottle lasts for a long time.  I&#x27;ve given Orofluido as a gift to several friends and family.  Everyone has raved about it also, regardless of their hair type. Not often do I find a product that actually does what it says and more.</li>
            <li> As an african american female with coarse tight frizzy hair it has been a struggle to find products that work for my hair type. The main problem being moisturizing and conditioning. The majority of products contain ingredients that will de-tangle and add shine however they have no lasting benefit. These just sit on my hair and shampoo off. The latest shampoos including the low sudsing options may be better for my hair but require that i reach for a de-tangling  product to keep my hair from breaking  off and to regain a silky feel.  I relax my hair twice a year so my scalp can breath and the length is visible and recently i started using Carol&#x27;s Daughter curl products which actually improved the texture of my hair.  Even though i never apply heat to curl or dry it my hair it was still not holding enough moisture.  I heard about the  Moroccan Oil brand which contains argan oil and did some research. I found the reviews were good for anything containing argan but there were very few brands with it listed as a main ingredient including Moroccan.  A little further research lead me to Orofluido . I have been using it for a month now and still have two thirds of the bottle left.  This really is absorbed into the hair shaft. My hair is SHINY, SOFT, SMOOTH in any weather, shows off my natural curl pattern and is totally touchable. There is no oil on my fingers after i touch it or on my clothing. I have also found that i use less of all my products and my hair dries faster. Best of all is that i only need to apply it now once every three days. This to me is proof of its affects and makes it an excellent value.  Orofluido is my hair&#x27;s new best friend.</li>
            <li> My mother-in-law started using this oil on her hair via her hair stylist and she was urging me to try it.  I was skeptical - my long, super-dry colored hair usually doesn&#x27;t like hair oils, ironically they make my hair too greasy, especially if I skip a day of washing.  Not the case with this stuff!  I just use a nickel or a quarter size amount, warm it up between my hands and spread on wet hair. It makes my hair silky smooth and even improves the color/luster.  Plus, the next day my hair still looks great, no greasiness even near the roots.  It&#x27;s pricey but the bottle lasts a long time and the smell is lovely (like vanilla) but not overpowering.  I appreciated the three samples of the elixir that came in the box - they are essential because I travel a lot for work and don&#x27;t want to bring the big bottle with me in case it breaks in my bag or security steals it.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! it smells wonderful and makes your hair very soft and shiny without weighing it down. I&#x27;ve had it for a few months and have barely made a dent in the amount of product left in the bottle. I hope they keep making this forever because I love it so much. :)</li>
            <li> This product is probably one of the best for hair care.  It does exactly what is says: leaves hair healthy, shiny and soft!  This product is so good, I recommend it to women of all ages and buy it for my family and friends. It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Moroccan Oil, the One N Only Argan oil from Sally&#x27;s and now the Orofluido.  There is no comparison!  The One N Only left my hair greasy, the Moroccan Oil is nice just isn&#x27;t quite the same.  The Orofluido leaves my hair silky and soft and smelling wonderful!  It&#x27;s a little pricey but a little goes a long way.  My first experience with it was a sample that last me a few months.  I think the full bottle will last a year or longer.  It&#x27;s hard to beat for how nice it is.</li>
            <li> This product is AWESOME!  Love the scent (not too strong).  I have coarse hair, this oil helps fight frizziness leaving my hair with a lux feel.  Love the fact that they give you free samples with the product so that you can share with friends and family.  I have used Morrocan Oil, in my opinion OROFLUIDO is better in that the Argan oil (and other active oil ingredients) are listed among the top, meaning there is more of it than other products that have a lot of fillers like dimethicone (the stuff that makes your hair have that \\&quot;silky\\&quot; feel).      Just remember that less is more when it comes to using oil products.  You can always build (add) to achieve the desired style.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was not blessed with thick, full hair like some of my friends.  I have thin hair that breaks easily at the ends and must be trimmed every 6-8 weeks.  My stylist&#x27;s assistant told me about this product and recommended that I use it only on my ends, so I tried it.  Not only did it curb some of the breakage, but it makes my hair feel soft and not weighed down like the Morroccan Oil did.  I use it when my hair is wet (just before I blowdry it) and hold my hair in a low ponytail to evenly distribute among my ends (from the ponytail down I rub the oil in my hair).  Not only does my hair smell good, but it feels soft and smooth.  I have even been able to go one week longer in between trims (no kidding!).  I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> I am a hairstylist, and I highly recommend this product for anyone who has curly hair, that tends to be course and frizzy. Since my own hair is fine and straight I use just a bit before my blow out for shine and silkiness. But also this product is phenomenal on your skin. I wash my face at night to get rid of makeup and I slather a dime size amount all over my face and neck. It absorbs very quickly leaving my face soft and silky. I use it on my hands in the winter to combat dryness and on my knees, elbows and heels as well. It smells fantastic also. I am never without Orofluido. I love this product for my hair and especially my skin.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of Orofluido in a Birch Box and was extremely skeptical.  I went online to the Orofluido website and was shaking my head at how wonderful they made their product sound.  I am not a girly girl and I normally don&#x27;t do anything with my hair but wash it and put it in a ponytail.  My hair is  very straight and thin so even the lightest product weights my hair down and makes it look very greasy.  I tried Orofluido and could not believe the difference in my hair.  I couldn&#x27;t keep from touching my hair it was so soft and felt wonderful.  After the first use I was hooked.  I even went out and bought a curling iron.  This product is a miracle and I have told all of my friends about it.  WONDERFUL.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil at 5000yen ($50) in Japan 3 years ago and since then I have been using it. I&#x27;m so happy that I found the same product at Amazon and much cheaper price. Use this oil when you dry your hair after shampooing. It will make your hair shinny and smoothly. Usually I hate vanilla smell, but this oil has no strong smell. It doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. One thing I was disappointed is that it didn&#x27;t come with three mini sample bottles that are useful for traveling. According to the description, it should come with them, but it did not.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever bought for my hair.  My hair gets dried out VERY easily (from coloring and health issues) but a little of this out of the shower, and it keeps the dryness at bay.  A little more at night helps heal damage.  considering how much you need to use (or don&#x27;t need, I should say) versus the price, I highly recommend this product.  It also works great at moisturizing freshly shaved legs.</li>
            <li> My supplier stopped carrying Orofluido Elixir so I was very happy to find it here.  This is such an amazing product.  It leaves the hair feeling super silky without adding any weight.  I use it on many clients and find that it leaves the hair bouncy yet really controlling unwanted frizz!  And yes I can use a curling iron and it will hold!</li>
            <li> My best friend is a hair stylist and said that as we age, just like everything else, we see changes with our hair. It looses it&#x27;s natural luster and shine so what is a girl to do but buy a hot oil treatment! I&#x27;ve tried many different brands and have to say this, by far, is the best. While I initially loved the Moroccan Oil brand I tried something less expensive and you definitely get what you pay for. The One n&#x27; Only brand left my hair feeling heavy and greasy which isn&#x27;t surprising since the first ingredients are silicone based. Recently, I got my hair cut and the stylist used this product and I loved it! While I wasn&#x27;t willing to pay the $40 the salon was charging I figured I could find it cheaper on Amazon...which I did for half the cost! While this product also has silicone as the first ingredient it contains three different oils and has a wonderful smell. Bonus...it leaves my long, straight hair feeling silky and smooth and definitely not heavy. It feels like it actually penetrates the hair and not just leave a coat of oil on it. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have dry hair (tips) because I swim like 4 times a week and the salt and chlor is awful for the hair... while I dry my hair I add some off the oil into the tips and finish drying. Awesome smell and makes hair shiny and like silk!!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff! It Keeps my hair smooth and silky all day! It Keeps my hair smelling great too!</li>
            <li> This argan oil works miracles- my hair remains smooth and manageable, even in Texas humidity! Mini bottles are convenient for traveling. My only frustration is that the large bottle of oil breaks incredibly easily. I&#x27;ve purchased a total of 5 bottles, which have all broken after a slight knock on my bathroom counter (salvaged the oil each time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product, but handle the bottle with care! May be good to have a spare container around to transfer the oil to if you&#x27;re looking for something more durable.</li>
            <li> This was originally recommended to me by my hairstylist, and although I was a little taken aback by the price, I tried it. It was definitely worth the purchase! I have thick, curly hair that tend to look like a mass. This separates th ehair and makes it shine. It even comes with smaller bottles that can be used for travel. The large bottle lasted over 3 months.</li>
            <li> I have tried Morrocan oil, Kpak Restorative oil and Orofluido. I have very thick, fine hair. It is chemically treated.  Morrocan never did anything for my hair other than make it smell funny. At first I thought Kpak didn&#x27;t work well either so I switched to Orofluido. Orofluido is amazing. It smoothes, softens, protects against heat, and it tames flyaways.  I hate to be without it. After using it for over a year I took a break and tried out the bottle of Kpak I still had.  I discovered that with the Kpak I had to use about three times as much than orofluido. It protected my hair from heat but that&#x27;s about it. It didn&#x27;t do much for softness or anything. I finished out that bottle and ordered new Orofluido. It&#x27;s my go-to hair product and I missed it!</li>
            <li> A salon in Italy sold me this Orofluido and I was worried I woudn&#x27;t find it in the US; this is the same stuff I purchased there - a little cheaper and came with free samples I now have shared with friends. This is the best hair product for after shampoo/conditioner I have ever used. Glad it is available here.</li>
            <li> This leaves a great look, scent and feel to my hair. Fly always? Frizz? Not after using this. Love this product!!!</li>
            <li> This product makes my long hair easy to manage and takes away the frizz.  I love the fragrance.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily looking, but shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a little over a year now...gives a natural shine without weighing my hair down and my hair doesn&#x27;t look greasy.  I am a black woman with thick, unrelaxed, colored hair and I use this product after I blow dry my hair but before I flat iron it.  I hate that i spent $40 in the salon for this product but love the fact that its here on amazon for half the cost!!!!  It lasts forever...like i said i have been using the oil for a little over a year and still have over a half of a bottom left. that&#x27;s because you only need a little bit on your hair and still have a natural, beautiful shine until the next shampoo!!! definitely a hair staple!!!</li>
            <li> Perfect solution for dry hair.  I just put a little on the ends of my hair.  The smell is fantastic!</li>
            <li> This is a nice finishing product on your hair supposedly to help ease frizz and boost shine.  It does that but the fragrance is very powerful and longlasting.  It was too much for my sinuses and ended up giving me a headache.</li>
            <li> Does a great job keeping frizz and flyaways at bay and it smells GREAT!  Also cuts my blowdrying time by about a third.  Love to use this in the hair instead of wearing perfume because it&#x27;s just enough scent without being overpowering.  Often people ask what perfume I&#x27;m wearing when all I used was the Orofluido!  The small glass bottles are perfect travel sizes / weekend sizes.  I refill them from the larger bottle to save space on the vanity.</li>
            <li> I love orofluido oil! I use it on my hair and skin. The weather in Minnesota in the winter is dry and harsh on my hair and skin. Using orofluido makes me feel fresh and replenished, and it smells awesome too. Anyone can use this product.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this at my hair salon and have been using it for some time now. The smell is soft, smells good. I didn&#x27;t notice any shine to my hair but i did notice it felt softer. As for frizz control, it helped, but so did a blow dry. I guess i&#x27;m just not convinced. I expected \\&quot;amazing\\&quot; results as others have raved about the product.</li>
            <li> I love the product, but I did not receive the Gift Set.  I received the individual bottle of Orofluido.  Thanks</li>
            <li> My hairstylist used this on my hair after cuts and I had to have it at home. I use it every morning before I leave the house &amp; it is fabulous. I have limp, straight hair in the very humid Florida climate. I sparingly rub it through my hair &amp; it actually makes it shine, shimmer &amp; glow, plus it smooths any flyaways. I would highly recommend this product. It lasts a LOOOONG time to because you only use a tiny amount daily. Also I LOVE the little sample jars it comes with so I can share it or simply refill the tiny jars to keep on the counter for daily use. So happy Amazon offers it!</li>
            <li> My hair gal turned me on to this with a little sample she was given at a hair convention.  I have been hooked on it ever since.  I have naturally curly hair, and use this product to add shine as well as moisturize.  I absolutely love the way it smells.....a combination of amber, vanilla, and some other things.  A soap-maker friend of mine gave me a hug one day and couldn&#x27;t believe how good I smell.  It was my hair!  Beauty Drawer was so great in answering my questions about the product, as well.  I really love this product</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this in one of those subscription boxes and never looked back. I have long, color-treated (but with a base of blonde), fine, stick-straight hair and get the greasies pretty easily, so I wasn&#x27;t sure how I&#x27;d do with hair oil. THIS STUFF IS AMAZING. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple years now while I&#x27;ve been growing my hair out. My ends never split, my hair is soft, soft, soft. I went to a new stylist and she couldn&#x27;t believe I color my hair because it was so healthy. I rub a nickel-sized amount into the ends after I wash before I blow dry. On really dry days I may add some after it&#x27;s dry to control my wispy bits. It smells wonderful (but isn&#x27;t overpowering). This particular kit is the best price I&#x27;ve found and it comes with 3 smaller vials which are perfect for travel or keeping in your purse to keep your hair superfly on the go. I&#x27;ve used a lot of the &amp;#34;frizz&amp;#34; reducing serums, and while those still come into play in my routine, they can sometimes make my hair greasy and don&#x27;t always absorb. This stuff NEVER does that. It&#x27;s basically perfect. No matter what kind of hair you have I think you&#x27;ll benefit from it.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Makes my hair feel soft, look healthy in the harsh dry winter.  Does not weight my hair down...which is very important as I have thin, fine hair.  The Item arrived within a few days of my order and was packaged great.</li>
            <li> Holy Hannah!  This stuff IS gold!  My hair stylist (at one of those super trendy high-end salons in LA) explained how to use this (or any product) like this:  pour a small amount into you hand and then rub it all over your hands like you&#x27;re putting on lotion, then start applying it to the middle of your damp strands down to the ends, and finally get up near the crown after most of the product is already onto your hair.  This way you don&#x27;t get one spot of tons of goop and bare spots in other places.  Then blow dry.  So I did all that at home and it seriously looked like I had just left the salon with a professional blow-out.  Until then, pretty much all products were the same for me.  Now when I want sleek and smooth hair (my hair is pretty straight naturally but I get beachy (but frizzy) waves if I don&#x27;t blow dry) for an important meeting or just to kind of feel unstoppable, I do use the Orofluido and it&#x27;s an instant confidence boost!</li>
            <li> Not greasy and a wonderful fragrance.  I wish they would sell this as a perfume!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, however this is NOT a gift set like the description says.  It does not have the three smaller bottles like the description says.  It has the large bottle and that&#x27;s it.  I ordered two of these and neither have the smaller bottles.  The smaller bottles are perfect if you travel so you aren&#x27;t packing a large glass bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is amazing on my frizzy curly thick hair and does not leave a greasy feeling either on my hands or in my hair.  It makes it shine, smooths it down.....and just simply amazing on my hair!!</li>
            <li> My older daughter recommend me to use this oil for hear.It is great sings and very healthy! I am sure that it is very helpfull.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many others including morrocanoil but this one is by far my favorite. It&#x27;s light, pleasantly scented and makes your hair feel like satin. What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> After moving to the desert, I was seriously considering cutting off my long hair because it was so frizzy and unattractive.  I tried a number of different shampoos and conditioners, with mixed results.  I got a free sample of this Orofluido hair oil, and was instantly in love.  I still use good shampoo and conditioner, but a small amount of this elixer makes all the difference.  My hair is shiny, soft, and lays flat.  Plus it smells amazing.  And a single bottle seems like it will last me at least three months - probably longer.  I travel a lot for work, so I went ahead and got the gift set, which also include three small bottles, which have been a blessing after long plane rides.</li>
            <li> Keeps your hair look great. After my shower I apply the oil and it stays thru out the day. Great product.</li>
            <li> I recently changed salons after my previous stylist just wasn&#x27;t doing a good job cutting and coloring my hair anymore. I was afraid to part with her because while I loved her as a person, I wasn&#x27;t in love with her hair cutting skills. When she got pregnant and moved to a new salon, that was too far for me, I decided to go on the hunt for someone new. I am happy to say that I found her and she is the one who introduced me to this product. Not only does she know how to cut my ton of naturally curly hair, she is a wealth of knowledge. She sold me this product and some new shampoo and conditioner and I will never change to something new. They are all fantastic products and I just love this elixir. Smells wonderful, leaves my hair so soft and shiny and really moisturizes my curls. And the best part is, it&#x27;s so lightweight! doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down. I am so happy!</li>
            <li> Orofluido may be the only product I swear by. I have long hair which tends to be thin, although I have a lot of it. Living in a dry climate for most of my life, I didn&#x27;t experience any problems with frizz, etc. Once a moved to a (slightly) more humid climate, every day was a bad hair day. I went through an assortment of products, and some helped enough to stabilize the frizz problem... but they were nothing magical. Then, maybe 2 years ago, a trip to a new hair stylist changed my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw my hair stylist pour a small amount of golden liquid into his palm, and massage it into my hair. While he didn&#x27;t offer to sell me any Orofluido, I was certain it was the secret ingredient to my hair feeling amazing after leaving the salon. I picked up a bottle off the internet and was amazed. I started getting compliments all the time (before I got none) about my hair. It was smooth, shiny, and looked and felt healthy. When I ran out of Orofluido and didn&#x27;t use it for a while, the compliments stopped. It is MAGIC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Orofluido after every shower. It does seem to work a little better if your hair isn&#x27;t sopping wet, so I&#x27;d recommend drying it off just a little bit first. You don&#x27;t need a lot to coat your hair. I put maybe a nickel-sized amount in my palm and work it through my hair; my hair goes nearly to my waist though. When I have shoulder-length hair I tend to use a dime-sized amount. If I take a shower at night, I still use Orofluido both after my shower and in the morning when my hair is dry. With dry hair, I dab a very, very small amount (I put my finger over the bottle, turn it upside down, and then take my finger off so there&#x27;s hardly any) and then dab my fingers over any flyaway strands. If you put too much in when your hair is dry, it can look a little oily, so use sparingly. I&#x27;ve found this to be an effective way to eliminate frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nice thing about Orofluido compared to other products is that it&#x27;s really light so your hair won&#x27;tfeel like it&#x27;s weighed down. The smell is also really nice and very subtle; it is a natural, soft smell and won&#x27;t make you smell like chemicals. The smell seems to fade away quickly. The gift set is great because it comes with a few travel sized bottles -- you won&#x27;t want to leave home without Orofluido! It has leaked on me during a trip though, so be careful to tighten the cap really well and use a couple Ziploc bags for protection.</li>
