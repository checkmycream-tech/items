            <li>but they sure did!</li>
            <li>nice to get out of a bra for a change and not dangle all over the place.</li>
            <li>The top part started sliding down,leaving a sticky residue from where they were placed.</li>
            <li>They were okay,  did give some lift</li>
            <li>Not too comfortable wearing it</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t work well if u are full breasted</li>
            <li>and surely they had fixed the problem, nope</li>
            <li>They just peeled right off.  </li>

            <li>Not sure if they are old or knockoffs but not as the original ones I bought before.</li>
            <li>When the seller was informed of this error they refunded me half the purchase price which was fine even if I would have preferred the other 2 packages.</li>

            <li> Such a waste.</li>

            <li> It does not fit properly and it looked odd on my chest.</li>
            <li> I have purchased these previously from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond</li>
            <li> but you can see the slight &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; difference...</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> They are a flimsy waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Amazon usually has standards.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lift not a push up :/</li>
            <li> These are thick stiff tape that does not stick to the skin at all.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!</li>
            <li> The other breast lifts were like surgical tape, very thin, flexible &amp; adhered to skin.</li>
            <li> but when I used them, the glue off the sticky part came right off on to my skin in the form of nasty gooey substance.</li>
            <li> I was really hopeing they would do the job their suppose too very disappointed, won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Not really sure am I just did it wrong?!</li>

            <li> If I could give 0 stars, I would.  I have purchased these previously from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and they worked great.  These are either a knock off or old.  I went through an entire box hoping one set would stick.  They just peeled right off.  Waste of money.  I will stick with  buying these locally.</li>
            <li> They work and I have DD. nice to get out of a bra for a change and not dangle all over the place.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!! I bought something that looked just like these before that worked, these do NOT work. The difference is what they are made of. The other breast lifts were like surgical tape, very thin, flexible &amp; adhered to skin. These are thick stiff tape that does not stick to the skin at all. Peels off as soon as applied. Such a waste.</li>
            <li> They are a flimsy waste of money. You might as well use scotch tape if you buy these. Amazon usually has standards. You failed me with these</li>
            <li> Delivery time was great. However, the product didn&#x27;t do what I expected it to do. I am a size 34D and I have had a breast lift done. I really just needed a little more lift when I wear my nubra.  I put them on after cleaning my skin; just to wear around the house without the nubra to see if they worked. The top part started sliding down,leaving a sticky residue from where they were placed. It&#x27;s a good thing that I did not go out with these on. Not to be worn alone if you are a size D cup.</li>
            <li> It was not what I expect. It does not work on my d cup chest. It does not fit properly and it looked odd on my chest.</li>
            <li> They not really sticky enough to do the work!! Not really sure am I just did it wrong?! If anyone can let me show the tips will be great!!!</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work well if u are full breasted</li>
            <li> They were okay,  did give some lift</li>
            <li> Works quite well, which I found surprising for my cup size. Its not perfect support, but it does lift them up so I can feel more relaxed.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. These are painful.</li>
            <li> Perhaps for a fuller figured girl, but on a 32B, the tape ends up folding and is unsightly under a regular weight blouse.</li>
            <li> boobs are just too big I guess didn&#x27;t work. I wear a 38 dd</li>
            <li> I am a size 32dd and I bought these to wear with a backless high neck halter dress. I thought in no way in hell these will hold my boobs up but they sure did! I definitely recommend buying these. They say they only work for breast sizes a-d but they work great for me :) Great product!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this barelifts were old or what but when I used them, the glue off the sticky part came right off on to my skin in the form of nasty gooey substance. Just gross. Not sure if they are old or knockoffs but not as the original ones I bought before.</li>
            <li> This is my second order of these because I really like wearing them especially in the summer, however the first order I only received 2 packages. When the seller was informed of this error they refunded me half the purchase price which was fine even if I would have preferred the other 2 packages. When I saw the were still selling 4 packages for the same price I thought I&#x27;d try again and surely they had fixed the problem, nope, 2 packages again. I won&#x27;t try again.</li>
            <li> They arrived very fast, but they didn&#x27;t work for me I&#x27;m a 36C went thru 4 pairs and couldn&#x27;t get them to lift up my breast I was really hopeing they would do the job their suppose too very disappointed, won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t stay longer... Not too comfortable wearing it coz i have to check it every now and then if it&#x27;s still in place...&#x27;</li>
            <li> Watch the videos before you try or your waste them and probably get frustrated... It doesn&#x27;t lift that much but you can see the slight &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; difference... Just keep your expectations low.. It&#x27;s a lift not a push up :/</li>
