    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>For me, this product performs as well as the Redken Rewind 06 (RR6) pomade that I used to like best, and it&#x27;s about one-quarter the price.  </li>
            <li>Perfect, doesn&#x27;t flake,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s to gely for my taste, but otherwise a excellent product</li>

            <li>smells good and no flaking.</li>

            <li>so I have a good hairdresser too</li>
            <li>Then I tousle it all over for a semi-unkempt look with lots of movement and a good amount of volume.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>So, I began to let my hair grow, and loved it, until this Summer.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li>A good product--don&#x27;t know why it was discontinued, but I&#x27;ve got my &amp;#34;stash&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It was a very good price, so I don&#x27;t mind adding stuff like this to my order to get it up to the amount I need for free shipping.</li>
            <li>Love it, works great.  </li>

            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>when I make a ponytail, I feel like I have more hair!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Great price - comparable products are easily 2-4x</li>
            <li>Great shipper, got it quick!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>This is light and has great hold</li>
            <li>Not as amazing as promise.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of in between.  </li>
            <li>Also does not have any kind of flakiness or residue about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent is nice and neutral, neither too manly or too girly.</li>
            <li>I will never fall into this kind deal again.  </li>
            <li>Best stuff ever nothing else works as good on short hair</li>
            <li>This doesn’t make your hair too shiny or greasy, and it is very easy to wash out at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t have a very strong hold and tends to leave flakes.</li>
            <li>love love this product!</li>
            <li>You get smooth, shiny, good smelling hair that stays where you styled it.</li>
            <li>Cheap and efficient, it has a good fragrance and works well.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, so I&#x27;ve been using this to give it some texture and body.</li>
            <li>Its not greasy at all, and the smell is mild but pleasant.</li>
            <li>very light</li>
            <li>Great hair product, it had pretty decent hold and smelled great.</li>
            <li>This product is ok.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I like a paste consistency more to get the &amp;#34;chunky&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;piecy&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Love love love this stuff</li>
            <li>After using many different types of wax in my hair, I found this amount of hold to be perfect.</li>
            <li>Better off with a fiber paste like Got2Be</li>
            <li>I love L&#x27;Oreal Paris Studio Line Out of Bed Texturizer.  </li>
            <li>I love the product but might return it because of the lack of safety seal.</li>
            <li>For short styles it really is perfect.  </li>
            <li>I have found that by continuing to work it through the hair eliminates more of the stickiness.  </li>
            <li>If I want something more styled, I apply this then apply a wax or pomade to the ends and flip them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Light fragrance that fades quickly - perfect if you&#x27;re sensitive to scents&lt;</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>When I opened it, I found a hair on the top of the product.</li>
            <li>I love it!my hair looks healthy,</li>
            <li>I love the out of bed</li>
            <li>I love this product and cannot find anything else like it on the market.  </li>
            <li>I love the feel of this on my hands...</li>
            <li>Love this stuff and love the price.</li>
            <li>love Amazon, and began searching for a texturizing paste, to see if it would work.</li>
            <li>I just ordered 2 more jars of it...</li>
            <li>there are better product out there.</li>
            <li>Sure you get more compare to others</li>
            <li>I love it.it</li>
            <li>It keeps your hair looking great the whole day through and does not flake unless you put your hands through it.</li>
            <li>couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere, so I bought more off</li>
            <li>Stores near me stopped carrying this, so I am happy to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Sticky, but it has a nice fresh smell on your hair.</li>
            <li>There are a lot of products on the market, but you really can&#x27;t beat the price of this product and you get a fair amount of product for your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>As a gel it does a great job--not greasy, not heavy, and very good for sculpturing your hair to fit your individual needs.</li>
            <li>* Easy to wash out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not sticky and it&#x27;s easy to wash off of my hands.  </li>
            <li>STRONG FOR ME.&lt;br /&gt;ON</li>
            <li>spread evenly everywhere making sure to pay special attention to bangs etc.  </li>
            <li>This is the first texture product I have really liked.</li>
            <li>I am a first time user of a hair texturizer of any kind.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this product helps to keep it looking controlled and in place.</li>
            <li>Thank you Amazon for making this available when no one else did.  </li>
            <li>Great for managing short hair.</li>
            <li>You can tell its cheap because you have to put quite a bit in order to get your hair how you want it.</li>
            <li>I brought two cans for a cheap price $10.99 and it stink</li>
            <li>is light on my hair.  </li>
            <li>My favorite gel I love it so much I buy it all the time it makes my curls curlier</li>
            <li>This one is also the perfect amount of stiffness/hold - not too stiff, not too light.</li>
            <li>This product gives excellent hold but doesn&#x27;t feel stiff.</li>
            <li>It is good for having &amp;#34;touchable&amp;#34; hair that goes back into place easily.  </li>
            <li>I loved the product so much I bought a large batch.</li>
            <li>it won&#x27;t get old because it seems so many products I love are discontinued.</li>
            <li>but this product makes your hair soft and swirls and men love it :)</li>
            <li>I have to scrub with soap to get my hands clean after using it.  </li>
            <li>Excellent hard to find product.</li>
            <li>In need of a styling product after just having cut my hair short again, I bought this based on the good reviews.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no lasting smell which is a good thing.  </li>
            <li>but glad Amazon had it in stock and ready to go.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t quite get the piece-y, very textured look with it, but that could be because my hair is just so fine and smooth.</li>
            <li>The only thing that irrates me is that I used to be able to buy it at Walmart or Walgreens and nobody carries it any more</li>
            <li>It smelled nice, but left my fingers sticky, and made my hair look like I had used a cheap hair gel to style it.</li>
            <li>story short, I found this on Amazon (at the regular great price of about $4 each!)</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something that is super tacky or that will mold your hair and keep it in place, this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li>and/or hair quickly dries into ... nothing.</li>
            <li>Delightful scent, easy manageability, and you can use it on damp or dry hair, every single day.</li>
            <li>It gives me great definition and tames frizz under a harder holding gel on first day hair.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t fuss over my hair much, but I like how easy it is to touch up with damp hands in the bathroom if something looks out of place.  </li>
            <li>I change my hair style depending on weather conditions and this stuff is the best for my long hair look and my short spikey hair look.</li>
            <li>the first use of the Out of Bed, I was hooked!</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this gives me good control without being stiff or sticky so it&#x27;s been my go to product.  </li>
            <li>This is like rubbing fresh tapioca in your hair.</li>
            <li>I have used many L&#x27;Oreal product - this one didn&#x27;t work for me and the way that I style my hair - it seems like it really more for the wet look.</li>
            <li>(3) more natural look-</li>
            <li>It keeps my naturally curly hair more textured than frizzy looking.</li>
            <li>This product provides good hold with minimal stickiness and/or oils, which can &amp;#34;weigh hair down&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal Gel has a distinct fragrance when you use it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Great product especially for those of us with baby-fine hair that cannot take the weight of most gel/mousse products - it&#x27;s worth the price !</li>
            <li>I love it because it goes on great when hair is wet or dry.</li>
            <li>:  some very large CVS stores may still carry t his.  </li>
            <li>After having mid-back hair for most of my life, I cut my hair into a super short pixie.</li>
            <li>probably good for a jersey shore due ;)</li>
            <li>But these are but minor drawbacks to an effective product.</li>
            <li>This works well for very short hair and very light weight hair.</li>
            <li>I like it much better than Gatsby wax and will continue to use it in the future.</li>
            <li>The hold seems to last most of the day&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I love this texturizer &amp; can&#x27;t find it locally anymore.  </li>
            <li>(I should read more carefully next time)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was really does an &amp;#34;out of bed&amp;#34; look to your hair!</li>
            <li>really like it!</li>
            <li>This stuff is so inexpensive, and for me, it&#x27;s really a winner!</li>
            <li>, finger comb a good amount of this texturizing gel thru my hair, then comb it down straight.  </li>
            <li>It has good hold but isn&#x27;t sticky or stiff.</li>
            <li>Great product for short wet styles.</li>
            <li>Not sticky - hair looks clean and naturally styled but maintains its shape&lt;</li>
            <li>But good enough, and a regular texturizer.</li>
            <li>It gives a nice flexible, slightly wild hold on my relatively short guy hair.  </li>
            <li>It washes out very easily, though, so it&#x27;s not for days when your hair would get wet.</li>
            <li>This product works really well at a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>When my hair is shorter, it holds up better but still no all that long.</li>
            <li>I love this as a putty replacement and use it either for the “messy” look or the “clean combed” look.</li>
            <li>none of the extra &amp;#34;gloss&amp;#34; and (4) easy to re-style hair- just rub in some water to you hair and you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;Works for my hair, but may not work for everyone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also rather dry, for lack of a better description, so</li>
            <li>If you’re looking to spike your hair, the hold for this probably won’t be strong enough.</li>
            <li>* (relatively) large container size&lt;br</li>
            <li>would just write &amp;#34;awful&amp;#34; but Amazon insists that I write a certain minimum number of words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It sounds crazy, but I like to have my hair easy to look great in the morning.</li>
            <li>(I have short, fine hair.)</li>
            <li>This has a very high rating on Amazon and that is why I ordered it.</li>
            <li>texturizer gives my fine hair much needed volume without looking over done, coarse, or fussy.</li>
            <li>the ends a little then put this on my hands and pull at the ends for the messy wispy look and it does the job perfectly!</li>
            <li>I subscribe for one tub every three months, and don&#x27;t quite use that much.</li>
            <li>However, you did not need as much paste.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have much of a fragrance, and I like that too.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like it that much.</li>
            <li>it can give you and it holds really well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Every time I order from Amazon and need to add to my purchase, I order these to get enough for free shipping.  </li>
            <li>I really like the fact that I do not need to use this every day.  </li>
            <li>I do not like this quite as much as Fructis Pixie Play.</li>
            <li>Since the time I actually started caring about how I looked, I&#x27;ve had to use some kind of hair product or keep my hair so short that it doesn&#x27;t matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good hold and stays in control of my thick hair all day.</li>
            <li>best thing is, my hair remains soft and manageable at all times, and the color is still true, which is difficult with red hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have found other products that will still hold my hair in place, and I am still able to run my fingers through my hair -- not so with this product.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t make my hair curl up like most other gels do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, texturized effects are also great -- I avoid running a brush through it, usually just using my hands/fingers and/or couple runs with fat-tooth comb (I use giant rollers for shoulder length hair after washing).  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair feeling clean when it&#x27;s brushed through, not gummed up like others.</li>
            <li>My hair being very fine doesn&#x27;t do well with heavy texture products.  </li>
            <li>So, price wise, this product is only a little cheaper than the Bed Head</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t live without it!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s less sticky than other texturizers and smells great too.</li>
            <li>When I put it in my hair it left my hair with that super crunchy feeling you get with gel or hairspray.</li>
            <li>This product does a decent job at texturizing.</li>
            <li>I would have expected that from a product that advertises a strong hold, but this one said it had a flexible hold.</li>
            <li>This product is becoming increasingly hard to find; Amazon is the only place I have been able to find it lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone .</li>
            <li>Highly recommend if you want manageability</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for something a little bit more gooey.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products to give my hair a little hold.</li>
            <li>and I need something with a little more control (the &amp;#34;more control&amp;#34; product does leave a bit of a film).</li>
            <li>It even has a little more hold than the label implies.</li>
            <li>Love this product for my little boys hair.</li>
            <li>It’s very pliable, though the hold is a medium level (not super strong if that’s what you’re looking for).</li>
            <li>not thick creamy like i was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use in my sons hair for a cute messy look, and in mine and my daughters hair to give definition.</li>
            <li>Hard to find a gel that goes on great when hair is dry.</li>
            <li>This hair product is just right for my short hair and keeps my waves and curls under control.</li>
            <li>happy to find a cheap replacement for Paul Mitchell, Jonathan, Sebastian etc, products I regularly use, sad to see it fall short.</li>
            <li>Some other products I&#x27;ve tried work well in terms of giving a light hold and providing a silky feel, but the tradeoff for me is always &amp;#34;flat head&amp;#34; and a lack of texture.</li>
            <li>Not a bad hair control product - just a little runny - and kinda has a shin to it at first but wears off during the day</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this goo if you aren&#x27;t trying to glue your hair into spikes and just want natural looking hair.</li>
            <li>Once dry I run my fingers through my hair and the end result is that my hair is super soft, casually in place, and looks really good, for the whole rest of the day.</li>
            <li>Exact same product as in the store.  </li>
            <li>Hair care is pretty individual.  </li>
            <li>, IT KEEPS MY HAIR PRETTY MOIST THE ENTIRE DAY!!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although, this product is not as firm as the other, it does do a good job.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin look at Crew or a similar higher end product.</li>
            <li>Gives it a natural cute messy look!</li>
            <li>Light and not sticky with a very subtle clean scent.</li>
            <li>This is the only product I use when I want to style my hair certain ways etc.  </li>
            <li>I initially bought this at a large retailer but for some reason the store stopped carrying it.  </li>
            <li>It just helps it keep a natural looking form (like not sticking out to the side or plastered to the side of your head).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I like how it provides some hold and shine in a soft way; however, there is gunky build up, so</li>
            <li>I have just enough and not too much.</li>
            <li>and I have a perm and everyone thinks it is natural</li>
            <li>This completely eradicates all the undesired curl in my hair.  </li>
            <li>prefer a wax or cream product that is lighter and lets you style your hair while still keeping a natural, soft look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And, even though I&#x27;m an old lady, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I only use a dime size amount, so it cant be that I&#x27;m using to much.</li>
            <li>This is the pirfict soft hold that i&#x27;m looking for.  </li>
            <li>It holds your hair and can be brushed out the next day and your hair is just as fresh as the day before.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t give a wet shiny look, but it holds nice and firm without giving the tacky appearance.</li>
            <li>It smells really nice, it adds volume and holds my style without being stiff, sticky or wet looking, even when I apply it to damp hair.  </li>
            <li>I had tried other hair products (at a much higher price!)</li>
            <li>Easy to use - apply while wet or dry and style&lt;</li>
            <li>The hold is not super strong (which I personally don&#x27;t mind)</li>
            <li>I typically apply it to the roots and smooth it to the ends while my hair is wet, then blow dry using a wide round brush for great lift that is still touchable and soft.</li>
            <li>The last time I ordered this particular product, I ordered two of them.</li>
            <li>and my hair looks decent enough to venture out of the house without washing.</li>
            <li>I first bought this over a year ago when I had a short hair cut since it was recommended at the time by the hair stylist, but for some reason never bothered to even open the jar.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>BUT YOU ALSO NEED TO USE MORE to get half the result of other products.</li>
            <li>blow dry my hair straight</li>
            <li>hair texture is medium/coarse, very wavy and extremely</li>
            <li>I let my hair to air dry after shower ( which gives it a natural wave) , then I apply this l!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I have a close friend, who also has long natural curls.</li>
            <li>1 for my friend with the long, natural curls, and 1 for myself.</li>
            <li>Then I blow dry the straight gelled hair till its dry.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that is difficult to style.  </li>
            <li>It looks dry and and doesn&#x27;t give you that wet looking hair if you apply a lot.&lt;br /&gt;Gel stays for the whole day.</li>
            <li>only criticism is that it leaves a dull finish -- to get sheen, I spray lightly with a silicone spray once I have my hair in rollers and let dry as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The hold is perfect...not too much hold, not too little.  </li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> For me, this product performs as well as the Redken Rewind 06 (RR6) pomade that I used to like best, and it&#x27;s about one-quarter the price.  </li>

            <li> smells good and no flaking.</li>

            <li> so I have a good hairdresser too</li>
            <li> Then I tousle it all over for a semi-unkempt look with lots of movement and a good amount of volume.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> So, I began to let my hair grow, and loved it, until this Summer.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> A good product--don&#x27;t know why it was discontinued, but I&#x27;ve got my &amp;#34;stash&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It was a very good price, so I don&#x27;t mind adding stuff like this to my order to get it up to the amount I need for free shipping.</li>

            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> when I make a ponytail, I feel like I have more hair!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>

            <li> Great shipper, got it quick!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> This is light and has great hold</li>
            <li> Not as amazing as promise.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of in between.  </li>
            <li> Also does not have any kind of flakiness or residue about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent is nice and neutral, neither too manly or too girly.</li>
            <li> I will never fall into this kind deal again.  </li>
            <li> Best stuff ever nothing else works as good on short hair</li>
            <li> This doesn’t make your hair too shiny or greasy, and it is very easy to wash out at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t have a very strong hold and tends to leave flakes.</li>
            <li> love love this product!</li>
            <li> You get smooth, shiny, good smelling hair that stays where you styled it.</li>
            <li> Cheap and efficient, it has a good fragrance and works well.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, so I&#x27;ve been using this to give it some texture and body.</li>
            <li> Its not greasy at all, and the smell is mild but pleasant.</li>
            <li> very light</li>
            <li> Great hair product, it had pretty decent hold and smelled great.</li>
            <li> This product is ok.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I like a paste consistency more to get the &amp;#34;chunky&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;piecy&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Love love love this stuff</li>
            <li> After using many different types of wax in my hair, I found this amount of hold to be perfect.</li>
            <li> Better off with a fiber paste like Got2Be</li>
            <li> I love L&#x27;Oreal Paris Studio Line Out of Bed Texturizer.  </li>
            <li> I love the product but might return it because of the lack of safety seal.</li>
            <li> For short styles it really is perfect.  </li>
            <li> I have found that by continuing to work it through the hair eliminates more of the stickiness.  </li>
            <li> If I want something more styled, I apply this then apply a wax or pomade to the ends and flip them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Light fragrance that fades quickly - perfect if you&#x27;re sensitive to scents&lt;</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> When I opened it, I found a hair on the top of the product.</li>
            <li> I love it!my hair looks healthy,</li>
            <li> I love the out of bed</li>
            <li> I love this product and cannot find anything else like it on the market.  </li>
            <li> I love the feel of this on my hands...</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and love the price.</li>
            <li> love Amazon, and began searching for a texturizing paste, to see if it would work.</li>
            <li> I just ordered 2 more jars of it...</li>
            <li> there are better product out there.</li>
            <li> Sure you get more compare to others</li>
            <li> I love it.it</li>
            <li> It keeps your hair looking great the whole day through and does not flake unless you put your hands through it.</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere, so I bought more off</li>
            <li> Stores near me stopped carrying this, so I am happy to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Sticky, but it has a nice fresh smell on your hair.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of products on the market, but you really can&#x27;t beat the price of this product and you get a fair amount of product for your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> As a gel it does a great job--not greasy, not heavy, and very good for sculpturing your hair to fit your individual needs.</li>
            <li> * Easy to wash out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not sticky and it&#x27;s easy to wash off of my hands.  </li>
            <li> STRONG FOR ME.&lt;br /&gt;ON</li>
            <li> spread evenly everywhere making sure to pay special attention to bangs etc.  </li>
            <li> This is the first texture product I have really liked.</li>
            <li> I am a first time user of a hair texturizer of any kind.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this product helps to keep it looking controlled and in place.</li>
            <li> Thank you Amazon for making this available when no one else did.  </li>
            <li> Great for managing short hair.</li>
            <li> You can tell its cheap because you have to put quite a bit in order to get your hair how you want it.</li>
            <li> I brought two cans for a cheap price $10.99 and it stink</li>
            <li> is light on my hair.  </li>
            <li> My favorite gel I love it so much I buy it all the time it makes my curls curlier</li>
            <li> This one is also the perfect amount of stiffness/hold - not too stiff, not too light.</li>
            <li> This product gives excellent hold but doesn&#x27;t feel stiff.</li>
            <li> It is good for having &amp;#34;touchable&amp;#34; hair that goes back into place easily.  </li>
            <li> I loved the product so much I bought a large batch.</li>
            <li> it won&#x27;t get old because it seems so many products I love are discontinued.</li>
            <li> but this product makes your hair soft and swirls and men love it :)</li>
            <li> I have to scrub with soap to get my hands clean after using it.  </li>
            <li> Excellent hard to find product.</li>
            <li> In need of a styling product after just having cut my hair short again, I bought this based on the good reviews.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no lasting smell which is a good thing.  </li>
            <li> but glad Amazon had it in stock and ready to go.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t quite get the piece-y, very textured look with it, but that could be because my hair is just so fine and smooth.</li>
            <li> The only thing that irrates me is that I used to be able to buy it at Walmart or Walgreens and nobody carries it any more</li>
            <li> It smelled nice, but left my fingers sticky, and made my hair look like I had used a cheap hair gel to style it.</li>
            <li> story short, I found this on Amazon (at the regular great price of about $4 each!)</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something that is super tacky or that will mold your hair and keep it in place, this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li> and/or hair quickly dries into ... nothing.</li>
            <li> Delightful scent, easy manageability, and you can use it on damp or dry hair, every single day.</li>
            <li> It gives me great definition and tames frizz under a harder holding gel on first day hair.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t fuss over my hair much, but I like how easy it is to touch up with damp hands in the bathroom if something looks out of place.  </li>
            <li> I change my hair style depending on weather conditions and this stuff is the best for my long hair look and my short spikey hair look.</li>
            <li> the first use of the Out of Bed, I was hooked!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this gives me good control without being stiff or sticky so it&#x27;s been my go to product.  </li>
            <li> This is like rubbing fresh tapioca in your hair.</li>
            <li> I have used many L&#x27;Oreal product - this one didn&#x27;t work for me and the way that I style my hair - it seems like it really more for the wet look.</li>
            <li> (3) more natural look-</li>
            <li> It keeps my naturally curly hair more textured than frizzy looking.</li>
            <li> This product provides good hold with minimal stickiness and/or oils, which can &amp;#34;weigh hair down&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Gel has a distinct fragrance when you use it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Great product especially for those of us with baby-fine hair that cannot take the weight of most gel/mousse products - it&#x27;s worth the price !</li>
            <li> I love it because it goes on great when hair is wet or dry.</li>
            <li> :  some very large CVS stores may still carry t his.  </li>
            <li> After having mid-back hair for most of my life, I cut my hair into a super short pixie.</li>
            <li> probably good for a jersey shore due ;)</li>
            <li> But these are but minor drawbacks to an effective product.</li>
            <li> This works well for very short hair and very light weight hair.</li>
            <li> I like it much better than Gatsby wax and will continue to use it in the future.</li>
            <li> The hold seems to last most of the day&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I love this texturizer &amp; can&#x27;t find it locally anymore.  </li>
            <li> (I should read more carefully next time)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was really does an &amp;#34;out of bed&amp;#34; look to your hair!</li>
            <li> really like it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is so inexpensive, and for me, it&#x27;s really a winner!</li>
            <li> , finger comb a good amount of this texturizing gel thru my hair, then comb it down straight.  </li>
            <li> It has good hold but isn&#x27;t sticky or stiff.</li>
            <li> Great product for short wet styles.</li>
            <li> Not sticky - hair looks clean and naturally styled but maintains its shape&lt;</li>
            <li> But good enough, and a regular texturizer.</li>
            <li> It gives a nice flexible, slightly wild hold on my relatively short guy hair.  </li>
            <li> It washes out very easily, though, so it&#x27;s not for days when your hair would get wet.</li>
            <li> This product works really well at a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> When my hair is shorter, it holds up better but still no all that long.</li>
            <li> I love this as a putty replacement and use it either for the “messy” look or the “clean combed” look.</li>
            <li> none of the extra &amp;#34;gloss&amp;#34; and (4) easy to re-style hair- just rub in some water to you hair and you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;Works for my hair, but may not work for everyone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also rather dry, for lack of a better description, so</li>
            <li> If you’re looking to spike your hair, the hold for this probably won’t be strong enough.</li>
            <li> * (relatively) large container size&lt;br</li>
            <li> would just write &amp;#34;awful&amp;#34; but Amazon insists that I write a certain minimum number of words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It sounds crazy, but I like to have my hair easy to look great in the morning.</li>
            <li> (I have short, fine hair.)</li>
            <li> This has a very high rating on Amazon and that is why I ordered it.</li>
            <li> texturizer gives my fine hair much needed volume without looking over done, coarse, or fussy.</li>
            <li> the ends a little then put this on my hands and pull at the ends for the messy wispy look and it does the job perfectly!</li>
            <li> I subscribe for one tub every three months, and don&#x27;t quite use that much.</li>
            <li> However, you did not need as much paste.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have much of a fragrance, and I like that too.  </li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it that much.</li>
            <li> it can give you and it holds really well.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Every time I order from Amazon and need to add to my purchase, I order these to get enough for free shipping.  </li>
            <li> I really like the fact that I do not need to use this every day.  </li>
            <li> I do not like this quite as much as Fructis Pixie Play.</li>
            <li> Since the time I actually started caring about how I looked, I&#x27;ve had to use some kind of hair product or keep my hair so short that it doesn&#x27;t matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good hold and stays in control of my thick hair all day.</li>
            <li> best thing is, my hair remains soft and manageable at all times, and the color is still true, which is difficult with red hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have found other products that will still hold my hair in place, and I am still able to run my fingers through my hair -- not so with this product.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t make my hair curl up like most other gels do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , texturized effects are also great -- I avoid running a brush through it, usually just using my hands/fingers and/or couple runs with fat-tooth comb (I use giant rollers for shoulder length hair after washing).  </li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling clean when it&#x27;s brushed through, not gummed up like others.</li>
            <li> My hair being very fine doesn&#x27;t do well with heavy texture products.  </li>
            <li> So, price wise, this product is only a little cheaper than the Bed Head</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t live without it!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less sticky than other texturizers and smells great too.</li>
            <li> When I put it in my hair it left my hair with that super crunchy feeling you get with gel or hairspray.</li>
            <li> This product does a decent job at texturizing.</li>
            <li> I would have expected that from a product that advertises a strong hold, but this one said it had a flexible hold.</li>
            <li> This product is becoming increasingly hard to find; Amazon is the only place I have been able to find it lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone .</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you want manageability</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for something a little bit more gooey.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products to give my hair a little hold.</li>
            <li> and I need something with a little more control (the &amp;#34;more control&amp;#34; product does leave a bit of a film).</li>
            <li> It even has a little more hold than the label implies.</li>
            <li> Love this product for my little boys hair.</li>
            <li> It’s very pliable, though the hold is a medium level (not super strong if that’s what you’re looking for).</li>
            <li> not thick creamy like i was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use in my sons hair for a cute messy look, and in mine and my daughters hair to give definition.</li>
            <li> Hard to find a gel that goes on great when hair is dry.</li>
            <li> This hair product is just right for my short hair and keeps my waves and curls under control.</li>
            <li> happy to find a cheap replacement for Paul Mitchell, Jonathan, Sebastian etc, products I regularly use, sad to see it fall short.</li>
            <li> Some other products I&#x27;ve tried work well in terms of giving a light hold and providing a silky feel, but the tradeoff for me is always &amp;#34;flat head&amp;#34; and a lack of texture.</li>
            <li> Not a bad hair control product - just a little runny - and kinda has a shin to it at first but wears off during the day</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this goo if you aren&#x27;t trying to glue your hair into spikes and just want natural looking hair.</li>
            <li> Once dry I run my fingers through my hair and the end result is that my hair is super soft, casually in place, and looks really good, for the whole rest of the day.</li>
            <li> Exact same product as in the store.  </li>
            <li> Hair care is pretty individual.  </li>
            <li> , IT KEEPS MY HAIR PRETTY MOIST THE ENTIRE DAY!!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although, this product is not as firm as the other, it does do a good job.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin look at Crew or a similar higher end product.</li>
            <li> Gives it a natural cute messy look!</li>
            <li> Light and not sticky with a very subtle clean scent.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I use when I want to style my hair certain ways etc.  </li>
            <li> I initially bought this at a large retailer but for some reason the store stopped carrying it.  </li>
            <li> It just helps it keep a natural looking form (like not sticking out to the side or plastered to the side of your head).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I like how it provides some hold and shine in a soft way; however, there is gunky build up, so</li>
            <li> I have just enough and not too much.</li>
            <li> and I have a perm and everyone thinks it is natural</li>
            <li> This completely eradicates all the undesired curl in my hair.  </li>
            <li> prefer a wax or cream product that is lighter and lets you style your hair while still keeping a natural, soft look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And, even though I&#x27;m an old lady, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I only use a dime size amount, so it cant be that I&#x27;m using to much.</li>
            <li> This is the pirfict soft hold that i&#x27;m looking for.  </li>
            <li> It holds your hair and can be brushed out the next day and your hair is just as fresh as the day before.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t give a wet shiny look, but it holds nice and firm without giving the tacky appearance.</li>
            <li> It smells really nice, it adds volume and holds my style without being stiff, sticky or wet looking, even when I apply it to damp hair.  </li>
            <li> I had tried other hair products (at a much higher price!)</li>
            <li> Easy to use - apply while wet or dry and style&lt;</li>
            <li> The hold is not super strong (which I personally don&#x27;t mind)</li>
            <li> I typically apply it to the roots and smooth it to the ends while my hair is wet, then blow dry using a wide round brush for great lift that is still touchable and soft.</li>
            <li> The last time I ordered this particular product, I ordered two of them.</li>
            <li> and my hair looks decent enough to venture out of the house without washing.</li>
            <li> I first bought this over a year ago when I had a short hair cut since it was recommended at the time by the hair stylist, but for some reason never bothered to even open the jar.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> BUT YOU ALSO NEED TO USE MORE to get half the result of other products.</li>
            <li> blow dry my hair straight</li>
            <li> hair texture is medium/coarse, very wavy and extremely</li>
            <li> I let my hair to air dry after shower ( which gives it a natural wave) , then I apply this l!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I have a close friend, who also has long natural curls.</li>
            <li> 1 for my friend with the long, natural curls, and 1 for myself.</li>
            <li> Then I blow dry the straight gelled hair till its dry.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that is difficult to style.  </li>
            <li> It looks dry and and doesn&#x27;t give you that wet looking hair if you apply a lot.&lt;br /&gt;Gel stays for the whole day.</li>
            <li> only criticism is that it leaves a dull finish -- to get sheen, I spray lightly with a silicone spray once I have my hair in rollers and let dry as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The hold is perfect...not too much hold, not too little.  </li>
            <li> hair does not fall flat throughout the day, it actually held a style with this stuff.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is a bit &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; when first using and stays that way.  </li>
            <li> Using a small amount, about half a teaspoon for my ~2-inch long hair, it is easily distributed and leaves a dry styled look.  </li>
            <li> So, I have been cursed for as long as I can remember with a rooster tail on the back of my head.  </li>
            <li> and I flat iron</li>
            <li> I am 65 years old, a natural redhead, and tired of a lifetime of uncontrollable natural curls.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I tried a few new products and just proved to myself, sometimes you just gotta stick with what works.</li>
            <li> So I rubbed a tiny pea sized amount into my roots, finger combed it through then took a wide tooth comb and brushed it through the length of my hair.</li>
            <li> - you can end up with extremely shiny (blindingly shiny) patches if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> (1) doesn&#x27;t make your hear stiff like hair gel, (2) isn&#x27;t sticky and doesn&#x27;t run down your face when it&#x27;s hot,</li>
            <li> Everything else was great, what I wanted to buy, but I was little bit disappointed by the hair.</li>
            <li> On second day hair I wet my hands and add a bit of this and scrunch through hair for a wavy look.  </li>
            <li> You get what you pay for and this was a complete waste of money....</li>
            <li> A bit too liquidy, somewhat sticky but not thick enough to texturizing my thick hair-</li>
            <li> It holds my short hair back and if its wet ...when its dry I can just run a wet brush thru it</li>
            <li> IM A BLACK MALE WITH LOW CUT HAIR AND THIS TEXTURIZER ISN&#x27;T</li>
            <li> Has a very different texture depending on whether you use it on wet or dry hair, so be forewarned</li>
            <li> I researched different products to see if I could find something comparable to the other product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While the price of other hair putties are skyrocketing (and container sizes are shrinking), this is a relative bargain for the container size you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pretty weak stuff</li>
            <li> My hair varies from quite wavy/curly on humid days to kind of limp and flat on dry days, and my hair is neither thin nor thick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy this product again because it has a hold yet isn&#x27;t a high strength to make my hair feel hard.</li>
            <li> Can use on damp or dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I can blow dry my hair with this product in and it does not flake.  </li>
            <li> I can run my hand through my hair during the day and my hands remain dry, not sticky or greasy like the axe products.</li>
            <li> I use this product regularly on dry hair after styling.  </li>
            <li> Once your hair is dry you just run your fingers through it!</li>
            <li> Put this in your wet hair, comb through, let hair dry, and comb through (or don&#x27;t).</li>
            <li> I had used the other product for a long time.</li>
            <li> For finer, flat, and asian hair this product gives a little bit of volume and texture while having a slight hold.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so painful that you are better off just washing it out.</li>
            <li> In comparison, my hair had to be wet in order to get the paste distributed evenly.  </li>
            <li> This is the only creme texture that works in my heavy hair and it has no smell.</li>
            <li> Just as expected.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair sticky and with a wet look I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> I like the semi wet look</li>
            <li> the texture of the product is a bit gooey, but works well to keep my part held with minimal hardening feel like gel.</li>
            <li> I use it on my curly hair when it&#x27;s wet, to help hold the shape of the curls.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s thinner than it used to be, flat, limp and never has any volume.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that it  takes out the shine from my hair, but I&#x27;d imagine some shine/gloss spray can remedy this minor issue.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t flake and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> This product was the closest thing to the other one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would not rely on this for any hair style that requires spiking or anything extreme.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t harden up and stick to the hair that other gels can irritate you with.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my hair shine like all the other Gael&#x27;s and pastes.</li>
            <li> other day I remembered I had this stuff</li>
            <li> My hair is heavy and when I tried it as it grew it didn&#x27;t hold up long.</li>
            <li> Your hair also doesn&#x27;t have to be very wet to get this stuff to blend in.  </li>
            <li> Now I expected my hair to be limp and greasy looking, like every other product usually leaves my hair, but NO, my hair had body and actually MOVED.</li>
            <li> Only downside it is hard to find it anywhere but through here.</li>
            <li> This product does the job, but it makes my hair extremely hard and crusty that I have simply given up on this product.</li>
            <li> I have short thick curly hair</li>
            <li> Some days all I need to do is dampen my fingers, tilt my head down and rub all over my hair.  </li>
            <li> It is not waxy, so it doesn&#x27;t pull your hair down an hour after you&#x27;ve styled it.  </li>
            <li> too water down,</li>
            <li> It is slicker on the palm and less sticky than RR6, with consistency that feels sort of like Miracle Whip but does not make my hair look or feel oily.  </li>
            <li> I had been using gel in my thick, short, layered hair for years to get a messy look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years, unfortunately the local supermarket doesn&#x27;t seem to stock this anymore-</li>
            <li> than gel (less hard/shiny/stiff) and not waxy or slippery.  </li>
            <li> I just wish it looked and felt less like semen.  </li>
            <li> I highly believe this one is fake.  </li>
            <li> Instead of putting it into my hair in random places straight from the container, to make a ruffled look, I mix a small amount in my hand with a handful of water and then spread it evenly across all of my hair.</li>
            <li> little greasy feeling and doesn&#x27;t give a matte</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I wanted just a little straighter in my hair and it worked like a dream.</li>
            <li> that my hair is grown out (a little over shoulder length)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried plenty of body, volume, texturizing products to give my baby-fine, limp hair some oomph.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday for styling and holding my hair.  </li>
            <li> This will leave your hair separated in shiny chunks with a firm finish.</li>
            <li> my hair, allows it to move without getting messy and does not leave a film, something I dislike about a lot of heavier products.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m missing something, but this texture cream is like a jar of hair conditioner: a dab rubbed into your palm</li>
            <li> Waste of money....</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li> It never &#x27;goops up&#x27;, never makes your hair gooey or stiff, and you can put a comb or brush through it afterward, with no tangles.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wear a spikey hair cut and this holds the spikes in place without feeling sticky, gummy, or too stiff.  </li>
            <li> My hair did not feel stiff or sticky either because this texturizer is so lightweight.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only negative thing I would say is that, my package came broken on the bottom</li>
            <li> no more frizz</li>
            <li> I was skeptical initially and that&#x27;s why I just bought one bottle (just in case)</li>
            <li> This product was purchased as a replacement for the usual, Rusk.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after an hour of (slow) daily biking, my hair returns to its pre-product state.</li>
            <li> everything has just weighed my hair down and made it look worse or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> A little weak, and gets a tad crispy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Hard to find locally&lt;</li>
            <li> Hard to find does the job</li>
            <li> Holds your style with out being hard or &amp;#34;gelled&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> you can hardly tell it&#x27;s in your hair.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it&#x27;s really hard to wash off your hands too.  </li>
            <li> I like the texture that it gives my hair but the consistency is a little too thin and sticky.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it - it&#x27;s just darn hard for us curly girls to look neat and shiny when it is muggy and frizzy outside.  </li>
            <li> does not separate the hair well (at least for me)</li>
            <li> I began thinking of cutting it short, once again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> IF IT WAS AT LEAST 4/5 STRENGTH ID RATE</li>
            <li> I have curly thick medium hair, and I ride a bike to work with a helmet.</li>
            <li> I mean, its alright just wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> /&gt;o Does dry my hair out a bit if I use it daily, but nothing terrible - no split ends, and nothing a little conditioner now</li>
            <li> Just run a very small amount through my hair and out the door</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it isn&#x27;t sold in stores anymore, at least not around here.</li>
            <li> Not great for out of bed, piecey, or spiky look.</li>
            <li> You need rather a lot of these if you unfortunately have a thick hair.</li>
            <li> you want an artificial and harsh look, this could be for you.</li>
            <li> Some other kinds look bad after the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I find a product that actually works for my impossible hair and it&#x27;s discontinued!</li>
            <li> live in South Florida, and the humidity has been horrible.</li>
            <li> , so sad its been discontinued..</li>
            <li> terrible texture (white</li>
            <li> trying to purchase the waxy stuff and failed.</li>
            <li> This stuff is very thin and requires a lot to achieve desired result ( for me, with thicker, but thinning hair).  </li>
            <li> Sad to say, but it was getting impossible to find this product on the store shelves.  </li>
            <li> But I never liked the way I looked, and my husband of 47 years hated</li>
            <li> Nothing I did was controlling the frizz, the dried out hair, and I was miserable.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> but I was wrong!</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad batch ...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed this product is discontinued.  </li>
            <li> I tried hair curlers, hair accessories to put it up in the air, but just hated all of the fuss, the time, and the work.</li>
            <li> However, this is one of the worst styling products I&#x27;ve used.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> For me, this product performs as well as the Redken Rewind 06 (RR6) pomade that I used to like best, and it&#x27;s about one-quarter the price.  It is slicker on the palm and less sticky than RR6, with consistency that feels sort of like Miracle Whip but does not make my hair look or feel oily.  Using a small amount, about half a teaspoon for my ~2-inch long hair, it is easily distributed and leaves a dry styled look.  I don&#x27;t fuss over my hair much, but I like how easy it is to touch up with damp hands in the bathroom if something looks out of place.  I subscribe for one tub every three months, and don&#x27;t quite use that much.</li>
            <li> I have 3 of these in my storage at all times. I change my hair style depending on weather conditions and this stuff is the best for my long hair look and my short spikey hair look.</li>
            <li> Exact same product as in the store.  Perfect, doesn&#x27;t flake, just enough hold for long-ish guy hair.  Can be reworked with moisture.</li>
            <li> This product is ok. I was using a product also put out by Loreal that was a texturizer too, but it was discontinued.  I had used the other product for a long time. I researched different products to see if I could find something comparable to the other product. This product was the closest thing to the other one.&lt;br /&gt;Although, this product is not as firm as the other, it does do a good job. The last time I ordered this particular product, I ordered two of them. I didn&#x27;t want to run out of it and perhaps it be discontinued also. I would recommend this to anyone especially anyone with short hair. It does the trick!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy this product again because it has a hold yet isn&#x27;t a high strength to make my hair feel hard.</li>
            <li> I use the L&#x27;Oreal Out of Bed Texturizer as a curl enhancer.  It gives me great definition and tames frizz under a harder holding gel on first day hair.  On second day hair I wet my hands and add a bit of this and scrunch through hair for a wavy look.  Gives me consistently good results and its a great value.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It holds your hair and can be brushed out the next day and your hair is just as fresh as the day before. I can use it 3 days in a row without washing it out. I have found nothing else on the market that works as good. The only thing that irrates me is that I used to be able to buy it at Walmart or Walgreens and nobody carries it any more and I have to order it over the internet.</li>
            <li> So, I have been cursed for as long as I can remember with a rooster tail on the back of my head.  Since the time I actually started caring about how I looked, I&#x27;ve had to use some kind of hair product or keep my hair so short that it doesn&#x27;t matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter this product.  It isn&#x27;t a paste or a gel..  It&#x27;s kind of in between.  It goes through the hair evenly and doesn&#x27;t leave it shiny or glued together when it dries.  Your hair also doesn&#x27;t have to be very wet to get this stuff to blend in.  It does not freeze your hair in place.  It just helps it keep a natural looking form (like not sticking out to the side or plastered to the side of your head).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used Tigi Bed Head Molding Paste.  In comparison, my hair had to be wet in order to get the paste distributed evenly.  However, you did not need as much paste.  So, price wise, this product is only a little cheaper than the Bed Head Paste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this goo if you aren&#x27;t trying to glue your hair into spikes and just want natural looking hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is very thin and requires a lot to achieve desired result ( for me, with thicker, but thinning hair).  I like a paste consistency more to get the &amp;#34;chunky&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;piecy&amp;#34; look, whatever they call it.  This is like rubbing fresh tapioca in your hair.</li>
            <li> In need of a styling product after just having cut my hair short again, I bought this based on the good reviews. However, this is one of the worst styling products I&#x27;ve used. When I put it in my hair it left my hair with that super crunchy feeling you get with gel or hairspray. I would have expected that from a product that advertises a strong hold, but this one said it had a flexible hold. It smelled nice, but left my fingers sticky, and made my hair look like I had used a cheap hair gel to style it. Definitely did not give me a texturized look. I don&#x27;t recommend this product for people looking for a texturizing product.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for something a little bit more gooey. It&#x27;s to gely for my taste, but otherwise a excellent product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried plenty of body, volume, texturizing products to give my baby-fine, limp hair some oomph.  This product is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried -- it truly is \\&quot;weigtless\\&quot; in that my hair has great volume and fullness that lasts wash to wash.  The \\&quot;piecey\\&quot;, texturized effects are also great -- I avoid running a brush through it, usually just using my hands/fingers and/or couple runs with fat-tooth comb (I use giant rollers for shoulder length hair after washing).  It doesn&#x27;t have much of a fragrance, and I like that too.  Also does not have any kind of flakiness or residue about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only criticism is that it leaves a dull finish -- to get sheen, I spray lightly with a silicone spray once I have my hair in rollers and let dry as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product especially for those of us with baby-fine hair that cannot take the weight of most gel/mousse products - it&#x27;s worth the price !</li>
            <li> Chemical smell and caused skin irritation. If you have sensitive skin look at Crew or a similar higher end product.</li>
            <li> After having mid-back hair for most of my life, I cut my hair into a super short pixie. I have very fine hair, so I&#x27;ve been using this to give it some texture and body. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or leave any residue. I don&#x27;t quite get the piece-y, very textured look with it, but that could be because my hair is just so fine and smooth.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product! The scent is nice and neutral, neither too manly or too girly. I&#x27;ve purchased countless pomades, gels, sprays, texturizers, etc. but keep coming back to this. Put this in your wet hair, comb through, let hair dry, and comb through (or don&#x27;t). There is no sticky or oily residue, no white flakes, no helmet hair. You get smooth, shiny, good smelling hair that stays where you styled it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  There&#x27;s no lasting smell which is a good thing.  It has good hold but isn&#x27;t sticky or stiff. Just adds great body to the styling. Unfortunately it isn&#x27;t sold in stores anymore, at least not around here.</li>
            <li> Great hair product, it had pretty decent hold and smelled great.</li>
            <li> Hair care is pretty individual.  I have fine hair and this gives me good control without being stiff or sticky so it&#x27;s been my go to product.  Good find.</li>
            <li> Find a great product like this and I buy 4 because it seems like L&#x27;Oreal has discontinued it. I really like it. It holds my short hair back and if its wet ...when its dry I can just run a wet brush thru it</li>
            <li> Leaves a good grip on hair without it being too oily.</li>
            <li> Love love love this stuff, so sad its been discontinued.. The only place I can. Find it is o. Amazon</li>
            <li> It looks dry and and doesn&#x27;t give you that wet looking hair if you apply a lot.&lt;br /&gt;Gel stays for the whole day.</li>
            <li> I had been using gel in my thick, short, layered hair for years to get a messy look. I recently tried this stuff and I love it! It smells really nice, it adds volume and holds my style without being stiff, sticky or wet looking, even when I apply it to damp hair.  I can even finger style it in the morning and my hair looks decent enough to venture out of the house without washing. I will be using this for years and years!</li>
            <li> This is the only creme texture that works in my heavy hair and it has no smell.</li>
            <li> I have curly thick medium hair, and I ride a bike to work with a helmet. This keeps me looking presentable. Its not greasy at all, and the smell is mild but pleasant. It controls my curls with a basic look that works when I take my helmet off.</li>
            <li> Great product, can always count on amazon for finding products no longer at store shelves!</li>
            <li> Just as expected. I gives you the perfect look like just out of the bed.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this product helps to keep it looking controlled and in place. It doesn&#x27;t flake and a little goes a long way. I would not rely on this for any hair style that requires spiking or anything extreme.</li>
            <li> not thick creamy like i was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a little greasy feeling and doesn&#x27;t give a matte look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 2</li>
            <li> After using many different types of wax in my hair, I found this amount of hold to be perfect. For finer, flat, and asian hair this product gives a little bit of volume and texture while having a slight hold. I like it much better than Gatsby wax and will continue to use it in the future.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. Cheap and efficient, it has a good fragrance and works well. The only negative thing I would say is that, my package came broken on the bottom, that is probably Amazon&#x27;s fault. Besides that, you should give it a try.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it that much. Leaves my hair sticky and with a wet look I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> Sad to say, but it was getting impossible to find this product on the store shelves.  I had tried other hair products (at a much higher price!) but they didn&#x27;t work like this stuff does.&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, I found this on Amazon (at the regular great price of about $4 each!) and order an entire box!!!  Boy oh boy, I&#x27;ve got enough to last me for about the next five years.  Thank you Amazon for making this available when no one else did.  (I know, it&#x27;s only a hair product...)</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever nothing else works as good on short hair</li>
            <li> I have used many L&#x27;Oreal product - this one didn&#x27;t work for me and the way that I style my hair - it seems like it really more for the wet look.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive styling product that works, and doesn&#x27;t build up.  A little goes a long way.  Can&#x27;t be without it.  (I have short, fine hair.)</li>
            <li> This has a very high rating on Amazon and that is why I ordered it. This is a trusted hair product name. It was a very good price, so I don&#x27;t mind adding stuff like this to my order to get it up to the amount I need for free shipping.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it - it&#x27;s just darn hard for us curly girls to look neat and shiny when it is muggy and frizzy outside.  This product is a good alternative.  I like how it provides some hold and shine in a soft way; however, there is gunky build up, so Day 2 hair is a challenge.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday for styling and holding my hair.  It doesn&#x27;t harden up and stick to the hair that other gels can irritate you with.  Would recommend</li>
            <li> Not great for out of bed, piecey, or spiky look. A little weak, and gets a tad crispy. Better off with a fiber paste like Got2Be In Play. Comparable in price too. I tried a few new products and just proved to myself, sometimes you just gotta stick with what works.</li>
            <li> I love this as a putty replacement and use it either for the “messy” look or the “clean combed” look. It’s very pliable, though the hold is a medium level (not super strong if that’s what you’re looking for). If you’re looking to spike your hair, the hold for this probably won’t be strong enough. This doesn’t make your hair too shiny or greasy, and it is very easy to wash out at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the price of other hair putties are skyrocketing (and container sizes are shrinking), this is a relative bargain for the container size you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* (relatively) cheap&lt;br /&gt;* (relatively) large container size&lt;br /&gt;* The hold seems to last most of the day&lt;br /&gt;* Easy to wash out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* The hold is not super strong (which I personally don&#x27;t mind)</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would be a cheap alternative to the J Crew fiber I have used, alas, it was not.  I didn&#x27;t find it provided the hold or no product look I wanted.  I mean, its alright just wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Does the job without the gunky feeling of gel-like residue.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this! I use in my sons hair for a cute messy look, and in mine and my daughters hair to give definition. Smells great and always leaves the hair feeling wonderful. Will be buying again for sure!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this expecting something like a Reformer or a Crew Forming Cream. This will leave your hair separated in shiny chunks with a firm finish.</li>
            <li> Sticky, but it has a nice fresh smell on your hair. You need rather a lot of these if you unfortunately have a thick hair.</li>
            <li> I love L&#x27;Oreal Paris Studio Line Out of Bed Texturizer.  It makes my hair do just what I want it to do and I couldn&#x27;t live without it!  I would highly recommend this product to anyone .</li>
            <li> As a gel it does a great job--not greasy, not heavy, and very good for sculpturing your hair to fit your individual needs.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I use when I want to style my hair certain ways etc.  I like the semi wet look it can give you and it holds really well.  Only downside it is hard to find it anywhere but through here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years, unfortunately the local supermarket doesn&#x27;t seem to stock this anymore- so I decided to order from Amazon. The product came on time.&lt;br /&gt;Reasons why I use this product: (1) doesn&#x27;t make your hear stiff like hair gel, (2) isn&#x27;t sticky and doesn&#x27;t run down your face when it&#x27;s hot, (3) more natural look- none of the extra &amp;#34;gloss&amp;#34; and (4) easy to re-style hair- just rub in some water to you hair and you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;Works for my hair, but may not work for everyone.</li>
            <li> dont like this product. goopy, sticky andvery drying</li>
            <li> Was so happy to find this online.  Stores don&#x27;t carry it anymore.</li>
            <li> I have used this for several years. It&#x27;s hard to find in stores. As a man, I don&#x27;t want to look like I have grease in my hair. This is light and has great hold</li>
            <li> Not as amazing as promise. Pretty weak stuff</li>
            <li> Not a bad hair control product - just a little runny - and kinda has a shin to it at first but wears off during the day</li>
            <li> Have used this for years and it gives me the best &amp;#34;messy&#x27; hair look out of all products i have tried.</li>
            <li> It works!  I love this texturizer &amp; can&#x27;t find it locally anymore.  Thanks Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it because it said it was from Amazon &amp; I hope it was because it came without any type of safety seal.  The store product had a seal. I love the product but might return it because of the lack of safety seal.</li>
            <li> This product does the job, but it makes my hair extremely hard and crusty that I have simply given up on this product. I have found other products that will still hold my hair in place, and I am still able to run my fingers through my hair -- not so with this product. It feels like you are ripping out your hair, if you would try to brush this stuff out of your hair. It&#x27;s so painful that you are better off just washing it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products to give my hair a little hold. This one does it with out looking oily or crusty. It also doesn&#x27;t make my hair stick together.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Helps keep hair in place without using spray. For short styles it really is perfect.  My only complaint is that it is a bit &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; when first using and stays that way.  I have found that by continuing to work it through the hair eliminates more of the stickiness.  Otherwise, a good product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It keeps my hair standing up and in place without making my hair stick together or looking like I have product in my hair. It is good for having &amp;#34;touchable&amp;#34; hair that goes back into place easily.  It washes out very easily, though, so it&#x27;s not for days when your hair would get wet.</li>
            <li> Light and not sticky with a very subtle clean scent.</li>
            <li> This product is becoming increasingly hard to find; Amazon is the only place I have been able to find it lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This texturizer gives my fine hair much needed volume without looking over done, coarse, or fussy. I typically apply it to the roots and smooth it to the ends while my hair is wet, then blow dry using a wide round brush for great lift that is still touchable and soft. If I want something more styled, I apply this then apply a wax or pomade to the ends and flip them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;o Great price - comparable products are easily 2-4x the cost&lt;br /&gt;o Light fragrance that fades quickly - perfect if you&#x27;re sensitive to scents&lt;br /&gt;o Not sticky - hair looks clean and naturally styled but maintains its shape&lt;br /&gt;o Easy to use - apply while wet or dry and style&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;o Hard to find locally&lt;br /&gt;o Does dry my hair out a bit if I use it daily, but nothing terrible - no split ends, and nothing a little conditioner now and then can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It is one-of-a-kind. They quit carrying it in the stores.  Every time I order from Amazon and need to add to my purchase, I order these to get enough for free shipping.  I am taking my chances it won&#x27;t get old because it seems so many products I love are discontinued.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best texturizer out there! smells good and no flaking.</li>
            <li> I do not use it as directed. Instead of putting it into my hair in random places straight from the container, to make a ruffled look, I mix a small amount in my hand with a handful of water and then spread it evenly across all of my hair. I then &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; my hair with my fingers and this stuff holds it in place as it dries. Once dry I run my fingers through my hair and the end result is that my hair is super soft, casually in place, and looks really good, for the whole rest of the day.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I wanted just a little straighter in my hair and it worked like a dream. I have just enough and not too much. Highly recommend if you want manageability</li>
            <li> Excellent hard to find product.</li>
            <li> Great product for short wet styles. Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair stiff or sticky. Once your hair is dry you just run your fingers through it! This product is awesome. Gives my hair a nice shine!</li>
            <li> This gives me the look I want.  Can use on damp or dry hair.  Never take this product out of your line...</li>
            <li> When I opened it, I found a hair on the top of the product. Everything else was great, what I wanted to buy, but I was little bit disappointed by the hair.</li>
            <li> One of the best gels I&#x27;ve ever found. I love it because it goes on great when hair is wet or dry. Hard to find a gel that goes on great when hair is dry. This one is also the perfect amount of stiffness/hold - not too stiff, not too light. Smells great.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! It&#x27;s less sticky than other texturizers and smells great too. Good price, cheaper than salon products but works as well.</li>
            <li> terrible texture (white slime)&lt;br /&gt;terrible smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;was trying to purchase the waxy stuff and failed. the packaging looked TOO SIMILAR to the Hair Putty. (I should read more carefully next time)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROs: probably good for a jersey shore due ;)</li>
            <li> My favorite gel I love it so much I buy it all the time it makes my curls curlier and I have a perm and everyone thinks it is natural so I have a good hairdresser too but this product makes your hair soft and swirls and men love it :)</li>
            <li> I love it!my hair looks healthy,no more frizz,in the morning when I wake up, my curls looks great, I recommend 100%.</li>
            <li> the texture of the product is a bit gooey, but works well to keep my part held with minimal hardening feel like gel.</li>
            <li> I initially bought this at a large retailer but for some reason the store stopped carrying it.  I loved the product so much I bought a large batch.</li>
            <li> Used this product for a couple of years. Great for managing short hair.</li>
            <li> A bit too liquidy, somewhat sticky but not thick enough to texturizing my thick hair- does not separate the hair well (at least for me)</li>
            <li> This hair product is just right for my short hair and keeps my waves and curls under control.</li>
            <li> Great shipper, got it quick!</li>
            <li> You can tell its cheap because you have to put quite a bit in order to get your hair how you want it. But good enough, and a regular texturizer.</li>
            <li> Wife loves these, we buy a number at a time to last the year.</li>
            <li> Hard to find does the job</li>
            <li> Once again, I only use L&#x27;Oreal products.  This Out of Bed Texturizer is great.  I love the out of bed look.  Just run a very small amount through my hair and out the door I go.  I really like the fact that I do not need to use this every day.  Some days all I need to do is dampen my fingers, tilt my head down and rub all over my hair.  I love this!  It sounds crazy, but I like to have my hair easy to look great in the morning.</li>
            <li> I love this product and cannot find anything else like it on the market.  It is not waxy, so it doesn&#x27;t pull your hair down an hour after you&#x27;ve styled it.  It&#x27;s also rather dry, for lack of a better description, so it doesn&#x27;t make my hair curl up like most other gels do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair texture is medium/coarse, very wavy and extremely thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I blow dry my hair straight, finger comb a good amount of this texturizing gel thru my hair, then comb it down straight.  Then I blow dry the straight gelled hair till its dry.  This completely eradicates all the undesired curl in my hair.  Then I tousle it all over for a semi-unkempt look with lots of movement and a good amount of volume.&lt;br /&gt;Love love love this product!</li>
            <li> This was really does an &amp;#34;out of bed&amp;#34; look to your hair! I was skeptical initially and that&#x27;s why I just bought one bottle (just in case) but I was wrong! It leaves your hair with that out of bed look that I want for some days! really like it!</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that is difficult to style.  Therefore, I require products that will add texture.  This product works really well at a very reasonable price.  It&#x27;s a bit tacky, but doesn&#x27;t make my hair sticky.  I can blow dry my hair with this product in and it does not flake.  It holds up all day and gives my hair volume and texture.  There are a lot of products on the market, but you really can&#x27;t beat the price of this product and you get a fair amount of product for your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for texture, but note that it&#x27;s NOT a hair glue.  If you&#x27;re looking for something that is super tacky or that will mold your hair and keep it in place, this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this on my hands...it&#x27;s not sticky and it&#x27;s easy to wash off of my hands.  The hold is perfect...not too much hold, not too little.  I love the smell of it too!  I have short thick curly hair and I flat iron the ends a little then put this on my hands and pull at the ends for the messy wispy look and it does the job perfectly!</li>
            <li> This product works well.  It does not &amp;#34;freeze&amp;#34; my hair, allows it to move without getting messy and does not leave a film, something I dislike about a lot of heavier products.  Best for when my hair has grown out a bit in between hair cuts, as opposed to when it is shorter and I need something with a little more control (the &amp;#34;more control&amp;#34; product does leave a bit of a film).</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m missing something, but this texture cream is like a jar of hair conditioner: a dab rubbed into your palm and/or hair quickly dries into ... nothing. No gel, no hold, no texture! Maybe I got a bad batch ...</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and love the price. Keeps my hair in place all day.</li>
            <li> Awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would just write &amp;#34;awful&amp;#34; but Amazon insists that I write a certain minimum number of words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what else can I say? Goopy. Smelly. Leaves hair sticky and stiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer a wax or cream product that is lighter and lets you style your hair while still keeping a natural, soft look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not that product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want an artificial and harsh look, this could be for you.</li>
            <li> This is the first texture product I have really liked. It gives me a hair salon look at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> I am a first time user of a hair texturizer of any kind. I am 65 years old, a natural redhead, and tired of a lifetime of uncontrollable natural curls.&lt;br /&gt;I had been wearing my hair short for about 10 years.  But I never liked the way I looked, and my husband of 47 years hated it.&lt;br /&gt;I have a close friend, who also has long natural curls. So, I began to let my hair grow, and loved it, until this Summer.&lt;br /&gt;We live in South Florida, and the humidity has been horrible. Nothing I did was controlling the frizz, the dried out hair, and I was miserable. I tried hair curlers, hair accessories to put it up in the air, but just hated all of the fuss, the time, and the work. I began thinking of cutting it short, once again.&lt;br /&gt;I love Amazon, and began searching for a texturizing paste, to see if it would work. I decided to &#x27;embrace my curls&#x27; rather than fight them. And, even though I&#x27;m an old lady, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased L&#x27;Oreal Out of Bed Texturizer.&lt;br /&gt;From the first use of the Out of Bed, I was hooked! Delightful scent, easy manageability, and you can use it on damp or dry hair, every single day. It never &#x27;goops up&#x27;, never makes your hair gooey or stiff, and you can put a comb or brush through it afterward, with no tangles.&lt;br /&gt;The best thing is, my hair remains soft and manageable at all times, and the color is still true, which is difficult with red hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hooked!  I just ordered 2 more jars of it...1 for my friend with the long, natural curls, and 1 for myself. And, so as not to take a chance of running out, I placed myself on the automatic order list.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for this product! MStalhut  Ft Pierce FL</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  I wear a spikey hair cut and this holds the spikes in place without feeling sticky, gummy, or too stiff.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> IM A BLACK MALE WITH LOW CUT HAIR AND THIS TEXTURIZER ISN&#x27;T STRONG FOR ME.&lt;br /&gt;ON THE LABEL IT WAS A 2/5 STRENGTH ON L&#x27;OREALS SCALE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DESPITE THAT, IT KEEPS MY HAIR PRETTY MOIST THE ENTIRE DAY!!!! IF IT WAS AT LEAST 4/5 STRENGTH ID RATE THIS SPECIFIC ITEM A 5.</li>
            <li> I thought this wouldn&#x27;t bulk up, but it does. It also doesn&#x27;t have a very strong hold and tends to leave flakes. I only use a dime size amount, so it cant be that I&#x27;m using to much.</li>
            <li> too water down, if you have stubborn hair DO NOT GET THIS PRODUCT. there are better product out there. Sure you get more compare to others BUT YOU ALSO NEED TO USE MORE to get half the result of other products.</li>
            <li> Good hold and stays in control of my thick hair all day. Some other kinds look bad after the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Stores near me stopped carrying this, so I am happy to find it on Amazon.  I use it on my curly hair when it&#x27;s wet, to help hold the shape of the curls.  Love it!</li>
            <li> My husband won&#x27;t use anything else.  He used to use gel.  Leaves hair feeling clean when it&#x27;s brushed through, not gummed up like others.</li>
            <li> I like the texture that it gives my hair but the consistency is a little too thin and sticky.</li>
            <li> I let my hair to air dry after shower ( which gives it a natural wave) , then I apply this l! Gives it a natural cute messy look!</li>
            <li> Waste of money.... This product was purchased as a replacement for the usual, Rusk. What a disappointment. You get what you pay for and this was a complete waste of money....</li>
            <li> Love this! Doesn&#x27;t make my hair shine like all the other Gael&#x27;s and pastes. I can run my hand through my hair during the day and my hands remain dry, not sticky or greasy like the axe products. Doesn&#x27;t give a wet shiny look, but it holds nice and firm without giving the tacky appearance.</li>
            <li> I felt compelled to review this product after returning to it after a while trying pricier products and ultimately coming back to this, which I had used on an off for years. My hair varies from quite wavy/curly on humid days to kind of limp and flat on dry days, and my hair is neither thin nor thick. I like a &amp;#34;bed head&amp;#34; look with piece-y waves and texture. This product gives excellent hold but doesn&#x27;t feel stiff. It actually makes my hair feel thicker, like when I make a ponytail, I feel like I have more hair! Some other products I&#x27;ve tried work well in terms of giving a light hold and providing a silky feel, but the tradeoff for me is always &amp;#34;flat head&amp;#34; and a lack of texture. This stuff is so inexpensive, and for me, it&#x27;s really a winner!</li>
            <li> Love it, works great.  This is the pirfict soft hold that i&#x27;m looking for.  Holds your style with out being hard or &amp;#34;gelled&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I use this product regularly on dry hair after styling.  A dab on my fingertips and run it through my short hair.  It keeps my naturally curly hair more textured than frizzy looking.</li>
            <li> Of course depends on your hair but I wanted the just out of bed look and this doesn&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li> I have a somewhat oily scalp, with stubborn waves and curls. This product provides good hold with minimal stickiness and/or oils, which can &amp;#34;weigh hair down&amp;#34;. A good product--don&#x27;t know why it was discontinued, but I&#x27;ve got my &amp;#34;stash&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> You get what you paid for.  I highly believe this one is fake.  L&#x27;Oreal Gel has a distinct fragrance when you use it.  I brought two cans for a cheap price $10.99 and it stink, even you just opened it up.  I will never fall into this kind deal again.  Like they said, &amp;#34;You Get What You Paid For&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! However, I cannot find it in stores anymore. I&#x27;m panicking! I fear that they&#x27;re going to take this off the market.  It is the best hair gel I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed this product is discontinued.  I love it.it is light on my hair.  My hair being very fine doesn&#x27;t do well with heavy texture products.  This is just perfect.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best hair gels I have used. The smell is awesome and it makes your hair look awesome as well. It keeps your hair looking great the whole day through and does not flake unless you put your hands through it. I would definitely recommend this product in heart beat.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this for me, here on Amazon. This product does a decent job at texturizing. Unfortunately, after an hour of (slow) daily biking, my hair returns to its pre-product state. Can&#x27;t risk using the rest, since when I do grooming, I intend it to last longer.&lt;br /&gt;Was happy to find a cheap replacement for Paul Mitchell, Jonathan, Sebastian etc, products I regularly use, sad to see it fall short.</li>
            <li> I went to 2 CVS and 1 Rite aid to buy this stuff I&#x27;ve been using for 1-2 years.  couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere, so I bought more off Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;better than gel (less hard/shiny/stiff) and not waxy or slippery.  very light you can hardly tell it&#x27;s in your hair.  apply when hair is towelled off and still damp, for best results.  spread evenly everywhere making sure to pay special attention to bangs etc.  will set within 1-2 minutes.  just give a spritz of Suave or another hairspray to finish, and you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  some very large CVS stores may still carry t his.  but glad Amazon had it in stock and ready to go.  will keep buying...</li>
            <li> I do not like this quite as much as Fructis Pixie Play.</li>
            <li> It gives a nice flexible, slightly wild hold on my relatively short guy hair.  It&#x27;s never greasy.  I just wish it looked and felt less like semen.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s really hard to wash off your hands too.  I have to scrub with soap to get my hands clean after using it.  But these are but minor drawbacks to an effective product.</li>
            <li> The best hair gel for my fine hair, have tried many and this one is the best. Hope it is not discontinued.</li>
            <li> I first bought this over a year ago when I had a short hair cut since it was recommended at the time by the hair stylist, but for some reason never bothered to even open the jar.&lt;br /&gt;Now that my hair is grown out (a little over shoulder length), it&#x27;s thinner than it used to be, flat, limp and never has any volume. I have tried volumizing mousses, sprays...everything has just weighed my hair down and made it look worse or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;The other day I remembered I had this stuff and figured I&#x27;d try it. So I rubbed a tiny pea sized amount into my roots, finger combed it through then took a wide tooth comb and brushed it through the length of my hair. Now I expected my hair to be limp and greasy looking, like every other product usually leaves my hair, but NO, my hair had body and actually MOVED. My hair did not feel stiff or sticky either because this texturizer is so lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;My hair does not fall flat throughout the day, it actually held a style with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it  takes out the shine from my hair, but I&#x27;d imagine some shine/gloss spray can remedy this minor issue.&lt;br /&gt;It just figures I find a product that actually works for my impossible hair and it&#x27;s discontinued!</li>
            <li> This does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. It even has a little more hold than the label implies. I would probably rate the hold as 7/10 instead of 2/5.</li>
            <li> Love this product for my little boys hair.</li>
            <li> Works well for short asian hair.  Has a very different texture depending on whether you use it on wet or dry hair, so be forewarned - you can end up with extremely shiny (blindingly shiny) patches if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> This works well for very short hair and very light weight hair. My hair is heavy and when I tried it as it grew it didn&#x27;t hold up long. When my hair is shorter, it holds up better but still no all that long. I plan on using it until it&#x27;s gone but I think I need a firmer hold.</li>
