            <li> it work only one time and it supposed to come with +1x Blackhead Remover Needle and it did&#x27;t I feel scamed!!! Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> This is a very cheep product and it doesn&#x27;t even work at all! It also did not come as the seller described it would. It didn&#x27;t come with the extra tool like it describes. I tried contacting the seller about my issues and I still have not heard back from anyone in regards to the issues. Not even worth the $!! I would not purchase this item! I wish I had not ordered this!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t come with metal tool. There is literally no suction it&#x27;s crap don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work, no metal stick thing</li>
            <li> The vacuum really doesn&#x27;t suck much. I couldn&#x27;t even tell if it was on at first. But at least I got the extractor at a good price.</li>
            <li> Instructions were in Asian typeface. I could not figure out HOW to use it.&lt;br /&gt;So I gave it to a Chinese friend.</li>
            <li> Great price. Great suction great tool.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work. Won&#x27;t turn on.</li>
            <li> not every item listed came in the package...</li>
            <li> The suction tool seems to be very inexpensive plastic. When the package was delivered the metal tool was not included. I was quickly refunded $2.00. The metal tool may just be good enough if bought separately.</li>
