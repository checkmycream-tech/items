            <li>This is the best stuff!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s especially good.</li>
            <li>So great stuff!</li>
            <li>Not hair spray, but a great substitute!</li>
            <li>and it sets it perfectly without any stickiness or gunky feeling, and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Best for root boost.</li>
            <li>It is great!</li>
            <li>I found this to be the best alternative I can find for Redken&#x27;s discontinued Wool Shake product.  </li>
            <li>works great with no stiffness!</li>
            <li>I do not think this mist could possibly be good for your lungs!  </li>
            <li>Got a sample of this at a hair show in Denver, and loved it!  </li>
            <li>this texturizing spray does the trick and smells great, too.  </li>
            <li>and this works great for me.  </li>
            <li>This product is great for giving lots of texture and some matte mild-moderate hold to shorter hair.</li>
            <li>Works well, smells amazing!</li>
            <li>Good buy, great product</li>
            <li>While hilarious and good value for money (entertainment and hair styling in one!)</li>
            <li>If you love texture and volume this product is amazing!</li>
            <li>I love the combo!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite product for keeping my curls curled!</li>
            <li>This product, I love!</li>
            <li>Great product for fine hair like mine.  </li>
            <li>And the price on Amazon is amazing.</li>
            <li>The smell is a bit strong but it&#x27;s kind of nice.</li>
            <li>If you have fine slippery sleek hair and you want texture and volume, this is your ticket!  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This product is ok.</li>
            <li>My favorite hair product ever</li>
            <li>Love this product for volume, lift and texture.  </li>
            <li>Never mind - I can get it here for a better price.</li>
            <li>I love what this product does to my hair, but boy</li>
            <li>My stylist recommended and it is much more affordable to purchase via Amazon than at the salon.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair cut into a a short layered bob-this stuff works great!</li>
            <li>I have thinner hair, and I feel that this product is great at not being too heavy, but also is great at holding the style.</li>
            <li>Flip outs and washes out easily.</li>
            <li>It has an overpowering strong smell.  </li>
            <li>THIS is by far the BEST product I&#x27;ve used so far</li>
            <li>It gives body &amp; texture &amp; does give hold, but it helps if you finish styling with a light spray of hairspray.</li>
            <li>Great for short hair.</li>
            <li>Travel size is great for short trips!</li>
            <li>That being said my hair looks fabulous and doesn&#x27;t feel poisoned.</li>
            <li>Has a light scent.  </li>
            <li>(it smells wonderful, by the way), but it does magic for my thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li>It is pretty much potent poison in the air when you spray it, choking anything around it.</li>
            <li>If you have fine, straight hair, this stuff is magic.</li>
            <li>Great dry holding spray.</li>
            <li>My hair has not an ounce of frizz or volume, so if you&#x27;re a fine hair type, you might only use this for styling rather than &amp;#34;clumping.&amp;#34; The texture of my hair is smooth and nice, and despite the name, is shiny looking.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In terms of its actual job, it seems like a good product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product and still works properly despite the shipping damage.</li>
            <li>The scent is nice as well- not heavy at all and quickly dissipates.</li>
            <li>It looked great for 30 min then by time I got to the party, it made hair weight down and sticky.</li>
            <li>It dries very fast, so better be ready when you use it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for my thick course hair!</li>
            <li>Well worth your money!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Take all the horrendous body sprays you remember and spray them on your head - same kind of effect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not unpleasant, exactly, but it will overrule everything else you&#x27;re wearing - and people will get a whiff of you before they see you.</li>
            <li>This stuff works pretty well, but it has a POWERFUL smell.</li>
            <li>Great stuff I use everyday!</li>
            <li>Dries super fast and keeps things in place while styling.  </li>
            <li>I have short hair, wear it flat-ironed and messy and this works perfect for that style.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
            <li>and my hairstyle was voluminous and stylish with just enough texture and grip.</li>
            <li>I have bought this product from beauty stores for over a year, and didn&#x27;t think much of buying it</li>
            <li>I have very wavy hair that&#x27;s on the verge of curly.</li>
            <li>If you use too much it will be sticky.</li>
            <li>Aimed properly you can texturize as well as shape your style with a nice dry feel</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 33 year old woman, so as you can imagine, this got me funny looks from my husband, coworkers, and even passers-</li>
            <li>Holds really well and leaves hair soft.</li>
            <li>I wash my hair every couple days, I have fine brown hair that has slight curl.</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length hair- its not super fine, but theres a lot of it.  </li>
            <li>I would not suggest using it with really fine hair as this product can be heavy.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t love about it is that it can get a little flaky/dusty at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a smoker I&#x27;d steer clear.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sadly, this spray smells like a cosmetics executive&#x27;s idea of a 14 year old boy&#x27;s masculine aspirations.</li>
            <li>My old hairdresser used to use it, but since I&#x27;ve moved, I&#x27;ve found no one that&#x27;s ever heard of it.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin hair</li>
            <li>I usually use a spray wax and this did a similar job with a great all round texture for my short pixie cut.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s vastly unhealthy to breathe</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of using a little too much and it completely flattened my hairstyle and dulled out my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a late 20&#x27;s male and have tried many different pomades, creams and other products.</li>
            <li>I have a layered bob &amp; fine thin hair.</li>

            <li> works just like hairspray, but it&#x27;s dry and you can barely tell there&#x27;s product in your hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair from falling flat.</li>
            <li> I use this on dry hair and it literally freezes it into place.</li>
            <li> To me it is a mix between dry shampoo and hairspray.  </li>
            <li> The second time around, I was a lot less heavy handed</li>
            <li> Other reviews mentioned the smell.</li>
            <li> I was extremely dissapointed with my order.</li>
            <li> My husband griped about it endlessly, so I gave the can to my cousin.</li>
            <li> After reafing the other reviews, i feel like i must be using it incorrectly.</li>
            <li> tried it 3 different times, each times on clean hair and each time my hair was gray and looked very dirty in the places</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, and I hate that not everywhere carries it.  </li>
            <li> Tried a couple other products and nothing worked as well as this!</li>
            <li> It gives my hair texture and hold without weighting it down or getting stiff like hair spray.</li>
            <li> I literally use this almost everyday.</li>
            <li> oh boy do I feel like I&#x27;m taking a few days off of my life every time I use it.</li>
            <li> I spray a bit over dried hair before I use a curling wand and my curls stay all day.</li>
            <li> so it can leave your hair looking a little dull.</li>
            <li> and it is hard for me to get curls to stay, but</li>
            <li> I have very thick and heavy hair</li>
            <li> This was an unbelievable price compared to salon cost!</li>
            <li> also provides a lot of volume for those with thin hair as I.</li>
            <li> The product was fake or something, because it turned my hair gray when I sprayed it on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , I am afraid this is going to be relegated to the emergency hair supplies</li>
            <li> I washed hair not day, hate the feeling of it in my hair.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this stuff. It keeps my hair from falling flat. I have a layered bob &amp; fine thin hair. Set in velcro rollers to add shape &amp; body. After finger combing I lift layers &amp; spray at roots. Shake can as you spray.  It gives body &amp; texture &amp; does give hold, but it helps if you finish styling with a light spray of hairspray.</li>
            <li> I literally use this almost everyday. Well worth your money!&lt;br /&gt;This works just like hairspray, but it&#x27;s dry and you can barely tell there&#x27;s product in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;It also provides a lot of volume for those with thin hair as I.</li>
            <li> It has an overpowering strong smell.  I do not think this mist could possibly be good for your lungs!  I cannot breathe well around the spray of it!</li>
            <li> Other reviews mentioned the smell. &amp;#34;What&#x27;s in a smell?&amp;#34; I thought. All hair products tend to smell of something, after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, this spray smells like a cosmetics executive&#x27;s idea of a 14 year old boy&#x27;s masculine aspirations. Take all the horrendous body sprays you remember and spray them on your head - same kind of effect. I&#x27;m a 33 year old woman, so as you can imagine, this got me funny looks from my husband, coworkers, and even passers-by in the street. While hilarious and good value for money (entertainment and hair styling in one!), I am afraid this is going to be relegated to the emergency hair supplies drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of its actual job, it seems like a good product. I usually use a spray wax and this did a similar job with a great all round texture for my short pixie cut. I just can&#x27;t deal with the smell.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s vastly unhealthy to breathe (it smells wonderful, by the way), but it does magic for my thin, fine hair. And the price on Amazon is amazing. I&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for my thick course hair!</li>
            <li> Good buy, great product</li>
            <li> This product is ok. I made the mistake of using a little too much and it completely flattened my hairstyle and dulled out my hair. The second time around, I was a lot less heavy handed and my hairstyle was voluminous and stylish with just enough texture and grip. The scent is nice as well- not heavy at all and quickly dissipates. I spray directly into my roots and it feels like a rough putty so it gets the style done. Great for short hair. Flip outs and washes out easily.</li>
            <li> Works well, smells amazing!</li>
            <li> My son loves this stuff!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product and still works properly despite the shipping damage.</li>
            <li> Great product for fine hair like mine.  Use it every day.</li>
            <li> If you love texture and volume this product is amazing!</li>
            <li> This spray is different from regular hairspray. Aimed properly you can texturize as well as shape your style with a nice dry feel</li>
            <li> I have bought this product from beauty stores for over a year, and didn&#x27;t think much of buying it online.&lt;br /&gt; I was extremely dissapointed with my order. The product was fake or something, because it turned my hair gray when I sprayed it on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it 3 different times, each times on clean hair and each time my hair was gray and looked very dirty in the places I sprayed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will never order again.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff!</li>
            <li> My favorite hair product ever</li>
            <li> This stuff is a miracle!  I wish they had bigger bottles.</li>
            <li> I have very wavy hair that&#x27;s on the verge of curly. I use products like this to encourage clumping. I use this on dry hair and it literally freezes it into place. The smell is a bit strong but it&#x27;s kind of nice. It dries very fast, so better be ready when you use it. After it dries, it doesn&#x27;t move, though I must say it feels a bit tacky for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On damp hair - a method for wavies/curlies to de poof and de frizz -  it&#x27;s especially good. My hair has not an ounce of frizz or volume, so if you&#x27;re a fine hair type, you might only use this for styling rather than &amp;#34;clumping.&amp;#34; The texture of my hair is smooth and nice, and despite the name, is shiny looking. So great stuff! I might stop using glues and switch to this.</li>
            <li> Love this product for volume, lift and texture.  I use it with Alterna Bamboo Volume 48 and Alterna Volume Plumping Strand Expand and I look like I have a LOT OF HAIR.  I love the combo!</li>
            <li> This stuff works pretty well, but it has a POWERFUL smell. It&#x27;s not unpleasant, exactly, but it will overrule everything else you&#x27;re wearing - and people will get a whiff of you before they see you. My husband griped about it endlessly, so I gave the can to my cousin.</li>
            <li> Great stuff I use everyday! Travel size is great for short trips! This was an unbelievable price compared to salon cost!</li>
            <li> Made hair sticky and had to wash not day. I wash my hair every couple days, I have fine brown hair that has slight curl. After blow drying I added spray to give it some volume and texture. It looked great for 30 min then by time I got to the party, it made hair weight down and sticky. I went to fix my hair, my fingers cut even go through my hair. Like I had honey in my hair. I washed hair not day, hate the feeling of it in my hair.</li>
            <li> If you have fine, straight hair, this stuff is magic. It gives my hair texture and hold without weighting it down or getting stiff like hair spray. My old hairdresser used to use it, but since I&#x27;ve moved, I&#x27;ve found no one that&#x27;s ever heard of it. Never mind - I can get it here for a better price.</li>
            <li> I love what this product does to my hair, but boy oh boy do I feel like I&#x27;m taking a few days off of my life every time I use it. It is pretty much potent poison in the air when you spray it, choking anything around it. That being said my hair looks fabulous and doesn&#x27;t feel poisoned. If you&#x27;re a smoker I&#x27;d steer clear.</li>
            <li> Holds really well and leaves hair soft. My stylist recommended and it is much more affordable to purchase via Amazon than at the salon. Not hair spray, but a great substitute!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair cut into a a short layered bob-this stuff works great! It adds volume and holds with no hairspray required. Tried a couple other products and nothing worked as well as this! I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, and I hate that not everywhere carries it.  I have wavy/curly hair, so when I wear my hair curly I use this and it sets it perfectly without any stickiness or gunky feeling, and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> If you have fine slippery sleek hair and you want texture and volume, this is your ticket!  However, its is a clay type product which reduces shine.  Best for root boost. I&#x27;ve ordered a couple.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite product for keeping my curls curled! I have very fine, thin hair and it is hard for me to get curls to stay, but this texturizing spray does the trick and smells great, too.  I spray a bit over dried hair before I use a curling wand and my curls stay all day.</li>
            <li> Got a sample of this at a hair show in Denver, and loved it!  Dries super fast and keeps things in place while styling.  I have been using it on men&#x27;s hair only.</li>
            <li> It is great! Texturixes, adds volume and has no residue.</li>
            <li> This product, I love! I have short hair, wear it flat-ironed and messy and this works perfect for that style. Just know that it is a matte finish so it can leave your hair looking a little dull. Consider finishing with a shine mist or pairing with some wax in pieces here and there.</li>
            <li> Great dry holding spray.</li>
            <li> I found this to be the best alternative I can find for Redken&#x27;s discontinued Wool Shake product.  It gives me the matte textured look, but in an aerosol instead of a pump.  Has a light scent.  I have very thick and heavy hair and this works great for me.  I would not suggest using it with really fine hair as this product can be heavy.  To me it is a mix between dry shampoo and hairspray.  If you use too much it will be sticky.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair- its not super fine, but theres a lot of it.  My stylist recommended some sort of texturizer so i tried spray clay.  After reafing the other reviews, i feel like i must be using it incorrectly. It makes my hair insta tangley, and does NOT Hold curl at all! In fact, unless i wash my hair, it wont hold curl the next day!!  I could see this working fir short hair, as it does add texture, however, I wont be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I have thinner hair, and I feel that this product is great at not being too heavy, but also is great at holding the style. I&#x27;m a late 20&#x27;s male and have tried many different pomades, creams and other products. THIS is by far the BEST product I&#x27;ve used so far and I plan to continue using it.</li>
            <li> This product is great for giving lots of texture and some matte mild-moderate hold to shorter hair. The only thing I don&#x27;t love about it is that it can get a little flaky/dusty at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> works great with no stiffness!</li>
