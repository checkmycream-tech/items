            <li> It is wonderful.  I noticed thicker hair and small growth emerging on my scalp both front and back.  I felt added volume whenever I comb and brush my hair in which I did feel before.  I am in my one month application and expecting more growth thicker hair in the future.</li>
            <li> I use this product daily after taking a  shower. After a month , I can say its a decent product but it takes too long to see real&lt;br /&gt;results ...I have just noticed modest improvements</li>
            <li> I just received this product on May 14th so I cannot honestly provide a results review.  The product smelled great!  It also made my hair soft.  I will give another review in a few weeks if applicable.</li>
            <li> My product arrived on time, I had no problem with the shipping,,,I&#x27;m still using this product, for abt a month now and I&#x27;ve seen great results so far, my hair grew and felt thicker, I love the smell and it gives a tingly feeling on my scalp which I love.. I would definitely Order more</li>
            <li> I am currently using thifours product every time  I shampoo my hair and have been using it for about 6 months now and have noticed that it works, I will continue using it</li>
            <li> I like it a lot my hair looks good.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  My hair is of long length and have been using the Alter Ego drops for years in combination with my garlic conditioner.  I decided to try something different to give my scalp/hair additional nourishment and Kismera has done the job.  Also, the seller responded immediately to my question.  I am very pleased with my purchase, pleased with the price compared to the website I typically purchase my Dominican products...needless to say, I will be a repeat customer for life.</li>
            <li> its okay I love my alter ego one better......</li>
