            <li>I love the Suave line of products for kids.  </li>
            <li>My kids love it, and it does the job.  </li>
            <li>My kids love this for body wash...</li>
            <li>It was too strong; I prefer a more mild-smelling soap for my kids.</li>
            <li>The kids love it because it&#x27;s easy - one product for their hair and body -</li>
            <li>Nice, mild shampoo and body wash.</li>
            <li>There are not too many companies that make kid friendly shampoo and body wash.</li>
            <li>It inspires them to foam themselves up and scrub clean, which I love.</li>
            <li>This 3 and 1 shampoo, conditioner and shower gel is really useful, washing a very sweet very clean, with my son&#x27;s love, he said very convenient and can be washed very clean and will recommend to friends!</li>
            <li>This product works fine.</li>
            <li>It smells fine though, and does the job, and works as bubble bath too.</li>
            <li>It worked just fine and</li>
            <li>My kids love the smells and fun bottles and tear free shampoo.</li>
            <li>this is a nice size and great price for how much soap you get, it smells nice and doesn&#x27;t make hair dried out or frizzy.</li>
            <li>We originally received this soap as a gift from Grandma.</li>
            <li>They love the fruity smells, and we love that we only need one bottle to clean and condition their skin AND Hair!</li>
            <li>Smells good and easy to use, I love not having three separate bottles in the tub for my little one.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed that it conditions any better than just the straight up baby shampoo that we used to use for my daughter.  </li>
            <li>He really loves the scent and it gets him clean and fresh from head to toe.  </li>
            <li>scrubbing clean, not so much.</li>
            <li>I am going to go back to using the Smoothers type of suave kids shampoo, it has much better end results.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>Amazon would surely replace it, but it did not leak enough to warrant a phone call.</li>
            <li>it comes straight to my door!  </li>
            <li>I have been  using all the different varieties of suave for years and love them.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing some more as long as the price stays at an economical price.</li>
            <li>It is too dry ( hair and body ) after  wash, for travel is ok but not for everyday use, smell good</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also makes the hair super soft(my son has girls ask him what he uses because his hair is always so soft and shinny!)</li>
            <li>When bathing your kids, you want something fast and not have to reach for a bottle for the body and one for the hair</li>
            <li>(Haha.)  </li>
            <li>Just lather up the sponge and slather it on your whole body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t want to have to drive an hour to the nearest Walmart to get this.</li>
            <li>It cleans good and is big enough to last a while.</li>
            <li>I still use conditioner on my daughters hair because our hair is really hard to brush without it no matter what kind of 2 in 1 we use</li>
            <li>The soap is nice and thick and has lasted the kids for sometime now.  </li>
            <li>My little one likes this product but says it isn&#x27;t tear free.  </li>
            <li>I use this product with my 3 year old son.</li>
            <li>Yes, I&#x27;m a cheap, lazy twenty-something woman.</li>

            <li> This product works fine. My 5-year-old daughter can use it when showering or bathing herself with no problems. Does not make her eyes hurt.</li>
            <li> I have two little ones at home that get very dirty playing out in the yard.  This soap does a great job getting them nice and clean.  The soap is nice and thick and has lasted the kids for sometime now.  Great product. Great price.</li>

            <li> This shampoo leaves my daughters hair dried out feeling so we have stopped using it after only a few times. Now I have this big bottle we are going to throw away, or perhaps use as body wash only. I am going to go back to using the Smoothers type of suave kids shampoo, it has much better end results.&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, this should not be considered a &amp;#34;3in1&amp;#34;, as it doesn&#x27;t condition.</li>
            <li> This is a good product it does all 3 it also smells good.  I still use conditioner on my daughters hair because our hair is really hard to brush without it no matter what kind of 2 in 1 we use but, it&#x27;s great on my sons shorter hair great product!</li>

            <li> Great purchase through subscribe and save, but did leak a bit during shipping.  Amazon would surely replace it, but it did not leak enough to warrant a phone call.</li>
            <li> This is a great all-in-one for kids.  They can use it for everything: shampoo, conditioner, &amp; body wash.  I buy it via Subscribe &amp; Save and it ends up being about the same price that I can buy it in the store PLUS it comes straight to my door!  I love it!</li>
            <li> Smells good, love that the boys can use it on their body as well as their hair, makes it easy for them and for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also makes the hair super soft(my son has girls ask him what he uses because his hair is always so soft and shinny!)</li>
            <li> Smells good and easy to use, I love not having three separate bottles in the tub for my little one.</li>
            <li> This is a great size and smells great.  I love that this is 3 in 1 so I can expedite shower time with my kids!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this shampoo it smells nice and its nice to have the 3 in 1 she can use it for everything while in the bath.</li>
            <li> It is inexpensive, smells great, and is tear free. We love this shampoo.i recommend it for anyone who has children.</li>
            <li> I would like to know where to see the expiry of this product !! Thank you ! Please help me</li>
            <li> this is a nice size and great price for how much soap you get, it smells nice and doesn&#x27;t make hair dried out or frizzy.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son so that he only had to fool with one bottle in the shower.  He would have just washed himself with shampoo otherwise.  (Haha.)  He really loves the scent and it gets him clean and fresh from head to toe.  We will definitely keep buying this.</li>
            <li> My kids love this product.  They like the different smells it comes in.  It&#x27;s 3 in 1, cant beat that products price :)</li>
            <li> I choose 5 stars because its a low cost for a great product! I now smell like a smurf berry. I prefer to be lazy when showering and 3-in-1 lets me be lazy. It left my hair with a conditioner feel to it and It made me smell like a smurf berry!</li>
            <li> It was a great price and I like that it was a 3-1. when bath time comes around whatever makes it easier I am for it</li>
            <li> My little one likes this product but says it isn&#x27;t tear free.  They experienced a dry/uncomfortable feeling.  I would still buy it again.</li>
            <li> The kids love it because it&#x27;s easy - one product for their hair and body - Just lather up the sponge and slather it on your whole body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We as parents love it because it&#x27;s just easier. The only possible drawback is the larger container for smaller children is a bit more difficult to manipulate, but we solved that by having a separate soap dispenser - so all is well in the shower now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We wish Amazon would bring back Subscribe and save though.</li>
            <li> My son loves the bubbles and I love the smell of it, its really a great buy. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed that it conditions any better than just the straight up baby shampoo that we used to use for my daughter.  It smells fine though, and does the job, and works as bubble bath too.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, I wish it was still offered through the subscription program. I really don&#x27;t want to have to drive an hour to the nearest Walmart to get this.</li>
            <li> We LOVE this 3 in 1 for our 3 kids.  Shower days are always a pain, but this helps speeds up the process and make it easier to tolerate with both the parents and the kids.  They love the fruity smells, and we love that we only need one bottle to clean and condition their skin AND Hair!</li>
            <li> There are not too many companies that make kid friendly shampoo and body wash. Actually, I don&#x27;t know any others. I have been  using all the different varieties of suave for years and love them. My kids love the smells and fun bottles and tear free shampoo. I love that it&#x27;s one product for everything- no clutter in the shower.</li>
            <li> It is too dry ( hair and body ) after  wash, for travel is ok but not for everyday use, smell good</li>
            <li> Nice, mild shampoo and body wash. Great for babies or adults. I prefer this scent over Johnson and Johnson&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grandson in WI and from what mommy says he loves it and she loves the smell! I will be purchasing some more as long as the price stays at an economical price. Thank you suave for giving a 3 in 1 for kids that actually is scented like it states!</li>
            <li> Yes, I&#x27;m a cheap, lazy twenty-something woman. I like smelling like berries and I like only having one bottle in my shower. This works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I use this product with my 3 year old son. It smells great, is gentle on his fair skin, and is tear free. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this so give to a mother with little ones. It worked just fine and the kids like getting hair washed.</li>
            <li> Our kids like to play in the bath . . . scrubbing clean, not so much. We originally received this soap as a gift from Grandma. Our kids love it! It inspires them to foam themselves up and scrub clean, which I love. The cherry on top is how nice the bathroom smells when they are done.</li>
            <li> I love the Suave line of products for kids.  My kids love it, and it does the job.  With several different smells, you can add variety to the kids bath time.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to sting their eyes.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend for kids of all ages.</li>
            <li> The kids don&#x27;t mind the shampoo and it doesn&#x27;t bother their eyes.</li>
            <li> My kids love this for body wash...but it is no longer offered on subscribe and save, so we no longer order it.  I will have to find it in stores.</li>
