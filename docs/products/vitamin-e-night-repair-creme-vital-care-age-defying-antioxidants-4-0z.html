            <li>but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>No offense to those who love the product.</li>
            <li>Most lotions I cannot use because they feel greasy.</li>
            <li>Best effects are when you commit and do a regular routine nightly of applying.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied how moisturizing and hydrating my skin feels after this.</li>
            <li>I have to admit, I have been using a nightly moisturizer for about 25 years, and I mainly go by cost (I&#x27;m proudly frugal).  </li>
            <li>I love this cream, I bought this my skin Refreshing and renewal, I am happy and satisfied the product , and good product, with complete package for me, and really works for me, recommended to all .</li>
            <li>I just received my new Vit E cream and it is great for moisturizing at night.</li>
            <li>Great product thus far.</li>
            <li>I got this as a gift for a friend, and as far as I can tell and have been told it&#x27;s working great.</li>
            <li>No one wants to be 60 with a gorgeous face and a turkey neck.</li>
            <li>easy and great results so far on my skin.</li>
            <li>The cream has a normal, almost pleasant smell to it.</li>
            <li>Great night cream; does help fine lines and to keep my face soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>This one is kind to the skin and really makes your skin tighter and more radiant.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easy, not too greasy.  </li>
            <li>I noticed my whiteheads and blackheads can easily removed just rubbing my face with my fingers,</li>
            <li>The labeling is easy to read nothing fancy to its look.</li>
            <li>To me it is the way too strong.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just hoping in time it will start showing results over my fine lines,</li>
            <li>This cream also helps to protect against elements and fights wrinkles and fine lines.</li>
            <li>It does make my skin softer when I put it on, but it hasn&#x27;t reduced any fine lines.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and leaves face feeling smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li>This is a very good product to use at night before bed - I am partial to any products containing Vitamin E.  </li>
            <li>The fact that it&#x27;s not tested on animals is always a huge plus for me too.</li>
            <li>so I thought she would enjoy it as well.</li>
            <li>Later she told me she had used it before and was happy with it and is glad I got for here and really likes it and is pleased with its results.</li>
            <li>but I would say that it&#x27;s more worth.</li>
            <li>i got this productin a discounted price , for product testing, it fit in my expectation</li>
            <li>a plus.&lt;br /&gt;The cream applies smoothly and the smell is normal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I enjoy writing reviews and put a lot of effort into how I feel about the products.</li>
            <li>I think it is important as consumers to make a well informed decision before purchasing a product.</li>
            <li>Not overpowering, just light and airy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product has done a fantastic job in moisturizing my skin.</li>
            <li>It’s cheap</li>
            <li>it’s cheap.</li>
            <li>I was given this product free to review.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it every day after cleaning my face right before bed, and I&#x27;ve noticed how my eyes look a bit more rested in the morning</li>
            <li>It really does not leave your skin greasy feeling!!!</li>
            <li>one has a very mild scent that I do not have any issue of, most of the evening moisturizers that I tried are very concentrated and strong.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes they would end up making my skin prone to acne, considering that I already have an oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I can say I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to many products because strong scents can trigger a migraine, so the very light scent was definitely a positive.  </li>
            <li>Wow did this work amazing well for this area.  </li>
            <li>I really was not to sure if she would pleased as she is very picky with here choices.</li>
            <li>I will absolutely recommend this product to every ladies who wants to have a nice looking skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m lucky because you let me review this product...</li>
            <li>Ever since we first received it, I constantly hear her talking about how much of a good job it is doing.</li>
            <li>got here almost right away, the size of the pot seems more than generous and when it comes to use a bit goes a long way, so thats for sure</li>
            <li>After 3days of using my face is more soft n supple.</li>
            <li>definitely worth purchasing.</li>
            <li>and I ordered it right away, and</li>
            <li>After using this product, though, I would gladly pay full price for it in the future.</li>
            <li>This product is ideal for someone with dry or moderate skin.</li>
            <li>those are where women of a certain age really get hit, and this is so worth it!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>and i love the results the next day.</li>
            <li>but my feet in the morning just felt soft and smooth,</li>
            <li>We received this and were amazed after the first night.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great size at 4oz that will last you a long time.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant scent that is not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The shipping was acceptable, the product is really large, much larger than most night creams I have come across.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;You don&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy when you put it on, and it&#x27;s absorbed and nice by morning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and avoided using it on the areas right beside my nose, but I think it is light enough that I will use it all over my face before bed tonight.  </li>
            <li>, u use this everyday, all night before i sleep, it makes my face smooth and very clean</li>
            <li>It has a very lovely scent that is not strong or overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I apply it usually on a clean face right before bed or even in the mornings when I know I&#x27;ll have a long day as moisturizer.</li>
            <li>and this cream helped so much.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see much change on my face</li>
            <li>The sense of scent may be very personal but to me it smells cheap.</li>
            <li>I have really oily skin on my face.</li>
            <li>I absolutely would recommend it.</li>
            <li>This goes for any product really.</li>
            <li>I give real reviews and it does not effect my opinion on a product.</li>
            <li>I heard that using an anti-age product early on will help so much in the future, so I was very excited to try this product.</li>
            <li>The crème goes on smoothly and not greasy, left my face very soft and no residue or greasy feeling afterwards!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other lotions and creams and find that they seem to sink into my socks more than my skin.  </li>
            <li>but so do many other brands of product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually more on the higher end of face products when it comes to everyday use</li>
            <li>As far as wrinkles and fine lines, I think consistency is the key to it, I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month now</li>
            <li>The only problem I had was due to my own carelessness.  </li>
            <li>When it comes to eye creams, theres a million options in the market, I honestly don&#x27;t splurge on super expensive creams, so when I got offered the product to try in exchange of a review I didn&#x27;t think twice.</li>
            <li>My current skin regimen right now is this line of skin</li>
            <li>I must say when I first ordered this item I was a bit reluctant, a night cream for such a low price is not what would catch my eye down the alley of this kind of products.</li>
            <li>and now I can finally say that i&#x27;m starting to notice a bit of reduction in the fine lines of my eyes.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t wait to try it and it has made my skin so soft!</li>
            <li>I have used many night cremes in the past and all of them are greasy.  </li>
            <li>of results, I can&#x27;t really say I&#x27;ve noticed any big difference in my fine lines, but then it&#x27;s also been such short time.</li>
            <li>I completely agree.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>Will definitely continue to use until I go through the whole pot</li>
            <li>My skin always feels soft and silky after applying this product.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling soft but with a greasy feel.  </li>
            <li>I really like this night cream enough to recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>If they completely go away, I will return for an update.</li>
            <li>You’ll love this crème for a few different reasons.</li>
            <li>The lotion itself is very light weight and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, just wash face as usual and apply to face and neck.</li>
            <li>This is a thicker cream that initially wanted to use on my neck area but found it just very thick and took a bit more working in that I was willing to do.</li>
            <li>And on the very positive side, I haven&#x27;t seen any breakouts due to the application of this product on my face and for that alone, I give it all the stars I did.</li>
            <li>It has a faint sweet smell to it that I enjoy as well.</li>
            <li>I live in a very dry climate and this cream felt very revitalizing when I put it on my face.</li>
            <li>I have only used this product for a few days, but I really enjoy it.  </li>
            <li>The order not only came early, but the product went a bit beyond my expectations.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very hydrating for your skin, especially mine as a sufferer of dry skin and eczema.  </li>
            <li>This product has made it much softer and smoother, and while there haven’t been instant results, I do think the dark sun spots I’ve developed have started to lighten up.</li>
            <li>This tube is huge; it will probably last for at least six months.</li>
            <li>My fave actually almost instantly feels hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li>It is a thick cream and seemed to absorb quickly.</li>
            <li>My skin is combination type, so my T zone usually gets pretty oily throughout the day, so I usually use just right amount to get what I need from it</li>
            <li>I am suffering with a little of age problems but using this at nighttime worked very well for me.</li>

            <li> Later she told me she had used it before and was happy with it and is glad I got for here and really likes it and is pleased with its results.</li>
            <li> but I would say that it&#x27;s more worth.</li>
            <li> i got this productin a discounted price , for product testing, it fit in my expectation</li>
            <li> a plus.&lt;br /&gt;The cream applies smoothly and the smell is normal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I enjoy writing reviews and put a lot of effort into how I feel about the products.</li>
            <li> I think it is important as consumers to make a well informed decision before purchasing a product.</li>
            <li> Not overpowering, just light and airy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product has done a fantastic job in moisturizing my skin.</li>
            <li> It’s cheap</li>
            <li> it’s cheap.</li>
            <li> I was given this product free to review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it every day after cleaning my face right before bed, and I&#x27;ve noticed how my eyes look a bit more rested in the morning</li>
            <li> It really does not leave your skin greasy feeling!!!</li>
            <li> one has a very mild scent that I do not have any issue of, most of the evening moisturizers that I tried are very concentrated and strong.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes they would end up making my skin prone to acne, considering that I already have an oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I can say I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to many products because strong scents can trigger a migraine, so the very light scent was definitely a positive.  </li>
            <li> Wow did this work amazing well for this area.  </li>
            <li> I really was not to sure if she would pleased as she is very picky with here choices.</li>
            <li> I will absolutely recommend this product to every ladies who wants to have a nice looking skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m lucky because you let me review this product...</li>
            <li> Ever since we first received it, I constantly hear her talking about how much of a good job it is doing.</li>
            <li> got here almost right away, the size of the pot seems more than generous and when it comes to use a bit goes a long way, so thats for sure</li>
            <li> After 3days of using my face is more soft n supple.</li>
            <li> definitely worth purchasing.</li>
            <li> and I ordered it right away, and</li>
            <li> After using this product, though, I would gladly pay full price for it in the future.</li>
            <li> This product is ideal for someone with dry or moderate skin.</li>
            <li> those are where women of a certain age really get hit, and this is so worth it!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> and i love the results the next day.</li>
            <li> but my feet in the morning just felt soft and smooth,</li>
            <li> We received this and were amazed after the first night.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great size at 4oz that will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant scent that is not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The shipping was acceptable, the product is really large, much larger than most night creams I have come across.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;You don&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy when you put it on, and it&#x27;s absorbed and nice by morning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and avoided using it on the areas right beside my nose, but I think it is light enough that I will use it all over my face before bed tonight.  </li>
            <li> , u use this everyday, all night before i sleep, it makes my face smooth and very clean</li>
            <li> It has a very lovely scent that is not strong or overpowering.  </li>
            <li> I apply it usually on a clean face right before bed or even in the mornings when I know I&#x27;ll have a long day as moisturizer.</li>
            <li> and this cream helped so much.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see much change on my face</li>
            <li> The sense of scent may be very personal but to me it smells cheap.</li>
            <li> I have really oily skin on my face.</li>
            <li> I absolutely would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This goes for any product really.</li>
            <li> I give real reviews and it does not effect my opinion on a product.</li>
            <li> I heard that using an anti-age product early on will help so much in the future, so I was very excited to try this product.</li>
            <li> The crème goes on smoothly and not greasy, left my face very soft and no residue or greasy feeling afterwards!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other lotions and creams and find that they seem to sink into my socks more than my skin.  </li>
            <li> but so do many other brands of product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually more on the higher end of face products when it comes to everyday use</li>
            <li> As far as wrinkles and fine lines, I think consistency is the key to it, I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month now</li>
            <li> The only problem I had was due to my own carelessness.  </li>
            <li> When it comes to eye creams, theres a million options in the market, I honestly don&#x27;t splurge on super expensive creams, so when I got offered the product to try in exchange of a review I didn&#x27;t think twice.</li>
            <li> My current skin regimen right now is this line of skin</li>
            <li> I must say when I first ordered this item I was a bit reluctant, a night cream for such a low price is not what would catch my eye down the alley of this kind of products.</li>
            <li> and now I can finally say that i&#x27;m starting to notice a bit of reduction in the fine lines of my eyes.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t wait to try it and it has made my skin so soft!</li>
            <li> I have used many night cremes in the past and all of them are greasy.  </li>
            <li> of results, I can&#x27;t really say I&#x27;ve noticed any big difference in my fine lines, but then it&#x27;s also been such short time.</li>
            <li> I completely agree.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> Will definitely continue to use until I go through the whole pot</li>
            <li> My skin always feels soft and silky after applying this product.  </li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling soft but with a greasy feel.  </li>
            <li> I really like this night cream enough to recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> If they completely go away, I will return for an update.</li>
            <li> You’ll love this crème for a few different reasons.</li>
            <li> The lotion itself is very light weight and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, just wash face as usual and apply to face and neck.</li>
            <li> This is a thicker cream that initially wanted to use on my neck area but found it just very thick and took a bit more working in that I was willing to do.</li>
            <li> And on the very positive side, I haven&#x27;t seen any breakouts due to the application of this product on my face and for that alone, I give it all the stars I did.</li>
            <li> It has a faint sweet smell to it that I enjoy as well.</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate and this cream felt very revitalizing when I put it on my face.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for a few days, but I really enjoy it.  </li>
            <li> The order not only came early, but the product went a bit beyond my expectations.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hydrating for your skin, especially mine as a sufferer of dry skin and eczema.  </li>
            <li> This product has made it much softer and smoother, and while there haven’t been instant results, I do think the dark sun spots I’ve developed have started to lighten up.</li>
            <li> This tube is huge; it will probably last for at least six months.</li>
            <li> My fave actually almost instantly feels hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li> It is a thick cream and seemed to absorb quickly.</li>
            <li> My skin is combination type, so my T zone usually gets pretty oily throughout the day, so I usually use just right amount to get what I need from it</li>
            <li> I am suffering with a little of age problems but using this at nighttime worked very well for me.</li>
            <li> have the daily vitamin e moisturizer which I use everyday in the morning, and it gives me a very soft and moisturized skin.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t use a lot so it can really last a long time.  </li>
            <li> However, every person is different and although it did not workout for me, I do recommend this product for a person with dry skin.</li>
            <li> so far half my wrinkles have faded away</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this works, but is has a gentle aroma that is not offensive in the least.</li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Because to her she said she could actually feel the difference just a few days later in the way her face felt when feeling it or just overall how it felt refreshed compared before.</li>
            <li> and I definitely recommend it, the jar is very big and a little goes</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak for the anti-aging aspect of it due to the fact we haven&#x27;t had enough time to notice any defined changes.  </li>
            <li> I can definitely say that this little container will last me a very long time, even though I use it almost every night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having lots of breakouts after my pregnancy and my skin is also so dry</li>
            <li> I have very dry and sensitive skin, usually face products like this leave an unwelcome burning sensation, but this did not!</li>
            <li> I have only been using for a few days.</li>
            <li> I received it with the seal broke and a dead bug in it, very gross, I am returning</li>
            <li> My eye make up and foundation seem to apply and appear smoother and blend easier, less blotching from the dry skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bottle is like any other bottle you would get of cream.</li>
            <li> It helps with the hereditary dark eye circles that seem to run rampant in my family.  </li>
            <li> There is a slight fragrance to this cream but not overbearing.</li>
            <li> However i have seen a slight notice in wrinkle remover but nothing drastically yet.</li>
            <li> I started working out a lot in the outdoors a few years ago, and the wind, cold and sun has really taken its toll on my skin.</li>
            <li> Not sure I&#x27;d want to buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why I tried it on my feet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure way</li>
            <li> Is too hard for my skin</li>
            <li> Even though the product is thick, its doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling on your skin at all.  </li>
            <li> It is very thick and creamy and cooling feeling when you apply it to your face.</li>
            <li> After moving to the desert I was in desperate need of a solution to moisturizing my face that didn&#x27;t include laying on 12 layers of lotion all day and clogging my pores up.  </li>
            <li> but it turned out a bit disappointing.</li>

            <li> This is now my favorite product on Amazon.  I just put it on before bed and then go to sleep.  I have used many night cremes in the past and all of them are greasy.  This one is kind to the skin and really makes your skin tighter and more radiant.  Oh.  non-greasy also.</li>

            <li> Thank you key brands..&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m lucky because you let me review this product... God bless</li>
            <li> I must say when I first ordered this item I was a bit reluctant, a night cream for such a low price is not what would catch my eye down the alley of this kind of products.I&#x27;m usually more on the higher end of face products when it comes to everyday use but I have been using it now for almost two weeks, and I can say I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with it.&lt;br /&gt;I got here almost right away, the size of the pot seems more than generous and when it comes to use a bit goes a long way, so thats for sure a plus.&lt;br /&gt;The cream applies smoothly and the smell is normal.&lt;br /&gt;As of results, I can&#x27;t really say I&#x27;ve noticed any big difference in my fine lines, but then it&#x27;s also been such short time. I&#x27;ve been using it every day after cleaning my face right before bed, and I&#x27;ve noticed how my eyes look a bit more rested in the morning and my face too. I&#x27;m just hoping in time it will start showing results over my fine lines, but for now, I think I&#x27;m satisfied. Will definitely continue to use until I go through the whole pot and maybe then I&#x27;ll review again. :)</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for a few days, but I really enjoy it.  It goes on easy, not too greasy.  It absorbs quickly and leaves face feeling smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin E Night Repair is so refreshing &amp; light &amp; smells so good - I could almost eat it!  It made me hungry for whipped cream. It is perfect for going to bed in these hot summer nights. My face felt so good going to bed &amp; waking up in the morning.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate or make my eyes water. I love It!  I did receive this at a reduced price for an honest opinion. Honestly, you will love it! Thank You!</li>
            <li> Pleasant scent. Easy to use, just wash face as usual and apply to face and neck. Not greasy at all. The fact that it&#x27;s not tested on animals is always a huge plus for me too. A+</li>
            <li> I purchased this Vitamin E Night Repair cr&amp;egrave;me with my mother and grandmother in mind.  They are big fans of Vitamin E products.  It helps with the hereditary dark eye circles that seem to run rampant in my family.  This is a 4 oz. jar of Vitamin E Night Repair Cr&amp;egrave;me.  You don&#x27;t use a lot so it can really last a long time.  Even though the product is thick, its doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling on your skin at all.  It&#x27;s very hydrating for your skin, especially mine as a sufferer of dry skin and eczema.  It has a very lovely scent that is not strong or overpowering.  My skin always feels soft and silky after applying this product.  I am definitely keeping this part of my night time beauty regimen.  I look forward to seeing how this product works on my skin in the winter months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have received a discount on this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  I enjoy writing reviews and put a lot of effort into how I feel about the products. I think it is important as consumers to make a well informed decision before purchasing a product.</li>
            <li> Great night cream; does help fine lines and to keep my face soft and moisturized. Very pleased!!</li>
            <li> This Vitamin E Night Repair Cream combines ideally with the Vital Care Vitamin E Day Cream!  We purchased the night cream in a promotion for testing and review.  The cream is non-greasy formula and absorbs into your skin quickly, especially beneficial before bedtime, as there is no greasy residue.  This cream also helps to protect against elements and fights wrinkles and fine lines.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling soft but with a greasy feel.  Not sure I&#x27;d want to buy it again.</li>
            <li> Is too hard for my skin</li>
            <li> After moving to the desert I was in desperate need of a solution to moisturizing my face that didn&#x27;t include laying on 12 layers of lotion all day and clogging my pores up.  I found this while researching and was offered a discount in exchange for testing the product and reviewing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was acceptable, the product is really large, much larger than most night creams I have come across.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been testing the product at night before  bed because I feel like that is when my skin has the best opportunity to absorb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some things I noticed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely feel my skin is softer, no doubt about it.  My eye make up and foundation seem to apply and appear smoother and blend easier, less blotching from the dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is nice. Not overpowering, just light and airy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy when you put it on, and it&#x27;s absorbed and nice by morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendations: Do NOT forget to apply this to your neck area as well as your face.  No one wants to be 60 with a gorgeous face and a turkey neck.</li>
            <li> I just received this two nights ago, and absolutely love it! The crème goes on smoothly and not greasy, left my face very soft and no residue or greasy feeling afterwards! I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> My current skin regimen right now is this line of skin care.&lt;br /&gt;I have the daily vitamin e moisturizer which I use everyday in the morning, and it gives me a very soft and moisturized skin.&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer is my night time fix, it works as great as the morning moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;This one has a very mild scent that I do not have any issue of, most of the evening moisturizers that I tried are very concentrated and strong.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes they would end up making my skin prone to acne, considering that I already have an oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;But since using this moisturizer, I never had any issues of massive breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;I would always wake up with amazingly smoother and softer skin.&lt;br /&gt;I feel like I always had a goodnight sleep, as my skin is supple and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;I love it and I definitely recommend it, the jar is very big and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this using a promo code for testing.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream to my mum because she was looking for a good solution for his wrinkles. After try it, I have to say that now she looks really better and I can confirm that this product works. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> easy and great results so far on my skin. I am suffering with a little of age problems but using this at nighttime worked very well for me. I just put it on and sleep and wake up with rejuvenated skin!</li>
            <li> I just received my new Vit E cream and it is great for moisturizing at night. There is a slight fragrance to this cream but not overbearing. I live in a very dry climate and this cream felt very revitalizing when I put it on my face. It is a thick cream and seemed to absorb quickly. there is no greasy felling after you put it on and seemed to last all night. I saw a discount code for this and I ordered it right away, and I really like this night cream enough to recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> This night cream is amazing . I put it on every night and i love the results the next day. Makes my skin so hydrated and smooth and its amazing. I&#x27;ve been having lots of breakouts after my pregnancy and my skin is also so dry and this cream helped so much. Ive been in search of a night cream that actually works and i found it.&lt;br /&gt;i received a discount on this product in exchange for an unbiased review</li>
            <li> I received this product in exchange for my honest review. This product is ideal for someone with dry or moderate skin. However, with my oily/combo skin, this product worsened my condition. I do not recommend this for people with oily skin. However, every person is different and although it did not workout for me, I do recommend this product for a person with dry skin.</li>
            <li> It does make my skin softer when I put it on, but it hasn&#x27;t reduced any fine lines. Unsure if I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> This is a thicker cream that initially wanted to use on my neck area but found it just very thick and took a bit more working in that I was willing to do. I&#x27;m not sure why I tried it on my feet but I worked it in and put socks on for the night. Wow did this work amazing well for this area.  I&#x27;ve tried other lotions and creams and find that they seem to sink into my socks more than my skin.  I&#x27;m not sure way this worked so well but my feet in the morning just felt soft and smooth, a welcome change in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;I had a coupon code that reduced the cost for me but this review is based on my personal experience.  I may not have used the product as intended but I fond that it worked well for me as a foot cream.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I have been using a nightly moisturizer for about 25 years, and I mainly go by cost (I&#x27;m proudly frugal).  We received this and were amazed after the first night.  Both my husband &amp; I used it, and have been using it nightly for over a week.  Both of us have noticed a difference in our skin when we get up in the morning.  I can&#x27;t speak for the anti-aging aspect of it due to the fact we haven&#x27;t had enough time to notice any defined changes.  We will further our review after 1 month.  Great product thus far.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this works, but is has a gentle aroma that is not offensive in the least. And on the very positive side, I haven&#x27;t seen any breakouts due to the application of this product on my face and for that alone, I give it all the stars I did.</li>
            <li> i bought it based on all the good reviews here but it turned out a bit disappointing. The cream feels good on the face but so do many other brands of product. I don&#x27;t see much change on my face but it&#x27;s ok.The best thing about this product may be the good price. But I can&#x27;t stand the scent. To me it is the way too strong. The sense of scent may be very personal but to me it smells cheap. No offense to those who love the product. Anyway I will go through this jar and won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for a friend, and as far as I can tell and have been told it&#x27;s working great. She says she enjoys the antioxidant part and especially the moisturizing effect. Because to her she said she could actually feel the difference just a few days later in the way her face felt when feeling it or just overall how it felt refreshed compared before. She definitely recommends it and is looking to get another or two shortly.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product to use at night before bed - I am partial to any products containing Vitamin E.  I used it last night and woke up this morning to a face that felt moisturized, but not oily. I have combination skin and avoided using it on the areas right beside my nose, but I think it is light enough that I will use it all over my face before bed tonight.  It has a pleasant scent that is not overwhelming.  I am sensitive to many products because strong scents can trigger a migraine, so the very light scent was definitely a positive.  The only problem I had was due to my own carelessness.  It states on the jar to avoid contact with your eyes.  I put the product on my eyelids and ended up with some of the crème in my eyes after rubbing them.  Trust me - avoid the eye area because it does burn if it gets in your eyes.  I also like that it is not tested on animals.  I received a discount on this product for writing an honest and non-biased review.  After using this product, though, I would gladly pay full price for it in the future.</li>
            <li> This product has done a fantastic job in moisturizing my skin. However i have seen a slight notice in wrinkle remover but nothing drastically yet. I have only been using for a few days. I expect the results to be in my favor.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at a great discounted price to review it. I have really oily skin on my face. Most lotions I cannot use because they feel greasy. However, that is not the case with this lotion. It is very thick and creamy and cooling feeling when you apply it to your face. I woke up this morning with my face feeling refreshed and not one blemish. I would definitely buy this product again! And I will once this jar is gone. It also has a very light pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> I received it with the seal broke and a dead bug in it, very gross, I am returning</li>
            <li> I heard that using an anti-age product early on will help so much in the future, so I was very excited to try this product. I have very dry and sensitive skin, usually face products like this leave an unwelcome burning sensation, but this did not! My fave actually almost instantly feels hydrated and soft. The lotion itself is very light weight and a little goes a long way. I can definitely say that this little container will last me a very long time, even though I use it almost every night. I would definitely recommend this to my friends and family!</li>
            <li> I absolutely would recommend it. The order not only came early, but the product went a bit beyond my expectations. When it comes to eye creams, theres a million options in the market, I honestly don&#x27;t splurge on super expensive creams, so when I got offered the product to try in exchange of a review I didn&#x27;t think twice. The cream has a normal, almost pleasant smell to it. I apply it usually on a clean face right before bed or even in the mornings when I know I&#x27;ll have a long day as moisturizer. My skin is combination type, so my T zone usually gets pretty oily throughout the day, so I usually use just right amount to get what I need from it, Ive actually noticed it doesn&#x27;t increase the oiliness at all and just my eyes from getting saggy. As far as wrinkles and fine lines, I think consistency is the key to it, I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month now and now I can finally say that i&#x27;m starting to notice a bit of reduction in the fine lines of my eyes. Doesn&#x27;t do a miracle! but works over time.</li>
            <li> You’ll love this crème for a few different reasons. It’s cheap, it’s effective, it smells good … it’s cheap. I started working out a lot in the outdoors a few years ago, and the wind, cold and sun has really taken its toll on my skin. This product has made it much softer and smoother, and while there haven’t been instant results, I do think the dark sun spots I’ve developed have started to lighten up. If they completely go away, I will return for an update. Until then, I’ll just keep using it. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I received this early than expected delivery date. After 3days of using my face is more soft n supple. I noticed my whiteheads and blackheads can easily removed just rubbing my face with my fingers, amazing!</li>
            <li> I love this cream, I bought this my skin Refreshing and renewal, I am happy and satisfied the product , and good product, with complete package for me, and really works for me, recommended to all .</li>
            <li> a lovely night cream that feels very nice and I use it everywhere! my face , my cleavage and my neck. those are where women of a certain age really get hit, and this is so worth it!</li>
            <li> This product rejuvenates, restores,, moisturizes and brightens your skin. The bottle is like any other bottle you would get of cream. The labeling is easy to read nothing fancy to its look. The purpose of the product is to minimize the effects of aging. Packed with vitamin E and mangosteen. It is non-greasy and softens and conditions your skin. It really does not leave your skin greasy feeling!!! To use just apply at night to moisturize soften and rejuvenate. The product is not tested on animals. I love that about any product! Another thing I liked seeing on this product is it asks you to please recycle. The product is made in the USA. It&#x27;s a great size at 4oz that will last you a long time. Best effects are when you commit and do a regular routine nightly of applying. This goes for any product really. You need to continue using it to see effects from it. It has a faint sweet smell to it that I enjoy as well. I was given this product free to review. I give real reviews and it does not effect my opinion on a product.</li>
            <li> I always vary the moisturizers I use at night so this one came handy because I was able to get it at discounted price. However, it doesn&#x27;t affect my opinion of the product. This tube is huge; it will probably last for at least six months. I am satisfied how moisturizing and hydrating my skin feels after this. definitely worth purchasing. It delivers all the nutrient y skin needs. I will definitely consider repurchasing it.</li>
            <li> I use this before bed and drink a big glass of water and a skin health supplement and so far half my wrinkles have faded away</li>
