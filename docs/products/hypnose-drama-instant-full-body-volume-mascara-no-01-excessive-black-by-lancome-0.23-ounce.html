            <li>great mascara</li>

            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Amazing mascara.  </li>
            <li>I am very thankful that a friend of mine recommended it because it is the best mascara I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I have used so many Mascaras and this is a good one.</li>
            <li>comes off easily with mascara remover...good product!</li>
            <li>I recomend to use the primer for better results</li>
            <li>Like magic :)</li>
            <li>This is it &amp; to make things even better Amazon sells it for about 30 to 40% off.</li>
            <li>love it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li>I was very excited to get a mascara that was upscale and would make my lashes thicker and would not clump.  </li>
            <li>I am a fashioniesta who writes for product design for super trendy online store.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then after becoming a mother and staying home with the kids, I had to cut out my pricey make-up and resort to drug-store brands.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smells cheap.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I did not buy Hypnose Drama but received it as a free sample.</li>
            <li>All you need is two layers, really, and you get a nice effect.  </li>
            <li>As a makeup artist and hairstylist I love it because it helps me create the curve to the lashes that is uplifting for the eye.this is not for the natural look, but for someone who loves the look of lash extensions, but doesn&#x27;t want to damage their own lashes.</li>
            <li>After searching for years for a good mascara I came across this recently as part of a free gift with purchase.</li>
            <li>With careprost (same Exact thing as latisse but at a fraction of the cost) and viviscal added to your regimen, this mascara will give you the look of lash extensions, but with your own lashes!</li>
            <li>I tried Definicils High Definition first, and I could not believe how clumpy the mascara is, even after wiping most of it from the brush.</li>
            <li>Really creates a lovely thick lash and what I love most is that it doesn&#x27;t break off and crumble in my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to products and my eyes are just fine with this product.</li>
            <li>I chose to sample this mascara over Definicils High Definition, hoping it would be better, but it is exactly the same.</li>
            <li>most of the drug store brands), the absolute best is Jordana, which you can find at Walgreens for approximately $3.00, usually less.</li>
            <li>This product gives me big, full, long eyelashes, and its a nice brush.  </li>
            <li>I have tried numerous mascaras over the past 15 years, and this is by far the best!</li>
            <li>My lashes grow straight out, so they are not noticeable.  </li>
            <li>After using this for a week or two, it started to dry out super quickly.</li>
            <li>It clumps more than any other mascara I have tried.</li>
            <li>A couple of coats makes my lashes super long and voluminous.</li>
            <li>I ordered something else and will throw this away when my new mascara comes in.</li>
            <li>Maybe I just picked the wrong Lancôme Mascara and there are better ones available.</li>
            <li>First, the whole thing about buying makeup from Amazon is going to be dry and faded is a rumor.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your time on this.</li>
            <li>It prompted me to compare the tube to my old (legit) one that it was supposed to replace.</li>
            <li>I cannot believe how inexpensive this mascara is, especially since it is of a much higher quality than any other I have used.</li>
            <li>Layer on multiple coats for an even more dramatic effect.</li>
            <li>I have tried both Hypnose Drama and Definicils High Definition mascara from Lancome, and trust me, both are a COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t put too much on, because it will sometimes flake and leave little polka dots on your cheeks.</li>

            <li> its long lasting, lengthen, &amp; simple to apply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Lancome Definicils fan for as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> I typically can use a tube of Hypnose Drama for a few weeks or even a couple of months before it dries out, so I was quite surprised.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey,but lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I like all Lancome mascara, but Hypnose Drama blows the other formulas out of the water.</li>

            <li> A few strokes of the wand, and it looks like you have layers on!  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I´ve been using this mascara for years and I think I won´t change it never. I recomend to use the primer for better results</li>
            <li> THIS WAS BEYOND MY EXPECTETION.I AM A FAN OF LANCOME MASCARA&#x27;S BUT THIS ONE,I HAD NOT TRIED TILL NOW.IT IS THE BEST ONE I EVER USED!I AM 100% SATISFIED!!GREAT,CURLY EYELASHES.LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I like all Lancome mascara, but Hypnose Drama blows the other formulas out of the water. This stuff is awesome. The slightly curved applicator wand fans your lashes outward and also gives them a glamourous curl. My eyes look bigger and sexier after using this. Layer on multiple coats for an even more dramatic effect. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> The curved brush is something you either love or hate. As a makeup artist and hairstylist I love it because it helps me create the curve to the lashes that is uplifting for the eye.this is not for the natural look, but for someone who loves the look of lash extensions, but doesn&#x27;t want to damage their own lashes. With careprost (same Exact thing as latisse but at a fraction of the cost) and viviscal added to your regimen, this mascara will give you the look of lash extensions, but with your own lashes! Like magic :)</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time on this. The mascara over-coats the brush. I had to wipe it off the excess with a tissue. I ordered something else and will throw this away when my new mascara comes in. It&#x27;s smells cheap. I can&#x27;t believe Lancome made such a product.</li>
            <li> I bought this mascara because I had a sample that I loved.  The full tube was a disappointment in that the mascara clumps and flakes.  It does however lengthen and define the lashes as indicated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Lancome Definicils fan for as long as I can remember.  Then after becoming a mother and staying home with the kids, I had to cut out my pricey make-up and resort to drug-store brands.  I recently splurged and bought this Hypnose Drama and will never skimp again in mascara.  It&#x27;s THAT good.</li>
            <li> great mascara and it does help to pump up those lashes..does not clump or rub off while wearing. comes off easily with mascara remover...good product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to purchase any other mascara after using this.  I think I&#x27;m on my 3rd order now.  Really creates a lovely thick lash and what I love most is that it doesn&#x27;t break off and crumble in my eyes.  I am very sensitive to products and my eyes are just fine with this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous mascaras over the past 15 years, and this is by far the best! I&#x27;m not one to spend a lot of money on makeup, but this is the one thing I will splurge on. A couple of coats makes my lashes super long and voluminous. I recommend curling your lashes before use. Great product!</li>
            <li> After searching for years for a good mascara I came across this recently as part of a free gift with purchase. This mascara is awesome. It thickens and extends my lashes perfectly.</li>
            <li> I have tried both Hypnose Drama and Definicils High Definition mascara from Lancome, and trust me, both are a COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY. I tried Definicils High Definition first, and I could not believe how clumpy the mascara is, even after wiping most of it from the brush. Fortunately, I did not buy Hypnose Drama but received it as a free sample. I chose to sample this mascara over Definicils High Definition, hoping it would be better, but it is exactly the same. It clumps more than any other mascara I have tried. Of all of the brands I have tried (Maybelline, Lorreal, Cover Girl, Rimmel...most of the drug store brands), the absolute best is Jordana, which you can find at Walgreens for approximately $3.00, usually less. I am very thankful that a friend of mine recommended it because it is the best mascara I have ever used. I have purchased it in their store and from their website. If you buy Jordana in the store, it is a little difficult to find. It is just the mascara by itself in a black bottle with purple lettering(not attached to a cardboard backing). I cannot believe how inexpensive this mascara is, especially since it is of a much higher quality than any other I have used.</li>
            <li> After using this for a week or two, it started to dry out super quickly. I typically can use a tube of Hypnose Drama for a few weeks or even a couple of months before it dries out, so I was quite surprised. It prompted me to compare the tube to my old (legit) one that it was supposed to replace. They were similar, but different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product doesn&#x27;t appear to be actual Lancome, but a knockoff. The sticker on the bottom of the tube is not for Lancome out of France, like actual Lancome product, but for a company called &amp;#34;Luxury Products&amp;#34; out of NYC. Additionally, the printing process of the gold ink on the tube is done in a different way than actual Lancome product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a knockoff and the quality shows.</li>
            <li> First, the whole thing about buying makeup from Amazon is going to be dry and faded is a rumor. I am a fashioniesta who writes for product design for super trendy online store.&lt;br /&gt;Mascara is tricky, even when you try it on at Sephora, you still don,t know who it will look few hours later.&lt;br /&gt;I have been in the market for years now to find me a grown up mascara. This is it &amp; to make things even better Amazon sells it for about 30 to 40% off.HELLO&lt;br /&gt;Buy it, no need to think about it. its long lasting, lengthen, &amp; simple to apply.</li>
            <li> I have used so many Mascaras and this is a good one. It makes my eyelashes look fuller and longer.</li>
            <li> This is,by far,the best mascara.It&#x27;s a little pricey,but lasts a long time.I would never use another brand again.Looks great and stays on!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get a mascara that was upscale and would make my lashes thicker and would not clump.  Unfortunately, this is not it for me.  Problems I have found are flacking and clumping just as with the cheaper brands I can buy for half the price.  I was looking forward to applying the mascara and not worrying about it the rest of the day.  Maybe I just picked the wrong Lancôme Mascara and there are better ones available.</li>
            <li> I am a mascara junkie. This mascara is the best I&#x27;ve come across. It magnifies your eyelashes. In fact there is no room for my eyelashes when I put on my glasses , they are so thickened and elongated by the mascara. I will definitely continually buying. There is a tendency to clump which is the only flaw I can find.</li>
            <li> Amazing mascara.  My lashes grow straight out, so they are not noticeable.  This product gives me big, full, long eyelashes, and its a nice brush.  A few strokes of the wand, and it looks like you have layers on!  All you need is two layers, really, and you get a nice effect.  Don&#x27;t put too much on, because it will sometimes flake and leave little polka dots on your cheeks.</li>
            <li> love it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;........... ............ ..... .......... . .... . ..... .... ..... .... .... .... .... .... ... ...</li>
