    <ol>
            <li>this minimizes my pores the best.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the greatest pore filling primer of all time</li>
            <li>This was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell too good either.</li>
            <li>This is a great primer and feel so nice on my skin.</li>
            <li>Love This!</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>seems greasy at first but altogether is a great primer</li>
            <li>But I really do love it.</li>
            <li>I bought this from Target and let me just start by saying that it was my fault for even using it when I should have known better.</li>
            <li>i love this stuff and i will be ordering more</li>
            <li>I use it with Elf&#x27;s liquid foundation and have received many compliments about my skin.</li>
            <li>It almost made my face more shiny than it would be if I&#x27;d used nothing, and I believe it reduced the staying time of my foundation.</li>
            <li>So worth the money really good quality.</li>
            <li>If anything, I think it caused the liquid foundation to wear off more easily instead of staying on longer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really light and was definitely worth the purchase!!</li>
            <li>It has a strong minty almost menthol smell that makes you cring while applying.</li>
            <li>Hands down, the BEST primer ever!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because it does what it&#x27;s suppose to do but keep in mind it might not be good for someone who tends to have a natural greasy face.</li>
            <li>The only good thing is that it does make markup stay on longer.</li>
            <li>But it is true to what it says.</li>
            <li>I have super large pores on my nose and around my nose.</li>
            <li>It looks like a good bang for your buck for $6 until you unscrew the top and the clear outer casing comes away and you&#x27;re left with the pump and the inner colored plastic cylinder</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different primers like smash box, cover fx, tarte and so many others and hands down</li>
            <li>It mattes my whole face.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>I really recommend buying it from elf though.</li>
            <li>After using for about 2-3 days I noticed my skin breaking out and, since this was pretty much the only new product in the morning routine, I am close to certain it clogged my pores and lead to those breakouts.</li>
            <li>Also, I have VERY large pores and this does nothing to make them look smaller.</li>
            <li>that only comes about a third filled.</li>
            <li>Do NOT waste your money on this product!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t and have never had sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I use primer in the hopes that my 6 AM makeup will still look ok a few hours later in the summer heat.</li>
            <li>This was the only new thing I tried on my face</li>
            <li>This was just ok, it felt a little greasy putting on though and didn&#x27;t seem to work as well as other primers.</li>
            <li>But still, this is a HUGE waste of money!!!</li>

            <li> Only down fall is</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t waste the extra $5.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 33 and have been relatively acne-free for quite a few years.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>

            <li> NO ONE EVER MENTIONED the fact that it was a horrible, not Just chemical smell but definitively diesel &amp; should have been taken as a warning.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> Do NOT waste your money on this product! Fists of all, its appearance is deceiving; the container screws off leaving a smaller container in its place that only comes about a third filled. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE!! Eleven dollars for basically the amount of lip gloss that comes in  a small container?! Also, I have VERY large pores and this does nothing to make them look smaller. It doesn&#x27;t smell too good either. The only good thing is that it does make markup stay on longer. But still, this is a HUGE waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> This was a pleasant surprise. I bought this back in November and by the way it is only $6 on the elf website and at Walmart.com so don&#x27;t waste the extra $5. But it is true to what it says. I have super large pores on my nose and around my nose. It mattes my whole face. My pores do look instantly diminished.  A little goes a long way so you don&#x27;t need much. (Still using same bottle from November) it is a bit greasy tho so I typically wait about five minutes before putting on my makeup. Hence why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. But I really do love it. It&#x27;s a steal. I&#x27;ve tried so many different primers like smash box, cover fx, tarte and so many others and hands down this minimizes my pores the best. For only $6 you can&#x27;t go wrong. I really recommend buying it from elf though.</li>
            <li> I like it, it does help with minimizing the big pores on my face. Only down fall is it is sort of greasy and I&#x27;m not a fan of the tea tree smell. I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because it does what it&#x27;s suppose to do but keep in mind it might not be good for someone who tends to have a natural greasy face.</li>
            <li> Love This! Hands down, the BEST primer ever!</li>
            <li> I bought this at target and it made me break out after 4 times using it.. I never have breakouts. . This was the only new thing I tried on my face</li>
            <li> I have a few bones to pick with this primer. The reason I give it 2 stars is because it does work, somewhat. It&#x27;s not the greatest pore filling primer of all time but it gets the job done. My number one complaint was the smell. It has a strong minty almost menthol smell that makes you cring while applying. Thankfully the smell only lasts during application. My second problem with this product is the deceitful packaging. It looks like a good bang for your buck for $6 until you unscrew the top and the clear outer casing comes away and you&#x27;re left with the pump and the inner colored plastic cylinder and then you look up inside that cylinder and see the itsy bitsy tube hidden within. Over all I&#x27;ll pass on repurchasing this product.</li>
            <li> seems greasy at first but altogether is a great primer</li>
            <li> I bought this from Target and let me just start by saying that it was my fault for even using it when I should have known better. Because as soon as I opened the container it smelled like diesel fuel. I mean they mentioned the &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; in every online review I found for the stuff but NO ONE EVER MENTIONED the fact that it was a horrible, not Just chemical smell but definitively diesel &amp; should have been taken as a warning.&lt;br /&gt;I used it intermittently, maybe a total of 6 out of 15 days. However each time I would use it I would wind up with a new, (and very different from my usual) deep and excruciatingly painful almost boil like pimples on my face within a day or two! The last one left a lasting scar.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t and have never had sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve also never had a reaction like that to a beauty product. Buyer beware. I would give it a -10 of I could.</li>
            <li> Amazing. Smells similar to Vaseline but not quite. It&#x27;s really light and was definitely worth the purchase!! Will order again!!</li>
            <li> Smells like paint thinner</li>
            <li> horrible smell (herbal or not), like putting a dry oil on your skin.</li>
            <li> I use primer in the hopes that my 6 AM makeup will still look ok a few hours later in the summer heat. This was just ok, it felt a little greasy putting on though and didn&#x27;t seem to work as well as other primers. I won&#x27;t get it again.</li>
            <li> Bought this from Target and not Amazon for around $6 so the price was not the bad part. After using for about 2-3 days I noticed my skin breaking out and, since this was pretty much the only new product in the morning routine, I am close to certain it clogged my pores and lead to those breakouts. Also felt greasy on the skin and there was no noticeable difference in skin texture or appearance after using it. If anything, I think it caused the liquid foundation to wear off more easily instead of staying on longer. I would not recommend it even for the low price and I will not be buying it again.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff and i will be ordering more</li>
            <li> It takes forever to dry</li>
            <li> This is a great primer and feel so nice on my skin. I use it with Elf&#x27;s liquid foundation and have received many compliments about my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to go with the others who said this definitely causes breakouts. I&#x27;m 33 and have been relatively acne-free for quite a few years. However, within a week of using this product on a daily basis, I started to get a bunch of deep, cystic pimples. I&#x27;ve gotten maybe one of these a year since I was 25, and now I have 4 on my face all at once! This has been the only change in my routine, so I have to assume it&#x27;s to blame. It doesn&#x27;t even work as a primer, either. It almost made my face more shiny than it would be if I&#x27;d used nothing, and I believe it reduced the staying time of my foundation. Terrible product.</li>
            <li> So worth the money really good quality.</li>
