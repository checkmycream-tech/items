            <li> slowly but surely you will see that your darkest marks will lighten a few shades.</li>

            <li> I dipped a swab--just a small dab to try and</li>
            <li> duh, its a chemical peel</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;d rather have pain that&#x27;d deliver result than feeling burnt and would cause serious damage.</li>

            <li> Satisfied with my brushes I can see the difference on how my makeup looks. It&#x27;s looks more smooth and settle. The brushes do make a difference.</li>
            <li> Perfect beginners peel. I Use it 2 times monthly. Thought the smallest size wouldn&#x27;t last long but I got about 8-10 uses from it. Will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also going to purchase a stronger peel to do quarterly.</li>
            <li> Great product, easy to use, fantastic instructions.</li>
            <li> This is an absolute buy and beauty care staple at any age. I first bought this when I was 25 and wanted to lighten my acne scars.. I managed to have 13 or 14 peels from this one bottle which I did over the course of a year. It lightened my scars dramatically and improved the overall appearance of my skin and shrunk my pores thereby decreasing my oil production. While i use the MUAC peels I never break out. I stopped using this as I have been having laser hair removal on my face for the last 5 months but I am going to be buying this again shortly</li>
            <li> I tried this because I&#x27;m looking for something to try  aside from having it done at a dermatologist&#x27;s clinic.  First off, it has an awful smell.  I had so many chemical done in my face and arms but I&#x27;m just no familiar with the kind of chemical they use in the kit.  I dipped a swab--just a small dab to try and boy oh boy! It burns.... I don&#x27;t like it.  I&#x27;d stick to getting it done in a dermatology clinic.  I just can&#x27;t take a risk on this product.  I always say &amp;#34;NO PAIN NO GAIN&amp;#34;.  Well, I&#x27;d rather have pain that&#x27;d deliver result than feeling burnt and would cause serious damage.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that actually does perl my skin. Easy to use, fast deliveru,. It does peel, IDK about hyperpigmentation yet. Will update tho.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin glowing, even, smooth, and helps with pigmentation issues...one of the best products a woman could have!</li>
            <li> It helped my hyperpigmentation a little bit. I was using it to get my face ready for the tca 15 percent chemical peel. Overall its okay</li>
            <li> If you are even THINKING about buying this peel, do it.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my hyperpigmentation literally after once use of this product!  I had no sensitivity and so far have been impressed not only at the cost of this product but also with its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> The product should include instructions for use. Googled for instructions yet not accurate since the bottles does not even have 1.2.3 labels that would have sufficed.</li>
            <li> This peel was pretty great for my acne it helped a lot I was surprised but it did a great job ... The delivery was fast also</li>
            <li> after years and years of picking at my face the acne cleared but the scars remained. i use this peel once a week. i&#x27;ve been using it for about 10 weeks at this point and it really does its job. slowly but surely you will see that your darkest marks will lighten a few shades. your lights marks will be almost gone. if you&#x27;re looking for a fast fix, this isn&#x27;t for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;fyi: it burns. duh, its a chemical peel</li>
            <li> I have used this product 3 times now and can&#x27;t wait to continue using it to see the maximum benefits.  I do notice my pores are smaller and my face is nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> A LOT OF PEOPLE RAVE ABOUT THIS PRODUCT I DID IT FOR LIKE ALMOST TWO MONTHS AND NO PEELING I DIDNT REALLY SEE ANY DIFFERNECE IN MY SKIN. IT HELP A LITTLE. I USE OTHE RPRODUCTS ASWELL SO I CANT REALLY SAY.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first but I saw a diffrance in my scars and acne with the first use and it came right on time be sure to research to to the peel properly</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin so I thought this would be safe. This burned my face. It took 2 weeks to heal.</li>
