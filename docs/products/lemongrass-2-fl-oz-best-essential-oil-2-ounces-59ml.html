            <li> Excellent product.  Excellent quality.  Fast shipment.  I am a Fan</li>
            <li> I have been a tomboy all my life which comes with many injuries and many aching muscles and bones. I have had multiple knee surgeries and when the weather changes the aches begin which is why I was happy to try this oil for free and give an honest opinion on it. although lemongrass has a very strong odor (my husband complains) I find it to be an amazing oil to use. after a long day of walking at Disney world with my family I had some major pain in my knees and lower back. with just a few drops of this oil my pains calm down. now its not something that cures the pain instantly but I could tell within and hour or so a big difference in my pain level and I was even excited when I was able to drag our kids around Disney even longer the following day! im willing to have a strong lemon odor for some amazing pain relief!!!</li>
            <li> Sun Organics Essential Oils lemongrass essential oil seems to help my mood and my focus when it is diffused in my home office. The pleasant clean aroma is not overwhelming. Lemongrass oil is well known for being an effective insect repellent. Just add several drops to a plastic spray bottle with water and the mosquito will flee the scene. . A few sprays of this around and under where you are sitting outside and no more bug bites and no Deet.&lt;br /&gt;Lemongrass Essential Oil has not been a disappointment with its fresh lemon scent and bug barrier abilities. I would recommend it to my friends. I received this for free for testing and my unbiased opinion. This is my opinion and mine only.</li>
            <li> I received this oil for free to review. I love it. It smells so good. I have asthma so its hard for me to be around certain scents. So needless to say i am thrilled i found essential oils. They are strong yet not choke and gag you strength. I am able to put the oil in a warmer and or my humidifier and my whole house is delightful for hours on end. I find new uses evryday and look forward to them.</li>
            <li> This is one of my fav essential oil, it has very pleasant smell, very light oil, can be use on skin, skin feels so good!&lt;br /&gt;I got this product in exchange of review!!</li>
            <li> Great size, love the great lemon scent!</li>
            <li> Not a sure fire for this particular scent. I figured I&#x27;d give it a try but after using it a night my fiancé and I just can&#x27;t seem to get the smell out of our noise. Not to our taste but to each their own. My mother loves the smell so I&#x27;ve gifted it to her.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of fresh lemons, and cook with lemongrass, (not this oil, but the spice), which smells wonderful. I&#x27;ve never experienced lemongrass in an essential oil until this one from Sun Organics. One the side of the bottle it states this is a highly concentrated oil. I used one drop of this oil mixed with water in my diffuser, and wow it is potent! It&#x27;s a bit too strong of a smell for my liking, even when diluted with the water in the diffuser, and would have liked it better toned down a little more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am no expert on essential oils, and in fact only begun using them recently. I&#x27;ve been reading about how to test if it&#x27;s a true EO or if it&#x27;s synthetic, by adding a drop to white paper, then if it&#x27;s leaves a residue after evaporation it&#x27;s not a true EO, but rather a synthetic made oil. After doing a paper test, this lemon oil did leave a residue on the paper days after evaporation. Because of that, I would do your own research before using this oil to see if this is the one for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for the purpose of inspection and honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li> very interesting product, very good lemongrass oil, I love it, just got it few days ago and it has very good qualities.</li>
            <li> like the smell, use it to make homemade dish  detergent</li>
            <li> Very strong! A little goes a long way. Smells very clean!</li>
            <li> Lemongrass is good for most things. I needed it for my knees. The pain is decreasing every day.</li>
            <li> This essential oil has a great smell and many different uses. I used it in my diffuser and it made my home smell wonderful, it does not take a lot to make this smell come through your home so be cautious when putting this in. This oil is great if you have wood floors and want a great cleaner and to make your home smell great, it can also be used as a mosquito repellent as they do not like the smell of lemon. I put a little on my wrists and then some on our outdoor furniture and I did not have any trouble with them at all! * I received this product for free for my honest review.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy essential oils and lemon is the best, so I burn it to scent up the house. Very nice!</li>
            <li> Love it smalls so good</li>
            <li> I gave this 4 stars as bottle does not state where it was manufactured. Do Not take internally, read the bottle. Always read up up on safety warnings when using any oils.  Wonderful aroma, comes with a plastic bulb type dropper that has measurements on it.

            <li> Like  the fragrance emitted through my diffusers.  Many times a visitor to my house will exclaim &amp;#34;It smells great in here!&amp;#34; And I have a cat!</li>
            <li> This is a great oil for cooking! It adds an incredibly aromatic, yet subtle citrus flavor. Its great for soups, especially tomato and other vegetable soups, and I&#x27;ve recently started adding it to tea where it adds a ton of flavor and a real zing to it. I was able to try this out for free but will definitely buy this when I run out!</li>
