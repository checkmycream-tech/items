            <li>This is a great waver!  </li>
            <li>Best waver ever.</li>
            <li>This waver is the perfect solution!</li>
            <li>hi   its very good item and make great wave  </li>
            <li>so i was really happy to find it.</li>
            <li>It works great on my hair.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>I can use it sporadically in my hair on just the parts that are frizzy, or I can use it all over my head for perfect, frizz free</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad Revlon makes these now too...</li>
            <li>It looks soo cute!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS WAVER!</li>
            <li>love this thing!</li>
            <li>I have had this iron a while now, &amp; I love it!</li>
            <li>this waver is amazing and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair poofy.</li>
            <li>I already own a triple-barrel wave iron</li>
            <li>Very easy to use...</li>
            <li>LOVE THE SELLER, LOVE THE TOOL!  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best wave iron out there!  </li>
            <li>This works best on one day old hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is already pretty wavy, but it doesn&#x27;t always look that great.</li>
            <li>I love this product because it&#x27;s easy to use and makes my hair look great, but it&#x27;s a pain to use because right where you place your fingers is an indented area that hurts to hold after a while.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Get this product for sure, from this seller, there is another one on here that I think is about 10 bucks more</li>
            <li>Just hold the waver where you want and it magically curls....</li>
            <li>this is way better for that than the 3-barrel curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I want to figure out how to create more structured waves</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been in use now more many many months without problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is ok.</li>
            <li>It made my hair super frizzy and I felt it didn&#x27;t get as warm as it could have.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>The Revlon Waver makes it easy for you to make curls without any rolling or sitting around with pins and curlers in your hair.</li>
            <li>I have naturally \\&quot;frizzy\\&quot; hair and it makes mine look perfect very time.</li>
            <li>Liked this very much I struggled between purchasing this or the revlon three barrell waver.  </li>
            <li>Color doesn&#x27;t matter when you are getting the same thing and great tool.</li>
            <li>and I do enjoy the look it leaves, but have always desired a deeper wave.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy with crimper and have suggested it to numerous people.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be using this tool very often because it does not give nice results.</li>
            <li>This is a very useful device espically for my wife.</li>
            <li>The concept is great, they just need to make one that&#x27;s much bigger in order to achieve true waves.</li>
            <li>The Revlon Deep Waver is amazing!</li>
            <li>Still, it produced more of a large crimp than a wave.</li>
            <li>It creates large beachy waves very cute takes about 15 minutes for my whole head.  </li>
            <li>and I have a completely new, sexy hairstyle.  </li>
            <li>Still in great condition, crimps my hair in big barrel waves pretty fast</li>
            <li>and all 3 says \\&quot;WOW, we LOVE IT!\\&quot; when it comes to this product.</li>
            <li>Left great soft bouncy waves, smooth and lasts long! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Also, when doing the top layer of your hair make sure your turn the waver upside down.  </li>
            <li>She enjoied very much.</li>
            <li>The waves are soo big, I dont think short hair would be able to get more than one or two crimps in it.     </li>
            <li>I like it, at first it was making my hair frizzy</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had this over a year now and it still gets just as hot and works just a well as the day I got it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Mermaid&#x27; seems to be the first thing that comes to mind.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s never been a problem for me.&lt;br /&gt;The cord is long so it reaches most plugs without a problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it does create deep smooth waves even without straightening first.</li>
            <li>highly recommend  this product!</li>
            <li>waves!&lt;br /&gt;There is a nice heat temp setting, thought I usually keep it pretty high.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have mid-length thick hair that doesn&#x27;t hold curl easily, however while using the Deep Waver, my waves last a solid two days and still look great!</li>
            <li>I have long, straight, fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It delivers deep waves, is easy to use, and even with my massive amount of just beyond shoulder length baby fine hair; it only takes about 20 minutes to get a look that looks like it took hours.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, you will have flat hair on the top of your head and its not nearly as flattering.      </li>
            <li>Arrived in new condition and shipping times were acceptable.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for something to give my hair large, deep waves and</li>
            <li>Please make sure you have medium length hair for this though, at least.</li>
            <li>I have really long hair &amp; can crimp my whole head in about 10 minutes.</li>

            <li> Great product! Very easy to use...I got lots of compliments on  my hair that night.</li>
            <li> I too had been looking for this product for over a year after i already had one and it got broken. I thought it had been discontinued so i was really happy to find it. I have extremely thick hair and it does create deep smooth waves even without straightening first. you do need to practice a little and learn how to use it but its not that complex or anything.</li>
            <li> I had a Vidal Sassoon waver just like this one and it broke. I&#x27;m very glad Revlon makes these now too...this waver is amazing and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair poofy. Love it.</li>
            <li> This was the largest waver I could find on the market. Still, it produced more of a large crimp than a wave. The concept is great, they just need to make one that&#x27;s much bigger in order to achieve true waves.</li>
            <li> LOVE THE SELLER, LOVE THE TOOL!  TWO THUMBS UP!  It works great on my hair. I can do a lot of different styles once I&#x27;ve crimped my hair with this tool. A half ponytail, a poof, a low ponytail, twists to the side or all hanging down. It looks soo cute! Please make sure you have medium length hair for this though, at least. The waves are soo big, I dont think short hair would be able to get more than one or two crimps in it.     Anyway, got to give props to the seller, I ordered it Wednesday and it got shipped out the same day, I got it in the mail Friday! This was all on standard shipping! Get this product for sure, from this seller, there is another one on here that I think is about 10 bucks more and it&#x27;s purple. Color doesn&#x27;t matter when you are getting the same thing and great tool. Left great soft bouncy waves, smooth and lasts long! &#x3D;)</li>

            <li> hi   its very good item and make great wave  but   the Head conductor of electricity is small   so you should buy another big head to can you use the iron.</li>
            <li> Great product. My wife loves it! Arrived in new condition and shipping times were acceptable. Thx</li>
            <li> I already own a triple-barrel wave iron and I do enjoy the look it leaves, but have always desired a deeper wave.  This is by far the best wave iron out there!

It is a little tricky to use.  Definitely do not set it on the highest temperature setting if you do not have thick coarse hair.  Medium eliminates the frizz.  Also, when doing the top layer of your hair make sure your turn the waver upside down.  Otherwise, you will have flat hair on the top of your head and its not nearly as flattering.

            <li> I like it, at first it was making my hair frizzy but I turned the heat down and the frizz is gone. It gives me a ton of volume!</li>
            <li> Liked this very much I struggled between purchasing this or the revlon three barrell waver.  I went with this option.  It creates large beachy waves very cute takes about 15 minutes for my whole head.  I want to figure out how to create more structured waves but hopefully that will come with futher time.</li>

            <li> I have long, straight, fine hair.  I get REALLY bored with leaving it down and straight all of the time, but everyone tells me not to cut it.  No need with tools like this!  10 minutes and I have a completely new, sexy hairstyle.  I get tons of compliments and my husband loves it when I use this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy so what do I know ;-)&lt;br /&gt;However, this guy has 3 girls under the same roof, two of them being women........and all 3 says \\&quot;WOW, we LOVE IT!\\&quot; when it comes to this product. It&#x27;s been in use now more many many months without problem.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a quality item and does the job well.&lt;br /&gt;It gets thumbs-up from this Dad/Husband.</li>
            <li> This is a very useful device espically for my wife. She enjoied very much. It saved money and time for her.</li>
            <li> My hair is already pretty wavy, but it doesn&#x27;t always look that great. This waver is the perfect solution! I can use it sporadically in my hair on just the parts that are frizzy, or I can use it all over my head for perfect, frizz free waves!&lt;br /&gt;There is a nice heat temp setting, thought I usually keep it pretty high.&lt;br /&gt;There is a lock setting for travel, it doesn&#x27;t always hold but it&#x27;s never been a problem for me.&lt;br /&gt;The cord is long so it reaches most plugs without a problem.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this over a year now and it still gets just as hot and works just a well as the day I got it!&lt;br /&gt;I love this thing!</li>
