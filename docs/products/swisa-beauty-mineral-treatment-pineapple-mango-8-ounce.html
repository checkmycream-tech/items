            <li>I think the product works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>One of them is an Arbonne consultant that sells their own body scrub and lotions, and she ordered it from Amazon from my house before leaving!!!  </li>
            <li>I decided to give it a try myself, and boy was I impressed!</li>
            <li>This is the best foot care product on the market.</li>
            <li>and it makes your skin feel wonderful when done.</li>
            <li>The thing I like best about this product is its smell.</li>
            <li>Wish it was smoother creamier but the smell is great.</li>
            <li>This product was unlike anything I have ever experienced before.</li>
            <li>This smells great.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly very pleased with the product</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell and leaves your skin very smooth after it&#x27;s use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also lovely for the wifes hands and feet!</li>
            <li>My son used it while on holiday with amazing results.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s best to use at night before bed, as it is very oily even after you wash your hands.</li>
            <li>, I like it, does a nice job smoothing out the roughness from manual labor.  </li>
            <li>I waited to use this wonderful smelling product, by several months.  </li>
            <li>I love how it makes me look and glow, feel and smell.</li>
            <li>I guarantee instant, impressive results.</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>I love the oil and mineral treatment.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the prices and how quickly it arrived once ordered/shipped.</li>
            <li>Compulsive because it HAS to be a certain kind)!  </li>
            <li>Since they no longer have this in the mall here, I did a search for this on Amazon and was so extremely excited when I found it on here!  </li>
            <li>but I was so impressed by this product, I ended up having to track it down on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Keep moisture in and leaves them silky smooth.</li>
            <li>This product totally met my expectation at a great price.  </li>
            <li>It works great on already smooth skin as well as rough skin.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>There are no crazy and unpronounceable chemicals listed as ingredients</li>
            <li>smells good, but stings on cuts and not the quality of other sea salt products I have used</li>
            <li>Let me first start my review by saying, I have been labeled by physicians as \\&quot;OCD\\&quot; when it comes to lotion/body scrub use (Obsession in that</li>
            <li>More like body butter which I am not a big fan of.</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to the Swisa Beauty Mineral Products at a kiosk in a mall.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hands smooth and soft, for a day or two.</li>
            <li>Not being able to purchase it, had me looking for an alternate source.  </li>
            <li>I like this product pretty much.</li>
            <li>And this product helps my hands so much.</li>
            <li>It really works to get rid of dryness and cracking skin on your feet.</li>
            <li>As soon as you wash it off, the feel of your skin is ridiculously soft!!!  </li>
            <li>The oil can be messy if you&#x27;re not careful taking it out of the jar though, would be nice if it were a little thicker consistency wise.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re brand new!</li>
            <li>There really is nothing better for soft skin that actually LASTS throughout the entire day!!!!  </li>
            <li>Your body is left smelling fresh and fragrant (but not girly- just yummy), feeling smoother than it&#x27;s ever felt before, and glowing like</li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone that craves soft skin, or has issued with keeping their skin soft!  </li>
            <li>You can always find lotions or scrubs advertising how they&#x27;ll make your skin feel silky soft.</li>
            <li>She prefers the smaller crystals in sugar scrubs, but the product works very well</li>
            <li>Swisa is unlike the rest of these common products as it leaves you feeling soft and smooth for over a week.</li>
            <li>My only piece of advice is don&#x27;t put it over sensitive areas of the skin, especially if you&#x27;re pores are open (i.e. freshly shaved legs) as the sea salt can sting a little.</li>
            <li>At that time, I was REALLY young and didn&#x27;t have ANY problems with dry skin-</li>
            <li>I wash my hands often and it has a tendency to dry out my hands and make them rough, this really helps heal the skin.</li>

            <li> I have really dry hands.</li>
            <li> I have used medicated lotions/body scrubs, super expensive ones-</li>
            <li> We listened to a lady on a stall in America, who said it is useful for eczema, but thought it was expensive $80 Dollars  </li>
            <li> Usually though, they&#x27;ll make you feel silky soft for about a day, or even less if you wash it off.</li>
            <li> This is extremely moisturizing.</li>
            <li> My hands get washed, on an average, 30 times a day.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t the real deal, the grains are extra large and the oil is like auto oil and gets sticky once u rinse your hands, the texture of the oil they used to make it becomes like a very thick petroleum base which becomes hard to remove, i had to use dawn dish washing liquid to rid the thick residue</li>
            <li> NOTHING on the market is going to make your skin feel the way the Swisa Dead Sea scrub does!  </li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t get hooked by the kiosk pitch; however, I couldn&#x27;t help but notice how amazed people looked walking away from trying this product.</li>
            <li> Too thick</li>
            <li> Well worth a try if your kids suffer from this horrible ailment.  </li>
            <li> Hi     My son has sufferred from Eczema for years and it always gets worse when on holiday.</li>
            <li> I like the glow it leaves behind and the moisture it adds to my body.  </li>
            <li> It does leave an oil behind on your skin, I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> After exfoliating with Swisa, it seriously makes you feel like you&#x27;re reborn all over again, as if none of the elements have ever touched your skin!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It will go rancid in time, so perhaps refrigerating it between uses would retard it from going bad.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!!!</li>

            <li> smells good, but stings on cuts and not the quality of other sea salt products I have used</li>
            <li> Hi     My son has sufferred from Eczema for years and it always gets worse when on holiday. We listened to a lady on a stall in America, who said it is useful for eczema, but thought it was expensive $80 Dollars  Found it on Amazon and bought some. My son used it while on holiday with amazing results. His eczema calmed and all but disappeared.  Well worth a try if your kids suffer from this horrible ailment.  Also lovely for the wifes hands and feet!</li>
            <li> i bought this and to my surprise it wasn&#x27;t the real deal, the grains are extra large and the oil is like auto oil and gets sticky once u rinse your hands, the texture of the oil they used to make it becomes like a very thick petroleum base which becomes hard to remove, i had to use dawn dish washing liquid to rid the thick residue</li>
            <li> I think the product works wonderfully.  My husband keeps straing at me telling me I look 5 years younger! Thank you Swisa Pineapplee Mango treatment.....Doesn&#x27;t taste all that well however!    Linda Vella</li>
            <li> Let me first start my review by saying, I have been labeled by physicians as \\&quot;OCD\\&quot; when it comes to lotion/body scrub use (Obsession in that I HAVE to have lotion on; Compulsive because it HAS to be a certain kind)!  I  CANNOT even walk out in the rain without re-applying lotion.  Like another reviewer said, I had discovered this product SEVERAL years ago at a kiosk in the mall as well.  At that time, I was REALLY young and didn&#x27;t have ANY problems with dry skin- but still had the obsession with lotions.  Since they no longer have this in the mall here, I did a search for this on Amazon and was so extremely excited when I found it on here!  I have used medicated lotions/body scrubs, super expensive ones- NOTHING on the market is going to make your skin feel the way the Swisa Dead Sea scrub does!  As soon as you wash it off, the feel of your skin is ridiculously soft!!!  I have made 5-6 of my friends try out the product and EVERY one of them is amazed with the result!!  One of them is an Arbonne consultant that sells their own body scrub and lotions, and she ordered it from Amazon from my house before leaving!!!  There really is nothing better for soft skin that actually LASTS throughout the entire day!!!!  I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone that craves soft skin, or has issued with keeping their skin soft!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!!!</li>
            <li> I waited to use this wonderful smelling product, by several months.  the oil inside becomes almost rancid.  the odor of the oil overtakes the pineapple-y smell of the products.  it&#x27;s best to use at night before bed, as it is very oily even after you wash your hands.</li>
            <li> Wish it was smoother creamier but the smell is great. More like body butter which I am not a big fan of. Too thick</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly very pleased with the product</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to the Swisa Beauty Mineral Products at a kiosk in a mall. I usually don&#x27;t get hooked by the kiosk pitch; however, I couldn&#x27;t help but notice how amazed people looked walking away from trying this product. I decided to give it a try myself, and boy was I impressed! This product was unlike anything I have ever experienced before. You can always find lotions or scrubs advertising how they&#x27;ll make your skin feel silky soft. Usually though, they&#x27;ll make you feel silky soft for about a day, or even less if you wash it off. Swisa is unlike the rest of these common products as it leaves you feeling soft and smooth for over a week. After exfoliating with Swisa, it seriously makes you feel like you&#x27;re reborn all over again, as if none of the elements have ever touched your skin! Aside from feel, it leaves a noticeably visual difference after just one application. Your body is left smelling fresh and fragrant (but not girly- just yummy), feeling smoother than it&#x27;s ever felt before, and glowing like you&#x27;re brand new! The product and its fragrance work well for any person, male or female. My family, friends and boyfriend rave about this product now that I&#x27;ve shown it to them! It works great on already smooth skin as well as rough skin. I use it on my hands and feet as it says, but sometimes can&#x27;t help exfoliating my arms and neck with it as well. I love how it makes me look and glow, feel and smell. My only piece of advice is don&#x27;t put it over sensitive areas of the skin, especially if you&#x27;re pores are open (i.e. freshly shaved legs) as the sea salt can sting a little. The kiosk disappeared from the mall but I was so impressed by this product, I ended up having to track it down on Amazon. Do yourself a favor and try it. I guarantee instant, impressive results. You won&#x27;t want to stop using it!</li>
            <li> It works! I wash my hands often and it has a tendency to dry out my hands and make them rough, this really helps heal the skin.</li>
            <li> This product is a gift from the gods. It works so well. My hands get washed, on an average, 30 times a day. ( I work in the medical field) And this product helps my hands so much. Keep moisture in and leaves them silky smooth.</li>
            <li> This product totally met my expectation at a great price.  I would recommend this purchase to anyone wanting to soften up their hands.&lt;br /&gt;My wife doesn&#x27;t call me the Alligator any longer.</li>
            <li> Love the smell. Leaves my hands smooth and soft, for a day or two. I have really dry hands. This is extremely moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Wife likes it a lot, the smell and how well it works.  She prefers the smaller crystals in sugar scrubs, but the product works very well, I like it, does a nice job smoothing out the roughness from manual labor.  The oil can be messy if you&#x27;re not careful taking it out of the jar though, would be nice if it were a little thicker consistency wise.</li>
            <li> This is the best foot care product on the market. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. All the womwen and some of the men in the family use it now. It really works to get rid of dryness and cracking skin on your feet.</li>
            <li> The product had been purchased by a distributor in Canada for a couple of years.  Not being able to purchase it, had me looking for an alternate source.  I was very pleased with the prices and how quickly it arrived once ordered/shipped.</li>
            <li> Ordered and billed for 10oz, received 8oz.  Contact said they could not find any record of my purchase even though I provided correct order #</li>
            <li> I like this product pretty much. It has a pleasant smell and leaves your skin very smooth after it&#x27;s use.&lt;br /&gt;It will go rancid in time, so perhaps refrigerating it between uses would retard it from going bad.</li>
            <li> This smells great. There are no crazy and unpronounceable chemicals listed as ingredients and it makes your skin feel wonderful when done.</li>
            <li> The thing I like best about this product is its smell. What I do not like is that it has mineral oil listed in the ingredients. The product works well but I do not like to use mineral oil on my skin.</li>
            <li> I love the oil and mineral treatment.  I use it on my hands and feet and I feel so pampered.  I like the glow it leaves behind and the moisture it adds to my body.  It does leave an oil behind on your skin, I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
