            <li>good to know it works</li>
            <li>good price arrived on time</li>
            <li>I did the top and saw some great results.</li>

            <li>Love the results!</li>
            <li>Strong his teeth whitening gel I have ever gotten works great and doesn&#x27;t burn</li>
            <li>Amazing results in just one day.</li>
            <li>These are amazing but did cause some temporary tooth sensitivity.</li>
            <li>did not use the dental trays provided as I had my own</li>
            <li>I have my own custom whitening trays so that I hadn&#x27;t planned on using the ones that came with the product but still.  </li>
            <li>Positive reviews must be bogus or friends of the company!!!!</li>
            <li>I would have liked to see better directions and teeth trays, but it still does the trick.</li>
            <li>Always fresh and great results.</li>
            <li>Barely worth mentioning though because I&#x27;m so happy with the results.</li>
            <li>does not work, best to pay and have your teeth done professionally.</li>
            <li>STRONG!</li>
            <li>Thought it would be better.</li>
            <li>This gel is stronger than recommended as safe by the ADA (http://www.ada.org/~/media/ADA/About%20the%20ADA/Files/whitening_bleaching_treatment_considrations_for_patients_and_dentists.ashx), and it caused capillary embolism in my gums.  </li>
            <li>My top teeth show more visible results</li>
            <li>and i couldn&#x27;t even keep them in my mouth for more than 45 seconds</li>
            <li>No matter how many times I tried this</li>
            <li>Excellent, I&#x27;ve been using for about 3 weeks now, I&#x27;ve used different products and even had a deBristol professionaly whiten them and my teeth are the whitest they hav ever been.&lt;br</li>
            <li>was doing my top teeth and no bottom</li>
            <li>but i need to get on them bottom ones. :)</li>
            <li>so I can wear it longer and get more results.  </li>
            <li>works better than most whitening gels on line</li>
            <li>Love love.  </li>
            <li>I use this about 3-5 times a week, and my teeth are significantly whiter!</li>
            <li>I use a cotton swab to apply to my teeth then put the tray in and it works well, plus I am able to make sure my teeth get full coverage.</li>
            <li>and I feel like the light isn&#x27;t able to penetrate your teeth.</li>
            <li>Used in conjunction with the LED light, this product works as well or better than going to the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>I am an avid coffee drinker and am very satisfied with this treatment.</li>
            <li>I found this product easy to use with the personalized trays I already owned.</li>
            <li>Strong whitener seeing results in days</li>
            <li>This is some strong stuff, almost to strong.</li>
            <li>But this gel is slightly more gentle then the kind they used.</li>
            <li>Too strong.</li>
            <li>I started noticing the 22 after the first day and thought this would be amazing.  </li>
            <li>The syringes are huge.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>I use this in conjunction with a uv light I bought on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Even though it doesn&#x27;t come with the light, my teeth are whiter and brighter.</li>
            <li>Was suppose to cime with binus led light.</li>
            <li>Trays are cheap.</li>
            <li>am thrilled with how fast this worked; I&#x27;ll post some pictures.</li>
            <li>Great thing for using alongside with your regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li>does a good job.&lt;br /&gt;does not make my teeth hurt or sensitive like others</li>
            <li>Just started using but so far so good</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced my gums being that sore either with this product, not any more than with less strong teeth bleaches.  </li>
            <li>But I love a bright white smile.</li>
            <li>Wanted to use first buy as a sample and buy alot more.</li>
            <li>I am familiar with CE from lab work with concentrated hydrogen peroxide.</li>
            <li>This works quite well although it causes some sensitivity ( which in my opinion is worth it!)</li>
            <li>The package came with 3 syringes full of product</li>
            <li>this is great ...better than any other product.</li>
            <li>Not super happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I leave my trays in overnight and noticed results after the first night!</li>
            <li>This is truly a powerful whitener.  </li>
            <li>This is a good buy but be careful</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try at this price, esp.</li>
            <li>My smile is radiant already.</li>
            <li>With all the gel they give you makes this product well worth the buy.</li>
            <li>Prompt delivery, great service, makes my teeth white very fast, much better than the other products I had been using.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m whitening my teeth right now...</li>
            <li>For all I know this product does a great job, but it cause such agony when just a tiny bit touched my gums that I had to stop using it.</li>
            <li>Works great, lightened with first use and only in for thirty minutes, same texture as the stuff I bought from my dentist at a fraction of the cost</li>
            <li>It might be better to use a lower concentration more frequently and avoid irritation so that teeth can be brushed normally.  </li>
            <li>Finally, the optional light treatment is probably ineffective according to reliable scientific studies, and the carbamide peroxide is about as effective as hydrogen peroxide (as in Crest white strips) at 1/3 the concentration.</li>
            <li>This gel showed a noticeable difference with the first use.</li>
            <li>so I can only do the top or the bottom at a time.</li>
            <li>Already 2 shades whiter, the trick is to brush the gel on the teeth and use the light directly on them.</li>
            <li>As promised you see the positive results from the first application.  </li>
            <li>Great product, works very well, and the three tubes last a really long time.</li>
            <li>I went back to using my older trays and that worked a lot better for me.</li>
            <li>The package arrived extremely quickly and came with clear instructions for use.</li>
            <li>I recommend buying it with the remineralization gel (blue stuff) because it is strong and might make your teeth sore.</li>
            <li>This is so strong I can only leave it on 2-3 minutes before it stings and burns!</li>
            <li>works amazing but be careful if you have sensitive gums and teeth!</li>
            <li>You do have to be careful not to overload the trays with gel, or your gums will burn and turn white temporarily, but my teeth looked amazing after the first use!</li>
            <li>It works fast.  </li>
            <li>Very watery.  </li>
            <li>I might have gotten 30 seconds of use out of this product, then it went straight into the trash.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied, although I expected faster results ..</li>
            <li>Burns the gums too much.</li>
            <li>Fast.</li>
            <li>Hey this stuff really worked.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than buying at dental office.</li>
            <li>so it will get you results fast.</li>
            <li>If you are seeking the following pros, then please, FEEL FREE TO PURCHASE.</li>
            <li>I was very underwhelmed with how it was packaged.  </li>
            <li>then i realized that my top teeth are WHITE and bottom ones are a completely diff shade.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite sure this is just due to the increased strength of this formula.</li>
            <li>Very high recommendation for anyone needing high strength teeth whitening products.</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive and effective tooth whitening kit!&lt;br /&gt;I have trays from the dentist and spent $500 or so back then.&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li>and I recommend going to your dentist to see if they&#x27;ll give you a higher concentration directly from them.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off buying crest 3D white strips which will actually give you results.</li>
            <li>Teeth are SUPER WHITE..</li>
            <li>They give you plenty of whitening gel and it&#x27;s a good product but the molding trays are way to difficult to get right.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend a remineralization gel to get with this.</li>
            <li>but I wanted it to work a little better.</li>
            <li>If you want to go slow &amp; steady, with a gel you can apply before bed and just leave on overnight (which is nice), I&#x27;d get the lower percent gel.</li>
            <li>So you can smile big wherever you go.</li>
            <li>I waited at least 3 weeks to post a  review because I wanted to give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>If you want fast results and can be careful and tolerate some possible gum sore spots (briefly - heal in a day) and don&#x27;t mind applying for a short time and not sleeping with it on, then I think you&#x27;ll be happy with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;there not super white like you would see some people on tv, but for the cost of the product I&#x27;m very pleased and maybe they will get whiter, that&#x27;s why I only gave 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Be</li>
            <li>/&gt;Just be careful not to leave it on your gums for too long or it will take off some top layers of skin -- just in the tips of the gum issue between your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>far as the paste, this is the same gel that you purchase from a dentists office but at a much lower price.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>but now i think maybe that stuff was old or something.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re on a budget and can&#x27;t get professional whitening from your dentist.</li>
            <li>It does make my teeth sensitive sometimes, but I use sensodyne so its not a problem.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>Wow 11 dollars for what I used to pay 500 dollars for.</li>
            <li>Let me start off by saying if you have sensitive teeth like me do not automatically get discouraged by the strength of this product.</li>
            <li>and I can see on my top teeth small white streaks.</li>
            <li>I bought the 20-something% gel from my dentist first, and that worked too, just a bit more slowly and with less gum irritation.</li>
            <li>CE is caused by decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to give oxygen bubbles that block the capillaries; it is generally reversible, but can be considered a warning signal.  </li>
            <li>(I tried to use as little as possible), almost right after I put the forms in my mouth.</li>
            <li>The trays that came with the kit are definitely cheap and no good.  </li>
            <li>and I trimmed the trays they were just not a good fit.</li>
            <li>I use a super small amount and it goes a long way.</li>

            <li> This is so strong I can only leave it on 2-3 minutes before it stings and burns!</li>
            <li> works amazing but be careful if you have sensitive gums and teeth!</li>
            <li> You do have to be careful not to overload the trays with gel, or your gums will burn and turn white temporarily, but my teeth looked amazing after the first use!</li>
            <li> It works fast.  </li>
            <li> Very watery.  </li>
            <li> I might have gotten 30 seconds of use out of this product, then it went straight into the trash.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied, although I expected faster results ..</li>
            <li> Burns the gums too much.</li>
            <li> Fast.</li>
            <li> Hey this stuff really worked.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than buying at dental office.</li>
            <li> so it will get you results fast.</li>
            <li> If you are seeking the following pros, then please, FEEL FREE TO PURCHASE.</li>
            <li> I was very underwhelmed with how it was packaged.  </li>
            <li> then i realized that my top teeth are WHITE and bottom ones are a completely diff shade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite sure this is just due to the increased strength of this formula.</li>
            <li> Very high recommendation for anyone needing high strength teeth whitening products.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive and effective tooth whitening kit!&lt;br /&gt;I have trays from the dentist and spent $500 or so back then.&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> and I recommend going to your dentist to see if they&#x27;ll give you a higher concentration directly from them.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off buying crest 3D white strips which will actually give you results.</li>
            <li> Teeth are SUPER WHITE..</li>
            <li> They give you plenty of whitening gel and it&#x27;s a good product but the molding trays are way to difficult to get right.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend a remineralization gel to get with this.</li>
            <li> but I wanted it to work a little better.</li>
            <li> If you want to go slow &amp; steady, with a gel you can apply before bed and just leave on overnight (which is nice), I&#x27;d get the lower percent gel.</li>
            <li> So you can smile big wherever you go.</li>
            <li> I waited at least 3 weeks to post a  review because I wanted to give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> If you want fast results and can be careful and tolerate some possible gum sore spots (briefly - heal in a day) and don&#x27;t mind applying for a short time and not sleeping with it on, then I think you&#x27;ll be happy with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;there not super white like you would see some people on tv, but for the cost of the product I&#x27;m very pleased and maybe they will get whiter, that&#x27;s why I only gave 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Be</li>
            <li> /&gt;Just be careful not to leave it on your gums for too long or it will take off some top layers of skin -- just in the tips of the gum issue between your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> far as the paste, this is the same gel that you purchase from a dentists office but at a much lower price.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> but now i think maybe that stuff was old or something.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re on a budget and can&#x27;t get professional whitening from your dentist.</li>
            <li> It does make my teeth sensitive sometimes, but I use sensodyne so its not a problem.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> Wow 11 dollars for what I used to pay 500 dollars for.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying if you have sensitive teeth like me do not automatically get discouraged by the strength of this product.</li>
            <li> and I can see on my top teeth small white streaks.</li>
            <li> I bought the 20-something% gel from my dentist first, and that worked too, just a bit more slowly and with less gum irritation.</li>
            <li> CE is caused by decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to give oxygen bubbles that block the capillaries; it is generally reversible, but can be considered a warning signal.  </li>
            <li> (I tried to use as little as possible), almost right after I put the forms in my mouth.</li>
            <li> The trays that came with the kit are definitely cheap and no good.  </li>
            <li> and I trimmed the trays they were just not a good fit.</li>
            <li> I use a super small amount and it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> carefull around the gums, could be a little sensitive and will turn them white for some hours.</li>
            <li> Every single time I used them I ended up burning my gums with the gel which turns them white and HURTS!</li>
            <li> but that was because the trays were very hard to get right.</li>
            <li> I spent $200 to do an in house whitening treatment at my dental office and the results were about the same..</li>
            <li> but it works really gradually and SLOWLY.</li>
            <li> I barely used half</li>
            <li> is that I couldn&#x27;t keep them in my mouth very long because I couldn&#x27;t spit</li>
            <li> but it truely doesn&#x27;t deliever any results and the trays are just uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> With a longer treatment, my gums were irritated to the point that I couldn&#x27;t brush as usual, and repeated whitener treatments could be done only after several days.  </li>
            <li> The gel will last, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Anyway I had coffee stains and a little tarter build up on the back of my teeth.</li>
            <li> Like some others, I had some sores on my gums where I let the gel touch them without wiping it away or when I left the gel on a little longer.</li>
            <li> so I expected it.</li>
            <li> No really.</li>
            <li> my teeth do get whiter and that is all I really expected.</li>
            <li> Follow the directions carefully.</li>
            <li> Yes you do need to be careful not to get on your gums or they will get irritated.</li>
            <li> So be careful.</li>
            <li> You need to be careful not to burn your gums.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> When this happens, you may notice small white patches on the gums between teeth, which is a sign of capillary embolism (CE).  </li>
            <li> Sent the wrong strength at first had to re-ship correct ones.</li>
            <li> I agree 100% w/ one of the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> I received my order the other day</li>
            <li> Shipping was a little longer than expected</li>
            <li> Smoking and coffee ruins the work the dentist does.</li>
            <li> did try the trays and my only complaint with those</li>
            <li> It cuts down tooth sensitivity and leaves your mouth refreshed.</li>
            <li> think it boils down to what you prefer.</li>
            <li> but makes a difference, be prepared to have white spots on your gum if you use it excessively!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bleached my teeth 3 to 4 times, once a week, 20-30 minutes each, and the results are slightly blotched, bleached, teeth.</li>
            <li> However, this will lose its potency in less than two months.</li>
            <li> But this product works faster and is half the price of the gel my dentist sells.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also you can feel the little peroxide bubbles going to work.</li>
            <li> Works just like all the rest--maybe a little stronger.</li>
            <li> I switched from 22 percent given to me by my dentist and that would make my teeth tingle a little bit</li>
            <li> Burned my gums a little</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> i did not like the messy gag feeling, ick.</li>
            <li> Money wasted.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Should have followed the other negative reviews.</li>
            <li> it is virtually impossible to whiten the whole tooth without getting some of the gel on your gums.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t take it no more than 5 min</li>
            <li> so abstain for a few days if you encounter that!</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth anyway</li>
            <li> I guesstimate in about three months, with at least 2 to 3 treatments a week</li>
            <li> At least 4 teeth whitening opportunities.</li>
            <li> Let me start off with saying I am usually very lazy when it comes to writing a review..</li>
            <li> Sometimes the whitener I get from the dentist is too weak.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m disappointed with my purchase</li>
            <li> This stuff seriously works!</li>
            <li> The package was partially torn and the trays were disgusting with dust and black stuff on them.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed prefer</li>
            <li> and my teeth were numb for a few hours and painful</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> Was difficult to get out of the syringe.</li>
            <li> but we had bad weather</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch or</li>
            <li> Highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It works fast.  So you can smile big wherever you go.</li>
            <li> works amazing but be careful if you have sensitive gums and teeth!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this!! 3 days(once a day) and I&#x27;m already where I want to be. I may do a touch up in a week or so. Shipping was a little longer than expected but we had bad weather so I expected it.</li>
            <li> Great!  This is truly a powerful whitener.  I got it on my gums by mistake and thought I could just ride it out, but oh no I couldn&#x27;t.  That is good.  Sometimes the whitener I get from the dentist is too weak.</li>
            <li> Not only does this burn your gums, it doesn&#x27;t get your teeth any bit whiter! You&#x27;re better off buying crest 3D white strips which will actually give you results. I don&#x27;t have any idea why anyone would recommend such a wasteful product. It&#x27;s a waste of money and time. You might think becuase it&#x27;s cheap it&#x27;s a good deal but it truely doesn&#x27;t deliever any results and the trays are just uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> This stuff seriously works! I recommend buying it with the remineralization gel (blue stuff) because it is strong and might make your teeth sore. I went 5 shades lighter in 2 days / 2 uses.</li>
            <li> I received an expired whitening gel.  Says 4 / 2016. Very watery.  Highly disappointed. Wanted to use first buy as a sample and buy alot more. Very disappointed. Thought it would be better.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product at all! The forms did not work out for me too well, and the gel started burning my gums (I tried to use as little as possible), almost right after I put the forms in my mouth. I might have gotten 30 seconds of use out of this product, then it went straight into the trash.</li>
            <li> Strong whitener seeing results in days</li>
            <li> Not impressed prefer nite white makes your mouth burn allot and gums sore even with Vaseline</li>
            <li> My teeth are so white people in the office have been wearing sunglasses since I started using this. No really.</li>
            <li> For tray-based treatments (as opposed to strips) it is virtually impossible to whiten the whole tooth without getting some of the gel on your gums.  When this happens, you may notice small white patches on the gums between teeth, which is a sign of capillary embolism (CE).  This gel is stronger than recommended as safe by the ADA (http://www.ada.org/~/media/ADA/About%20the%20ADA/Files/whitening_bleaching_treatment_considrations_for_patients_and_dentists.ashx), and it caused capillary embolism in my gums.  I am familiar with CE from lab work with concentrated hydrogen peroxide. CE appears as white &amp;#34;bleaching&amp;#34; of the skin (as seen here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_peroxide#Disinfectant).  CE is caused by decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to give oxygen bubbles that block the capillaries; it is generally reversible, but can be considered a warning signal.  The 44% carbamide peroxide in this product produces about 15% hydrogen peroxide.  Others have recommended short (3-5 minute) treatments because longer treatments lead to irritation. With a longer treatment, my gums were irritated to the point that I couldn&#x27;t brush as usual, and repeated whitener treatments could be done only after several days.  It might be better to use a lower concentration more frequently and avoid irritation so that teeth can be brushed normally.  I&#x27;ll try the 22%!  Finally, the optional light treatment is probably ineffective according to reliable scientific studies, and the carbamide peroxide is about as effective as hydrogen peroxide (as in Crest white strips) at 1/3 the concentration. (as in Crest strips)</li>
            <li> This works quite well although it causes some sensitivity ( which in my opinion is worth it!)</li>
            <li> I would probably purchase a lower dose next time. This product is very good and I would purchase from this vendor again. Quality if just to good, LOl!</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with a uv light I bought on Amazon. I use this about 3-5 times a week, and my teeth are significantly whiter!</li>
            <li> This is some strong stuff, almost to strong. I can&#x27;t take it no more than 5 min and my gums are on fire. I use a super small amount and it goes a long way. This is a good buy but be careful</li>
            <li> this works....my teeth do get whiter and that is all I really expected.</li>
            <li> I like the whitener - and use with some trays my dentist had made.  The trays that came with the kit are definitely cheap and no good.  The whitener my dentists sells is almost $100.  SLIGHTLY more than this!!!</li>
            <li> I found this product easy to use with the personalized trays I already owned. You do have to be careful not to overload the trays with gel, or your gums will burn and turn white temporarily, but my teeth looked amazing after the first use! I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Wow. I&#x27;ve ordered tooth whitening gel from another company before and saw some results but now i think maybe that stuff was old or something. This gel showed a noticeable difference with the first use. I have a terrible gag reflex when using the trays so I can only do the top or the bottom at a time. I did the top and saw some great results. I do think that you should use until you get to your desired color but i will buy this stuff again. Definitely worth a try at this price, esp. if you&#x27;re on a budget and can&#x27;t get professional whitening from your dentist.</li>
            <li> STRONG! but makes a difference, be prepared to have white spots on your gum if you use it excessively! so abstain for a few days if you encounter that!</li>
            <li> This works for me but it works really gradually and SLOWLY. I waited at least 3 weeks to post a  review because I wanted to give my honest opinion. So, this works but I wanted it to work a little better. I&#x27;ve bleached my teeth 3 to 4 times, once a week, 20-30 minutes each, and the results are slightly blotched, bleached, teeth. My top teeth show more visible results and I can see on my top teeth small white streaks. I am satisfied, although I expected faster results ..but patience is a virtue. I guesstimate in about three months, with at least 2 to 3 treatments a week, I&#x27;ll achieve my pearly whites. It does make my teeth sensitive sometimes, but I use sensodyne so its not a problem. I also keep the gel in my refrigerator..</li>
            <li> Strong his teeth whitening gel I have ever gotten works great and doesn&#x27;t burn</li>
            <li> Great product, works very well, and the three tubes last a really long time. HOWEVER. Follow the directions carefully. They are not kidding when they say avoid getting this stuff on your gums! It will give you a burning sensation in your mouth if you do. Also avoid getting it on your tongue if you&#x27;re doing this every day - your sense of taste will be off for a day or two if there is prolonged contact of this product on your tongue. Expect to slobber quite a bit while using the product too.</li>
            <li> Definitely can see results in a couple of days. Came with plenty of whitening gel for weeks of use. Great buy!</li>
            <li> All i can say is ouch. I don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth and i couldn&#x27;t even keep them in my mouth for more than 45 seconds and my teeth were numb for a few hours and painful</li>
            <li> Even though it doesn&#x27;t come with the light, my teeth are whiter and brighter. A little goes a long way. Yes you do need to be careful not to get on your gums or they will get irritated. I use a cotton swab to apply to my teeth then put the tray in and it works well, plus I am able to make sure my teeth get full coverage.</li>
            <li> As promised you see the positive results from the first application.  Please follow application instructions.</li>
            <li> This product burned my gums within five minutes of using it.  BEWARE!</li>
            <li> Wow 11 dollars for what I used to pay 500 dollars for. I am a smoker I know trying to quit. Anyway I had coffee stains and a little tarter build up on the back of my teeth. Gross I know. I go to the dentist!! But I love a bright white smile. Smoking and coffee ruins the work the dentist does. I took a chance on this one. It works!!! After 4 days the tarter is gone I shouldn&#x27;t say tarter it&#x27;s tobacco uugghh and eeww. My smile is radiant already. Also this is alot of product. At least 4 teeth whitening opportunities. The syringes are huge. I read the reviews and used a qtip to put on the gel then the trays go in. I have gotten this on my gums and ouchie So be careful. I will purchase from this company again. Also you can feel the little peroxide bubbles going to work. Great kit. I highly recommend a remineralization gel to get with this. You can get those off Amazon as well. It cuts down tooth sensitivity and leaves your mouth refreshed. Win win super combo. If you want white teeth this will do it!!</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery, great service, makes my teeth white very fast, much better than the other products I had been using.  Very high recommendation for anyone needing high strength teeth whitening products.</li>
            <li> Let me start off with saying I am usually very lazy when it comes to writing a review.. But I&#x27;m extremely happy with the results of this whitening gel kit. Already 2 shades whiter, the trick is to brush the gel on the teeth and use the light directly on them. The trays aren&#x27;t any good and I feel like the light isn&#x27;t able to penetrate your teeth. With all the gel they give you makes this product well worth the buy. Amazing results in just one day. I spent $200 to do an in house whitening treatment at my dental office and the results were about the same.. But this gel is slightly more gentle then the kind they used. Definitely suggest buying this product.</li>
            <li> This works great in one hour. You need to be careful not to burn your gums. However, this will lose its potency in less than two months. That is why the won&#x27;t let you buy just one.</li>
            <li> Was suppose to cime with binus led light. Did not. Def burns gums if gets on them but whitens well. Trays are cheap. Do not form well.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive and effective tooth whitening kit!&lt;br /&gt;I have trays from the dentist and spent $500 or so back then.&lt;br /&gt;Save some money!  Go with these!!</li>
            <li> Burns the gums too much. Too strong.</li>
            <li> They give you plenty of whitening gel and it&#x27;s a good product but the molding trays are way to difficult to get right. You have to put them into boiling water then press them up to your teeth so that they can mold to your bite. No matter how many times I tried this and I trimmed the trays they were just not a good fit. Every single time I used them I ended up burning my gums with the gel which turns them white and HURTS! I would say buy the gel if you already have custom fitted trays from a dentist.</li>
            <li> works, but trays are a pain!</li>
            <li> Parts of it didn&#x27;t show up. Only whitening gel, no finishing gel. Doesn&#x27;t work at all. Waste of money. Sorry</li>
            <li> Excellent, I&#x27;ve been using for about 3 weeks now, I&#x27;ve used different products and even had a deBristol professionaly whiten them and my teeth are the whitest they hav ever been.&lt;br /&gt;there not super white like you would see some people on tv, but for the cost of the product I&#x27;m very pleased and maybe they will get whiter, that&#x27;s why I only gave 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Be carefull around the gums, could be a little sensitive and will turn them white for some hours.</li>
            <li> i did not like the messy gag feeling, ick.</li>
            <li> Best teeth bleaching agent I&#x27;ve ever used.  Finally my teeth are turning white.  I haven&#x27;t experienced my gums being that sore either with this product, not any more than with less strong teeth bleaches.  Plus the price of this is unbelievably low.</li>
            <li> Used in conjunction with the LED light, this product works as well or better than going to the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> The whitening product does work well. I definitely felt the gum pain even though I only used a tiny bit of gel. I&#x27;m quite sure this is just due to the increased strength of this formula. I would have liked to see better directions and teeth trays, but it still does the trick. The syringes will last an eternity!</li>
            <li> Works just like all the rest--maybe a little stronger.</li>
            <li> Really happy with the product.  Always fresh and great results.</li>
            <li> I recommend this - it worked great for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be careful not to leave it on your gums for too long or it will take off some top layers of skin -- just in the tips of the gum issue between your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled with how fast this worked; I&#x27;ll post some pictures. Like some others, I had some sores on my gums where I let the gel touch them without wiping it away or when I left the gel on a little longer. Barely worth mentioning though because I&#x27;m so happy with the results. I use my Invisalign retainers so I can&#x27;t speak to the trays that come with this. But it definitely WORKS! Fast. I bought the 20-something% gel from my dentist first, and that worked too, just a bit more slowly and with less gum irritation. But this product works faster and is half the price of the gel my dentist sells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it boils down to what you prefer. If you want to go slow &amp; steady, with a gel you can apply before bed and just leave on overnight (which is nice), I&#x27;d get the lower percent gel. If you want fast results and can be careful and tolerate some possible gum sore spots (briefly - heal in a day) and don&#x27;t mind applying for a short time and not sleeping with it on, then I think you&#x27;ll be happy with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus you get a ton of it. I barely used half and I&#x27;m all the way whitened, so I have extra for touch-ups.</li>
            <li> Hey this stuff really worked. I used 8 treatments and saw a difference. My discolored tooth matches my dental work now. I am an avid coffee drinker and am very satisfied with this treatment.</li>
            <li> Great thing for using alongside with your regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Works well. Much cheaper than buying at dental office. Can see results after only 2 uses.</li>
            <li> It works! This is my 3rd order of this product.  I can see the difference almost after each time I use it.</li>
            <li> does a good job.&lt;br /&gt;does not make my teeth hurt or sensitive like others have.&lt;br /&gt;for some reason it stalled out at just 3 shades of whiteness.</li>
            <li> Now this stuff works..!</li>
            <li> Seems to be working, only used it about 3 times.... I have not experience tooth sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Works great, lightened with first use and only in for thirty minutes, same texture as the stuff I bought from my dentist at a fraction of the cost</li>
            <li> was doing my top teeth and no bottom then i realized that my top teeth are WHITE and bottom ones are a completely diff shade. good to know it works but i need to get on them bottom ones. :)</li>
            <li> Awesome.  Took three or four times to figure out how to do the trays, cut them to size with scissors. Very happy wi product. Next time I will lower the strength that I order so I can wear it longer and get more results.  This is so strong I can only leave it on 2-3 minutes before it stings and burns! But works amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m whitening my teeth right now...this is great ...better than any other product.</li>
            <li> Sent the wrong strength at first had to re-ship correct ones.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t complain about the gel. For the price the gel works and that&#x27;s all I wanted anyway. The trays were just extra for me because I already had trays from years ago from my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did try the trays and my only complaint with those is that I couldn&#x27;t keep them in my mouth very long because I couldn&#x27;t spit and my mouth got slobbery before I just had to remove them. I couldn&#x27;t keep them in my mouth longer than 15 minutes. I went back to using my older trays and that worked a lot better for me. Someone else might get these trays to work for them. I have a small mouth anyway so perhaps that&#x27;s why they didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying if you have sensitive teeth like me do not automatically get discouraged by the strength of this product. I purchased this along with arm and hammer sedative toothpaste and brushing with the toothpaste before and after using the gel helps a lot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the review:&lt;br /&gt;I did not use the dental trays provided as I had my own so I cannot comment on those.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the paste, this is the same gel that you purchase from a dentists office but at a much lower price. The gel is the strongest on the market so it will get you results fast. The package arrived extremely quickly and came with clear instructions for use. I leave my trays in overnight and noticed results after the first night! After about 4 or 5 nights of wearing the trays I got to the level of whiteness that I wanted to be at. The package came with 3 syringes full of product but I only used about a quarter of one. I will be purchasing this product again without a doubt!</li>
            <li> works better than most whitening gels on line</li>
            <li> If you are seeking the following pros, then please, FEEL FREE TO PURCHASE. Money wasted.  Should have followed the other negative reviews. I agree 100% w/ one of the other reviews.  Can&#x27;t comment on the trays b/c I had trays that were made by my dentist. Positive reviews must be bogus or friends of the company!!!! BUYER BEWARE...&lt;br /&gt;PROS:  Burns your gums,&lt;br /&gt;  Does not whiten,&lt;br /&gt;  Real gritty mixture,&lt;br /&gt;  Makes you feel nauseous if any is swallowed...&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Inexpensive,&lt;br /&gt;  Lots of gel,&lt;br /&gt;  Trays included,</li>
            <li> The gel seemed to be old/expired...Was difficult to get out of the syringe. Not super happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Love love.  Teeth are SUPER WHITE..I.USE A Q TIP TO APPLY GEL TO EACH TOOTH then put tray in mouth. voila no burn&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;)</li>
            <li> For all I know this product does a great job, but it cause such agony when just a tiny bit touched my gums that I had to stop using it. I was very disappointed but I had to switch to a product with a lower concentration.</li>
            <li> These are amazing but did cause some temporary tooth sensitivity. These worked much better than the expensive crest whitening strips I tried in the paste.</li>
            <li> does not work, best to pay and have your teeth done professionally.</li>
            <li> Now this is a product that works, finally.</li>
            <li> Just started using but so far so good</li>
            <li> I received my order the other day and I just want to start off with the packaging.  I was very underwhelmed with how it was packaged.  The package was partially torn and the trays were disgusting with dust and black stuff on them.  I have my own custom whitening trays so that I hadn&#x27;t planned on using the ones that came with the product but still.  Now as for the get itself.  Ive used it twice already and I feel as if nothing is happening.  I switched from 22 percent given to me by my dentist and that would make my teeth tingle a little bit and this stuff I feel like there is nothing on my teeth.  I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch or what but I feel and notice nothing.  I started noticing the 22 after the first day and thought this would be amazing.  Overall I&#x27;m disappointed with my purchase and I recommend going to your dentist to see if they&#x27;ll give you a higher concentration directly from them.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> good price arrived on time</li>
            <li> Love it!!  Watch getting this on your gums, it burns a bit!!</li>
            <li> One treatment was all it took for me. I&#x27;ve never seen my teeth this white. Burned my gums a little but that was because the trays were very hard to get right. The gel will last, a little goes a long way! Love the results!</li>
