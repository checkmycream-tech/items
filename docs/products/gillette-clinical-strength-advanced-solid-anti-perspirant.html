    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>it&#x27;s awesome</li>
            <li>We buy this by the truckload and even get it on auto-ship from Amazon as that is the best price around, and believe me, I&#x27;ve shopped around.</li>
            <li>OMG this is the best deodorant/anti-perspirant I have ever used and</li>
            <li>It is best to use this product either before going to bed, or after a shower in the night-time so it has time to set up.</li>
            <li>Clinical Strength is a great product.  </li>
            <li>It smells absolutely great.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Even after a very warm and tiring day, I do not have any bed smell.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>free to leave me a comment or question, I’m happy to add anything else you’d like to know about the product.</li>
            <li>free to leave me a comment or question, I’m happy to add anything else you’d like to know about the product.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that if I can&#x27;t find it there again, I will buy it at full-price because for me, it works so well.  </li>
            <li>I thought it must be some kind of a chemical reaction.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t leave any kind of marks on my clothing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The deodorant still goes on strong!  </li>
            <li>I tend to sweat quite a bit and always struggled to find a good anti-perspirant/deodorant that made me feel comfortable (and smell OK) for the duration of the day.  </li>
            <li>Pleasant sent, and does a super strength job...</li>
            <li>I gladly pay the premium for a good product that keeps me comfortable (and free from embarassment!).</li>
            <li>my underarms feel very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>So I turned to Amazon for the next best price.  </li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Sure, I&#x27;ll sweat more, but it beats the heck out of the alternative!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sure, I&#x27;ll sweat more, but it beats the heck out of the alternative!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product for sure</li>
            <li>I have had no clinical strength degree that did better</li>
            <li>I use to take Botox for my hyperhidrosis, and with this I don&#x27;t need it any more.  </li>
            <li>I tend to sweat more during the summer time</li>
            <li>I found that Certain Dri is very effective.</li>
            <li>, why would I give a 1 Star Review to a product that seemingly worked and smelled (for the most part) pretty good?</li>
            <li>and since I work in a job where I am moving all over the building, all throughout the day, I need a strong deodorant to provide maximum protection.</li>
            <li>(I belong to amazon prime, so it was two day shipping for free)</li>
            <li>fragrance free..</li>
            <li>I went to the dry-cleaners and they gave me a free sampled attached to my clothes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the cheapest deodorant, but for those who have hyperhidrosis, this is a fantastic value.  </li>
            <li>good for sensitive skin..</li>
            <li>Not doing it at night time (and right after a shower for me) made me sweat more it</li>
            <li>Try the non clinical solution first, if it works for you, then why pay more?</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve got to preface the rest of this review by saying that I&#x27;m not someone who is prone to allergens; I don&#x27;t avoid any foods; use special detergents; or anything else along those lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>yes, really (I know I should know better than to ask &amp;#</li>
            <li>;, and we quickly moved on.</li>
            <li>It sure would have been convenient to have been able to scratch another item off the physical store list.  </li>
            <li>From the very first time i tried it out there has been no change.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would recommend this for anyone looking for anything a bit better then normal.</li>
            <li>Ultimately though, I relented, and I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li>Ultimately though, I relented, and I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li>So far it has met my needs and left me very pleased and satisfied.</li>
            <li>like the fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It says 2-clicks worth is all you need, so</li>
            <li>During that time, I used both the &#x27;Fresh&#x27; and the &#x27;IMT&#x27; labeled scents.</li>
            <li>This product is worth the investment wholeheartedly.</li>
            <li>Thanks for taking the time to read my review, hopefully this information was useful!</li>
            <li>Will keep searching for the right product.</li>
            <li>The swelling began to appear in my right underarm as well</li>
            <li>Thanks for taking the time to read my review, hopefully this information was useful!rs now.&amp;#34;, and we quickly moved on.</li>
            <li>Different body chemistry means variety is important and must be available.</li>
            <li>The gel kind stain your clothes (usually not permanently) like no other.</li>
            <li>Of the two, I didn&#x27;t really care for the &#x27;Fresh&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This definitely works better then</li>
            <li>Make sure you apply it at night, and then again if necessary in the morning.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>How could it have taken so long for someone to design such a simple product that works effortlessly and flawlessly</li>
            <li>Some women may find it too masculine, but for me, it&#x27;s simply a &#x27;clean&#x27; scent that softens as you wear it.  </li>
            <li>I work out all the time and work up a pretty good sweat and usually do errands around the house before I shower.</li>
            <li>and I get good coverage without all the white flakes of a solid.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While it&#x27;s a bummer that my quest for a great deodorant/antiperspirant has seemingly restarted, it&#x27;s a small price to pay to not have to live with the discomfort (and associated fear)</li>
            <li>/&gt;While it&#x27;s a bummer that my quest for a great deodorant/antiperspirant has seemingly restarted, it&#x27;s a small price to pay to not have to live with the discomfort (and associated fear)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it pretty much is.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because the product is a cream that comes up out of a tube through many small holes, it is easy to roll out too much.  </li>
            <li>Aright, so I seldom speak very highly of a product and give all 5 stars, but this deserves it, why!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>days after my most recent run of lab tests, my wife asked &amp;#34;Why don&#x27;t you try a new deodorant?&amp;#34; I pushed back since this one genuinely seemed to help with my excess sweating and had never caused me a problem before.</li>

            <li>Works very well for me.  </li>
            <li>Been using this since  it came out ,this stuff just works where nothing else ever has just follow directions,one tip is if you shave it really works not a drop I have skipped days in the summertime ,sweating everywhere else</li>
            <li>2-clicks didn&#x27;t produce much of the anti-persperant.</li>
            <li>Was really bummed when they discontinued</li>
            <li>The product doesn&#x27;t really absorb well into the skin</li>
            <li>I suspect that reviewers having these issues are applying too much of it.  </li>
            <li>Price is a bit much in my opinion for it&#x27;s strength though.</li>
            <li>It really did not work.</li>
            <li>tend to sweat more than the average guy, so I appreciated having found a product that gave me some relief in that department.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell and last almost all day long</li>
            <li>Simply the best I have ever used its the dryness of a solid but the ease of spreading of a liquid, my t-shirts no longer have that hard block from gel based</li>
            <li>This product is very strong and long lasting.  </li>
            <li>For years (since about age 15 - I&#x27;m 42 now) I&#x27;ve found few (Mitchum has been the closest to a good daily product for me) anti-perspirant products that have even come close to helping me with wetness and odor control, until now.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I have high hopes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A normal day of running around the city and travelling and</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a few years of searching, this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to get the trial size (0.5 oz) of this from Bed Bath and Beyond for $1 each - which was a steal at a little over $3 for the same quantity available here, but they stopped carrying the trial size some time back.  </li>
            <li>Having used this product for so long, it never occurred to me that I was experiencing some kind of allergy to any of the ingredients (active or otherwise)</li>
            <li>Surprisingly it was broken exactly the same way.  </li>
            <li>We live and we learn.</li>
            <li>Other perscription deoderants made me itch--They have different percentages of their main ingredient, so be sure to test out which one works for you before committing to a purchase.</li>
            <li>I still very frequently have pit stains and moist underarms.</li>
            <li>This product caused me to sweat more than usual.</li>
            <li>In my experience this works just as well as the Gillette all day clean, but is considerably more expensive.</li>
            <li>Clinical strength deodorant is often very costly, particularly at the grocery store or your local pharmacy.  </li>
            <li>This under arm deodorant actually keeps me dry and odor free.</li>
            <li>This is the only anti perspirant and deodorant that has really lasted all day and into the night for me (just ask my wife, who swears that I don&#x27;t smell like I used to...)  </li>
            <li>This deodorant went on my sensitive skin with no reaction whatsoever.</li>
            <li>Old Spice &#x27;Swagger&#x27; deodorant-only stick exclusively instead of an antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>Old Spice &#x27;Swagger&#x27; deodorant-only stick exclusively instead of an antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve attempted to use this product for the last few weeks as instructed, and used a separate antiperspirant during the day like most websites suggested</li>
            <li>/&gt;But unless the price comes down or they increase the size, I can&#x27;t give it a full 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Certain Dri comes in a cheap looking box unlike this false product.</li>
            <li>Prepare to stain both the inside &amp; outside of ur clothing, but if u sweat profusely like I do, you don&#x27;t have much of a choice vs regular pitstick.</li>
            <li>Within 48 hours, the swelling went down by more than half.</li>
            <li>Within 48 hours, the swelling went down by more than half.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product isn&#x27;t invisible and will get on your clothes if you&#x27;re not careful.  </li>
            <li>This product has met my needs in the masculine personal hygiene area.</li>
            <li>As someone else said, it will really cut down on sweating, but for those who chronically sweat a lot, it&#x27;s not perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, the subscription purchase feature is really convenient-and ends up costing less than buying two sticks in the store.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is really powerful so as the saying goes, &amp;#34;a little dab will do you,&amp;#34; and it also makes this product last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> /&gt;After a few years of searching, this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I used to be able to get the trial size (0.5 oz) of this from Bed Bath and Beyond for $1 each - which was a steal at a little over $3 for the same quantity available here, but they stopped carrying the trial size some time back.  </li>
            <li> Having used this product for so long, it never occurred to me that I was experiencing some kind of allergy to any of the ingredients (active or otherwise)</li>
            <li> Surprisingly it was broken exactly the same way.  </li>
            <li> We live and we learn.</li>
            <li> Other perscription deoderants made me itch--They have different percentages of their main ingredient, so be sure to test out which one works for you before committing to a purchase.</li>
            <li> I still very frequently have pit stains and moist underarms.</li>
            <li> This product caused me to sweat more than usual.</li>
            <li> In my experience this works just as well as the Gillette all day clean, but is considerably more expensive.</li>
            <li> Clinical strength deodorant is often very costly, particularly at the grocery store or your local pharmacy.  </li>
            <li> This under arm deodorant actually keeps me dry and odor free.</li>
            <li> This is the only anti perspirant and deodorant that has really lasted all day and into the night for me (just ask my wife, who swears that I don&#x27;t smell like I used to...)  </li>
            <li> This deodorant went on my sensitive skin with no reaction whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Old Spice &#x27;Swagger&#x27; deodorant-only stick exclusively instead of an antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> Old Spice &#x27;Swagger&#x27; deodorant-only stick exclusively instead of an antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve attempted to use this product for the last few weeks as instructed, and used a separate antiperspirant during the day like most websites suggested</li>
            <li> /&gt;But unless the price comes down or they increase the size, I can&#x27;t give it a full 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Certain Dri comes in a cheap looking box unlike this false product.</li>
            <li> Prepare to stain both the inside &amp; outside of ur clothing, but if u sweat profusely like I do, you don&#x27;t have much of a choice vs regular pitstick.</li>
            <li> Within 48 hours, the swelling went down by more than half.</li>
            <li> Within 48 hours, the swelling went down by more than half.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product isn&#x27;t invisible and will get on your clothes if you&#x27;re not careful.  </li>
            <li> This product has met my needs in the masculine personal hygiene area.</li>
            <li> As someone else said, it will really cut down on sweating, but for those who chronically sweat a lot, it&#x27;s not perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, the subscription purchase feature is really convenient-and ends up costing less than buying two sticks in the store.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is really powerful so as the saying goes, &amp;#34;a little dab will do you,&amp;#34; and it also makes this product last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ended up having blood labs done a few weeks apart, and after being poked and prodded every which way--we found that everything was either in normal ranges, or inconclusive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ended up having blood labs done a few weeks apart, and after being poked and prodded every which way--we found that everything was either in normal ranges, or inconclusive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used the old spice pro-strength swagger for a few years, and definitely grew to rely on it&#x27;s performance.</li>
            <li> because even through tough workouts and long days, this product holds up!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had anything that kept my pits so fresh smelling and kept the sweat under control, so</li>
            <li> Besides not working well, it caused a strange odor for both of us.  </li>
            <li> Strange that it happened to both of us though.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll see how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> I like using this type of deodorant due to it is very long lasting.  </li>
            <li> It was very strange.</li>
            <li> It went on dry and without any fragrance to it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works...goes on dry..</li>
            <li> I recommend this for the active individual who&#x27;s always on the go!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bigger guy that is active and my wife suggested some &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Again, a small amount is really all you need to apply, and to avoid this problem, use a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I lucked out and found this product at a local closeout store for 80% off.  </li>
            <li> When we opened the first on the piece at the bottom that you turn to get deodorant to come out was broken off so it wouldn&#x27;t dispense the deodorant.</li>
            <li> No regular deodorant could withstand me for some odd reason.</li>
            <li> Once again another clinical-strength deodorant with the sticky white residue mess.  </li>
            <li> so after ordering this you basically do not need to buy any other deodorants for a long time.</li>
            <li> One of the few that actually produces results.</li>
            <li> Over the next few days however--she did not.</li>
            <li> any other I&#x27;ve tried, but only a little bit.</li>
            <li> Getting these 2-3 packs online saves the trouble of hunting down a sale and often are delivered to your doorstep the next business day with Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using other deo&#x27;s AXE etc with no problem</li>
            <li> It was no better than regular antiperspirant.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up going to my doctor, who initially thought I might have anything from a small infection, up to the possibility of Lymphoma--</li>
            <li> The smell is not so sharp, sport smell; but a smoother one.</li>
            <li> I have since searched for side effects to the active ingredient (Aluminum Zirconium trichlorohydrex Gly, 20%), and found that I am not alone in this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I tend to sweat quite a bit and always struggled to find a good anti-perspirant/deodorant that made me feel comfortable (and smell OK) for the duration of the day.  Found this product a couple of years ago and never looked back.  I used to be able to get the trial size (0.5 oz) of this from Bed Bath and Beyond for $1 each - which was a steal at a little over $3 for the same quantity available here, but they stopped carrying the trial size some time back.  So I turned to Amazon for the next best price.  I gladly pay the premium for a good product that keeps me comfortable (and free from embarassment!).</li>
            <li> As someone else said, it will really cut down on sweating, but for those who chronically sweat a lot, it&#x27;s not perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, with some exercise and some omega 3, my anxiety becomes low enough for this to work for me.</li>
            <li> Its only one time application and I just can&#x27;t dare to try it again..caused dryness in my underarms and it just wouldn&#x27;t go away. I&#x27;ve been using other deo&#x27;s AXE etc with no problem so i know my skin was not the issue. Don&#x27;t want to recommend this product</li>
            <li> This is the only anti perspirant and deodorant that has really lasted all day and into the night for me (just ask my wife, who swears that I don&#x27;t smell like I used to...)  Also, the subscription purchase feature is really convenient-and ends up costing less than buying two sticks in the store.  Other perscription deoderants made me itch--They have different percentages of their main ingredient, so be sure to test out which one works for you before committing to a purchase.</li>
            <li> One of the few that actually produces results. I have to use it at night and the next morning to get it to work instead of just at night as recommended. But that&#x27;s better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant that works for me it&#x27;s awesome</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a difficult time locating an anti-perspirant deodorant that would do the trick.  For years (since about age 15 - I&#x27;m 42 now) I&#x27;ve found few (Mitchum has been the closest to a good daily product for me) anti-perspirant products that have even come close to helping me with wetness and odor control, until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette Clinical Strength is a great product.  I use it at night before bed (currently battling perimenopausal night sweats), and then in the morning when I go to the gym I have the option to re-apply it or not.  It works THAT well!  It is tough to shave your underarm after applying this stuff (makes the underarm tacky, providing a wetness barrier), but it does what it promises, and keeps wetness and odor under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fresh scent.  Some women may find it too masculine, but for me, it&#x27;s simply a &#x27;clean&#x27; scent that softens as you wear it.  I don&#x27;t find it competing with my perfume and haven&#x27;t noticed it to be overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the product is a cream that comes up out of a tube through many small holes, it is easy to roll out too much.  I have had problems with over-application and feel like I wasted some that way.  Just be aware of this, and roll up only a small amount at a time when using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product isn&#x27;t invisible and will get on your clothes if you&#x27;re not careful.  Again, a small amount is really all you need to apply, and to avoid this problem, use a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I lucked out and found this product at a local closeout store for 80% off.  I can honestly say that if I can&#x27;t find it there again, I will buy it at full-price because for me, it works so well.  I no longer worry about &#x27;pitting out&#x27; my clothing or offensive odors from my armpits.</li>
            <li> Works very well for me.  This is basically the prescription strength just a different form of aluminum.  No complaints for me at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in hopes that it would have solved my issue, but it didn&#x27;t! From the very first time i tried it out there has been no change. I then thought that maybe my body needs to get used to it, well the its almost done and there has been no change, i still sweat the same. Now i have o figure out what am going to do with the extra one it came with... throw it out i guess.</li>
            <li> I like using this type of deodorant due to it is very long lasting.  I work out all the time and work up a pretty good sweat and usually do errands around the house before I shower. The deodorant still goes on strong!  A normal day of running around the city and travelling and my underarms feel very comfortable.  I recommend this for the active individual who&#x27;s always on the go!</li>
            <li> Been using this since  it came out ,this stuff just works where nothing else ever has just follow directions,one tip is if you shave it really works not a drop I have skipped days in the summertime ,sweating everywhere else but not a drop in the PITS!!!!!</li>
            <li> Although I didn&#x27;t follow the directions and use at night, I still don&#x27;t feel this product delivers. I put it on every morning and still ended up sweating. Not happy.</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant that has actually worked for me in the summer. It smells absolutely great. It also keeps my shirts dry even when I am working out hard in the gym. I heard some clinical strength deodorants burn the underarm, this one does not.</li>
            <li> Pluses and Minuses:  + The savings were 48.9% over my local drug store without a coupon.  (With a $2 coupon, it would have still been a savings.)  - You have to buy two instead of one  - You might have to add in shipping costs when you compare! (I belong to amazon prime, so it was two day shipping for free)</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I tried this deodorant.  It was no better than regular antiperspirant.  Besides not working well, it caused a strange odor for both of us.  I thought it must be some kind of a chemical reaction.  Strange that it happened to both of us though.  I called the company to tell them about this, and they were less than helpful.</li>
            <li> This deodorant went on my sensitive skin with no reaction whatsoever. That is saying a lot for this product. It went on dry and without any fragrance to it. It didn&#x27;t leave any kind of marks on my clothing.&lt;br /&gt;Works...goes on dry..good for sensitive skin..fragrance free..&lt;br /&gt;You just can&#x27;t beat that!&lt;br /&gt;Well Done Gillette!</li>
            <li> I order this item after reading all reviews.  I got to say that it did not make a difference.  The perspiration is still the same.  I may be working for some, but did not work for me at all.  I followed all directions for day and night.  Will keep searching for the right product.</li>
            <li> This product caused me to sweat more than usual. It was very strange. I found that Certain Dri is very effective. Certain Dri comes in a cheap looking box unlike this false product. You may want to check it out.</li>
            <li> In terms of its effectiveness, it&#x27;s 5 stars. In terms of how it smells, I give it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s costly, and about 3/4th the size of a regular stick of anti-persperant deodorant. I found one at CVS for about $10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says 2-clicks worth is all you need, so I&#x27;ll see how long it lasts. 2-clicks didn&#x27;t produce much of the anti-persperant. So I have high hopes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But unless the price comes down or they increase the size, I can&#x27;t give it a full 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I used the old spice pro-strength swagger for a few years, and definitely grew to rely on it&#x27;s performance. Was really bummed when they discontinued and i actually bought about 5 from a CVS when they told me they were discontinuing it. Eventually when I ran out, I decided to try Gilette&#x27;s version, in hopes that it would be similar. I&#x27;d say it pretty much is.</li>
            <li> The husband is a real stinker and sweats profusely.    At the end of the day, I can smell only a FAINT smell of perspiration in his shirts.  This stuff is a MIRACLE!!      We buy this by the truckload and even get it on auto-ship from Amazon as that is the best price around, and believe me, I&#x27;ve shopped around.</li>
            <li> Once again another clinical-strength deodorant with the sticky white residue mess.  Prepare to stain both the inside &amp; outside of ur clothing, but if u sweat profusely like I do, you don&#x27;t have much of a choice vs regular pitstick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve attempted to use this product for the last few weeks as instructed, and used a separate antiperspirant during the day like most websites suggested and I still sweat profusely. The product doesn&#x27;t really absorb well into the skin and I hate how it&#x27;s a cream form. Might want to try a different brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying that I&#x27;ve used this product (multiple sticks) for over a year now. During that time, I used both the &#x27;Fresh&#x27; and the &#x27;IMT&#x27; labeled scents. Of the two, I didn&#x27;t really care for the &#x27;Fresh&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to sweat more than the average guy, so I appreciated having found a product that gave me some relief in that department. Note though, that if you buy this deodorant thinking that it&#x27;s going to keep you from sweating altogether, you probably need to adjust your expectations and maybe try a prescription like Drysol to get you closer to that goal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, why would I give a 1 Star Review to a product that seemingly worked and smelled (for the most part) pretty good? Two words: Swollen. Underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got to preface the rest of this review by saying that I&#x27;m not someone who is prone to allergens; I don&#x27;t avoid any foods; use special detergents; or anything else along those lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Up until recently, I had no qualms whatsoever with this product, and no side effects to speak of... then, a couple of months ago, I noticed in the shower that my left underarm was swollen and a bit tender. After I got cleaned up, I came downstairs and expressed the concern to my wife. She thought I was nuts. Over the next few days however--she did not. The swelling began to appear in my right underarm as well (it looked like a halved tennis ball under each arm). Having used this product for so long, it never occurred to me that I was experiencing some kind of allergy to any of the ingredients (active or otherwise) within.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up going to my doctor, who initially thought I might have anything from a small infection, up to the possibility of Lymphoma--yes, really (I know I should know better than to ask &amp;#34;What&#x27;s the worst case scenario here?&amp;#34;, but sometimes I just can&#x27;t help myself). In one appointment, he even asked me if I had changed deodorants recently, and I told him &amp;#34;No, I&#x27;m using the same one I have for years now.&amp;#34;, and we quickly moved on. I ended up having blood labs done a few weeks apart, and after being poked and prodded every which way--we found that everything was either in normal ranges, or inconclusive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some days after my most recent run of lab tests, my wife asked &amp;#34;Why don&#x27;t you try a new deodorant?&amp;#34; I pushed back since this one genuinely seemed to help with my excess sweating and had never caused me a problem before. Ultimately though, I relented, and I&#x27;m glad I did! Within 48 hours, the swelling went down by more than half. I have since searched for side effects to the active ingredient (Aluminum Zirconium trichlorohydrex Gly, 20%), and found that I am not alone in this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it&#x27;s a bummer that my quest for a great deodorant/antiperspirant has seemingly restarted, it&#x27;s a small price to pay to not have to live with the discomfort (and associated fear) that popped up out of nowhere with this product. In the interim, I&#x27;m electing to use [[ASIN:B008HQ8M0Y this]] Old Spice &#x27;Swagger&#x27; deodorant-only stick exclusively instead of an antiperspirant. Sure, I&#x27;ll sweat more, but it beats the heck out of the alternative!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recognize that my case is an anomaly, but all the same, please exercise caution when using this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to leave me a comment or question, I’m happy to add anything else you’d like to know about the product.

            <li> Not all Anti-Perspirants / Deodorants are created equal. After years of trying this one or that one. I can now say that I have found what I&#x27;ve been looking for. This product has met my needs in the masculine personal hygiene area. So far it has met my needs and left me very pleased and satisfied. It has a nice smell and last almost all day long There is no one size fits all when it comes to personal care Different body chemistry means variety is important and must be available. I would recommend this product for sure but it has to be individually tried on a case by case basis. For me it&#x27;s a winner, I give it five stars * * * * * .</li>
            <li> I have always used Arm and Hammer Deodorant/Anti-Perspirant. I noticed I was still sweating and that it was not working as well as it used to.    I went to the dry-cleaners and they gave me a free sampled attached to my clothes. I gave it a try and OMG this is the best deodorant/anti-perspirant I have ever used and I will use this forever!    I highly recommend this to anyone whom is currently not happy with their anti-perspirant/deodorant!</li>
            <li> In my experience this works just as well as the Gillette all day clean, but is considerably more expensive. Try the non clinical solution first, if it works for you, then why pay more?</li>
            <li> I thought I would save a trip to the store with this one.  I guess I was wrong.  When we opened the first on the piece at the bottom that you turn to get deodorant to come out was broken off so it wouldn&#x27;t dispense the deodorant. So we opened the second one.  Surprisingly it was broken exactly the same way.  Returning this one for a refund.  Amazon Prime, so there are no issues with the return.  Some things I guess you just need to pick up while you are at the store.  It sure would have been convenient to have been able to scratch another item off the physical store list.  Oh well.  We live and we learn.</li>
            <li> If you find that lesser deodorants cause you to rash or just don&#x27;t work, then spend the extra dollar or so and buy these.  This product is very strong and long lasting.  I have not have any issues with staining, residue, etc.  I suspect that reviewers having these issues are applying too much of it.  This stuff is really powerful so as the saying goes, &amp;#34;a little dab will do you,&amp;#34; and it also makes this product last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And getting them through the Amazon subscription service is totally clutch.</li>
            <li> My son used this and it&#x27;s the only thing that seems to help him.</li>
            <li> This under arm deodorant actually keeps me dry and odor free. No more wet. No more smell. That is no small feat, since none of the other products have worked for me. I have even used it inside of my tennis shoes and yes it works there too. Great product.</li>
            <li> I usually used Axe, tried the Axe clinical strength once, and a few other random ones, they all seem to work about the same - not at all. This definitely works better then any other I&#x27;ve tried, but only a little bit. I still very frequently have pit stains and moist underarms. Make sure you apply it at night, and then again if necessary in the morning. Not doing it at night time (and right after a shower for me) made me sweat more it seems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for anyone looking for anything a bit better then normal. Price is a bit much in my opinion for it&#x27;s strength though. I will keep looking when these run out (one seems to last a month or so), and will hopefully find one that&#x27;s stronger and/or not gel! The gel kind stain your clothes (usually not permanently) like no other.</li>
            <li> Aright, so I seldom speak very highly of a product and give all 5 stars, but this deserves it, why!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well because even through tough workouts and long days, this product holds up!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had anything that kept my pits so fresh smelling and kept the sweat under control, so I def recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use two clicks under each arm and that still does the trick (on lighter days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try you wont be disappointed, I have to reorder.</li>
            <li> Bought this to try to help my sweating. It really did not work. I have had no clinical strength degree that did better</li>
            <li> I use to take Botox for my hyperhidrosis, and with this I don&#x27;t need it any more.  It&#x27;s not the cheapest deodorant, but for those who have hyperhidrosis, this is a fantastic value.  It started working for me after just a few days and I sweat 3-5% of what I use to sweat.</li>
            <li> Simply the best I have ever used its the dryness of a solid but the ease of spreading of a liquid, my t-shirts no longer have that hard block from gel based and I get good coverage without all the white flakes of a solid.  Plus it lasts all day no matter how hard I push my body</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bigger guy that is active and my wife suggested some &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; deodorant when I started to experience some irritation when the usual deodorant just wasn&#x27;t holding up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few years of searching, this is my favorite. Pleasant sent, and does a super strength job...just don&#x27;t accidentally get it into your eye! ;)</li>
            <li> 1. The smell is not so sharp, sport smell; but a smoother one. I like it because I can use my perfume on it.&lt;br /&gt;2. It prevents my arm pits to sweat. Even after a very warm and tiring day, I do not have any bed smell.&lt;br /&gt;3. One of them will probably enough for you about a month. It comes with a packed of two. so after ordering this you basically do not need to buy any other deodorants for a long time.</li>
            <li> Clinical strength deodorant is often very costly, particularly at the grocery store or your local pharmacy.  Getting these 2-3 packs online saves the trouble of hunting down a sale and often are delivered to your doorstep the next business day with Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> How could it have taken so long for someone to design such a simple product that works effortlessly and flawlessly</li>
            <li> this works well for me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i don&#x27;t necessarily sweat a lot but like to walk to/ from work which is about 1.5 miles and without it i would end up getting there not fresh - not a problem since I started using this</li>
            <li> I tend to sweat a lot and since I work in a job where I am moving all over the building, all throughout the day, I need a strong deodorant to provide maximum protection.</li>
            <li> I was a guy who had serious sweat issues. No regular deodorant could withstand me for some odd reason. Then I was turned to this. It is best to use this product either before going to bed, or after a shower in the night-time so it has time to set up. This stuff holds up in the hottest climates! This product is worth the investment wholeheartedly.</li>
            <li> I tend to sweat more during the summer time so I thought I would upgrade to a stronger antiperspirant but instead it made me sweat more&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could give this item 0 stars</li>
