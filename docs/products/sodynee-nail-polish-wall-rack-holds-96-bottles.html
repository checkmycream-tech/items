            <li>This was a birthday gift for my daughter who is 23 and does her own nails.  </li>
            <li>It will look really nice when I find a place to hang it some day.</li>
            <li>and she was thrilled..</li>
            <li>It holds up nicely.</li>
            <li>Product was nice and as pictured.</li>
            <li>Fits nicely on any wall.</li>
            <li>It is well made and looks nice.</li>
            <li>Nice unit.  </li>
            <li>It came with a separate header piece that said \\&quot;polish station\\&quot;, but it looks kind of tacky, so I&#x27;m not using it.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this rack!!</li>
            <li>My craft room and nail polish collection were the main focus of this revamp, and I couldn&#x27;t have done it without this awesome nail polish rack.</li>
            <li>Great item, super fast shipping very happy</li>
            <li>It did come with a very cute top plate that says &amp;#34;Nail Station&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased :)</li>
            <li>I received it very quickly, and I was able to fit 102 polish bottles!!!</li>
            <li>Great quality product and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>I wouldnt consider this salon worthy but it great for &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; people storage.</li>
            <li>Very Cool!  Very easy to install.  </li>
            <li>It was very easy to install.  </li>
            <li>We have not attached the rack to the wall yet but looks very easy to do so.</li>
            <li>it is very easy to hang and holds all of my polishes.  </li>
            <li>i couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied!</li>
            <li>She filled the rack right away and is very happy with this solution to her polish collection.  </li>
            <li>Will be buying more very soon!!!!!</li>
            <li>Honestly, I could not ask for more.</li>
            <li>If you install it correctly, it&#x27;s a good, secure way to store and display all your nail polish.</li>
            <li>because I don&#x27;t own nearly as many of bottles of Butter London or Nicole by OPI as I do in China Glaze.</li>
            <li>This was perfect for all my nail polish....makes my &amp;#34;girl room&amp;#34; look professional &amp; organized.</li>
            <li>My solution was to attach some shelving brackets underneath to help and so far, it has held up great!  </li>
            <li>It was easy to install and fits all of her polishes and nail supplies!</li>
            <li>Easy to hang!</li>
            <li>Easy to put on the wall!</li>
            <li>but now it&#x27;s up and strong !</li>
            <li>Perfect fit on the wall  came so fast and packed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It can fit a great amount of nail polish but the tall nail polish don&#x27;t fit in it</li>
            <li>great buy, bought it as a gift for my 15 year old niece and see loved it...</li>
            <li>This product was exactly as described and will work out great for what I need if for.</li>
            <li>Love love love love love it!</li>
            <li>was what it appeared to be in picture,  Fit my space perfectly, looks good and finally all my nail polishes are organized as opposed to thrown in a drawer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made very cheaply, but will get the job done.  </li>
            <li>It is so easy to see which shades we want now, and adds a nice touch of color to the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I originally ordered one rack &amp; was very pleased, so I decided to order another.</li>
            <li>Depending on what brands you fill it with it can fit significantly more than 96 bottles on each!</li>
            <li>Now I am able to choose my polish at a glance and can easily know what I own.  </li>
            <li>So, I applaud this seller for providing accurate information!</li>
            <li>96 bottles is an estimate of how many it holds.</li>
            <li>I love it...</li>
            <li>I plan to purchase many more bottles. :)</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t know my wife and daughter had so many nail polish bottles.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I think I may have gotten more than 96 bottle on the rack, but I didn&#x27;t count them, so I can&#x27;t say for sure.</li>
            <li>and I ordered this and love it.  </li>
            <li>Thank you!  :)</li>
            <li>It screws into the wall with 2 screws at the top.  </li>
            <li>Item delivered on time, was as described love it</li>
            <li>but it was perfect outside of that.</li>
            <li>if you have polish you want to display get this one you will love it.</li>
            <li>Great product and fast shipping</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this nail polish rack.</li>

            <li>I use this to hold my essential oils and it works awesome</li>

            <li>I have so many nail polishes.</li>
            <li>I love seeing them all displayed out like that.</li>
            <li>I love this rack.</li>
            <li>It is so much better than our plastic bin of polish.</li>
            <li>The size is more for a business .</li>
            <li>but the process would cost me more money</li>
            <li>It came with a label header to go on top, however the holes on the header dont line up with ones on the display.</li>
            <li>We have so many polishes</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>Most of my nail polishes are OPI or Essie</li>
            <li>Love the look of it in my room.</li>
            <li>different brand I have of polish fits PERFECT.</li>
            <li>so it can hold all your polish safely.</li>
            <li>I love this , I just wish it was cheaper .</li>
            <li>The quality is excellent and I love being able to actually see all of my polish!</li>
            <li>so I have more room to work.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>my daughter and I have over 60 bottles of nail polish and plenty more will still fit!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, and great packaging.</li>
            <li>I have mostly OPI and China Glaze</li>
            <li>I LOVE MY WALL DISPLAY</li>
            <li>Totally satisfied.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize I had SOOOO many nail polishes until I put them all in one location with this wall rack.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li>I love this nailpolish rack....</li>

            <li>It was packed for safe travels.  </li>
            <li>I like these shelves a lot more than my countertop racks as they display the polishes better and save a lot of space.  </li>
            <li>This was perfect to store all my polishes vs. having them in several (shoebox) storage containers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>grandkids love the &amp;#34;Nail Station&amp;#34</li>
            <li>can not wait for more ads on nail polish and hair products.</li>
            <li>Fits perfect and slim line enough to where it does not interfere with the door.</li>
            <li>My wife and daughter love this.</li>
            <li>but I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>It was also packaged really nice and secure to avoid damage.</li>
            <li>Packaged well for safe delivery.</li>
            <li>I am SO glad I got this.  </li>
            <li>I really love this item.  </li>
            <li>and I love them to death.</li>
            <li>Can put some taller items on the top shelf.</li>
            <li>I have a mix of polish brands on there, most of them being Zoya.</li>
            <li>so I can get more on there.</li>
            <li>The top row was off about an eighth of an inch.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Excellent product - this is the second one I&#x27;ve bought!</li>
            <li>I am still in love with this rack!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>My wife had so many nail polish bottles that were in</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>This is wonderful, I love that I can see all my different polishes at once!!</li>
            <li>no you will have to buy more to fill it</li>
            <li>make sure you use all tools sent to put it up.</li>
            <li>and I think it holds more than 96 bottles</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really in love with this</li>
            <li>, I think I&#x27;m going to buy 2 more</li>
            <li>It holds all my nail polishes very well, and looks great.  </li>
            <li>I love that all of my polishes are neatly organized and out of the way.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I LOVE IT...</li>
            <li>THANK YOU to EVERYONE who had a hand in this :-)  </li>
            <li>Nail polish display (better for businesses)</li>
            <li>cause you for sure find what you looking for easier-faster, and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping that once it&#x27;s filled up with polish bottles, the imperfections won&#x27;t be as noticeable and it will still look nice.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this nail polish rack:&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>well those are most of what I have.</li>
            <li>I mostly have China Glaze and have no issues with it.</li>
            <li>top piece and has a lot more visible glue around the shelves.  </li>
            <li>Wish I could have room for more.</li>
            <li>I wish the acrylic had been a ilttle thicker, or better quality (rounded edges maybe?).</li>
            <li>I have all sorts of brands and some take up more room than others.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m able to put all my nail polish in there....</li>
            <li>It was surrounded by styrofoam to keep it safe, but the bottom shelf was in pieces.  </li>
            <li>I love the Nail polish rack.</li>
            <li>ah i&#x27;m in love with the rack and nail polish so helpful</li>
            <li>Works great and it&#x27;t filling up fast.</li>
            <li>Holds so many bottles of nail polish.  </li>
            <li>One was a gift and since I needed more space I bought another.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It holds so many nail polishes.</li>
            <li>it holds so many bottles, now I don&#x27;t have to guess what colors I have</li>
            <li>it did come with a section that you can add to the top that says &amp;#34;polish station&amp;#34; but it is optional (not attached)</li>
            <li>All my friends are in amazement and jealous when they come and look at my nail polish collection. :-)</li>
            <li>I enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love this polish rack</li>
            <li>Fits all my polish easily &amp; makes things very easy to find now.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a very strong plastic looks like glass almost its really strong</li>
            <li>It has so much space and displays all of my polishes in a very nice way.</li>
            <li>looks clean and tidy.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this rack for anyone with a large polish collection who wants to be able to see all of their beautiful colors better!  </li>
            <li>And Does Come With A Super Nice Top Sign, &amp;#34;Reads Polish Station&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Good product is pretty and durable</li>
            <li>I am so excited!  </li>
            <li>It hung easily in my nieces bathroom and held many polish bottles.  </li>
            <li>but it is super handy and comes with a &amp;#34;nail station&amp;#34; sign.  </li>
            <li>I easily took off the top part that said Polish Station.</li>
            <li>Mounted it to the back of my linen closet door (fit perfectly).  </li>
            <li>This polish rack is the perfect size for a salon that is limited on space.  </li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s clear, the polish is easy to see and the colors are beautifully displayed.</li>
            <li>I am VERY happy with the other product as it is more decorative and still functional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really enjoy being able to see all of my nail polish at once.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m able to fit 15 OPI polishes per shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are six rows and I have four rows filled still with plenty of room for more.</li>
            <li>I was able to fit 94 bottles.</li>
            <li>I love this thing, it&#x27;s filled up and now I need another one.</li>
            <li>It looks great that way and the colors flow seamlessly.</li>
            <li>I use this to hold my polish and so far it works great.</li>
            <li>So if you have a lot of Nicole opi polishes just know you&#x27;ll barely be able to fit them.</li>
            <li>I was able to fit 92 bottles of polish, OPI, Sephora for OPI, China Glaze, Orly and Zoya.</li>
            <li>Brands like OPI would fit about that many,</li>
            <li>It came a day before the expected shipping date and was packaged wonderfully!</li>
            <li>cuz I was able to fit 120</li>
            <li>I even placed my art nail colors in it, most of them fit but</li>
            <li>I really love how it looks on the wall and how the polishes fit.</li>
            <li>Perfect solution for the semi-large volume of nail polish bottles laying around the house with no real place to put them...</li>
            <li>If you also have those 2-oz bottles of acrylic paint used for nail art, they will fit on the top shelf.</li>
            <li>DAUGHTER LOVED IT AND WANTS ANOTHER</li>
            <li>I love seeing my glitter polish and being able to pick out quickly the colors I want.</li>
            <li>I originally bought one and realized i had way more polishes than I thought</li>
            <li>I purchased this nail polish rack for my daughter and my neice last Christmas, and they absolutely loved them!  </li>
            <li>It came with mounting supplies and was super easy to install!  </li>
            <li>Perfect in my daughters bather for all her nail polish and other items.</li>
            <li>and it makes finding what color you want more fun!</li>
            <li>The third-party seller I purchased from -- Beauticom -- also imposes a 15% restocking fee, making returning the item cost as much or more than the original purchase price.</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s a constant reminder to put these gorgeous colors to use!</li>
            <li>Easy to hang</li>

            <li>It hangs easily and is housing all my polish with room to expand.  </li>
            <li>I received this rack very quickly and it met my expectations.</li>
            <li>It was so easy to put up and</li>
            <li>easy to put on my wall</li>
            <li>It was lightweight and easy to hang.</li>
            <li>Easy for me (a woman) to mount on a wall by myself without any help.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to set up</li>
            <li>It was easy to put up and we used the &amp;#34;Polish Station&amp;#34; sign that came with it.  </li>
            <li>Easy to install&lt;br /</li>
            <li>This shelf is easy to wall mount.</li>
            <li>It was REALLY EASY to install in my wall</li>
            <li>Fairly easy to hang.</li>
            <li>Not the most attractive piece if you have to glue it all back together, though.</li>
            <li>The product is strong, well made, holds 96 bottles of polish and can sit on a table or be hung on a wall or door.</li>
            <li>I bought this in 2012 and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li>strong material</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s actually really strong and sturdy</li>
            <li>of my polishes with stranger shaped bottles don&#x27;t fit (ie my Nicole by OPI), but most of my bottles, including Gelish, fit just fine.</li>
            <li>Now I know exactly what colors I own.</li>
            <li>she liked it so much we got her another one!</li>
            <li>this nail polish rack was exactly what i needed to hold all of my nail polishes at my own home.  </li>
            <li>Hanging it was super easy too, as it came pre-drilled with holes at the top of the unit and four screws with matching plastic wall anchors to help bear weight.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very nice rack with lot&#x27;s of room for your polishes it has a nice rack to protect the polishes from falling, however when received it was cracked and had to be glued together, but that was due to the way it was handled through delivery.</li>
            <li>Hung just fine</li>
            <li>so it does the job fine for her.</li>
            <li>The product itself is pretty and it looks nice and secure.</li>
            <li>Apparently the clinking REALLY bothered him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is perfect.</li>
            <li>Well now they are all out and available for easy selection (she has them sorted by color in the rack).  </li>
            <li>The material is cheap and I could tell that can easily break, even the shelf looks like they could break anytime with weight...</li>
            <li>It does hold OPI nail polish just fine and does hold about 96 bottles</li>
            <li>does the job fine though</li>
            <li>I used some plastic adhesive and it works just fine.  </li>
            <li>Well Made And Looks Super In My Shop!</li>
            <li>This looks super cute, though.</li>
            <li>Organized all my polishes well and received quickly!</li>
            <li>High quality and made exceptionally.  </li>
            <li>Now I feel like I really don&#x27;t have that many polishes!</li>
            <li>revlon they all fit fine.</li>
            <li>Orly&#x27;s, Lippman&#x27;s, Essie&#x27;s, OPI, China Glaze, Loreal, Revlon and Salon Express fit on there just fine.</li>
            <li>but if the shelf was just a little bit deeper, it would be perfect.</li>
            <li>The measurements are accurate at 24&amp;#34; H x 21&amp;#34; W x 2&amp;#34</li>
            <li>2nd one I have bought, it is great.</li>
            <li>Sturdy and holds the polish securely.</li>
            <li>some of the bottles won&#x27;t fit</li>
            <li>it were cheap.</li>
            <li>This is the 3rd 90 count nail polish rack I have ordered from Amazon, great price, packaging and ship time.</li>
            <li>Seems secure and the shelves are holding up well.</li>
            <li>I can fit around 15 to 16 bottles per row</li>
            <li>- Can you really fit 90?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap looking and feeling.  </li>
            <li>It has four holes to secure it to the wall</li>
            <li>so I can have my polish on display and have it be protected from the light.</li>
            <li>Everything but OPI fit, you just have to turn them sideways.</li>
            <li>Both girly and practical, these are a great way to organize some of the chaos that teenage girls&#x27; rooms hold.  </li>
            <li>Made rather cheaply.</li>
            <li>I also received no screws/fasteners to hang it up; which is kind of the whole point of a &amp;#34;wall rack&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It gives a great visual of what colors I have.</li>
            <li>For the price, these racks are fantastic.</li>
            <li>The description says that they fit all brands.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind the look of acrylic, they would probably be great as spice racks or for holding similarly shaped items.</li>
            <li>Overall she is happy with it.</li>
            <li>but after you put your polish on it and hang it on the wall it doesn&#x27;t look that big anymore, it just looks great.</li>
            <li>My rack fit 98 bottles.</li>
            <li>beware that is looks cheap.</li>
            <li>So on one rack I can fit over 100 bottles.</li>
            <li>Overall, it was a great purchase</li>
            <li>I can fit 16 Zoya bottles per row, which is 96 bottles of polish.</li>
            <li>arrived in great condition and holds different shapes of polish bottles.</li>
            <li>; sound he&#x27;d hear while I did that.</li>
            <li>Although if you have Nicole by OPI brand nail polish, those irregular shaped bottles don&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>and they all fit.</li>
            <li>They all fit.  </li>
            <li>great product especially for someone who loves to buy nail polish</li>
            <li>, it looks cheap you can see the glue.  </li>
            <li>All my nail polishes fit in this rack.</li>
            <li>and it is almost filled.</li>
            <li>I am so happy I finally bought this nail polish rack it has made all my dreams come true&amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>I did not use cause this is only for my personal use, it comes already assambled all you have to do is attach it to the wall with two screws I placed mine in my walking closet wall and is honestly the best way to organize your nail polish</li>
            <li>: It does fit a lot of nail polishes  </li>
            <li>but it filled this rack up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i will buy another rack soon to fit the rest of my polish .</li>
            <li>I love this product because you can see all the colors of the polish right away.</li>
            <li>Most people that go into my bathroom notice it right away and ask where I got it from.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves it so much!!!</li>
            <li>It was exactly what she wanted !!  </li>
            <li>The transaction was smooth, shipping was super-fast and the product was shiny, clean and crack free.</li>
            <li>I used a special &amp;#34;hollow door anchor&amp;#34; and silicone washers (to protect against over tightening screws thus cracking acrylic) and used a ~stretch-to-remove~ adhesive to secure bottom corners.&lt;br /&gt;Took</li>
            <li>it is very sturdy, easy to put on, im in love with this one,</li>
            <li>I actually chose to add glitter to the fronts of my shelves with modpogde and it turned out amazing!</li>
            <li>It also looks pretty on the wall :).  </li>
            <li>and I love picking out the perfect red or blue.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>a more girly and pretty look.</li>
            <li>I Can fit 14 full size china glaze in one row.</li>
            <li>Will be buying rack #2 very soon! :)</li>
            <li>I am so excited about this product.</li>
            <li>so much fun!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Although, it looks great, there is not way that this would survive long.</li>
            <li>Love it so much I have two!</li>
            <li>The only thing I would have liked more would have been if the racks were wider</li>
            <li>This shelving unit is absolutely wonderful for holding my bottles of Young Living Essential oils.  </li>
            <li>I used to keep my polish in a caboodle, and I do kind of miss being able to carry the box outside.</li>
            <li>The only reason why I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again would be if I would find a better deal on another wall rack, or if I&#x27;d decide to make my own wall rack myself.</li>
            <li>This rack isn&#x27;t as clean as it looks in the picture.</li>
            <li>It displays nicely on my wall next to my vanity and it is much better than keeping my polish in a box.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled to see my polish collection so professionally displayed and you will be too!</li>
            <li>this is exactly what i was hoping for, its super cute on my vanity wall.</li>
            <li>Although packaging was more than sufficient , carton was visibly damaged during shipping and display arrived with a large chip and crack in it.</li>
            <li>I have previously ordered this polish rack and loved it!</li>
            <li>When I received it, it was carefully packaged and in great condition.</li>
            <li>My nail Polish rack has been moved from 2 homes &amp; still holds up very well &amp; is full from top to bottom.</li>
            <li>I bought a second one when I realized that it was a good buy and quality.</li>
            <li>I got to about 90 bottles before it was full.  </li>
            <li>My 12 year old daughter is thrilled to have this on the wall in her bedroom.  </li>
            <li>Out these brands, the only ones that didn&#x27;t fir too good were the Butter London, and Nicole by OPI.</li>
            <li>Good looking rack and came the very next day that I ordered it!!</li>
            <li>Looks extremely professional on my wall and holds every kind of nail polish</li>
            <li>Mine are full and show no signs of weakness.</li>
            <li>Idk about 96 but good enough.</li>
            <li>That is true EXCEPT for NOPI.</li>
            <li>Wow ... this is made really nice.</li>
            <li>and she has already got it full</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t put it up, but I&#x27;m gonna have my husband paint me a cool image on it (recycling and all) to hang over</li>
            <li>Once this one is full I plan on buying another one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>So nice that it is on a wall in my bedroom near my makeup dresser.</li>
            <li>and I must say I&#x27;m actually surprised this stuff is really nice</li>
            <li>The plastic is nice and clear with no scratches.</li>
            <li>The display has two holes at the top to hang it by, which doesn&#x27;t really seem sufficient to hold the weight of 96 or so bottles of polish.</li>
            <li>Mine is completely full now at 86 bottles</li>
            <li>although cute i really have no use for.</li>
            <li>I ordered this 11/18 and received it 11/22 in perfect condition, it was packaged PERFECTLY, I was extremely concerned about it breaking during shipping but packaging was definitely executed very well; It also has a big &amp;#34;Nail Polish Station&amp;#34; sign included, that I was NOT expecting</li>
            <li>Love the organization up on the wall and easy to select design/displays professionally.  </li>
            <li>so those size bottles fit just right.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely in love with my new nail rack!</li>
            <li>I love my new nail polish rack!  </li>
            <li>Luckily, it was just the corners and not the shelves.</li>
            <li>This product shipped and arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if it was smaller and in light colors for use in the home.</li>
            <li>This was the perfect size to display the larger 15 ml bottles of my essential oils in the wall.</li>
            <li>The sides of it looked as if they had been super glued.</li>
            <li>the package came quickly and well protected.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I just love being able to see my entire collection.</li>
            <li>Both racks were wrapped in a flimsy sheet - there was no other padding inside the box, so it&#x27;s easy to see why cheap plastic would break so easily.</li>
            <li>I love this race it very helpful when you need any colors you see it right their.</li>
            <li>so I ordered a second and am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Item came exactly as described and was packaged securely.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>Nails because my walls are very funny</li>
            <li>Great product but subpar packaging ruins it.</li>
            <li>It came much quicker than I expected and she absolutely loved it!</li>
            <li>so my whole rack is full of bottles!</li>
            <li>so mine is almost full it holds up well on the wall with the right amount of nails to hold it up</li>
            <li>It looks so cool with all her nail polish in it, it is holding 101 bottles right now and</li>
            <li>It was easy to hang up and it is very sturdy</li>
            <li>but it is still super colorful when you get everything on it</li>
            <li>They are easy to hang, and very sturdy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sturdy, drills easily into your wall, and really holds your polishes.</li>
            <li>yet so I cant really say how strong it is to hold almost 100 bottles, but I&#x27;ve had mine for about 3 months,</li>
            <li>This product came exactly as described!  </li>
            <li>The item was exactly as described!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>just exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>I certainly don&#x27;t feel comfortable putting my nail polishes in a cracked display.  </li>
            <li>Although the massage oil bottless are too large it fit behind the lip, they sit great on the top shelf.</li>
            <li>For example, the Nicole by OPI bottles don&#x27;t fit very well.  </li>
            <li>But you can fit almost that much.</li>
            <li>The return hassle really doesn&#x27;t sound like something I want to go through.</li>
            <li>This item is just amazing is big</li>
            <li>Very durable and fit over 96 bottles of polish.</li>
            <li>My polish rack was in great shape (there were a few scratches or smudges</li>
            <li>I was pleased with this polish rack - it didn&#x27;t quite fit 96 bottles for me, but I have mixed brands, shapes and sizes in it.  </li>
            <li>The price was worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s clear</li>
            <li>I also put some wrapping paper in the back so it would look nice</li>
            <li>I love it because I can get a clear view of the shades I have, and the ones I need, without getting doubles or losing them in a drawer or something.</li>
            <li>My husband had to drill more holes as we felt it wasnt secure enough.</li>
            <li>This is nice and solid.  </li>
            <li>Only thing I used my own.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so useful</li>
            <li>It holds a lot of bottles, but if they are tall, they can only fit on the top row.  </li>
            <li>wild,zoya, NYC, color club, sinful colors, pop, klean color, finger paints, piggy polish, milani, fresh paint, chinaglaze, and Nicole by opi.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t ask for better than that as far as customer service for shipping.  </li>
            <li>I got this order earlier than expected, no damage to the box or anything, Opened it and was in perfect condition!</li>
            <li>I ordered a smaller one that fit the space better.</li>
            <li>so you&#x27;re able to fit big ones too&lt;</li>
            <li>it was well worth buying....</li>
            <li>It gives a nice visual of all your nail colors.</li>
            <li>but it is definately worth the</li>
            <li>On par with most other reviews, this item is very cheaply made.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As some have said, the glue shows a tiny bit and there is a scratch near the top, but other than that, it&#x27;s perfect for storing nail polish.</li>
            <li>My daughter is very excited and surprised with her nail polish shelf.  </li>
            <li>very neat and clean looking, stands well on it&#x27;s own, provided that you don&#x27;t fill tops only, but, can also hang on wall.</li>
            <li>The polish rack came quickly and it was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping and was exactly as specified.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a thick acrylic one,  good product!  </li>
            <li>( I haven&#x27;t counted but that sounds right.)  </li>
            <li>I have about 100 bottles on nail polish on my rack right now.</li>
            <li>They fit pretty much every brand of polish except Nicole by OPI (which almost fits).</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and is a much better storage solution than all the bottles in a basket, which I had to dump out frequently.</li>
            <li>Maybe if it was totally full of polishes in a store, it would look better, but I needed something smaller for my bathroom.</li>
            <li>I assumed that Beauticom would send me a return label for the damaged one and would ship a nice one back; however, they wanted a photo first.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light-weight, but not flimsy construction, and mounts very easily; I used hercules hooks for the extra weight of the bottles of polish.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>This was a very smart purchase.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and easy to hang, it holds about 95 polishes, sadly I will have to order another one, LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li>Holds all of my nail polish with so much room left over, looks like I need to buy more nail polish!</li>
            <li>This is the third one that I bought and I am very glad with the product I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>If you want something more decorative you can adhere colorful scrapbook paper to the back.</li>
            <li>The shipping was super fast too.</li>
            <li>The oils are easy to see because of the clear, acrylic fronts on the shelves.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap and plastic as expected, but I absolutely love having all my nail polish so organized.</li>
            <li>so nice to keep track of my colors so that I don&#x27;t end up with too much in the same shade.</li>
            <li>shipped quickly, and I&#x27;ll absolutely buy another when I run out of room on this one.</li>
            <li>The rack came packaged nicely, but the screws were loose in the bottom of the box; almost threw them out by accident.</li>
            <li>Holds a lot, easy to install, and seems to be pretty durable so far.</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Christmas present for 12 year old granddaughter who has many, many bottles of nail polish and really begged for two of these.</li>
            <li>Her polishes are not only organized and easy to see, they are displayed beautifully and takes very little space.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be getting some better hardware other than the cheap stuff that was included to hang it with.</li>
            <li>It comes in a huge box, but it is really slim and fits great right behind my bathroom door.  </li>
            <li>Seems durable and exactly what we had in mind for her to keep her collection organized,</li>
            <li>And it is very sturdy!</li>
            <li>I used 4 wood screws (not included) to hang it on my wall and it is holding up very well!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I finally decided to buy it.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>Everyone that comes into my room tells me it looks pretty too.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering another very soon!  </li>
            <li>contacted seller and asked for replacement anchors after the first two bent</li>
            <li>If she fills this one up (which she is pretty close to doing)</li>
            <li>Exactly what my girlfriend wanted and needed for all her nail polish.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ready for another one!</li>
            <li>Got exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>(only two mounting holes, at the top though).  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think so especially if you have many diff brands and sizes</li>
            <li>Just arrived today, very sturdy!  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I needed to organize my nail polishes.</li>
            <li>I absolutely ADORE this nail polish rack!</li>
            <li>This was exactly what my daughter wanted.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>She is a nail polish fanatic and this is great for her display all of her pretty colors.</li>
            <li>The item got to my house on time and was exactly what I was looking for...</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>This was much higher quality material than I though it would be.</li>
            <li>This was EXACTLY what I was looking for and what I needed.  </li>
            <li>It is tacky, cheap looking, and every corner where the shelves attached together, glue was completely visible.</li>
            <li>It shipped fast and everything I was hoping for!</li>
            <li>I looked around at a lot of different ones and I am so glad this is the one I got.</li>
            <li>another one didn&#x27;t realize I had that much nail polish!</li>
            <li>Exactly as listed.  </li>
            <li>We bought 2 and stacked them vertically, but didn&#x27;t leave enough room between for tall bottles on the lower rack&#x27;s top shelf.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I love it and will be looking into a second one!</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t the most well made but they&#x27;re sturdy enough.</li>
            <li>There are 2 nail techs in my salon and we each brought many polishes in when starting.  </li>
            <li>I elected to install one &amp;#34;Polish Station&amp;#34; sign just at the top (bought 2, so I have 2), but it&#x27;s not necessary.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more sturdy than I was expecting it to be, especially now that it is hung with my polishes on it.</li>
            <li>It fits most of my bottles, with the only exception being Nicole by OPI.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>this is so big that you will have to buy more polishes,lol.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this as a gift for a friend and she absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li>I know what colors I already own (not duplicates), it can fit several brands of nail polish since bottles are different shapes</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted and it came in a couple of day.</li>
            <li>I have all my essential oils organized - it&#x27;s attached to the inside of my bathroom cupboard door :)</li>
            <li>It looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>This is the second rack I have purchased from this seller and am one hundred percent satisfied.</li>
            <li>Living with a wife and teenage daughter can be challenging at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This nail polish rack made my heart whole!</li>
            <li>The clear race is what make it very useful by see all the colors</li>
            <li>she was very excited to get this rack finally.</li>
            <li>I did, however,store maybe about 2 or 3 nail polishes on its side to fit them a little better.</li>
            <li>I also tested this rack with other brands I own</li>
            <li>I now do not need to shuffle through many bottles to find the color I want to use because this clear display rack shows all bottles/colors lined up clearly.</li>
            <li>As for the polish rack itself, it is a nice enough rack and completely serviceable.  </li>
            <li>Love the product so much I bought a second one.</li>
            <li>Love that is clear and you can see the colors of the polishes clearly.</li>
            <li>Received my organizer before than expected, was shipped through fedex wich I loved, and it comes really well packaged in its own box with dry ice, I love how they printed on the box Fragile Glass handle with care, even dough is not cause is made of acrylic but still is fragile</li>
            <li>I am not a professional I just love nail polish.  </li>
            <li>The only one that won&#x27;t fit is my really big bottle of Top Coat</li>
            <li>Came pretty fast.</li>
            <li>Pretty much any brand of polish you can think of, I have it.  </li>
            <li>so I liked that a lot the only problem is mine looks almost uneven from the top and</li>
            <li>Despite it not being classy and good looking, I actually prefer that it&#x27;s clear because it makes it easier to see everything.</li>
            <li>but the bottom came alittle detached like it wasn&#x27;t glued right other than that I love the size of it</li>
            <li>I bought two and installed them right on top of each other.  </li>
            <li>But if you turn them slightly to the side they fit just fine.  </li>
            <li>I strongly recommend measuring your space, as this rack is enormous.</li>
            <li>But it is strong enough to hold polish bottle weight.</li>
            <li>I ordered this not realizing how large it would be.  </li>
            <li>Depending on where you plan to put it, you may not want something with so large a footprint.</li>
            <li>I thought my collection was not that large</li>
            <li>and I will probably be purchasing a new one sometime soon as I only have room for 4 more polishes.</li>
            <li>It does fit Nicole by OPI, but&#x27;s it&#x27;s a tight fit.</li>
            <li>60 counts are hard to find at a good price sell fast</li>
            <li>The only bottle that doesn&#x27;t fit facing straight forward are the Nicole by OPI bottles.  </li>
            <li>This rack is going to save me so much money because now I can see what I have</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sturdy.  </li>
            <li>It saves me so much space.  </li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t find what you really want.  </li>
            <li>It didnt hold up very well</li>
            <li>It came as one whole unit and is very well built.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not always available but keep checking back.</li>
            <li>This wall rack is very sturdy and durable.  </li>
            <li>and it really gives my room</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s very sturdy and looks like it did 2 years ago when I got it.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping &amp; sturdy.</li>
            <li>I was really scared to break it</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I use these for my hobby game paints and they work out great.</li>
            <li>very well</li>
            <li>It is very sturdy.</li>
            <li>AND IT LOOKS VERY PROFESSIONAL&lt;</li>
            <li>part of why I don&#x27;t really buy NOPI anymore)</li>
            <li>I had to glue it together to make it whole.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very upset with this</li>
            <li>It came very well packaged and protected.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really sturdy, with plastic and glass.</li>
            <li>....for my nail polish obsession.  Very efficient storage.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got my second one and filled it up as well.  </li>
            <li>I have so much nail polish</li>
            <li>Very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this nail polish rack.</li>
            <li>I really did not notice it until I got it up on the wall.</li>
            <li>They are very sturdy and hold an ample supply of polishes.</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>I really like this rack...</li>
            <li>Now I can really see all my colors.  </li>
            <li>Of course now my daughter wants one, too.</li>
            <li>Got it fast too</li>
            <li>Haha</li>
            <li>(I did get help from my husband, it would be a 2 person job to ensure they are straight, etc.)  </li>
            <li>;  It is very sturdy and well put together.  </li>
            <li>I ended up getting a refund on this item and bought a much nicer wrought iron nail polish rack.</li>
            <li>Hold so much.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just what I was looking for at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I really like this display.  </li>
            <li>so filled it the next day.  </li>
            <li>If this were a $15 or so shelf, it wouldn&#x27;t be as much of an issue.</li>
            <li>Also wasnt very well protected inside of the box.</li>
            <li>and is holding up very well.</li>
            <li>It comes with a cheasy top piece that says nail polish center</li>
            <li>The shelves appear to be glued on straight.</li>
            <li>I do highly recommend it if your nail polish is getting out of hand!</li>
            <li>I do plan on painting it because it&#x27;s clear, but that is more of a personal preference.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong, easy to attach to a wall, and the shelves are wide enough to accommodate large bottles like Deborah Lippmann.  </li>
            <li>She filled most levels with polish but also put in other smaller sized items, like perfume.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple: the way the nail polishes are shaped whether large or small in size will effect how many the rack is able to hold.</li>
            <li>It is a pretty large shelf but doesn&#x27;t look too bulky with the clear acrylic.</li>
            <li>it is low enough for very easy use.</li>
            <li>I love this and have given them as gifts for my other EO friends.</li>
            <li>I hung it on the wall in my smaller bathroom and it is easily accessible, but out of the way.  </li>
            <li>It fits perfectly as many polishes as it advertises, and it is extremely sturdy.</li>
            <li>So this rack is pretty versatile if you get a little creative with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So much better than the other racks going for close to $100 and some over $200 because it has some metal scrollwork?</li>
            <li>They look identical, although the first one seems to be of a little better quality.</li>
            <li>exactly what my 13 year old daughter wanted!</li>
            <li>one has a cheap looking glue sticking the parts together, and the glue is not clear so it is very visible.  </li>
            <li>Butter London would fill it up with less, however I have a mix of mini bottles and brands with smaller bottles (like Julep) or bottles that fit sideways (like Love &amp; Beauty).</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to watch her for hours digging and looking for the particular color she wants on any given day.</li>
            <li>While this doesn&#x27;t nearly hold all of it, it keeps enough of them off the floor and bathroom vanity to make me a little happy.  </li>
            <li>This rack is the same size, holds the same amount of polish, and gets the job done, but I would have preferred one like the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit arrived safely without defects and is very light-weight.  </li>
            <li>It holds so many bottles, is sturdy, and is very basic looking, so it doesn&#x27;t draw too much attention to the actual rack.  </li>
            <li>The clear acrylic allows the polish colors to show through nicely--at first glance it looks like a contemporary piece of art hanging on the wall.</li>
            <li>, I can just look at the wall, I put it behind the bedroom door so it is very visible, but only when I want to see it, so perfect, and it&#x27;s easy to hang, just a few screws</li>
            <li>But anyways I sent pictures via email showing the damage &amp; immediately got a reply saying that they were sending a brand new rack!</li>
            <li>Live it --- ordered another one!</li>
            <li>It may hold more or less than 96 depending on the brands and bottle shapes.  </li>
            <li>I drilled an extra set of holes in the second to last row just to make sure that it was extra safe and then mounted it to the wall with the screws and drywall anchors provided.</li>
            <li>Sad to report it was kind of cheap looking and also took up a lot of space.  </li>
            <li>I love the overall design of the rack, but next time I might try another brand or seller.</li>
            <li>decent display.</li>
            <li>all my Wet N Wild sideways to be able to accommodate brands like Orly or OPI.  </li>
            <li>I did however opt to use bigger equipment to hang it because I did not feel the tiny screws they sent with it would be as safe as I wanted for the wall.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This display is of high quality material.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>first one came damaged but not due to seller in fact</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice hard plastic with 4 holes to nail it to the wall.  </li>
            <li>Once it is filled with polish the glue is not really noticable.  </li>
            <li>The rack is clear plastic, so it is very lightwieght.</li>
            <li>This is the second rack I&#x27;ve purchased, so that should tell you something right there.</li>
            <li>Other than this damage, the items were accurate to their descriptions in terms of dimensions, etc.</li>
            <li>Brand new.  </li>
            <li>IT IN A STORE WHERE I LIVE</li>
            <li>I have no idea how I would live without them.</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;ll never deal with this company again.i needed to return for a new 1 cause</li>
            <li>when my grandaughter opened on christmas morning it was damaged .they refused to send a new 1.well merry christmas to them.i&#x27;ll</li>
            <li>get a new 1</li>
            <li>Order these two items together so that you have somewhere to store all those new polishes.</li>
            <li>I have been on a reorganization kick as of the beginning of the New Year.</li>
            <li>I like this rack because it&#x27;s clear, goes with my salon decor, and holds a decent amount of polish.  </li>
            <li>So when I purchase a new color an old &amp; unused one must go!</li>
            <li>The acrylic is very clear and shiny.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>/&gt;Subsequently, this unit can hold 3 (three) of my 50 ink bottles, which pretty much makes this useless for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, since the packaging is designed to fall apart when unpacking, returning this item is not possible, so good bye $38.</li>
            <li>Now I know exactly what I have at a glance and no longer keep purchasing the same colors.</li>
            <li>Other than that, the gift was a hit and most likely</li>
            <li>I am surprised it held all my nailpolishes!</li>
            <li>It looks exactly as the picture just a teeny bit bigger.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described in listing the only problem I have is I need</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say it arrived early during normal shipping.</li>
            <li>I have 2 so far!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve currently got about 102 bottles total, many are smaller Julep brand, but I still plan on buying another rack to hold the rest of my stash!</li>
            <li>Product ordered was in multiples, none were exactly the same...</li>
            <li>First rack In mint condition, however scratches from abrasives n blemishes in the acrylic in the next two.</li>
            <li>This is good in a way because it definitely is strong enough to hold multiple nail polishes, but is also a little disadvantageous because it is extremely heavy to hang.  </li>
            <li>Just as I expected, shipped quick.</li>
            <li>This really helps me stay more organized, I even use my last two rows for other nail related products.</li>
            <li>That would be fine if it were for me, but Katie, a mother of three little ones, who is not technologically inclined told me she would just keep it.</li>
            <li>fit 106 some where small bottles, very sturdy thus far.</li>
            <li>they were tight but fit facing forward.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a few years now that I&#x27;ve ordered this nail polish rack and it has been everything I expected and more!</li>
            <li>The racks hold all different kinds of polish; however, some of the fat bottles are too large for it.  </li>
            <li>I even have a 2nd one - mounted right above the first one and it looks like one big unit.</li>
            <li>The Nicole by OPI bottles fit if you put them a little bit sideways.</li>
            <li>Item was delievered when expected and was exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li>The glue job is also messy, so there are streaks of glue in random parts of the rack, which, to be honest, makes it look very cheap.  </li>
            <li>My best friend and I just started getting a little overly obsessed with nail polishes and our collection doubled over a week or two.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the prettiest thing in the world (just plain acrylic), but I mounted it on one of my closet end shelves and it works just fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Quality is just what you would expect - clear plastic, not flimsy, but not the sturdiest either.  </li>
            <li>so you can see the labels clearly.</li>
            <li>The rack holds all brands and sizes of polish and since it&#x27;s clear acrylic, it fits with any room decor.</li>
            <li>To me the acrylic doesn&#x27;t bother me because I wanted clear shelving</li>
            <li>but Butter London bottles are too wide to be displayed sideways (and you can&#x27;t fit them two bottles deep, either).  </li>
            <li>And because it&#x27;s clear it will blend in with any décor.</li>
            <li>so I won&#x27;t get a second one - that will just lead to empty shelves begging to be filled ;  </li>
            <li>I can see all the colors through the clear plastic.</li>
            <li>I have a ton of Julep nail polish and so far I have over 150 bottles on one of these.</li>
            <li>got this for my 14 yr old and she loves it holds all her polish and some</li>
            <li>The rack enabled her to see her collection much easier than having to look through numerous boxes to find the color she was looking for,  </li>
            <li>I will repost once all is said and done, but so far I&#x27;m pouting.</li>
            <li>until now.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need to have a nail salon to need this - I have it on my wall near my master bath and it works PERFECT!&lt;br /&gt;Every</li>
            <li>I use it to hold all my Young Living Oils.</li>
            <li>There was no padding at all, which totally surprised me since they were shipping something</li>
            <li>The outer box was marked &amp;#34;Glass Fragile&amp;#34; but without any type of padding, it was doomed for breakage.  </li>
            <li>This was for my 11 year old daughter</li>
            <li>And, I don&#x27;t have near the weight that would be equivalent to 96 bottles of nail polish on it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It will do what it is supposed to do, but it is far from a thing of beauty. .</li>
            <li>I even put the colors in groups (gelish, regular polish, then nail art) and that makes my life much easier.  </li>
            <li>I bought this rack for my 11 year old daughter for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t have to rummage through my old box I used to store all of my nail polishes in.</li>
            <li>, she could never find the one she was looking for without taking nearly all of them out to sort them.  </li>
            <li>The stand is sturdy and looks professional.</li>
            <li>This rack looks like the ones in the professional nail salon.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how much polish i actually had</li>
            <li>It hold approximately 95 bottles of polish (I only use OPI and Essie; both brands fit comfortably on the rack).</li>
            <li>Kind of confusing in which one you get when you place your order as there is a couple of different styles.</li>
            <li>The fact that it was already broken right out of the box does not give me any hope that it would hold 96 bottles securely.</li>
            <li>The item is extremely sturdy, and although I will add two more holes at the bottom for extra security that is also a personal preference.</li>
            <li>I will most likely order another next time, because I still have about 40 other polishes in need to be stored in a wall rack.</li>
            <li>and I was surprised because some of the bottles are pretty big fat different shapes</li>
            <li>I had bought this same product a few months ago, and the one I bought months ago is really nice, but the one that I got in the mail this time was a much cheaper, uglier looking version of the previous one.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great space saver and doesn&#x27;t look weird on your wall at home if you&#x27;re not a professional.</li>
            <li>and I was hoping the box would simply say Amazon on the outside instead of exactly what it was.  </li>
            <li>it was not the exact same one, although it came in with the same model number.</li>
            <li>Hung the rack up today - easy as pie, only two wall screws (not included, we used heavy duty wall anchors).  </li>
            <li>I accidentally had this product shipped to an old address and when I tried to get it redirected or held at a Fedex station, I was told by fedex that the sender didn&#x27;t opt in for this service - this service definitely is helpful, especially when the item is large and wouldn&#x27;t be left if not accepted.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t comment on the longevity of this particular rack as I&#x27;ve only had it a short time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also has a cute little sign from time to time it falls down</li>
            <li>It came in a fairly short amount of time, and it was completely unscathed when it arrived at my house.</li>
            <li>I decided to place this rack inside my closet on a bare wall</li>
            <li>And the way that the bottles are designed in these two brands I wasn&#x27;t surprised they didn&#x27;t fir properly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this shelf nearly 8 months now, and have discovered stress cracks in several places.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this nail polish display rack for my 16 year old daughter as a Christmas present.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing another in the near future</li>
            <li>barely 1/4&amp;#34</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve only taken it out of the already opened box, the bottom shelf was off, the glue didnt hold.</li>
            <li>My 17yr old is a recent cancer SURVIVOR  &amp; THIS was 1 of the items on her Christmas list.</li>
            <li>Christmas present for my 16 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It may seem like overkill, buying a rack that holds this much nail polish for use at home, but once some time is spent searching drawers, purses, cabints and cars...</li>
            <li>One came broken at the top which was not the sellers fault.  </li>
            <li>This rack is so much better though and it makes going into my closet feel like opening a secret door to a spa (see my customer photo).</li>
            <li>Not too thick so it can fit almost&lt;br /</li>
            <li>It came broken, in three pieces despite the sellers attempts to ship it safely.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it is not deep enough to hold my rectangular shaped nail polish remover on the top (however, that&#x27;s not a big enough issue to knock it down a star for me).</li>
            <li>My husband installed one above the other, behind our home office door where the lighting is good (floor torchere lamp nearby).</li>
            <li>Very nice too bad</li>
            <li>But other it just as it was described, shipping was fast, and the screws were provided for me to mount it on my wall.</li>
            <li>It was still a little too expensive, but luckily for me it was a graduation gift to myself :)</li>
            <li>Not even clear glue, SOLID WHITE GLUE!</li>
            <li>I store those each on a different shelf at the far left</li>
            <li>At first I was a little overwhelmed with the size</li>
            <li>use my wall rack in tandem with a used jewelry floor cabinet we purchased (center lift top, center multiple drawers and side wings that open that my husband build shelves into for me), for all my other fingernail art obsession</li>
            <li>I went from baskets and drawers full of polishes I didn&#x27;t use often because they were all over the place and hard to see what I owned.</li>
            <li>I will be buying another one pretty soon as I have gotten into the habit of changing my nail color every few days and with spring/summer and sandal weather</li>
            <li>Rack was exactly as pictured and did not have a \\&quot;Polish Station\\&quot; topper like a few reviews have mentioned.</li>
            <li>The only annoying part of this rack was the fact that the Nicole opi polish was barely able to fit in the rack.</li>
            <li>Everyone complaining about it not holding exactly 96 polishes is missing the point.</li>
            <li>My shelf came with a small crack in the acrylic, but it wasn&#x27;t worth sending back</li>
            <li>the positive side, it is well packed and protected and was received within a few days after ordering.</li>
            <li>only comes with 4 anchors and there are 4 holes if you hang the top part, two of my anchors bent and were not able to be used, so i didn&#x27;t put the top part on, its kinda ugly anyways</li>
            <li>However, the wall I put it on had wonky stud spacing anyway, so we pre-drilled 2 holes in the center of the rack, and it&#x27;s holding up just fine.</li>
            <li>So, I was really excited to receive this, and when I opened the box, my disappointment set in when I realized there is a huge crack down the bottom of the rack.  </li>

            <li> This item was made of plastic, which was nice, but not what was advertised.</li>
            <li> I currently own four</li>
            <li> so I could see my colors, so these are perfect, and they are very sturdy.</li>
            <li> I just liked the idea that the shelf itself blended into the surroundings.  </li>
            <li> I really liked it</li>
            <li> All in all, it serves its function and looks nice on the wall.</li>
            <li> it works perfectly for my collection and is very sturdy.</li>
            <li> nice</li>
            <li> I will now own 4 of these..</li>
            <li> So nice to see all my polish selection displayed in a glance and I have some room to grow.</li>
            <li> I have this rack and it is really nice looking.</li>
            <li> It was packaged nicely.</li>
            <li> This was a birthday gift for my daughter who is 23 and does her own nails.  </li>
            <li> It will look really nice when I find a place to hang it some day.</li>
            <li> and she was thrilled..</li>
            <li> It holds up nicely.</li>

            <li> Fits nicely on any wall.</li>
            <li> It is well made and looks nice.</li>
            <li> Nice unit.  </li>
            <li> It came with a separate header piece that said \\&quot;polish station\\&quot;, but it looks kind of tacky, so I&#x27;m not using it.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this rack!!</li>
            <li> My craft room and nail polish collection were the main focus of this revamp, and I couldn&#x27;t have done it without this awesome nail polish rack.</li>
            <li> Great item, super fast shipping very happy</li>
            <li> It did come with a very cute top plate that says &amp;#34;Nail Station&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased :)</li>
            <li> I received it very quickly, and I was able to fit 102 polish bottles!!!</li>
            <li> Great quality product and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I wouldnt consider this salon worthy but it great for &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; people storage.</li>
            <li> Very Cool!  Very easy to install.  </li>
            <li> It was very easy to install.  </li>
            <li> We have not attached the rack to the wall yet but looks very easy to do so.</li>
            <li> it is very easy to hang and holds all of my polishes.  </li>
            <li> i couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied!</li>
            <li> She filled the rack right away and is very happy with this solution to her polish collection.  </li>
            <li> Will be buying more very soon!!!!!</li>
            <li> Honestly, I could not ask for more.</li>
            <li> If you install it correctly, it&#x27;s a good, secure way to store and display all your nail polish.</li>
            <li> because I don&#x27;t own nearly as many of bottles of Butter London or Nicole by OPI as I do in China Glaze.</li>
            <li> This was perfect for all my nail polish....makes my &amp;#34;girl room&amp;#34; look professional &amp; organized.</li>
            <li> My solution was to attach some shelving brackets underneath to help and so far, it has held up great!  </li>
            <li> It was easy to install and fits all of her polishes and nail supplies!</li>
            <li> Easy to hang!</li>
            <li> Easy to put on the wall!</li>
            <li> but now it&#x27;s up and strong !</li>
            <li> Perfect fit on the wall  came so fast and packed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It can fit a great amount of nail polish but the tall nail polish don&#x27;t fit in it</li>
            <li> great buy, bought it as a gift for my 15 year old niece and see loved it...</li>
            <li> This product was exactly as described and will work out great for what I need if for.</li>
            <li> Love love love love love it!</li>
            <li> was what it appeared to be in picture,  Fit my space perfectly, looks good and finally all my nail polishes are organized as opposed to thrown in a drawer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made very cheaply, but will get the job done.  </li>
            <li> It is so easy to see which shades we want now, and adds a nice touch of color to the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I originally ordered one rack &amp; was very pleased, so I decided to order another.</li>
            <li> Depending on what brands you fill it with it can fit significantly more than 96 bottles on each!</li>
            <li> Now I am able to choose my polish at a glance and can easily know what I own.  </li>
            <li> So, I applaud this seller for providing accurate information!</li>
            <li> 96 bottles is an estimate of how many it holds.</li>
            <li> I love it...</li>
            <li> I plan to purchase many more bottles. :)</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know my wife and daughter had so many nail polish bottles.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I think I may have gotten more than 96 bottle on the rack, but I didn&#x27;t count them, so I can&#x27;t say for sure.</li>
            <li> and I ordered this and love it.  </li>
            <li> Thank you!  :)</li>
            <li> It screws into the wall with 2 screws at the top.  </li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described love it</li>
            <li> but it was perfect outside of that.</li>
            <li> if you have polish you want to display get this one you will love it.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this nail polish rack.</li>

            <li> I have so many nail polishes.</li>
            <li> I love seeing them all displayed out like that.</li>
            <li> I love this rack.</li>
            <li> It is so much better than our plastic bin of polish.</li>
            <li> The size is more for a business .</li>
            <li> but the process would cost me more money</li>
            <li> It came with a label header to go on top, however the holes on the header dont line up with ones on the display.</li>
            <li> We have so many polishes</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> but I love it.</li>
            <li> Most of my nail polishes are OPI or Essie</li>
            <li> Love the look of it in my room.</li>
            <li> different brand I have of polish fits PERFECT.</li>
            <li> so it can hold all your polish safely.</li>
            <li> I love this , I just wish it was cheaper .</li>
            <li> The quality is excellent and I love being able to actually see all of my polish!</li>
            <li> so I have more room to work.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> my daughter and I have over 60 bottles of nail polish and plenty more will still fit!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, and great packaging.</li>
            <li> I have mostly OPI and China Glaze</li>
            <li> I LOVE MY WALL DISPLAY</li>
            <li> Totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize I had SOOOO many nail polishes until I put them all in one location with this wall rack.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li> I love this nailpolish rack....</li>

            <li> and they all fit!  </li>
            <li> It was packed for safe travels.  </li>
            <li> I like these shelves a lot more than my countertop racks as they display the polishes better and save a lot of space.  </li>
            <li> This was perfect to store all my polishes vs. having them in several (shoebox) storage containers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> grandkids love the &amp;#34;Nail Station&amp;#34</li>
            <li> can not wait for more ads on nail polish and hair products.</li>
            <li> Fits perfect and slim line enough to where it does not interfere with the door.</li>
            <li> My wife and daughter love this.</li>
            <li> but I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> It was also packaged really nice and secure to avoid damage.</li>
            <li> Packaged well for safe delivery.</li>
            <li> I am SO glad I got this.  </li>
            <li> I really love this item.  </li>
            <li> and I love them to death.</li>
            <li> Can put some taller items on the top shelf.</li>
            <li> I have a mix of polish brands on there, most of them being Zoya.</li>
            <li> so I can get more on there.</li>
            <li> The top row was off about an eighth of an inch.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product - this is the second one I&#x27;ve bought!</li>
            <li> I am still in love with this rack!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> My wife had so many nail polish bottles that were in</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful, I love that I can see all my different polishes at once!!</li>
            <li> no you will have to buy more to fill it</li>
            <li> make sure you use all tools sent to put it up.</li>
            <li> and I think it holds more than 96 bottles</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really in love with this</li>
            <li> , I think I&#x27;m going to buy 2 more</li>
            <li> It holds all my nail polishes very well, and looks great.  </li>
            <li> I love that all of my polishes are neatly organized and out of the way.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I LOVE IT...</li>
            <li> THANK YOU to EVERYONE who had a hand in this :-)  </li>
            <li> Nail polish display (better for businesses)</li>
            <li> cause you for sure find what you looking for easier-faster, and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that once it&#x27;s filled up with polish bottles, the imperfections won&#x27;t be as noticeable and it will still look nice.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this nail polish rack:&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> well those are most of what I have.</li>
            <li> I mostly have China Glaze and have no issues with it.</li>
            <li> top piece and has a lot more visible glue around the shelves.  </li>
            <li> Wish I could have room for more.</li>
            <li> I wish the acrylic had been a ilttle thicker, or better quality (rounded edges maybe?).</li>
            <li> I have all sorts of brands and some take up more room than others.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m able to put all my nail polish in there....</li>
            <li> It was surrounded by styrofoam to keep it safe, but the bottom shelf was in pieces.  </li>
            <li> I love the Nail polish rack.</li>
            <li> ah i&#x27;m in love with the rack and nail polish so helpful</li>
            <li> Works great and it&#x27;t filling up fast.</li>
            <li> Holds so many bottles of nail polish.  </li>
            <li> One was a gift and since I needed more space I bought another.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It holds so many nail polishes.</li>
            <li> it holds so many bottles, now I don&#x27;t have to guess what colors I have</li>
            <li> it did come with a section that you can add to the top that says &amp;#34;polish station&amp;#34; but it is optional (not attached)</li>
            <li> All my friends are in amazement and jealous when they come and look at my nail polish collection. :-)</li>
            <li> I enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love this polish rack</li>
            <li> Fits all my polish easily &amp; makes things very easy to find now.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a very strong plastic looks like glass almost its really strong</li>
            <li> It has so much space and displays all of my polishes in a very nice way.</li>
            <li> looks clean and tidy.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this rack for anyone with a large polish collection who wants to be able to see all of their beautiful colors better!  </li>
            <li> And Does Come With A Super Nice Top Sign, &amp;#34;Reads Polish Station&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Good product is pretty and durable</li>
            <li> I am so excited!  </li>
            <li> It hung easily in my nieces bathroom and held many polish bottles.  </li>
            <li> but it is super handy and comes with a &amp;#34;nail station&amp;#34; sign.  </li>
            <li> I easily took off the top part that said Polish Station.</li>
            <li> Mounted it to the back of my linen closet door (fit perfectly).  </li>
            <li> This polish rack is the perfect size for a salon that is limited on space.  </li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s clear, the polish is easy to see and the colors are beautifully displayed.</li>
            <li> I am VERY happy with the other product as it is more decorative and still functional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really enjoy being able to see all of my nail polish at once.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m able to fit 15 OPI polishes per shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are six rows and I have four rows filled still with plenty of room for more.</li>
            <li> I was able to fit 94 bottles.</li>
            <li> I love this thing, it&#x27;s filled up and now I need another one.</li>
            <li> It looks great that way and the colors flow seamlessly.</li>
            <li> I use this to hold my polish and so far it works great.</li>
            <li> So if you have a lot of Nicole opi polishes just know you&#x27;ll barely be able to fit them.</li>
            <li> I was able to fit 92 bottles of polish, OPI, Sephora for OPI, China Glaze, Orly and Zoya.</li>
            <li> Brands like OPI would fit about that many,</li>
            <li> It came a day before the expected shipping date and was packaged wonderfully!</li>
            <li> cuz I was able to fit 120</li>
            <li> I even placed my art nail colors in it, most of them fit but</li>
            <li> I really love how it looks on the wall and how the polishes fit.</li>
            <li> Perfect solution for the semi-large volume of nail polish bottles laying around the house with no real place to put them...</li>
            <li> If you also have those 2-oz bottles of acrylic paint used for nail art, they will fit on the top shelf.</li>
            <li> DAUGHTER LOVED IT AND WANTS ANOTHER</li>
            <li> I love seeing my glitter polish and being able to pick out quickly the colors I want.</li>
            <li> I originally bought one and realized i had way more polishes than I thought</li>
            <li> I purchased this nail polish rack for my daughter and my neice last Christmas, and they absolutely loved them!  </li>
            <li> It came with mounting supplies and was super easy to install!  </li>
            <li> Perfect in my daughters bather for all her nail polish and other items.</li>
            <li> and it makes finding what color you want more fun!</li>
            <li> The third-party seller I purchased from -- Beauticom -- also imposes a 15% restocking fee, making returning the item cost as much or more than the original purchase price.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s a constant reminder to put these gorgeous colors to use!</li>
            <li> Easy to hang</li>

            <li> The unit has proven to be sturdy and is easy to hang/install.</li>
            <li> it was easy to hang on the wall</li>
            <li> It easily holds 95 - 100 bottles of nail polish.</li>

            <li> It hangs easily and is housing all my polish with room to expand.  </li>
            <li> I received this rack very quickly and it met my expectations.</li>
            <li> It was so easy to put up and</li>
            <li> easy to put on my wall</li>
            <li> It was lightweight and easy to hang.</li>
            <li> Easy for me (a woman) to mount on a wall by myself without any help.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to set up</li>
            <li> It was easy to put up and we used the &amp;#34;Polish Station&amp;#34; sign that came with it.  </li>
            <li> Easy to install&lt;br /</li>
            <li> This shelf is easy to wall mount.</li>
            <li> It was REALLY EASY to install in my wall</li>
            <li> Fairly easy to hang.</li>
            <li> Not the most attractive piece if you have to glue it all back together, though.</li>
            <li> The product is strong, well made, holds 96 bottles of polish and can sit on a table or be hung on a wall or door.</li>
            <li> I bought this in 2012 and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li> strong material</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s actually really strong and sturdy</li>
            <li> of my polishes with stranger shaped bottles don&#x27;t fit (ie my Nicole by OPI), but most of my bottles, including Gelish, fit just fine.</li>
            <li> Now I know exactly what colors I own.</li>
            <li> she liked it so much we got her another one!</li>
            <li> this nail polish rack was exactly what i needed to hold all of my nail polishes at my own home.  </li>
            <li> Hanging it was super easy too, as it came pre-drilled with holes at the top of the unit and four screws with matching plastic wall anchors to help bear weight.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very nice rack with lot&#x27;s of room for your polishes it has a nice rack to protect the polishes from falling, however when received it was cracked and had to be glued together, but that was due to the way it was handled through delivery.</li>
            <li> Hung just fine</li>
            <li> so it does the job fine for her.</li>
            <li> The product itself is pretty and it looks nice and secure.</li>
            <li> Apparently the clinking REALLY bothered him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is perfect.</li>
            <li> Well now they are all out and available for easy selection (she has them sorted by color in the rack).  </li>
            <li> The material is cheap and I could tell that can easily break, even the shelf looks like they could break anytime with weight...</li>
            <li> It does hold OPI nail polish just fine and does hold about 96 bottles</li>
            <li> does the job fine though</li>
            <li> I used some plastic adhesive and it works just fine.  </li>
            <li> Well Made And Looks Super In My Shop!</li>
            <li> This looks super cute, though.</li>
            <li> Organized all my polishes well and received quickly!</li>
            <li> High quality and made exceptionally.  </li>
            <li> Now I feel like I really don&#x27;t have that many polishes!</li>
            <li> revlon they all fit fine.</li>
            <li> Orly&#x27;s, Lippman&#x27;s, Essie&#x27;s, OPI, China Glaze, Loreal, Revlon and Salon Express fit on there just fine.</li>
            <li> but if the shelf was just a little bit deeper, it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> The measurements are accurate at 24&amp;#34; H x 21&amp;#34; W x 2&amp;#34</li>
            <li> 2nd one I have bought, it is great.</li>
            <li> Sturdy and holds the polish securely.</li>
            <li> some of the bottles won&#x27;t fit</li>
            <li> it were cheap.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd 90 count nail polish rack I have ordered from Amazon, great price, packaging and ship time.</li>
            <li> Seems secure and the shelves are holding up well.</li>
            <li> I can fit around 15 to 16 bottles per row</li>
            <li> - Can you really fit 90?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap looking and feeling.  </li>
            <li> It has four holes to secure it to the wall</li>
            <li> so I can have my polish on display and have it be protected from the light.</li>
            <li> Everything but OPI fit, you just have to turn them sideways.</li>
            <li> Both girly and practical, these are a great way to organize some of the chaos that teenage girls&#x27; rooms hold.  </li>
            <li> Made rather cheaply.</li>
            <li> I also received no screws/fasteners to hang it up; which is kind of the whole point of a &amp;#34;wall rack&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It gives a great visual of what colors I have.</li>
            <li> For the price, these racks are fantastic.</li>
            <li> The description says that they fit all brands.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind the look of acrylic, they would probably be great as spice racks or for holding similarly shaped items.</li>
            <li> Overall she is happy with it.</li>
            <li> but after you put your polish on it and hang it on the wall it doesn&#x27;t look that big anymore, it just looks great.</li>
            <li> My rack fit 98 bottles.</li>
            <li> beware that is looks cheap.</li>
            <li> So on one rack I can fit over 100 bottles.</li>
            <li> Overall, it was a great purchase</li>
            <li> I can fit 16 Zoya bottles per row, which is 96 bottles of polish.</li>
            <li> arrived in great condition and holds different shapes of polish bottles.</li>
            <li> ; sound he&#x27;d hear while I did that.</li>
            <li> Although if you have Nicole by OPI brand nail polish, those irregular shaped bottles don&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> and they all fit.</li>
            <li> They all fit.  </li>
            <li> great product especially for someone who loves to buy nail polish</li>
            <li> , it looks cheap you can see the glue.  </li>
            <li> All my nail polishes fit in this rack.</li>
            <li> and it is almost filled.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I finally bought this nail polish rack it has made all my dreams come true&amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I did not use cause this is only for my personal use, it comes already assambled all you have to do is attach it to the wall with two screws I placed mine in my walking closet wall and is honestly the best way to organize your nail polish</li>
            <li> : It does fit a lot of nail polishes  </li>
            <li> but it filled this rack up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i will buy another rack soon to fit the rest of my polish .</li>
            <li> I love this product because you can see all the colors of the polish right away.</li>
            <li> Most people that go into my bathroom notice it right away and ask where I got it from.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it so much!!!</li>
            <li> It was exactly what she wanted !!  </li>
            <li> The transaction was smooth, shipping was super-fast and the product was shiny, clean and crack free.</li>
            <li> I used a special &amp;#34;hollow door anchor&amp;#34; and silicone washers (to protect against over tightening screws thus cracking acrylic) and used a ~stretch-to-remove~ adhesive to secure bottom corners.&lt;br /&gt;Took</li>
            <li> it is very sturdy, easy to put on, im in love with this one,</li>
            <li> I actually chose to add glitter to the fronts of my shelves with modpogde and it turned out amazing!</li>
            <li> It also looks pretty on the wall :).  </li>
            <li> and I love picking out the perfect red or blue.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> a more girly and pretty look.</li>
            <li> I Can fit 14 full size china glaze in one row.</li>
            <li> Will be buying rack #2 very soon! :)</li>
            <li> I am so excited about this product.</li>
            <li> so much fun!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Although, it looks great, there is not way that this would survive long.</li>
            <li> Love it so much I have two!</li>
            <li> The only thing I would have liked more would have been if the racks were wider</li>
            <li> This shelving unit is absolutely wonderful for holding my bottles of Young Living Essential oils.  </li>
            <li> I used to keep my polish in a caboodle, and I do kind of miss being able to carry the box outside.</li>
            <li> The only reason why I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again would be if I would find a better deal on another wall rack, or if I&#x27;d decide to make my own wall rack myself.</li>
            <li> This rack isn&#x27;t as clean as it looks in the picture.</li>
            <li> It displays nicely on my wall next to my vanity and it is much better than keeping my polish in a box.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled to see my polish collection so professionally displayed and you will be too!</li>
            <li> this is exactly what i was hoping for, its super cute on my vanity wall.</li>
            <li> Although packaging was more than sufficient , carton was visibly damaged during shipping and display arrived with a large chip and crack in it.</li>
            <li> I have previously ordered this polish rack and loved it!</li>
            <li> When I received it, it was carefully packaged and in great condition.</li>
            <li> My nail Polish rack has been moved from 2 homes &amp; still holds up very well &amp; is full from top to bottom.</li>
            <li> I bought a second one when I realized that it was a good buy and quality.</li>
            <li> I got to about 90 bottles before it was full.  </li>
            <li> My 12 year old daughter is thrilled to have this on the wall in her bedroom.  </li>
            <li> Out these brands, the only ones that didn&#x27;t fir too good were the Butter London, and Nicole by OPI.</li>
            <li> Good looking rack and came the very next day that I ordered it!!</li>
            <li> Looks extremely professional on my wall and holds every kind of nail polish</li>
            <li> Mine are full and show no signs of weakness.</li>
            <li> Idk about 96 but good enough.</li>
            <li> That is true EXCEPT for NOPI.</li>
            <li> Wow ... this is made really nice.</li>
            <li> and she has already got it full</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t put it up, but I&#x27;m gonna have my husband paint me a cool image on it (recycling and all) to hang over</li>
            <li> Once this one is full I plan on buying another one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> So nice that it is on a wall in my bedroom near my makeup dresser.</li>
            <li> and I must say I&#x27;m actually surprised this stuff is really nice</li>
            <li> The plastic is nice and clear with no scratches.</li>
            <li> The display has two holes at the top to hang it by, which doesn&#x27;t really seem sufficient to hold the weight of 96 or so bottles of polish.</li>
            <li> Mine is completely full now at 86 bottles</li>
            <li> although cute i really have no use for.</li>
            <li> I ordered this 11/18 and received it 11/22 in perfect condition, it was packaged PERFECTLY, I was extremely concerned about it breaking during shipping but packaging was definitely executed very well; It also has a big &amp;#34;Nail Polish Station&amp;#34; sign included, that I was NOT expecting</li>
            <li> Love the organization up on the wall and easy to select design/displays professionally.  </li>
            <li> so those size bottles fit just right.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with my new nail rack!</li>
            <li> I love my new nail polish rack!  </li>
            <li> Luckily, it was just the corners and not the shelves.</li>
            <li> This product shipped and arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if it was smaller and in light colors for use in the home.</li>
            <li> This was the perfect size to display the larger 15 ml bottles of my essential oils in the wall.</li>
            <li> The sides of it looked as if they had been super glued.</li>
            <li> the package came quickly and well protected.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I just love being able to see my entire collection.</li>
            <li> Both racks were wrapped in a flimsy sheet - there was no other padding inside the box, so it&#x27;s easy to see why cheap plastic would break so easily.</li>
            <li> I love this race it very helpful when you need any colors you see it right their.</li>
            <li> so I ordered a second and am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Item came exactly as described and was packaged securely.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> Nails because my walls are very funny</li>
            <li> Great product but subpar packaging ruins it.</li>
            <li> It came much quicker than I expected and she absolutely loved it!</li>
            <li> so my whole rack is full of bottles!</li>
            <li> so mine is almost full it holds up well on the wall with the right amount of nails to hold it up</li>
            <li> It looks so cool with all her nail polish in it, it is holding 101 bottles right now and</li>
            <li> It was easy to hang up and it is very sturdy</li>
            <li> but it is still super colorful when you get everything on it</li>
            <li> They are easy to hang, and very sturdy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy, drills easily into your wall, and really holds your polishes.</li>
            <li> yet so I cant really say how strong it is to hold almost 100 bottles, but I&#x27;ve had mine for about 3 months,</li>
            <li> This product came exactly as described!  </li>
            <li> The item was exactly as described!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> just exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> I certainly don&#x27;t feel comfortable putting my nail polishes in a cracked display.  </li>
            <li> Although the massage oil bottless are too large it fit behind the lip, they sit great on the top shelf.</li>
            <li> For example, the Nicole by OPI bottles don&#x27;t fit very well.  </li>
            <li> But you can fit almost that much.</li>
            <li> The return hassle really doesn&#x27;t sound like something I want to go through.</li>
            <li> This item is just amazing is big</li>
            <li> Very durable and fit over 96 bottles of polish.</li>
            <li> My polish rack was in great shape (there were a few scratches or smudges</li>
            <li> I was pleased with this polish rack - it didn&#x27;t quite fit 96 bottles for me, but I have mixed brands, shapes and sizes in it.  </li>
            <li> The price was worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s clear</li>
            <li> I also put some wrapping paper in the back so it would look nice</li>
            <li> I love it because I can get a clear view of the shades I have, and the ones I need, without getting doubles or losing them in a drawer or something.</li>
            <li> My husband had to drill more holes as we felt it wasnt secure enough.</li>
            <li> This is nice and solid.  </li>
            <li> Only thing I used my own.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so useful</li>
            <li> It holds a lot of bottles, but if they are tall, they can only fit on the top row.  </li>
            <li> wild,zoya, NYC, color club, sinful colors, pop, klean color, finger paints, piggy polish, milani, fresh paint, chinaglaze, and Nicole by opi.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t ask for better than that as far as customer service for shipping.  </li>
            <li> I got this order earlier than expected, no damage to the box or anything, Opened it and was in perfect condition!</li>
            <li> I ordered a smaller one that fit the space better.</li>
            <li> so you&#x27;re able to fit big ones too&lt;</li>
            <li> it was well worth buying....</li>
            <li> It gives a nice visual of all your nail colors.</li>
            <li> but it is definately worth the</li>
            <li> On par with most other reviews, this item is very cheaply made.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As some have said, the glue shows a tiny bit and there is a scratch near the top, but other than that, it&#x27;s perfect for storing nail polish.</li>
            <li> My daughter is very excited and surprised with her nail polish shelf.  </li>
            <li> very neat and clean looking, stands well on it&#x27;s own, provided that you don&#x27;t fill tops only, but, can also hang on wall.</li>
            <li> The polish rack came quickly and it was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and was exactly as specified.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick acrylic one,  good product!  </li>
            <li> ( I haven&#x27;t counted but that sounds right.)  </li>
            <li> I have about 100 bottles on nail polish on my rack right now.</li>
            <li> They fit pretty much every brand of polish except Nicole by OPI (which almost fits).</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and is a much better storage solution than all the bottles in a basket, which I had to dump out frequently.</li>
            <li> Maybe if it was totally full of polishes in a store, it would look better, but I needed something smaller for my bathroom.</li>
            <li> I assumed that Beauticom would send me a return label for the damaged one and would ship a nice one back; however, they wanted a photo first.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light-weight, but not flimsy construction, and mounts very easily; I used hercules hooks for the extra weight of the bottles of polish.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> This was a very smart purchase.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and easy to hang, it holds about 95 polishes, sadly I will have to order another one, LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> Holds all of my nail polish with so much room left over, looks like I need to buy more nail polish!</li>
            <li> This is the third one that I bought and I am very glad with the product I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> If you want something more decorative you can adhere colorful scrapbook paper to the back.</li>
            <li> The shipping was super fast too.</li>
            <li> The oils are easy to see because of the clear, acrylic fronts on the shelves.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and plastic as expected, but I absolutely love having all my nail polish so organized.</li>
            <li> so nice to keep track of my colors so that I don&#x27;t end up with too much in the same shade.</li>
            <li> shipped quickly, and I&#x27;ll absolutely buy another when I run out of room on this one.</li>
            <li> The rack came packaged nicely, but the screws were loose in the bottom of the box; almost threw them out by accident.</li>
            <li> Holds a lot, easy to install, and seems to be pretty durable so far.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Christmas present for 12 year old granddaughter who has many, many bottles of nail polish and really begged for two of these.</li>
            <li> Her polishes are not only organized and easy to see, they are displayed beautifully and takes very little space.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be getting some better hardware other than the cheap stuff that was included to hang it with.</li>
            <li> It comes in a huge box, but it is really slim and fits great right behind my bathroom door.  </li>
            <li> Seems durable and exactly what we had in mind for her to keep her collection organized,</li>
            <li> And it is very sturdy!</li>
            <li> I used 4 wood screws (not included) to hang it on my wall and it is holding up very well!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I finally decided to buy it.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> Everyone that comes into my room tells me it looks pretty too.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be ordering another very soon!  </li>
            <li> contacted seller and asked for replacement anchors after the first two bent</li>
            <li> If she fills this one up (which she is pretty close to doing)</li>
            <li> Exactly what my girlfriend wanted and needed for all her nail polish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ready for another one!</li>
            <li> Got exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> (only two mounting holes, at the top though).  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think so especially if you have many diff brands and sizes</li>
            <li> Just arrived today, very sturdy!  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed to organize my nail polishes.</li>
            <li> I absolutely ADORE this nail polish rack!</li>
            <li> This was exactly what my daughter wanted.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> She is a nail polish fanatic and this is great for her display all of her pretty colors.</li>
            <li> The item got to my house on time and was exactly what I was looking for...</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This was much higher quality material than I though it would be.</li>
            <li> This was EXACTLY what I was looking for and what I needed.  </li>
            <li> It is tacky, cheap looking, and every corner where the shelves attached together, glue was completely visible.</li>
            <li> It shipped fast and everything I was hoping for!</li>
            <li> I looked around at a lot of different ones and I am so glad this is the one I got.</li>
            <li> another one didn&#x27;t realize I had that much nail polish!</li>
            <li> Exactly as listed.  </li>
            <li> We bought 2 and stacked them vertically, but didn&#x27;t leave enough room between for tall bottles on the lower rack&#x27;s top shelf.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I love it and will be looking into a second one!</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t the most well made but they&#x27;re sturdy enough.</li>
            <li> There are 2 nail techs in my salon and we each brought many polishes in when starting.  </li>
            <li> I elected to install one &amp;#34;Polish Station&amp;#34; sign just at the top (bought 2, so I have 2), but it&#x27;s not necessary.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more sturdy than I was expecting it to be, especially now that it is hung with my polishes on it.</li>
            <li> It fits most of my bottles, with the only exception being Nicole by OPI.  </li>
            <li> It was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> this is so big that you will have to buy more polishes,lol.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for a friend and she absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li> I know what colors I already own (not duplicates), it can fit several brands of nail polish since bottles are different shapes</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted and it came in a couple of day.</li>
            <li> I have all my essential oils organized - it&#x27;s attached to the inside of my bathroom cupboard door :)</li>
            <li> It looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> This is the second rack I have purchased from this seller and am one hundred percent satisfied.</li>
            <li> Living with a wife and teenage daughter can be challenging at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This nail polish rack made my heart whole!</li>
            <li> The clear race is what make it very useful by see all the colors</li>
            <li> she was very excited to get this rack finally.</li>
            <li> I did, however,store maybe about 2 or 3 nail polishes on its side to fit them a little better.</li>
            <li> I also tested this rack with other brands I own</li>
            <li> I now do not need to shuffle through many bottles to find the color I want to use because this clear display rack shows all bottles/colors lined up clearly.</li>
            <li> As for the polish rack itself, it is a nice enough rack and completely serviceable.  </li>
            <li> Love the product so much I bought a second one.</li>
            <li> Love that is clear and you can see the colors of the polishes clearly.</li>
            <li> Received my organizer before than expected, was shipped through fedex wich I loved, and it comes really well packaged in its own box with dry ice, I love how they printed on the box Fragile Glass handle with care, even dough is not cause is made of acrylic but still is fragile</li>
            <li> I am not a professional I just love nail polish.  </li>
            <li> The only one that won&#x27;t fit is my really big bottle of Top Coat</li>
            <li> Came pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Pretty much any brand of polish you can think of, I have it.  </li>
            <li> so I liked that a lot the only problem is mine looks almost uneven from the top and</li>
            <li> Despite it not being classy and good looking, I actually prefer that it&#x27;s clear because it makes it easier to see everything.</li>
            <li> but the bottom came alittle detached like it wasn&#x27;t glued right other than that I love the size of it</li>
            <li> I bought two and installed them right on top of each other.  </li>
            <li> But if you turn them slightly to the side they fit just fine.  </li>
            <li> I strongly recommend measuring your space, as this rack is enormous.</li>
            <li> But it is strong enough to hold polish bottle weight.</li>
            <li> I ordered this not realizing how large it would be.  </li>
            <li> Depending on where you plan to put it, you may not want something with so large a footprint.</li>
            <li> I thought my collection was not that large</li>
            <li> and I will probably be purchasing a new one sometime soon as I only have room for 4 more polishes.</li>
            <li> It does fit Nicole by OPI, but&#x27;s it&#x27;s a tight fit.</li>
            <li> 60 counts are hard to find at a good price sell fast</li>
            <li> The only bottle that doesn&#x27;t fit facing straight forward are the Nicole by OPI bottles.  </li>
            <li> This rack is going to save me so much money because now I can see what I have</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sturdy.  </li>
            <li> It saves me so much space.  </li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t find what you really want.  </li>
            <li> It didnt hold up very well</li>
            <li> It came as one whole unit and is very well built.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not always available but keep checking back.</li>
            <li> This wall rack is very sturdy and durable.  </li>
            <li> and it really gives my room</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s very sturdy and looks like it did 2 years ago when I got it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping &amp; sturdy.</li>
            <li> I was really scared to break it</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I use these for my hobby game paints and they work out great.</li>
            <li> very well</li>
            <li> It is very sturdy.</li>
            <li> AND IT LOOKS VERY PROFESSIONAL&lt;</li>
            <li> part of why I don&#x27;t really buy NOPI anymore)</li>
            <li> I had to glue it together to make it whole.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very upset with this</li>
            <li> It came very well packaged and protected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really sturdy, with plastic and glass.</li>
            <li> ....for my nail polish obsession.  Very efficient storage.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got my second one and filled it up as well.  </li>
            <li> I have so much nail polish</li>
            <li> Very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this nail polish rack.</li>
            <li> I really did not notice it until I got it up on the wall.</li>
            <li> They are very sturdy and hold an ample supply of polishes.</li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> I really like this rack...</li>
            <li> Now I can really see all my colors.  </li>
            <li> Of course now my daughter wants one, too.</li>
            <li> Got it fast too</li>
            <li> Haha</li>
            <li> (I did get help from my husband, it would be a 2 person job to ensure they are straight, etc.)  </li>
            <li> ;  It is very sturdy and well put together.  </li>
            <li> I ended up getting a refund on this item and bought a much nicer wrought iron nail polish rack.</li>
            <li> Hold so much.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what I was looking for at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I really like this display.  </li>
            <li> so filled it the next day.  </li>
            <li> If this were a $15 or so shelf, it wouldn&#x27;t be as much of an issue.</li>
            <li> Also wasnt very well protected inside of the box.</li>
            <li> and is holding up very well.</li>
            <li> It comes with a cheasy top piece that says nail polish center</li>
            <li> The shelves appear to be glued on straight.</li>
            <li> I do highly recommend it if your nail polish is getting out of hand!</li>
            <li> I do plan on painting it because it&#x27;s clear, but that is more of a personal preference.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong, easy to attach to a wall, and the shelves are wide enough to accommodate large bottles like Deborah Lippmann.  </li>
            <li> She filled most levels with polish but also put in other smaller sized items, like perfume.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple: the way the nail polishes are shaped whether large or small in size will effect how many the rack is able to hold.</li>
            <li> It is a pretty large shelf but doesn&#x27;t look too bulky with the clear acrylic.</li>
            <li> it is low enough for very easy use.</li>
            <li> I love this and have given them as gifts for my other EO friends.</li>
            <li> I hung it on the wall in my smaller bathroom and it is easily accessible, but out of the way.  </li>
            <li> It fits perfectly as many polishes as it advertises, and it is extremely sturdy.</li>
            <li> So this rack is pretty versatile if you get a little creative with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So much better than the other racks going for close to $100 and some over $200 because it has some metal scrollwork?</li>
            <li> They look identical, although the first one seems to be of a little better quality.</li>
            <li> exactly what my 13 year old daughter wanted!</li>
            <li> one has a cheap looking glue sticking the parts together, and the glue is not clear so it is very visible.  </li>
            <li> Butter London would fill it up with less, however I have a mix of mini bottles and brands with smaller bottles (like Julep) or bottles that fit sideways (like Love &amp; Beauty).</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to watch her for hours digging and looking for the particular color she wants on any given day.</li>
            <li> While this doesn&#x27;t nearly hold all of it, it keeps enough of them off the floor and bathroom vanity to make me a little happy.  </li>
            <li> This rack is the same size, holds the same amount of polish, and gets the job done, but I would have preferred one like the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit arrived safely without defects and is very light-weight.  </li>
            <li> It holds so many bottles, is sturdy, and is very basic looking, so it doesn&#x27;t draw too much attention to the actual rack.  </li>
            <li> The clear acrylic allows the polish colors to show through nicely--at first glance it looks like a contemporary piece of art hanging on the wall.</li>
            <li> , I can just look at the wall, I put it behind the bedroom door so it is very visible, but only when I want to see it, so perfect, and it&#x27;s easy to hang, just a few screws</li>
            <li> But anyways I sent pictures via email showing the damage &amp; immediately got a reply saying that they were sending a brand new rack!</li>
            <li> Live it --- ordered another one!</li>
            <li> It may hold more or less than 96 depending on the brands and bottle shapes.  </li>
            <li> I drilled an extra set of holes in the second to last row just to make sure that it was extra safe and then mounted it to the wall with the screws and drywall anchors provided.</li>
            <li> Sad to report it was kind of cheap looking and also took up a lot of space.  </li>
            <li> I love the overall design of the rack, but next time I might try another brand or seller.</li>
            <li> decent display.</li>
            <li> all my Wet N Wild sideways to be able to accommodate brands like Orly or OPI.  </li>
            <li> I did however opt to use bigger equipment to hang it because I did not feel the tiny screws they sent with it would be as safe as I wanted for the wall.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This display is of high quality material.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> first one came damaged but not due to seller in fact</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice hard plastic with 4 holes to nail it to the wall.  </li>
            <li> Once it is filled with polish the glue is not really noticable.  </li>
            <li> The rack is clear plastic, so it is very lightwieght.</li>
            <li> This is the second rack I&#x27;ve purchased, so that should tell you something right there.</li>
            <li> Other than this damage, the items were accurate to their descriptions in terms of dimensions, etc.</li>
            <li> Brand new.  </li>
            <li> IT IN A STORE WHERE I LIVE</li>
            <li> I have no idea how I would live without them.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;ll never deal with this company again.i needed to return for a new 1 cause</li>
            <li> when my grandaughter opened on christmas morning it was damaged .they refused to send a new 1.well merry christmas to them.i&#x27;ll</li>
            <li> get a new 1</li>
            <li> Order these two items together so that you have somewhere to store all those new polishes.</li>
            <li> I have been on a reorganization kick as of the beginning of the New Year.</li>
            <li> I like this rack because it&#x27;s clear, goes with my salon decor, and holds a decent amount of polish.  </li>
            <li> So when I purchase a new color an old &amp; unused one must go!</li>
            <li> The acrylic is very clear and shiny.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> /&gt;Subsequently, this unit can hold 3 (three) of my 50 ink bottles, which pretty much makes this useless for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, since the packaging is designed to fall apart when unpacking, returning this item is not possible, so good bye $38.</li>
            <li> Now I know exactly what I have at a glance and no longer keep purchasing the same colors.</li>
            <li> Other than that, the gift was a hit and most likely</li>
            <li> I am surprised it held all my nailpolishes!</li>
            <li> It looks exactly as the picture just a teeny bit bigger.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described in listing the only problem I have is I need</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say it arrived early during normal shipping.</li>
            <li> I have 2 so far!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve currently got about 102 bottles total, many are smaller Julep brand, but I still plan on buying another rack to hold the rest of my stash!</li>
            <li> Product ordered was in multiples, none were exactly the same...</li>
            <li> First rack In mint condition, however scratches from abrasives n blemishes in the acrylic in the next two.</li>
            <li> This is good in a way because it definitely is strong enough to hold multiple nail polishes, but is also a little disadvantageous because it is extremely heavy to hang.  </li>
            <li> Just as I expected, shipped quick.</li>
            <li> This really helps me stay more organized, I even use my last two rows for other nail related products.</li>
            <li> That would be fine if it were for me, but Katie, a mother of three little ones, who is not technologically inclined told me she would just keep it.</li>
            <li> fit 106 some where small bottles, very sturdy thus far.</li>
            <li> they were tight but fit facing forward.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few years now that I&#x27;ve ordered this nail polish rack and it has been everything I expected and more!</li>
            <li> The racks hold all different kinds of polish; however, some of the fat bottles are too large for it.  </li>
            <li> I even have a 2nd one - mounted right above the first one and it looks like one big unit.</li>
            <li> The Nicole by OPI bottles fit if you put them a little bit sideways.</li>
            <li> Item was delievered when expected and was exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> The glue job is also messy, so there are streaks of glue in random parts of the rack, which, to be honest, makes it look very cheap.  </li>
            <li> My best friend and I just started getting a little overly obsessed with nail polishes and our collection doubled over a week or two.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the prettiest thing in the world (just plain acrylic), but I mounted it on one of my closet end shelves and it works just fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Quality is just what you would expect - clear plastic, not flimsy, but not the sturdiest either.  </li>
            <li> so you can see the labels clearly.</li>
            <li> The rack holds all brands and sizes of polish and since it&#x27;s clear acrylic, it fits with any room decor.</li>
            <li> To me the acrylic doesn&#x27;t bother me because I wanted clear shelving</li>
            <li> but Butter London bottles are too wide to be displayed sideways (and you can&#x27;t fit them two bottles deep, either).  </li>
            <li> And because it&#x27;s clear it will blend in with any décor.</li>
            <li> so I won&#x27;t get a second one - that will just lead to empty shelves begging to be filled ;  </li>
            <li> I can see all the colors through the clear plastic.</li>
            <li> I have a ton of Julep nail polish and so far I have over 150 bottles on one of these.</li>
            <li> got this for my 14 yr old and she loves it holds all her polish and some</li>
            <li> The rack enabled her to see her collection much easier than having to look through numerous boxes to find the color she was looking for,  </li>
            <li> I will repost once all is said and done, but so far I&#x27;m pouting.</li>
            <li> until now.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need to have a nail salon to need this - I have it on my wall near my master bath and it works PERFECT!&lt;br /&gt;Every</li>
            <li> I use it to hold all my Young Living Oils.</li>
            <li> There was no padding at all, which totally surprised me since they were shipping something</li>
            <li> The outer box was marked &amp;#34;Glass Fragile&amp;#34; but without any type of padding, it was doomed for breakage.  </li>
            <li> This was for my 11 year old daughter</li>
            <li> And, I don&#x27;t have near the weight that would be equivalent to 96 bottles of nail polish on it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It will do what it is supposed to do, but it is far from a thing of beauty. .</li>
            <li> I even put the colors in groups (gelish, regular polish, then nail art) and that makes my life much easier.  </li>
            <li> I bought this rack for my 11 year old daughter for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t have to rummage through my old box I used to store all of my nail polishes in.</li>
            <li> , she could never find the one she was looking for without taking nearly all of them out to sort them.  </li>
            <li> The stand is sturdy and looks professional.</li>
            <li> This rack looks like the ones in the professional nail salon.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how much polish i actually had</li>
            <li> It hold approximately 95 bottles of polish (I only use OPI and Essie; both brands fit comfortably on the rack).</li>
            <li> Kind of confusing in which one you get when you place your order as there is a couple of different styles.</li>
            <li> The fact that it was already broken right out of the box does not give me any hope that it would hold 96 bottles securely.</li>
            <li> The item is extremely sturdy, and although I will add two more holes at the bottom for extra security that is also a personal preference.</li>
            <li> I will most likely order another next time, because I still have about 40 other polishes in need to be stored in a wall rack.</li>
            <li> and I was surprised because some of the bottles are pretty big fat different shapes</li>
            <li> I had bought this same product a few months ago, and the one I bought months ago is really nice, but the one that I got in the mail this time was a much cheaper, uglier looking version of the previous one.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great space saver and doesn&#x27;t look weird on your wall at home if you&#x27;re not a professional.</li>
            <li> and I was hoping the box would simply say Amazon on the outside instead of exactly what it was.  </li>
            <li> it was not the exact same one, although it came in with the same model number.</li>
            <li> Hung the rack up today - easy as pie, only two wall screws (not included, we used heavy duty wall anchors).  </li>
            <li> I accidentally had this product shipped to an old address and when I tried to get it redirected or held at a Fedex station, I was told by fedex that the sender didn&#x27;t opt in for this service - this service definitely is helpful, especially when the item is large and wouldn&#x27;t be left if not accepted.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on the longevity of this particular rack as I&#x27;ve only had it a short time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also has a cute little sign from time to time it falls down</li>
            <li> It came in a fairly short amount of time, and it was completely unscathed when it arrived at my house.</li>
            <li> I decided to place this rack inside my closet on a bare wall</li>
            <li> And the way that the bottles are designed in these two brands I wasn&#x27;t surprised they didn&#x27;t fir properly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shelf nearly 8 months now, and have discovered stress cracks in several places.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this nail polish display rack for my 16 year old daughter as a Christmas present.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing another in the near future</li>
            <li> barely 1/4&amp;#34</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only taken it out of the already opened box, the bottom shelf was off, the glue didnt hold.</li>
            <li> My 17yr old is a recent cancer SURVIVOR  &amp; THIS was 1 of the items on her Christmas list.</li>
            <li> Christmas present for my 16 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It may seem like overkill, buying a rack that holds this much nail polish for use at home, but once some time is spent searching drawers, purses, cabints and cars...</li>
            <li> One came broken at the top which was not the sellers fault.  </li>
            <li> This rack is so much better though and it makes going into my closet feel like opening a secret door to a spa (see my customer photo).</li>
            <li> Not too thick so it can fit almost&lt;br /</li>
            <li> It came broken, in three pieces despite the sellers attempts to ship it safely.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it is not deep enough to hold my rectangular shaped nail polish remover on the top (however, that&#x27;s not a big enough issue to knock it down a star for me).</li>
            <li> My husband installed one above the other, behind our home office door where the lighting is good (floor torchere lamp nearby).</li>
            <li> Very nice too bad</li>
            <li> But other it just as it was described, shipping was fast, and the screws were provided for me to mount it on my wall.</li>
            <li> It was still a little too expensive, but luckily for me it was a graduation gift to myself :)</li>
            <li> Not even clear glue, SOLID WHITE GLUE!</li>
            <li> I store those each on a different shelf at the far left</li>
            <li> At first I was a little overwhelmed with the size</li>
            <li> use my wall rack in tandem with a used jewelry floor cabinet we purchased (center lift top, center multiple drawers and side wings that open that my husband build shelves into for me), for all my other fingernail art obsession</li>
            <li> I went from baskets and drawers full of polishes I didn&#x27;t use often because they were all over the place and hard to see what I owned.</li>
            <li> I will be buying another one pretty soon as I have gotten into the habit of changing my nail color every few days and with spring/summer and sandal weather</li>
            <li> Rack was exactly as pictured and did not have a \\&quot;Polish Station\\&quot; topper like a few reviews have mentioned.</li>
            <li> The only annoying part of this rack was the fact that the Nicole opi polish was barely able to fit in the rack.</li>
            <li> Everyone complaining about it not holding exactly 96 polishes is missing the point.</li>
            <li> My shelf came with a small crack in the acrylic, but it wasn&#x27;t worth sending back</li>
            <li> the positive side, it is well packed and protected and was received within a few days after ordering.</li>
            <li> only comes with 4 anchors and there are 4 holes if you hang the top part, two of my anchors bent and were not able to be used, so i didn&#x27;t put the top part on, its kinda ugly anyways</li>
            <li> However, the wall I put it on had wonky stud spacing anyway, so we pre-drilled 2 holes in the center of the rack, and it&#x27;s holding up just fine.</li>
            <li> So, I was really excited to receive this, and when I opened the box, my disappointment set in when I realized there is a huge crack down the bottom of the rack.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that there are only two holes to secure the unit the the wall, and I was afraid that once I put 90+ bottles on it, it wouldn&#x27;t be strong enough to hold.  </li>
            <li> For the smaller bottle brands (like The New Black)</li>
            <li> the stripe rite ones since they have such a long cap, totally recommend this one.</li>
            <li> exactly the time I expected, within a few days.  </li>
            <li> For something that&#x27;s meant as a display item, it&#x27;s a little frustrating that it really doesn&#x27;t even look new and every single shelf has large glue streaks and splatters.</li>
            <li> and I put my clear, black, and white at the end.  </li>
            <li> I have waited a long time to finally buy a nail polish rack.</li>
            <li> She was looking to buy those over the door hanging bags, but they didn&#x27;t hold some of her taller long stemmed bottles properly.  </li>
            <li> A tiny bit bigger than I had expected,</li>
            <li> Came broken but replaced quickly</li>
            <li> I was extremely disillusioned with delivery since I paid for 2 day shipping on December 21st but did not receive the item until January 2nd.</li>
            <li> Such as a Butter London polish is twice as wide as a Julep polish.</li>
            <li> Comes with a Polish Center sign you can use, you attach it to the back on the screws that anchor the wall piece.</li>
            <li> I colored coded them according to the color spectrum &amp;#34;ROY G BIV&amp;#34; (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo,</li>
            <li> When installing, be careful when thighting the screws to attach it to the wall, use just enough force or it will break.</li>
            <li> Granted, this is a problem with the NOPI bottle shape being too strange (and</li>
            <li> Actually what I expected. ..</li>
            <li> Since I am not a professional, I chose not to use the toppers that came with the racks.</li>
            <li> Not for long.</li>
            <li> We just ordered another one for shades and tints of black and white, silver and gold only.  </li>
            <li> The box was very thin and had huge holes all over it.</li>
            <li> For the short term (e.g. 5 years or so) this shouldn&#x27;t be a problem, but I&#x27;ve noticed on other cemented products, after some time the plastic starts to craze and the joints begin to crack.  </li>
            <li> I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have waited so long to buy!</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars due to the scratch.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my shelf arrived broken with the top right corner missing.</li>
            <li> It also came with some plastic piece that I think must be decorative to hang above the case, but I didn&#x27;t see the point and it seemed like a waste of plastic and extra shipping cost.  </li>
            <li> This is a /constructed/ rack (not molded) meaning that it is cemented together instead of a single molded piece.  </li>
            <li> Not worth it for the money,  the plastic quality is very low!</li>
            <li> ; when in reality, the unit is less than 1.5 inches deep, which raises two questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have about 75 nail polish bottles currently and had been previously storing them all in a hanging organizer.</li>
            <li> easy to hang on wall thin enough to place behind door</li>
            <li> Since I always do my nails at her house we decided that something needed to change about our current storage system that consisted of two little boxes overflowing with bottles and nail</li>
            <li> I still have a little bit of room to grow my extensive selection.  </li>
            <li> Thought it was a little bigger</li>
            <li> but disappointed while opening the package it broke to the top its very fragile flimsy must be very careful with it</li>
            <li> I recommend it to any person that wants to organize small bottles or small boxes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got 2 1/2 empty rows.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> (a fuji polish station, with the pink heart box as it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> its wider than expected</li>
            <li> I just had to be careful when attaching the shelf to the wall.</li>
            <li> I ordered one and it arrived broken, the company sent me another one free of charge and it arrived broken in the same place.  </li>
            <li> The bottle brands were, opi, wet n</li>
            <li> it roughly holds about 100 bottles depending on size of the bottle of polish.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I underestimated the amount of polish I have and need to order another rack, but it will be well worth the investment.  </li>
            <li> This product did come before the date expected.</li>
            <li> it was packaged really carefully; the seller surrounded it in Styrofoam and foam peanuts.</li>
            <li> You can see the gule everywhere on the seams and one row is not straight.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Buyer beware: if you buy this from a third-party seller, return shipping (that you will be expected to pay if you are dissatisfied) will run you in excess of $25 at UPS.</li>
            <li> The padding inside the box is minimal...</li>
            <li> It is not what I expected at all</li>
            <li> But for $33 plus $5.50 shipping - close to $40 spent on an acrylic shelf, you expect it to look well made.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected</li>
            <li> The only brand I had trouble placing was Nicole by OPI, but I managed to squeeze them all in without it looking tacky.</li>
            <li> As expected .</li>
            <li> It arrived in a thin box that had been placed inside of the main outer shipping box but there was absolutely no cushioning around this rack.  </li>
            <li> This addresses the tall bottles and  takes up very little overall space</li>
            <li> Not sure it holds the 96 bottles as advertised considering the different shapes and sizes of bottles</li>
            <li> Mine does not have any scratches, cracks or glue issues like some of the other reviews have stated.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> It was shipped extremely well.</li>
            <li> No chips, cracks or any other dings that I could see.</li>
            <li> However, it fits EVERY OTHER BRAND.</li>
            <li> It took me a while to give in due to the cost</li>
            <li> I will be requesting a replacement of this item due to the damage.</li>
            <li> Could use for other things.</li>
            <li> but it doesnt hold 96 regular size nail polish bottles maybe small sample bottles</li>
            <li> Overall a little too much of a hassle for a product that arrived broken and missing parts!</li>
            <li> The only problem with these racks is that they are just a little bit too narrow on the shelves.</li>
            <li> I took one star off because, unfortunately, upon opening the box and unwrapping the rack, I found that the top corner was broken off.</li>
            <li> Came broken into several different pieces.</li>
            <li> One was cracked along the side, and the other was broken in multiple places - when I first opened the package, I could hear the broken plastic rattling around in the box.</li>
            <li> so I can have my nail polish organized, but for the price I paid, it&#x27;s not worth it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the hassle.  </li>
            <li> The only negative for me is that there are no pre-drilled holes or way to hang it.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that my Nicole by OPI nail polishes have to set sideways.  </li>
            <li> ; thick styrofoam pellet sheets on the front &amp; back sides of the rack.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a single bad thing to say, will be back again to purchase a fourth in the future!</li>
            <li> and my product will hit the tile floor, so I&#x27;m taking it down.  </li>
            <li> It does come with the \\&quot;Polish Station\\&quot; topper (as shown on a few of the other polish racks listed on Amazon), but the piece is separate and does not need to be used</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I tried to order it again, but it must have been a different vendor/manufacturer because it says it has the same measurements as this one, but they are not!</li>
            <li> Even the odd shaped ones.</li>
            <li> If you put your rectangular bottles at an angle (e.g., Butter London) or have typical polish bottles (OPI, Orly, Nubar, Zoya</li>
            <li> The glue where the shelves are placed is visible, but that will be hidden by polish bottles</li>
            <li> in my opinion that would only be if you merely buy drugstore brands only.  </li>
            <li> one of the little levels was not even glued down and the bottom level was loose as well :/</li>
            <li> It was a mess in boxes.</li>
            <li> I ended up unable to resist doing it by brand, with the exception of keeping my base coats, base/top coat combos, and top coats together since they are all mostly clear.</li>
            <li> I was quite disappointed because I made a point of ordering the exact same one, only to get a worse version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased this unit to hold fountain pen ink bottles and all but a few are less than 2 inches in diameter.</li>
            <li> It holds almost all of my nail polishes (some bottles are a little fat, but I squeeze them in to make them work)...</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to organize my nail polishes and make my room look a little bit less cluttered!</li>
            <li> My only disappointment with this item is that the acrylic has alot of tiny scratches, and there are visible glue marks everywhere.</li>
            <li> Some taller bottles will not fit..</li>
            <li> I also have one Nicole bottle and a few</li>
            <li> Rather than go through the hassle of returning it, I&#x27;m going to try to glue the broken pieces back on.  </li>
            <li> Ordered two and they both arrived seemly in one piece on the outside but were broken once I opened the boxes.</li>
            <li> She sorted by color and noticed she was missing some colors in the spectrum</li>
            <li> This was further frustrating since the range of dates for delivery given was December 26th through December 28th.</li>
            <li> Cons: Do not fit 96bottle</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teen daughter&#x27;s room for her gazillions nail polishes and upon opening the box (poor packaging)</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, when I opened the box, the bottom right corner was broken into pieces.</li>
            <li> I have a small box of odd bottles</li>
            <li> The one I was hoping to receive was plain, with no corny wording and sturdier looking.    </li>
            <li> (because I could not easily see what I already had).  </li>
            <li> so to avoid a huge mess of broken nail polish on my wood floors, I&#x27;m returning it. :-(</li>
            <li> and it adds a little glam effect to the area!  </li>
            <li> i was shocked by how fast this arrived.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t take all of the bottles taking up my small space anymore</li>
            <li> Thick, heavy plastic material.</li>
            <li> I have a small room</li>
            <li> Not sure how nail polish bottles it can hold</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid the shelf will crack completely</li>
            <li> :-/  </li>
            <li> We installed them into the studs; not sure it would support the weight of the nail polishes if we hadn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There was 1 small issue.</li>
            <li> It fits all my bottles of polish as well as a few tools!</li>
            <li> and my husband had to drill one of the holes because it was too small.</li>
            <li> It takes up a small space on the wall.</li>
            <li> No much better than the baskets I kept them in before....</li>
            <li> Really, sorely disappointed.  </li>
            <li> for.&lt;br /&gt;Very thin plastic cracks if you tighten the screws too tight.</li>
            <li> Gave the broken one to my neighbors little girl for her TY dolls.</li>
            <li> Plus, their return policy sounds shoddy.</li>
            <li> and I can put at least 96 bottles on it.  </li>
            <li> its crazy simple to hang.</li>
            <li> i dont understand the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> At least the nail polish will cover it.</li>
            <li> I bought this wall rack for my daughter who has a serious polish collection.  </li>
            <li> It arrived broken and it was too late to return it.  </li>
            <li> I think it made it look stupid, so I left it off, duh,</li>
            <li> was a bit disappointed that the pre-drilled holes were 16.5&amp;#34; apart instead of the regular 16&amp;#34; of wall studs.</li>
            <li> but, i got so tired of digging through a box of nail polishes, and leaving them all over the place.</li>
            <li> Ordered two and both had the corners broken.</li>
            <li> This product arrived with broken pieces.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t inside the box, so I&#x27;m assuming it was broken before it was packaged; and not during the delivery process.</li>
            <li> And I opened it and the rack was even worse.</li>
            <li> Installed on a wall behind a door.</li>
            <li> it was poor quality; well it had some glue on it</li>
            <li> we opened the box and the rack broken.</li>
            <li> The rack had to be broken when it was put in the box.</li>
            <li> It was broken and unusable when I took it out of the box.</li>
            <li> The product was broken on arrival.</li>
            <li> the corner was broken and the side was falling apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Amazon box was not damaged, but item inside was cracked and broken pieces.</li>
            <li> I was unable to track the package, and that is incredibly frustrating.</li>
            <li> At least now I can SEE my collection!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in the second rack I purchased.</li>
            <li> You cant go wrong with this price.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> The companies displays were just too expensive.</li>
            <li> It was so difficult to find the one I wanted.</li>
            <li> That is really unfortunate.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It came with a cheesy looking topper/crown type thing that says &#x27;polish station&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Sadly, it will be returned tomorrow.</li>
            <li> - some say it&#x27;s cheesy, but I like it.</li>
            <li> When i recieved it, it was scratched and there was glue all over it, carelessly put together.</li>
            <li> Cannot go wrong, people.</li>
            <li> When it arrived and opened was disappointed to find it poorly put together.  </li>
            <li> So disappointing.</li>
            <li> I paid about 40 bucks for this stupid thing and got the one that was listed as $15 to $25 dollars from beauticom, with the cheesy looking \\&quot;Polish Station\\&quot; topper.  </li>
            <li> Both of us are disappointed.</li>
            <li> :-(  </li>
            <li> Get this one you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How disappointing!</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very very disappointed. :(</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter for Christmas and was appalled at the terrible quality of it since I paid practically forty dollars for it.</li>
            <li> My husband hated that &amp;#34;clink</li>
            <li> so I was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> My outrageous collection of polish now looks like a piece of art on my wall.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift.  It hung easily in my nieces bathroom and held many polish bottles.  Seems durable and exactly what we had in mind for her to keep her collection organized,</li>
            <li> I love this shelf! 96 bottles is an estimate of how many it holds. I have a ton of Julep nail polish and so far I have over 150 bottles on one of these. And it is very sturdy! I used 4 wood screws (not included) to hang it on my wall and it is holding up very well! I would definitely buy this again. If you want something more decorative you can adhere colorful scrapbook paper to the back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect! Fits all my nail Polish and looks awesome on my wall!</li>
            <li> DAUGHTER LOVED IT AND WANTS ANOTHER</li>
            <li> I love it... I was running out of dresser space to display my growing supply of nail colors and saw this item. The quality is great. The product is strong, well made, holds 96 bottles of polish and can sit on a table or be hung on a wall or door. I now do not need to shuffle through many bottles to find the color I want to use because this clear display rack shows all bottles/colors lined up clearly. The rack is made to hold and keep the bottles of polish neatly and has a ridge to stop them from falling off yet it is low enough for very easy use. No struggles to chose a color or to replace it after use. I will be buying another one pretty soon as I have gotten into the habit of changing my nail color every few days and with spring/summer and sandal weather I plan to purchase many more bottles. :)</li>
            <li> Great rack did not have the problems with the nicole polishes by opi they were tight but fit facing forward. I went from baskets and drawers full of polishes I didn&#x27;t use often because they were all over the place and hard to see what I owned. I originally bought one and realized i had way more polishes than I thought so I ordered a second and am very pleased.</li>
            <li> very neat and clean looking, stands well on it&#x27;s own, provided that you don&#x27;t fill tops only, but, can also hang on wall. I have bought two as gifts, both recipients LOVE them!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know my wife and daughter had so many nail polish bottles. They can open a store. Matter a fact this unit holds all 96 bottles they have. I have a store on my wall. So why do I find the bottles still on my table? That&#x27;s the million dollar question!</li>
            <li> This rack is great. I bought a second one when I realized that it was a good buy and quality. It looks great in my walk in closet and fits all of my polish. You cant go wrong with this price.</li>
            <li> Great item, super fast shipping very happy I bought them here!!</li>
            <li> I love it! I&#x27;ve been debating whether or not to get one for the longest time and I&#x27;m glad I finally decided to buy it. Can&#x27;t wait to organize my nail polishes and make my room look a little bit less cluttered! I docked a star because the corner pieces were chipped. Luckily, it was just the corners and not the shelves. Also, it doesn&#x27;t come with hardware to mount onto your wall. Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of the nail polish rack and I absolutely love it. It keeps all my nail polishes organize and all on display</li>
            <li> It was very easy to install.  It holds about 90 polish bottles of varried sizes. This rack is going to save me so much money because now I can see what I have and hopefully I won&#x27;t have duplicates.</li>
            <li> It feels sturdy with the screws so I liked that a lot the only problem is mine looks almost uneven from the top and one of the little levels was not even glued down and the bottom level was loose as well :/</li>
            <li> 2nd one I have bought, it is great.</li>
            <li> got this for my 14 yr old and she loves it holds all her polish and some</li>
            <li> Happy with purchase.  Shipped in way over sized box!</li>
            <li> I love this product because you can see all the colors of the polish right away. I think I may have gotten more than 96 bottle on the rack, but I didn&#x27;t count them, so I can&#x27;t say for sure. Sturdy and holds the polish securely.</li>
            <li> Very Cool!  Very easy to install.  Is a great way to organize my nail polish.  Now I know exactly what I have at a glance and no longer keep purchasing the same colors.</li>
            <li> Love it! Easy to hang</li>
            <li> Sturdy, well-made rack.  I thought I had a lot of polish until I put them in the rack.  I&#x27;ve got 2 1/2 empty rows.  Looks like I&#x27;ll have to buy a lot more polish to fill it up!</li>
            <li> I am not a professional I just love nail polish.  It&#x27;s everywhere!  I couldn&#x27;t take all of the bottles taking up my small space anymore and I ordered this and love it.  It&#x27;s a nice hard plastic with 4 holes to nail it to the wall.  It&#x27;s very sturdy.  It saves me so much space.  It also looks pretty on the wall :).  Another thing about it is that when you&#x27;re looking for that perfect nail polish and you have bottles everywhere you can&#x27;t find what you really want.  With this rack you can see all of your colors at once to pick the shade you&#x27;re looking for.  I really enjoy being able to see all of my nail polish at once.  Everyone that comes into my room tells me it looks pretty too.  I organized all of my polish by color and I love picking out the perfect red or blue.  I want to get my niece one too because like me she has nail polish everywhere.  It&#x27;s a great space saver and doesn&#x27;t look weird on your wall at home if you&#x27;re not a professional.</li>
            <li> This product came exactly as described!  The only drawback is that it was a Christmas gift and I was hoping the box would simply say Amazon on the outside instead of exactly what it was.  Other than that, the gift was a hit and most likely I&#x27;ll be ordering another very soon!  Thank you!  :)</li>
            <li> I was pleased with this polish rack - it didn&#x27;t quite fit 96 bottles for me, but I have mixed brands, shapes and sizes in it.  I got to about 90 bottles before it was full.  Quality is just what you would expect - clear plastic, not flimsy, but not the sturdiest either.  It screws into the wall with 2 screws at the top.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to have any problems with the weight of 90 bottles of polish.  It does come with the \\&quot;Polish Station\\&quot; topper (as shown on a few of the other polish racks listed on Amazon), but the piece is separate and does not need to be used (I threw mine away).</li>
            <li> easy to hang on wall thin enough to place behind door</li>
            <li> Although packaging was more than sufficient , carton was visibly damaged during shipping and display arrived with a large chip and crack in it. I repaired it the best I could as it was needed to sell products !</li>
            <li> It met my standards. I love it!!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of nail polish and having this on my wall is an easy way to find the nail polish color you need. It was easy to hang up and it is very sturdy</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described love it</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these displays to hold my nail polish, and both came damaged. One was cracked along the side, and the other was broken in multiple places - when I first opened the package, I could hear the broken plastic rattling around in the box. Both racks were wrapped in a flimsy sheet - there was no other padding inside the box, so it&#x27;s easy to see why cheap plastic would break so easily. Other than this damage, the items were accurate to their descriptions in terms of dimensions, etc. and I&#x27;m able to fit 15 OPI polishes per shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, if you need one of these, prepare yourself for the possibility of receiving a damaged package &amp; having to take the time to return/re-order until you get racks that are fully in tact.</li>
            <li> I love this race it very helpful when you need any colors you see it right their. The clear race is what make it very useful by see all the colors</li>
            <li> I needed some space at my shop. The polish rack came quickly and it was exactly what I needed. The only thing I would have liked more would have been if the racks were wider some of the bottles won&#x27;t fit but it was perfect outside of that.</li>
            <li> I loved this from the moment I took it out of the box.  High quality and made exceptionally.  Ladies if you have polish you want to display get this one you will love it.</li>
            <li> My daughter is very excited and surprised with her nail polish shelf.  It was easy to install and fits all of her polishes and nail supplies!</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this nail polish rack. It is an awesome way to store nail polish. Now I know exactly what colors I own. The item was exactly as described! No complaints :)</li>
            <li> the rack itself is awesome the plastic anchors that come with it to hang it were cheap. i have an extra hole in my wall now because of it. i don&#x27;t think it was my fault i asked several people how to use them before i started and everyone gave me simple instructions and i watched a video on \\&quot;how to\\&quot; use them. only comes with 4 anchors and there are 4 holes if you hang the top part, two of my anchors bent and were not able to be used, so i didn&#x27;t put the top part on, its kinda ugly anyways (its like an extra piece of plastic that says \\&quot;polish station\\&quot; or something like that. contacted seller and asked for replacement anchors after the first two bent i was worried i wouldn&#x27;t get it hung up or i would have to go buy some at home depot or something, no response. i went to bed and hung it this morning without problems... holds a lot of polish and it looks nice.</li>
            <li> bought this shelf for my wife after she had me build her one out of foam board that she saw on pintrest. It didnt hold up very well so she found this one. I was expecting it to come in pieces of semi-flimsy plastic that snap together. I was wrong. It came as one whole unit and is very well built. Thick, heavy plastic material. This thing isnt going anywhere. Not sure it holds the 96 bottles as advertised considering the different shapes and sizes of bottles but itll hold plenty. If she fills this one up (which she is pretty close to doing) I have no problem buying her another to mount along side it.</li>
            <li> I use this to hold my essential oils and it works awesome</li>
            <li> This was the best polish rack for the money I&#x27;ve found on the internet. It&#x27;s not always available but keep checking back. Worth every penny! Holds all types of bottles.</li>
            <li> this product got all my daughters nail polishes off the dresser,desk,floor,etc...and put them in one place. Now they wont get lost. Great Idea</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd 90 count nail polish rack I have ordered from Amazon, great price, packaging and ship time. Reorder if I need another one.</li>
            <li> This product shipped and arrived quickly.  Easy to mount to wall.  I was able to fit in polishes from any brand that I own.  It may hold more or less than 96 depending on the brands and bottle shapes.  Such as a Butter London polish is twice as wide as a Julep polish.</li>
            <li> Love it! Nice for all my nail polishes. I have it in my home and is perfect. I have so many nail polishes. I need to buy another one though. It was easy to hang on the wall.</li>
            <li> I bought this wall rack for my daughter who has a serious polish collection.  The rack enabled her to see her collection much easier than having to look through numerous boxes to find the color she was looking for,  We have not attached the rack to the wall yet but looks very easy to do so.</li>
            <li> I am so upset. This is a gift for my granddaughter and it is cracked. The box had a tuck in on each end and was not even taped up. It should never have been shippled this way!!</li>
            <li> Item came exactly as described and was packaged securely. Mine does not have any scratches, cracks or glue issues like some of the other reviews have stated. It was easy to install with the help of another person. Seems secure and the shelves are holding up well. Now I just need more polish to fill it up! :D</li>
            <li> holds a lot of polishes in a variety of sizes and shapes.  looks clean and tidy.  mounts easily to wall.</li>
            <li> We gave one of these to our daughter for Christmas. She&#x27;s a nail tech who does nails in her home. she liked it so much we got her another one!</li>
            <li> Looks great easy to install.  Exactly what my girlfriend wanted and needed for all her nail polish. Some taller bottles will not fit..</li>
            <li> My best friend and I just started getting a little overly obsessed with nail polishes and our collection doubled over a week or two.  Since I always do my nails at her house we decided that something needed to change about our current storage system that consisted of two little boxes overflowing with bottles and nail tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had seen on a blog that someone had ordered a display rack from Amazon and so I searched.  The price was worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We organized all our bottles by brand and color spectrum and it looks amazing.  It is so easy to see which shades we want now, and adds a nice touch of color to the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your collection is growing out of control, look into this.</li>
            <li> sturdy, holds alot of polishes, looks great from afar.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I could not ask for more. It arrived, I hammered two pins into the wall, hung it up, and arranged my polishes. I&#x27;m ready for another one!</li>
            <li> I am surprised it held all my nailpolishes! The only one that won&#x27;t fit is my really big bottle of Top Coat but that&#x27;s to be expected. I love seeing them all displayed out like that. i used to keep them in a shoebox! Muuuch better!</li>
            <li> I love this rack. It has so much space and displays all of my polishes in a very nice way. It was also easy to hang up and came put together.</li>
            <li> This wall rack is very sturdy and durable.  The racks hold all different kinds of polish; however, some of the fat bottles are too large for it.  For example, the Nicole by OPI bottles don&#x27;t fit very well.  Other than that, it was very easy to hang on the wall and looks great.</li>
            <li> Great product! put it up as soon as i got home. easy to put on the wall and is stable.</li>
            <li> I already owned this nail  polish rack and i wanted another one since my collection has grown already. it is very sturdy, easy to put on, im in love with this one,</li>
            <li> This was a great gift.  My friend who received the rack was very happy.  Quick shipping. Brand new.  Got exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Love it! Now i can see all the colors of nail polish i have. Had to order another nail polish rack.</li>
            <li> This is a /constructed/ rack (not molded) meaning that it is cemented together instead of a single molded piece.  For the short term (e.g. 5 years or so) this shouldn&#x27;t be a problem, but I&#x27;ve noticed on other cemented products, after some time the plastic starts to craze and the joints begin to crack.  I can&#x27;t comment on the longevity of this particular rack as I&#x27;ve only had it a short time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It mounts easily enough (only two mounting holes, at the top though).  Fully stocked it seems to hold well, no complaints.</li>
            <li> This polish rack is the perfect size for a salon that is limited on space.  The clear acrylic allows the polish colors to show through nicely--at first glance it looks like a contemporary piece of art hanging on the wall.</li>
            <li> Very Nice, Well Made And Looks Super In My Shop! And Does Come With A Super Nice Top Sign, &amp;#34;Reads Polish Station&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I now own 3 of these, no complaints! I keep coming back as my nail polish collection grows.  I ordered them on the 17th and they got here on the 20th! Even though the estimated shipping says 22nd-26th! I don&#x27;t have a single bad thing to say, will be back again to purchase a fourth in the future! (:</li>
            <li> It arrived broken and it was too late to return it.  I bought it for my daughter and waited till she came to visit to actually open it and by then the exchange period had expired.</li>
            <li> My 12 year old daughter is thrilled to have this on the wall in her bedroom.  It is great, I do notice some of the glue showing through but once filled with polish it looks great for our purposes.  It is so much better than our plastic bin of polish.</li>
            <li> So, I was really excited to receive this, and when I opened the box, my disappointment set in when I realized there is a huge crack down the bottom of the rack.  I certainly don&#x27;t feel comfortable putting my nail polishes in a cracked display.  I am going to try to get in touch with the company - I hope it&#x27;s not a hassle to return.  I will repost once all is said and done, but so far I&#x27;m pouting.</li>
            <li> I bought this in 2012 and it is still going strong. I have a small room so I nailed it to the wall next to my bed and it really gives my room a more girly and pretty look. I can fit around 15 to 16 bottles per row and I counted 91 bottles total including 8 mini polishes. I don&#x27;t have space for another bottle. However, it&#x27;s very sturdy and looks like it did 2 years ago when I got it. Thank you seller!</li>
            <li> It is handy to have.  The size is more for a business . It would be nice if it was smaller and in light colors for use in the home.</li>
            <li> Came pretty fast. And it&#x27;s great if your collection of nail polishes isn&#x27;t that huge YET. lol - I Can fit 14 full size china glaze in one row. &amp; squeze a nail art pen at the end of that row. - Can you really fit 90? I don&#x27;t think so especially if you have many diff brands and sizes But you can fit almost that much. But its great and easy to put on the wall. Will be buying rack #2 very soon! :)</li>
            <li> The rack I received is not the rack in the picture.  I paid about 40 bucks for this stupid thing and got the one that was listed as $15 to $25 dollars from beauticom, with the cheesy looking \\&quot;Polish Station\\&quot; topper.  (a fuji polish station, with the pink heart box as it&#x27;s ad describes it)  The one I was hoping to receive was plain, with no corny wording and sturdier looking.    I guess I&#x27;ll keep it.  I&#x27;m only putting it up in my closet so I can have my nail polish organized, but for the price I paid, it&#x27;s not worth it.  It&#x27;s cheap looking and feeling.  Really, sorely disappointed.  I&#x27;d return it but the process would cost me more money and I&#x27;d have to wait even longer.  It&#x27;s not worth the hassle.  Plus, their return policy sounds shoddy.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping &amp; sturdy. It came with a label header to go on top, however the holes on the header dont line up with ones on the display. But I won&#x27;t be using the header anyway</li>
            <li> I have it displayed in my bathroom. Most people that go into my bathroom notice it right away and ask where I got it from. Great idea.</li>
            <li> Came as described, it comes with the screws to anchor it to a wall. No visible scratches or cracks. Comes with a Polish Center sign you can use, you attach it to the back on the screws that anchor the wall piece.I need another one!!</li>
            <li> My girls got two of these and it holds all of their nail polish.  I figured if they can youtube how to do their own manicure than I could save $ and headaches from they whining how they want a manicure.</li>
            <li> This is perfect! My daughter has so many bottles of polish and this works awesome. Not to big so it looks great on the wall. Hung just fine and she already needs another!! Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a really great product. Easy to install. We have so many polishes I think we may need another one!</li>
            <li> was what it appeared to be in picture,  Fit my space perfectly, looks good and finally all my nail polishes are organized as opposed to thrown in a drawer.  i love it.</li>
            <li> This was the perfect size to display the larger 15 ml bottles of my essential oils in the wall. The companies displays were just too expensive. I love this and have given them as gifts for my other EO friends.</li>
            <li> This nail polish rack is awesome! Holds over 100 nail polish bottles, was easy to attach to wall. Great purchase!</li>
            <li> Just amazing!! My daughter loves it so much!!! It fit perfectly in her rom and looks great!! She gets compliments from everyone about it!! Amazing product!</li>
            <li> I received this item today in the mail and I couldn&#x27;t be any happier. It came on time! It came in one piece and it looks amazing. Not sure how nail polish bottles it can hold but I will soon! I am satisfy with this item!!!!</li>
            <li> The product did not look good at all. The sides of it looked as if they had been super glued.</li>
            <li> Love this! A tiny bit bigger than I had expected, but I love it. Fits all of my polishes perfectly. Most of my nail polishes are OPI or Essie so those size bottles fit just right. I also have one Nicole bottle and a few revlon they all fit fine. There are six rows and I have four rows filled still with plenty of room for more. Love the look of it in my room. It looks exactly as the picture just a teeny bit bigger.</li>
            <li> Just arrived today, very sturdy!  Holds all different bottles with no problem.  Would purchase this again when I fill up the one I just hung on the wall!</li>
            <li> I had a shelf that was PACKED with all kinds of nail polish bottles - since they are all different shapes and sizes I never knew what to do with them.. until now.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need to have a nail salon to need this - I have it on my wall near my master bath and it works PERFECT!&lt;br /&gt;Every different brand I have of polish fits PERFECT.</li>
            <li> Good product is pretty and durable I recommend it to any person that wants to organize small bottles or small boxes.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> This is the third one that I bought and I am very glad with the product I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> If you install it correctly, it&#x27;s a good, secure way to store and display all your nail polish.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with my new nail rack! It is a lot nicer than I imagined. The shipping was super fast too. I order Sunday morning and got it Wednesday afternoon. When I received it, it was carefully packaged and in great condition. It has four holes to secure it to the wall so it can hold all your polish safely. I think I managed between 14-19 bottles per row. It all depends on the size of the bottles.</li>
            <li> I love this , I just wish it was cheaper . I was really scared to break it but now it&#x27;s up and strong !</li>
            <li> I originally ordered one rack &amp; was very pleased, so I decided to order another. Unfortunately, when I opened the box, the bottom right corner was broken into pieces. I&#x27;m guessing from the delivery truck... But anyways I sent pictures via email showing the damage &amp; immediately got a reply saying that they were sending a brand new rack! Very pleased with the product &amp; excellent customer service.</li>
            <li> time will tell if this rack holds up, but it looks fairly well constructed and no cracks in the acrylic. I like that it has a lip for each shelf so the polish does not fall off it. I will repurchase another one as I miscounted my inventory. Great price and good quality.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed to organize my nail polishes. I was able to fit 94 bottles. Rack was exactly as pictured and did not have a \\&quot;Polish Station\\&quot; topper like a few reviews have mentioned. I regret not buying two, as I severely underestimated the depth of my nail polish problem.</li>
            <li> I absolutely ADORE this nail polish rack! It came in a fairly short amount of time, and it was completely unscathed when it arrived at my house. Hanging it was super easy too, as it came pre-drilled with holes at the top of the unit and four screws with matching plastic wall anchors to help bear weight. It also came with a &amp;#34;nail polish station&amp;#34; sign which i opted out of using. All I needed to do to hang it was tap a hole into the wall with a bradawl and a hammer, hammer in the anchor, hold the rack in place, then screw the rack to the wall through the pre-drilled holes. I decided to place this rack inside my closet on a bare wall so I can have my polish on display and have it be protected from the light. The quality is excellent and I love being able to actually see all of my polish!</li>
            <li> loved this&amp;#62; i have a lot of nail polish so my whole rack is full of bottles! but it is super handy and comes with a &amp;#34;nail station&amp;#34; sign.  i dont use that but it is still super colorful when you get everything on it (if your that kind of person) hahah&amp;#62; anyway it is really handy and neat!</li>
            <li> This was exactly what my daughter wanted. Her polishes are not only organized and easy to see, they are displayed beautifully and takes very little space. She chose not to hang it on the wall yet. She&#x27;s very proud looking at her collection of polishes and I&#x27;m happy they aren&#x27;t all over her room in disarray!</li>
            <li> I have over a hundred nail polish bottles. It was a mess in boxes. It was so difficult to find the one I wanted. I bought 2 racks and now everything is organized by brand and color. It looks so good. It&#x27;s like a painting on the wall. I absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful! I use it to hold all my Young Living Oils. The measurements are accurate at 24&amp;#34; H x 21&amp;#34; W x 2&amp;#34; depth. This is the most important part!!! Unfortunately, I tried to order it again, but it must have been a different vendor/manufacturer because it says it has the same measurements as this one, but they are not! So, I applaud this seller for providing accurate information! Makes all the difference!</li>
            <li> Great quality product and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Perfect! this is exactly what i was hoping for, its super cute on my vanity wall. sturdy, and easy to hang. at first it seemed excessive but, i got so tired of digging through a box of nail polishes, and leaving them all over the place. This really helps me stay more organized, I even use my last two rows for other nail related products.</li>
            <li> I use these for my hobby game paints and they work out great. They keep my paint off my table so I have more room to work.</li>
            <li> This shelving unit is absolutely wonderful for holding my bottles of Young Living Essential oils.  It holds both sizes (5ml and 15ml) very well and I can put at least 96 bottles on it.  I hung it on the wall in my smaller bathroom and it is easily accessible, but out of the way.  I would encourage anyone who has these oils to get one of these shelving units.  The oils are easy to see because of the clear, acrylic fronts on the shelves.</li>
            <li> Bought this to hold my YL Essential Oils. Works great for my 5ml, 10ml and 15ml bottles. Although the massage oil bottless are too large it fit behind the lip, they sit great on the top shelf. Love that it&#x27;s clear so you can see the labels clearly.</li>
            <li> I love this rack!!!! It holds 96 bottles of lacquer perfectly. I currently have all China Glaze lacquers in the rack and each bottle fits without a struggle. I also tested this rack with other brands I own (Sephora by OPI, OPI, Nicole by OPI, Butter London, Orly, Essie). Out these brands, the only ones that didn&#x27;t fir too good were the Butter London, and Nicole by OPI. But that&#x27;s okay because I don&#x27;t own nearly as many of bottles of Butter London or Nicole by OPI as I do in China Glaze. And the way that the bottles are designed in these two brands I wasn&#x27;t surprised they didn&#x27;t fir properly. But other it just as it was described, shipping was fast, and the screws were provided for me to mount it on my wall. :-D</li>
            <li> Awesome! They are perfect! Everything but OPI fit, you just have to turn them sideways. I bought two of them</li>
            <li> I have ordered this item twice for my brother. Each time as an xmas gift for his wife. She absolutely loves it! She is a nail polish fanatic and this is great for her display all of her pretty colors. The unit has proven to be sturdy and is easy to hang/install. She gets compliments all the time, because the only place you ever see these in is the nail shop. I must admit I want one!</li>
            <li> The item got to my house on time and was exactly what I was looking for... It&#x27;s sturdy and really nice looking.</li>
            <li> Good looking rack and came the very next day that I ordered it!! I also put some wrapping paper in the back so it would look nice and it does, my daughter and I have over 60 bottles of nail polish and plenty more will still fit! We even put nail accessories on the rack and it looks perfect! I would recommend this rack to anyone looking for something for the room or bathroom.</li>
            <li> Looks great in my spa room, easy to hang and sturdy. Fast shipping, and great packaging. Def recommend this product! Love it!</li>
            <li> just what a polish addict needs.  GREAT Product.  Easy to hang, and looks great!  Will come back when I need a third rack</li>
            <li> I received this item in just two business days, and it was shipped the day I ordered it. It came in a secure and well padded box and everything was there and in excellent condition. Hardware for hanging this up was included. It is very sturdy. I hung this in my bathroom and have fingernail polish, lipstick, hair clips, etc. on it. It is a pretty large shelf but doesn&#x27;t look too bulky with the clear acrylic. Overall, I am quite impressed and think this item is priced very fairly.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the wall rack.  I can see all my nail polish at one time without having to sort through a basket of bottles.</li>
            <li> this is great I can finally organize all my nail polish. its wider than expected but it is still great</li>
            <li> this display is well made..it has been in use for one year and no cracks or chips..it was easy to hang on the wall</li>
            <li> I am so excited about this product. I do plan on painting it because it&#x27;s clear, but that is more of a personal preference. The item is extremely sturdy, and although I will add two more holes at the bottom for extra security that is also a personal preference. The rack fits ALL of my polish bottles. Even the odd shaped ones. I have mostly OPI and China Glaze though and it fits both kinds perfectly. This is exactly what I wanted. It was shipped extremely well. There was NO wiggle room and everything was covered with styrofoam padding. No chips, cracks or any other dings that I could see. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing product, arrived very quickly and was in perfect condition. Looks extremely professional on my wall and holds every kind of nail polish</li>
            <li> I LOVE MY WALL DISPLAY IT&#x27;S PERFECT TO DISPLAY ALL OF MY POLISHES AND GELS FOR THE CLIENTS ! !</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m very pleased. This was much higher quality material than I though it would be. The only negative for me is that there are no pre-drilled holes or way to hang it. My only option would be to drill myself or use command strips, which I don&#x27;t trust with 96 bottles of nail polish. But, I just stood it up on a vanity instead of hanging it.</li>
            <li> I love my nail polish rack I need another ! It holds 99 I believe and I am a nail polish junkie so mine is almost full it holds up well on the wall with the right amount of nails to hold it up and it has built in holes for that. It also has a cute little sign from time to time it falls down but I recommend this for any Nail polish junkie! Yes you could make one but by the time you finish doing that it would cost just the same !</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and was exactly as specified. Included hardware for hanging. Totally satisfied. It was the best price for this model that I could find anywhere.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick and the rack was in perfect condition. It holds plenty of polish. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Ordered two and both had the corners broken. Kind of confusing in which one you get when you place your order as there is a couple of different styles.</li>
            <li> I love this thing, it&#x27;s filled up and now I need another one. I love it because I can get a clear view of the shades I have, and the ones I need, without getting doubles or losing them in a drawer or something. A great gift for girls or woman who wears polish!</li>
            <li> I purchased this unit to hold fountain pen ink bottles and all but a few are less than 2 inches in diameter. The description states that the unit is &amp;#34;approximately 2&amp;#34; deep&amp;#34; when in reality, the unit is less than 1.5 inches deep, which raises two questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 - what is your definition of &amp;#34;approximately and&lt;br /&gt;2 - are you using Nepalese inches?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Subsequently, this unit can hold 3 (three) of my 50 ink bottles, which pretty much makes this useless for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, since the packaging is designed to fall apart when unpacking, returning this item is not possible, so good bye $38.</li>
            <li> I purchased this nail polish rack for my daughter and my neice last Christmas, and they absolutely loved them!  Both girly and practical, these are a great way to organize some of the chaos that teenage girls&#x27; rooms hold.  The rack holds all brands and sizes of polish and since it&#x27;s clear acrylic, it fits with any room decor.</li>
            <li> This was EXACTLY what I was looking for and what I needed.  It holds almost all of my nail polishes (some bottles are a little fat, but I squeeze them in to make them work)...I still have a little bit of room to grow my extensive selection.  I didn&#x27;t realize I had SOOOO many nail polishes until I put them all in one location with this wall rack.  I have it displayed in my bathroom and it adds a little glam effect to the area!  I colored coded them according to the color spectrum &amp;#34;ROY G BIV&amp;#34; (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet)....and I put my clear, black, and white at the end.  It looks great that way and the colors flow seamlessly.It came with mounting supplies and was super easy to install!  The &amp;#34;Polish Station&amp;#34; signage that came with the wall rack completes the finished look.  This would make an AWESOME gift!!!</li>
            <li> Gift for a 15yo and it was perfect. she has her own bathroom and is already mounted on the wall</li>
            <li> This product arrived with broken pieces.  There was no padding at all, which totally surprised me since they were shipping something so fragile.  It arrived in a thin box that had been placed inside of the main outer shipping box but there was absolutely no cushioning around this rack.  The outer box was marked &amp;#34;Glass Fragile&amp;#34; but without any type of padding, it was doomed for breakage.  This was a Christmas present for my teen daughter so I was very disappointed.  Rather than go through the hassle of returning it, I&#x27;m going to try to glue the broken pieces back on.  The front rails also needs to be taller than 7/8&#x27;&#x27;.  It looks like her OPI polishes are going to fall over the edge.</li>
            <li> This item was made of plastic, which was nice, but not what was advertised. I&#x27;d rather have the plastic as I feared breakage once it was hung. It did come with a very cute top plate that says &amp;#34;Nail Station&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Item came as described. This was for my 11 year old daughter so it does the job fine for her. I wouldnt consider this salon worthy but it great for &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; people storage. I wish it would have come with screw holes on the lower end. My husband had to drill more holes as we felt it wasnt secure enough. overall...I think it is a good item.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and plastic as expected, but I absolutely love having all my nail polish so organized. Despite it not being classy and good looking, I actually prefer that it&#x27;s clear because it makes it easier to see everything.</li>
            <li> Great quality and is a must have for a nail polish hoarder like myself. Holds a ton of polish and looks sleek. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Perfect in my daughters bather for all her nail polish and other items.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I got one of these! I actually ordered a second one. They are easy to hang, and very sturdy. Mine are full and show no signs of weakness. I used to keep my polish in a caboodle, and I do kind of miss being able to carry the box outside. This looks super cute, though.</li>
            <li> Granddaughter wanted it to organize her nail polish. Made rather cheaply. Would not buy it again. Both of us are disappointed.</li>
            <li> My wife hunged it up on the wall for all her nails and it looks very nice, and would recommend them to anyone that does nails.</li>
            <li> The product itself is pretty and it looks nice and secure. Unfortunately, my shelf arrived broken with the top right corner missing. It wasn&#x27;t inside the box, so I&#x27;m assuming it was broken before it was packaged; and not during the delivery process. That is really unfortunate. I&#x27;m still debating whether to send it back or just deal with it. The return hassle really doesn&#x27;t sound like something I want to go through. I also received no screws/fasteners to hang it up; which is kind of the whole point of a &amp;#34;wall rack&amp;#34;. Overall a little too much of a hassle for a product that arrived broken and missing parts!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter for Christmas and was appalled at the terrible quality of it since I paid practically forty dollars for it. It is tacky, cheap looking, and every corner where the shelves attached together, glue was completely visible. Not even clear glue, SOLID WHITE GLUE! I&#x27;m not sure if I just got a dud rack of the bunch, but I am definitely getting my money back and never buying from this seller again..</li>
            <li> This rack is perfect!!!  It easily holds 95 - 100 bottles of nail polish. Since it&#x27;s clear, the polish is easy to see and the colors are beautifully displayed.</li>
            <li> I love my new nail polish rack!  It organizes my polish and makes it so easy to see all of the colors.  I love seeing my glitter polish and being able to pick out quickly the colors I want.</li>
            <li> Like it ,fits all my nail polish</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this. It fits perfectly as many polishes as it advertises, and it is extremely sturdy. This is the cheapest one that I could find for this size. It was still a little too expensive, but luckily for me it was a graduation gift to myself :)</li>
            <li> Live it --- ordered another one!</li>
            <li> This is nice and solid.  It is a practical way to view my nail polishes!  I&#x27;m so happy with it!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t disappoint me and I can put all my colors there on display. Idk about 96 but good enough.</li>
            <li> we are soon to order another ...my daughter loves nail[polish and&lt;br /&gt;designing her nails.  This is a great holder and nicely displays all.</li>
            <li> I like this rack because it&#x27;s clear, goes with my salon decor, and holds a decent amount of polish.  I use Opi polish and not every row holds an equal amount of bottles, but I don&#x27;t mind.  My shelf came with a small crack in the acrylic, but it wasn&#x27;t worth sending back over~ I just had to be careful when attaching the shelf to the wall.</li>
            <li> I love this nailpolish rack.... it is very easy to hang and holds all of my polishes.  It gives a great visual of what colors I have.</li>
            <li> very good nail polish holder, the service was excellent, the package was carefully wraped and it arrived on time. I would recommend this product to any nail polish junkie.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT, ITS PERFECT FOR NAIL POLISH AND IT LOOKS VERY PROFESSIONAL&lt;br /&gt;FINDING IT IN A STORE WHERE I LIVE IS NOT EASY.&lt;br /&gt;DOESNT COME WITH SCREWS OR ANCHORS I SUGGEST YOU ANCHOR IT JUST IN CASE&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE HAD IT SINCE SEPT 2013 AND NO ISSUES LOTS OF COMPLIMENTS</li>
            <li> I love it and it does hold 96 bottles neatly on my wall so I will be ordering 2 more!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with this shelf. The Nicole by OPI bottles fit if you put them a little bit sideways. Amazing costumer service. When installing, be careful when thighting the screws to attach it to the wall, use just enough force or it will break.</li>
            <li> I ordered two. One came broken at the top which was not the sellers fault.  I immediately contacted Amazon and ordered another one. It is a very nice quality.  Holds my polishes and looks great.  I love it.  Very fast delivery.</li>
            <li> It shipped fast and everything I was hoping for! Very beautiful! !</li>
            <li> For the price, these racks are fantastic. I currently own four and I&#x27;m back to buy #5. (Yup, I have a polish addiction problem.) The only problem with these racks is that they are just a little bit too narrow on the shelves. The description says that they fit all brands. That is true EXCEPT for NOPI. The only way to get NOPI in there is to squeeze it in sideways. Granted, this is a problem with the NOPI bottle shape being too strange (and part of why I don&#x27;t really buy NOPI anymore) but if the shelf was just a little bit deeper, it would be perfect. However, it fits EVERY OTHER BRAND. To me the acrylic doesn&#x27;t bother me because I wanted clear shelving so I could see my colors, so these are perfect, and they are very sturdy. Love them! It does come with the polish station sign, but I threw all of mine away and just use the rack as it&#x27;s pictured.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage (HS) daughter who&#x27;s room needed some organizing.  She filled most levels with polish but also put in other smaller sized items, like perfume.  And it looks great on her wall and has held up over time.  All her friends love it!  I would definitely buy it again!!</li>
            <li> I purchased it to hold oils and it does.  I had to glue it together to make it whole.  I ordered one and it arrived broken, the company sent me another one free of charge and it arrived broken in the same place.  I just glued one together and it works.</li>
            <li> Wow ... this is made really nice. It looks awesome. Now I feel like I really don&#x27;t have that many polishes! Ideal.</li>
            <li> This was the best thing I bought on amazon! I love nail polishes! I have over 100 and I need somewhere to put the them neatly and they all fit!  My wife installed it and it was very easy to mount! Only thing I used my own. Nails because my walls are very funny but it does come with some.</li>
            <li> It was packed for safe travels.  Great job!  The acrylic is very clear and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love this rack! Best way to organize a large nail polish collection! Now I can see everything and I am more apt to use the polish because it&#x27;s on display!</li>
            <li> Love this! Organized all my polishes well and received quickly!</li>
            <li> Came broken but replaced quickly didn&#x27;t make me go through Hassel of returning either. Gave the broken one to my neighbors little girl for her TY dolls.</li>
            <li> I received the box and it was damaged. And I opened it and the rack was even worse. I&#x27;m very upset with this and I am sending it back for a refund.</li>
            <li> I bought three of these to hold my polishes, and hung together on a wall they take up almost the same amount of space as a door.  The shelves are deep enough to hold OPI bottles and will accommodate Rescue Beauty Lounge bottles sideways but Butter London bottles are too wide to be displayed sideways (and you can&#x27;t fit them two bottles deep, either).  If you put your rectangular bottles at an angle (e.g., Butter London) or have typical polish bottles (OPI, Orly, Nubar, Zoya etc.) then the rack will definitely hold 96 bottles.  I like these shelves a lot more than my countertop racks as they display the polishes better and save a lot of space.  If you don&#x27;t mind the look of acrylic, they would probably be great as spice racks or for holding similarly shaped items.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and easy to hang, it holds about 95 polishes, sadly I will have to order another one, LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> I had bought this same product a few months ago, and the one I bought months ago is really nice, but the one that I got in the mail this time was a much cheaper, uglier looking version of the previous one.  I was quite disappointed because I made a point of ordering the exact same one, only to get a worse version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one has a cheap looking glue sticking the parts together, and the glue is not clear so it is very visible.  The glue job is also messy, so there are streaks of glue in random parts of the rack, which, to be honest, makes it look very cheap.  I would not order another one of these.</li>
            <li> fit 106 some where small bottles, very sturdy thus far. We bought it for my teenage daughter she loved it.</li>
            <li> This was perfect to store all my polishes vs. having them in several (shoebox) storage containers.&lt;br /&gt;The grandkids love the &amp;#34;Nail Station&amp;#34;, a sign that comes with the display. They think this is great!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad to have found what I needed!</li>
            <li> Perfect fit on the wall  came so fast and packed. So we&#x27;ll arrived in great condition can not wait for more ads on nail polish and hair products. Headline.  Organization</li>
            <li> this makes my bathroom look way cooler. i get a million compliments on it. and it makes finding what color you want more fun!</li>
            <li> I have waited a long time to finally buy a nail polish rack. I looked around at a lot of different ones and I am so glad this is the one I got. It came very well packaged and protected. Easy to put up and sturdy. A must have for any polish collector. I&#x27;ll be getting a second one soon, as I still have a ton of polish to organize!</li>
            <li> I used to love this shelf!  But I don&#x27;t like it anymore.  I&#x27;ve had this shelf nearly 8 months now, and have discovered stress cracks in several places.  And, I don&#x27;t have near the weight that would be equivalent to 96 bottles of nail polish on it.  :-(  I use it for my doTERRA essential oils.  I&#x27;m afraid the shelf will crack completely and my product will hit the tile floor, so I&#x27;m taking it down.  I guess I should have gone with metal. :-/  I just liked the idea that the shelf itself blended into the surroundings.  (If I could post pictures of the cracks here, I would, but I don&#x27;t see an option.)</li>
            <li> I really liked it but the bottom came alittle detached like it wasn&#x27;t glued right other than that I love the size of it n it&#x27;s so useful</li>
            <li> Installed on a wall behind a door. Fits perfect and slim line enough to where it does not interfere with the door. Great storage/organization unit that you can use in those out of the way spaces. Unit came packaged well, no cracks.</li>
            <li> Works great and easy to install. Holds all of my nail polish with so much room left over, looks like I need to buy more nail polish!</li>
            <li> My daughter has about a million nail polishes.  While this doesn&#x27;t nearly hold all of it, it keeps enough of them off the floor and bathroom vanity to make me a little happy.  It&#x27;s really sturdy, with plastic and glass. This is good in a way because it definitely is strong enough to hold multiple nail polishes, but is also a little disadvantageous because it is extremely heavy to hang.  It also came with some plastic piece that I think must be decorative to hang above the case, but I didn&#x27;t see the point and it seemed like a waste of plastic and extra shipping cost.  All in all, it serves its function and looks nice on the wall.</li>
            <li> I received this last night and I put it up immediately. it works perfectly for my collection and is very sturdy. the package came quickly and well protected. I am very pleased :)</li>
            <li> ....for my nail polish obsession.  Very efficient storage. Sturdy.  Exactly as described and is a much better storage solution than all the bottles in a basket, which I had to dump out frequently.</li>
            <li> Best inexpensive investment ever.  My daughter&#x27;s nail polish is now neatly stored in her room.</li>
            <li> This Nail Polish wall rack display is a wonderful way to organize your polish and so much fun!  Makes a wonderful wall display. Easy to install. If you don&#x27;t find a stud to mount into, use toggle/molly bolts or butterfly bolts for the extra strength and support.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for! Exactly as described in listing the only problem I have is I need another one didn&#x27;t realize I had that much nail polish! So definately be ordering another one!</li>
            <li> Its big and so helpfull</li>
            <li> Exactly as listed.  Looks great on the wall and holds all my nail polish!</li>
            <li> I use this to hold my polish and so far it works great. Thinking about getting a second one!</li>
            <li> My wife and daughter love this.</li>
            <li> I accidentally had this product shipped to an old address and when I tried to get it redirected or held at a Fedex station, I was told by fedex that the sender didn&#x27;t opt in for this service - this service definitely is helpful, especially when the item is large and wouldn&#x27;t be left if not accepted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;that&#x27;s the only thing I didn&#x27;t like about this item.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to have my nail polish all displayed.  It took me a while to give in due to the cost but I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> This is what my daughter wanted.  It holds a lot of bottles, but if they are tall, they can only fit on the top row.  We bought 2 and stacked them vertically, but didn&#x27;t leave enough room between for tall bottles on the lower rack&#x27;s top shelf.  We installed them into the studs; not sure it would support the weight of the nail polishes if we hadn&#x27;t.  Overall she is happy with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very nice rack with lot&#x27;s of room for your polishes it has a nice rack to protect the polishes from falling, however when received it was cracked and had to be glued together, but that was due to the way it was handled through delivery.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, it holds a ton of my nail polish and was shipped very quickly. It was also packaged really nice and secure to avoid damage. At first I was a little overwhelmed with the size but after you put your polish on it and hang it on the wall it doesn&#x27;t look that big anymore, it just looks great. And because it&#x27;s clear it will blend in with any décor. I&#x27;m thinking I may purchase another. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Quality build.  Packaged well for safe delivery.</li>
            <li> Actually what I expected. .. nice</li>
            <li> I fell in loveeee with this nail rack. (: I ordered my rack through prime so I can&#x27;t say it arrived early during normal shipping. But the best about this wall rack is how many bottles I am able to store. My rack fit 98 bottles. The bottle brands were, opi, wet n wild,zoya, NYC, color club, sinful colors, pop, klean color, finger paints, piggy polish, milani, fresh paint, chinaglaze, and Nicole by opi. I did, however,store maybe about 2 or 3 nail polishes on its side to fit them a little better. The only annoying part of this rack was the fact that the Nicole opi polish was barely able to fit in the rack. So if you have a lot of Nicole opi polishes just know you&#x27;ll barely be able to fit them. This rack came with 4 screws, 4 mounts, and a &amp;#34;polish station&amp;#34; sign. You don&#x27;t have to put up the sign they&#x27;re separate pieces. I decided not to. I will most likely order another next time, because I still have about 40 other polishes in need to be stored in a wall rack. The only reason why I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again would be if I would find a better deal on another wall rack, or if I&#x27;d decide to make my own wall rack myself.</li>
            <li> I am SO glad I got this.  Now my nail polishes hang on the inside of my closet out of sight, and are organized by color.  GREAT product.  It arrived quickly and as advertised.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I am sooo pleased with this product! I have about 75 nail polish bottles currently and had been previously storing them all in a hanging organizer. This rack is so much better though and it makes going into my closet feel like opening a secret door to a spa (see my customer photo). It was easy to install too-- I drilled an extra set of holes in the second to last row just to make sure that it was extra safe and then mounted it to the wall with the screws and drywall anchors provided. I&#x27;m thrilled to see my polish collection so professionally displayed and you will be too!</li>
            <li> This product is practical and good to have.&lt;br /&gt;I read some reviews that the glue was shown on it and it was poor quality; well it had some glue on it but it becomes invisible once you add the nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;It can fit a great amount of nail polish but the tall nail polish don&#x27;t fit in it (i had bourjois nail polish and it was taller than this rack)</li>
            <li> This rack was purchased for my girlfriend&#x27;s expanding nail polish collection.&lt;br /&gt;My comparison is to my gf&#x27;s exsisting polish rack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initial looking at the polish rack, it looks cheaper. The acrylic is foggy and not clear.&lt;br /&gt;Overall its a good rack for the price, but beware that is looks cheap.</li>
            <li> Ordered two and they both arrived seemly in one piece on the outside but were broken once I opened the boxes. So disappointing. Great product but subpar packaging ruins it.</li>
            <li> On par with most other reviews, this item is very cheaply made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seams have a lot of adhesive residue and there are smudges, fingerprints, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will do what it is supposed to do, but it is far from a thing of beauty. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side, it is well packed and protected and was received within a few days after ordering.</li>
            <li> I will now own 4 of these.. it roughly holds about 100 bottles depending on size of the bottle of polish. Easy to hang! Perfect way to display my beauties!</li>
            <li> Sad to report it was kind of cheap looking and also took up a lot of space.  Maybe if it was totally full of polishes in a store, it would look better, but I needed something smaller for my bathroom.</li>
            <li> This is just the best thing since sliced bread!!!  I had all my nail polish in storage boxes.  While it kept it neat, it was a pain taking the individual bottles out to see what the colors were.  Now I can see all my polish at a glance  I even put the colors in groups (gelish, regular polish, then nail art) and that makes my life much easier.  Unfortunately, I underestimated the amount of polish I have and need to order another rack, but it will be well worth the investment.  It&#x27;s not the prettiest thing in the world (just plain acrylic), but I mounted it on one of my closet end shelves and it works just fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got my second one and filled it up as well.  This rack is used for my gelish and nail art polish and holds 103 bottles. I included a pic.</li>
            <li> I ordered this nail polish display rack for my 16 year old daughter as a Christmas present. It came much quicker than I expected and she absolutely loved it! We are now trying to find a matching nail poish carasole to go along with it.</li>
            <li> The rack is amazing! Easy to install (i&#x27;ve never touched a drill before and I did it), its study, and holds tons of nail polish! I love it and will be looking into a second one! shipping was good!</li>
            <li> Gave as a Christmas Present and she has already got it full so maybe next year another one for her.</li>
            <li> Just as I expected, shipped quick. Thank u</li>
            <li> I really love this item.  It comes in a huge box, but it is really slim and fits great right behind my bathroom door.  It hangs easily and is housing all my polish with room to expand.  Happy I purchased this and would get another when I run out of room.</li>
            <li> Ordered 11-1-11, shipped the same day and received the next day via FedEx - shipper and receiver both in California.  Can&#x27;t ask for better than that as far as customer service for shipping.  As for the polish rack itself, it is a nice enough rack and completely serviceable.  The glue where the shelves are placed is visible, but that will be hidden by polish bottles so it&#x27;s not a problem for me. Ordered one to see how it works out and will order an additional for overflow, if needed.  UPDATE:  Hung the rack up today - easy as pie, only two wall screws (not included, we used heavy duty wall anchors).  I left off the \\&quot;Polish Station\\&quot; sign that was included.  I was able to fit 92 bottles of polish, OPI, Sephora for OPI, China Glaze, Orly and Zoya. I have a small box of odd bottles so I won&#x27;t get a second one - that will just lead to empty shelves begging to be filled ;  At least now I can SEE my collection!!</li>
            <li> I am a total polish junkie so I had to get two of these. They aren&#x27;t the most well made but they&#x27;re sturdy enough. They fit pretty much every brand of polish except Nicole by OPI (which almost fits). Depending on what brands you fill it with it can fit significantly more than 96 bottles on each! Brands like OPI would fit about that many, Butter London would fill it up with less, however I have a mix of mini bottles and brands with smaller bottles (like Julep) or bottles that fit sideways (like Love &amp; Beauty). So on one rack I can fit over 100 bottles. I&#x27;ve had these for several years now and I love them to death. I have no idea how I would live without them.</li>
            <li> I have yet to hang it can&#x27;t find my drill but I have taken it out of the box and have it laying up against the wall and  the polished look great can&#x27;t wait to get them up off the floor LOL</li>
            <li> I bought this rack for my 11 year old daughter for Christmas.  She got to organize it with her polishes and it looks great in her room!&lt;br /&gt;Her friends are going to freak when they come over!</li>
            <li> This nail rack is beautiful. It arrived in flawless condition and has made my life just that much more organized. Now I don&#x27;t have to rummage through my old box I used to store all of my nail polishes in. I would definitely recommend this to any nail polish lover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this nail polish rack! I have so much nail polish and now it is nice and organized! Thank you!</li>
            <li> There are 2 nail techs in my salon and we each brought many polishes in when starting.  This rack will be perfect for our gel polishes and matching lacquer.  Received product sooner than I anticipated, which is a great thing as we are spilling over :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you and we are looking forward to having all of our gel / lacquer in one place for the customer</li>
            <li> I got this order earlier than expected, no damage to the box or anything, Opened it and was in perfect condition! It came with the Polish Station sign but its optional so i didn&#x27;t have to use it since I was only hanging it in my bathroom. I&#x27;d recommend this, Hell if i need another for all my nail polishes i&#x27;ll pry even buy another (:</li>
            <li> Love this rack, holds a variety of shape and size bottles and comes with the hardware! 6 rows fits 105 of my pieces of nail polish and nail art bottles . Great organization, bottles remain upright , wall mounted.</li>
            <li> I received this rack very quickly and it met my expectations. Very nice quality polish rack for the price!</li>
            <li> ***I wrote a review for this item that was meant for another product.***&lt;br /&gt; This product did come before the date expected. This rack isn&#x27;t as clean as it looks in the picture. There are some glue marks and tiny bubbles in some areas. I haven&#x27;t put it on the wall yet so I am unsure of how sturdy the rack will be.</li>
            <li> My husband installed one above the other, behind our home office door where the lighting is good (floor torchere lamp nearby). I elected to install one &amp;#34;Polish Station&amp;#34; sign just at the top (bought 2, so I have 2), but it&#x27;s not necessary. So nice to see all my polish selection displayed in a glance and I have some room to grow. Can put some taller items on the top shelf. Very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest dilemma was trying to decide whether to order my polish by brand or by color. I ended up unable to resist doing it by brand, with the exception of keeping my base coats, base/top coat combos, and top coats together since they are all mostly clear. I store those each on a different shelf at the far left so I don&#x27;t have to read the bottles to remember which type is which.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use my wall rack in tandem with a used jewelry floor cabinet we purchased (center lift top, center multiple drawers and side wings that open that my husband build shelves into for me), for all my other fingernail art obsession items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Just noted the last 2 paragraphs for anyone looking for ideas, as they don&#x27;t relate to the actual review of the product.)</li>
            <li> This was perfect for all my nail polish....makes my &amp;#34;girl room&amp;#34; look professional &amp; organized. Fits all my polish easily &amp; makes things very easy to find now.</li>
            <li> i was shocked by how fast this arrived. i literaly got it within a day or two or ordering it. it was packaged perfectly. its crazy simple to hang. it comes with everything you may nee. even a nail polish station sign love the acrylic it arrived in perfect condition  i would repurchase from this vendor in a heartbeat</li>
            <li> This product is great! It came a day before the expected shipping date and was packaged wonderfully! There were no visible scratches or cracks in the actual polish rack itself when I removed it from the packaging. It fits my Essie, OPI, and China Glaze great. It does fit Nicole by OPI, but&#x27;s it&#x27;s a tight fit. Overall, it was a great purchase and I would recommend this to anyone looking for a quality, inexpensive nail polish rack.</li>
            <li> My Polish Wall Rack Display looks great!  It was so easy to put up and my polish looks great.  Now I am able to choose my polish at a glance and can easily know what I own.  This display is of high quality material.  I will definately recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> I recived my order today for my daughter. she was very excited to get this rack finally. we opened the box and the rack broken. The rack had to be broken when it was put in the box. It had alot of packaging in there to hold the rack. so it had no movement&lt;br /&gt;The box has alot of labels on it fragile and glass..&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t order from this company again. Especially because they charged $14.00 for shipping..</li>
            <li> this nail polish rack was exactly what i needed to hold all of my nail polishes at my own home.  it hangs perfectly on the wall and is fun and functional!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shelf!! it arrived within a week of ordering, which was amazing. it was packaged really carefully; the seller surrounded it in Styrofoam and foam peanuts. when i pulled it out of the box it was in perfect condition (originally i had been worried it would have been scratched up in the process) and the supplies provided to hang it up with worked perfectly! i couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied!</li>
            <li> I really like this nail polish rack. It&#x27;s more sturdy than I was expecting it to be, especially now that it is hung with my polishes on it. I have a mix of polish brands on there, most of them being Zoya. I can fit 16 Zoya bottles per row, which is 96 bottles of polish. For my fatter/squarer/odd shaped polishes (like Funky Fingers, Butter London, and Sally Hansen insta-dry) I&#x27;ve set them at a 45 degree so I can get more on there. For the smaller bottle brands (like The New Black) I can double row them. Orly&#x27;s, Lippman&#x27;s, Essie&#x27;s, OPI, China Glaze, Loreal, Revlon and Salon Express fit on there just fine. So this rack is pretty versatile if you get a little creative with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came with a cheesy looking topper/crown type thing that says &#x27;polish station&#x27;. I didn&#x27;t put it up, but I&#x27;m gonna have my husband paint me a cool image on it (recycling and all) to hang over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was 1 small issue. The top row was off about an eighth of an inch. I really did not notice it until I got it up on the wall. BUT with my polishes ON it, it&#x27;s not that noticeable. I&#x27;m not a Type-A kinda person, so it&#x27;s not that big a big deal to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very happy with my nail polish rack. It&#x27;s nice to look up from my desk and see all my beautiful polishes on display. I would not hesitate to buy another one (which I will need to do shortly). The transaction was smooth, shipping was super-fast and the product was shiny, clean and crack free.</li>
            <li> I received it very quickly, and I was able to fit 102 polish bottles!!! OPI, Orly, Color club, China Glaze, Essie, OPI Nicole, and Zoyas!!! LOVE IT!!! Will be buying more very soon!!!!!</li>
            <li> first one came damaged but not due to seller in fact they were happy to replace it and now its hanging beautifully on my wall I will be purchasing another in the near future</li>
            <li> arrived in great condition and holds different shapes of polish bottles. easy to put on my wall and now I can choose among all the different colors at a glance. no problems with this item or seller. thank you</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with my purchase! I bought two of these racks and mounted them side-by-side on a bedroom wall, simple to mount and come with the hardware needed. They are very sturdy and hold an ample supply of polishes. I just love being able to see my entire collection. Since I am not a professional, I chose not to use the toppers that came with the racks.They are awesome and I&#x27;d recommend them to everyone.</li>
            <li> Not worth it for the money,  the plastic quality is very low!</li>
            <li> I ordered this not realizing how large it would be.  It was too big for the space I wanted to put it in, so I returned it.  The seller gave me a refund promptly, after a restocking fee.  I ordered a smaller one that fit the space better.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I am planning on buying another rack soon. It&#x27;s sturdy, drills easily into your wall, and really holds your polishes. Now I don&#x27;t have to sit with my box of nail polishes digging frantically to find the colors I need. My husband hated that &amp;#34;clink..clink..clink...crash...clink&amp;#34; sound he&#x27;d hear while I did that. In fact he was so happy I ordered this he immediately put it up and organized my polishes for me. Apparently the clinking REALLY bothered him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is perfect. So much better than the other racks going for close to $100 and some over $200 because it has some metal scrollwork? Really? Get this one you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have purchased two 60 count holders before and they were great quality.  I was eagerly awaiting the arrival of my 96 cnt. holder.  When it arrived and opened was disappointed to find it poorly put together.  You can see the gule everywhere on the seams and one row is not straight.  60 counts are hard to find at a good price sell fast that&#x27;s why i got the 96.  Next time I will wait.</li>
            <li> Excellent product - this is the second one I&#x27;ve bought! Perfect for storing (too many) bottles of nail polish.</li>
            <li> My nail Polish rack has been moved from 2 homes &amp; still holds up very well &amp; is full from top to bottom. I was going to purchase another one but this helps me to keep my hoarding in check!  So when I purchase a new color an old &amp; unused one must go!</li>
            <li> I really like this rack... It fits most of my bottles, with the only exception being Nicole by OPI.  It displays nicely on my wall next to my vanity and it is much better than keeping my polish in a box.  Now I can really see all my colors.  Once this one is full I plan on buying another one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 6/20/12 I purchased my second one and now have plenty of room for my polishes.  I am still in love with this rack!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 9/17/12 I just purchased my third rack.  I am beginning to think I have a nail polish addiction problem!</li>
            <li> I love these! I have 2 so far! They are amazing! I just wish they had a way to screw the bottom in! Not just the top!</li>
            <li> My wife had so many nail polish bottles that were in different make up bags, she could never find the one she was looking for without taking nearly all of them out to sort them.  Well now they are all out and available for easy selection (she has them sorted by color in the rack).  She was looking to buy those over the door hanging bags, but they didn&#x27;t hold some of her taller long stemmed bottles properly.  This addresses the tall bottles and  takes up very little overall space (hung up on bathroom wall).  Of course now my daughter wants one, too.</li>
            <li> Great piece... sturdy, fits flush against the wall and looks good... i dont understand the negative reviews. I wish i ordered two.</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish rack!  It fits all my bottles of polish as well as a few tools! Great buy</li>
            <li> Love this. Holds a lot, easy to install, and seems to be pretty durable so far. Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Thought it was a little bigger but I can spray paint it any Color and looks great. Got it fast too</li>
            <li> This is the third display rack I&#x27;ve purchased for home, not to replace but to add to a collection.  It&#x27;s strong, easy to attach to a wall, and the shelves are wide enough to accommodate large bottles like Deborah Lippmann.  It arrived well-packed and on time.</li>
            <li> This wall display looks great and installed easily allowing my wife to have her nail polish sorted and hanging off the wall in under an hour.</li>
            <li> I ordered this nail polish rack for my daughter for Christmas. I can&#x27;t wait until she opens it and puts all her nail polishes in order.  I received the rack in a timely manner... exactly the time I expected, within a few days.  Very pleased with the packaging.  I have not opened the box to see the rack so I can&#x27;t comment on the rack itself.  I will submit an update after Christmas. I think it will look great!</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I needed. Works great. Although if you have Nicole by OPI brand nail polish, those irregular shaped bottles don&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> its what i want but i&#x27;ll never deal with this company again.i needed to return for a new 1 cause when my grandaughter opened on christmas morning it was damaged .they refused to send a new 1.well merry christmas to them.i&#x27;ll get a new 1 somewhere else.i have 4 granddaughter and lots of friends who kids are into the nails n hair thing i&#x27;ll let them know THAT THIS COMPANY IS NOT 1 TO DO BUSISNESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend measuring your space, as this rack is enormous. Depending on where you plan to put it, you may not want something with so large a footprint. I personally found the acrylic to be unattractive and cheap-looking and am considering repurposing it for another use and getting a nicer-looking spice rack to use in its stead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware: if you buy this from a third-party seller, return shipping (that you will be expected to pay if you are dissatisfied) will run you in excess of $25 at UPS. The third-party seller I purchased from -- Beauticom -- also imposes a 15% restocking fee, making returning the item cost as much or more than the original purchase price. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I cant say enough about this rack.  I have ordered 5 in total.  It is the perfect size and holds many bottles of polish.  I have them throughout my nail boutique.  Do not hesitate when ordering this rack!!!!</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product. I have about 120 polishes and they all fit. Now i just need another rack! Haha&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> but disappointed while opening the package it broke to the top its very fragile flimsy must be very careful with it or you wont have no rack to begin with</li>
            <li> This is wonderful, I love that I can see all my different polishes at once!!</li>
            <li> Flimsy. It was broken and unusable when I took it out of the box. I was expecting a sturdy, acrylic rack like in the nail salons, but I could hear the plastic flexing as I unwrapped it. Sadly, it will be returned tomorrow. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I just received my second nail rack and I still think it is AMAZING! It does the job and looks neat. It looks like I&#x27;ll be needing my third one soon.</li>
            <li> I love this wall rack!  I bought two and installed them right on top of each other.  Pretty much any brand of polish you can think of, I have it.  They all fit.  The only bottle that doesn&#x27;t fit facing straight forward are the Nicole by OPI bottles.  But if you turn them slightly to the side they fit just fine.  It came shipped great and they were incredibly easy to install (I did get help from my husband, it would be a 2 person job to ensure they are straight, etc.)  I would recommend this rack for anyone with a large polish collection who wants to be able to see all of their beautiful colors better!  I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have waited so long to buy!</li>
            <li> Warning...  this is so big that you will have to buy more polishes,lol.  I put this wall rack up in 5 minutes and had all of my polishes on it in 10.  Even my husband said,&amp;#34;Oh no you will have to buy more to fill it up!&amp;#34;  It is very sturdy and well put together.  No I can see all of my polishes(or lack there of).  Would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> Excellent value product!  It was lightweight and easy to hang. Great for home use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few years now that I&#x27;ve ordered this nail polish rack and it has been everything I expected and more! Would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> UPDATE: I ended up getting a refund on this item and bought a much nicer wrought iron nail polish rack. I am VERY happy with the other product as it is more decorative and still functional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This nail polish wall rack looks great and has tons of room for my bottles of polish. I took one star off because, unfortunately, upon opening the box and unwrapping the rack, I found that the top corner was broken off. The padding inside the box is minimal...barely 1/4&amp;#34; thick styrofoam pellet sheets on the front &amp; back sides of the rack. I will be requesting a replacement of this item due to the damage.</li>
            <li> Love the product so much I bought a second one. Very good price and does in fact hold up to over 90 polishes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing!  I just order on 4th April and I received it today!!! It&#x27;s so beautiful!  I can&#x27;t wait to put all my nail polish on it! I am so excited!  It&#x27;s a thick acrylic one,  good product!  I love it and recommended!</li>
            <li> The stand is sturdy and looks professional. I used it to stack away the nail polishes I had in my home.</li>
            <li> This did not meet my expectations, but I guess you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;Very thin plastic cracks if you tighten the screws too tight.</li>
            <li> holds plenty of bottles and has been on my wall for months without breaking or falling. make sure you use all tools sent to put it up. you won&#x27;t regret this purchase!</li>
            <li> Hold so much.  Recommended it to friends and family.  Love that is clear and you can see the colors of the polishes clearly.</li>
            <li> I have this rack and it is really nice looking. So nice that it is on a wall in my bedroom near my makeup dresser.</li>
            <li> just exactly what I wanted! strong material but I&#x27;d not play around with it lol I don&#x27;t have anything else to say... lol</li>
            <li> I mistakenly purchased this rack instead of another like the ones I recently purchased from IDoNails.  Those racks are a superior quality and of sturdier build.  This rack is the same size, holds the same amount of polish, and gets the job done, but I would have preferred one like the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit arrived safely without defects and is very light-weight.  It is getting plenty of use storing my nail art decorations and tools.</li>
            <li> I just got this polish rack and I must say I&#x27;m actually surprised this stuff is really nice&lt;br /&gt;works well hung up on the wall&lt;br /&gt;and it&#x27;s actually really strong and sturdy , it&#x27;s a very strong plastic looks like glass almost its really strong and I think it holds more than 96 bottles cuz I was able to fit 120 and I was surprised because some of the bottles are pretty big fat different shapes and I guess its kinda deep so you&#x27;re able to fit big ones too&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m really in love with this , I think I&#x27;m going to buy 2 more it was well worth buying....I definitely recommend</li>
            <li> This is the second rack I&#x27;ve purchased, so that should tell you something right there. I had no problems with the shipping. It was packaged nicely.</li>
            <li> I just love having all my polishes lined up according to shades and easily accessible for when I need to find that perfect shade.  This was a very smart purchase.</li>
            <li> This was a birthday gift for my daughter who is 23 and does her own nails.  She filled the rack right away and is very happy with this solution to her polish collection.  We may need one more!</li>
            <li> The package was delivered promptly and well packed - no breaks or cracks. My husband had it up in minutes while I was unpacking my 100-pc All About Nail Package. Order these two items together so that you have somewhere to store all those new polishes. Highly recommend. Does have a plastic Polish Station sign with red lettering - some say it&#x27;s cheesy, but I like it.</li>
            <li> really amazing makes my polish look really nice and organized. Loved that the screws came with it! great product especially for someone who loves to buy nail polish</li>
            <li> Perfect for holding my favorite polishes.</li>
            <li> It holds all my nail polishes very well, and looks great.  The only complaint I have is that my Nicole by OPI nail polishes have to set sideways.  I haven&#x27;t hung it up yet so I cant really say how strong it is to hold almost 100 bottles, but I&#x27;ve had mine for about 3 months, been in a moving van (with bottles in it), and it does it&#x27;s job.  It will look really nice when I find a place to hang it some day.</li>
            <li> I love it !! I need another one !!</li>
            <li> My polishes never looked so good on display!  Easy for me (a woman) to mount on a wall by myself without any help.  Now it&#x27;s a constant reminder to put these gorgeous colors to use!</li>
            <li> I got this as a Christmas gift. So far I&#x27;ve only taken it out of the already opened box, the bottom shelf was off, the glue didnt hold. It is not what I expected at all, it looks cheap you can see the glue.  The fact that it was already broken right out of the box does not give me any hope that it would hold 96 bottles securely. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love it! It holds all my nail polishes and i still have room.</li>
            <li> All my nail polishes fit in this rack. It looks great too! I easily took off the top part that said Polish Station.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my granddaughter and she was thrilled.. Has it hanging up in her bedroom and it is almost filled. It was exactly what she wanted !!  Delivered promptly. Thank You for your great service !!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for a friend and she absolutely loves it!  The plastic is nice and clear with no scratches.</li>
            <li> excellent size,I like</li>
            <li> These are my favorite!! I have a ton of polish and this fits perfectly on my wall!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome display.  It&#x27;s just what I was looking for at a reasonable price.  I have no complaints about this product.</li>
            <li> I Ioved it, I like everything about it it&#x27;s easy to set up and if you have a variety on nail polishes I totally recommend this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for close to a year now. It holds up nicely. I&#x27;ve had it hanging on the wall and now it&#x27;s sitting on a ledge in my bathroom. I&#x27;ll need another one soon.</li>
            <li> I really like this display.  I don&#x27;t think that there is a polish bottle out there that this display won&#x27;t hold.  I love that all of my polishes are neatly organized and out of the way.  My only complaint is that there are only two holes to secure the unit the the wall, and I was afraid that once I put 90+ bottles on it, it wouldn&#x27;t be strong enough to hold.  My solution was to attach some shelving brackets underneath to help and so far, it has held up great!  I will be buying another one of these soon so I can continue to add to my collection!</li>
            <li> I ordered this 11/18 and received it 11/22 in perfect condition, it was packaged PERFECTLY, I was extremely concerned about it breaking during shipping but packaging was definitely executed very well; It also has a big &amp;#34;Nail Polish Station&amp;#34; sign included, that I was NOT expecting &amp; I LOVE IT...My 17yr old is a recent cancer SURVIVOR  &amp; THIS was 1 of the items on her Christmas list. THANK YOU to EVERYONE who had a hand in this :-)  This is my 8th purchase, I&#x27;m an Amazon shopper for LIFE!! ****HAPPY HOLIDAYS****</li>
            <li> Beautiful and well made. I like that I can see all the colors through the clear plastic. It is quality made.</li>
            <li> Christmas present for my 16 year old daughter. She loves it.  She thought she had 96 to fill it, but was about 20 short.  Not for long. She sorted by color and noticed she was missing some colors in the spectrum so filled it the next day.  We just ordered another one for shades and tints of black and white, silver and gold only.  Oh  joy!</li>
            <li> Shelf was exactly as described works perfect for what I purchased it for!!  I&#x27;m using shelf to store my Do Terra oil collection!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it! I am so happy I finally bought this nail polish rack it has made all my dreams come true&amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> It was easy to put up and we used the &amp;#34;Polish Station&amp;#34; sign that came with it.  It looks so cool with all her nail polish in it, it is holding 101 bottles right now and we are going to order another one soon, to hold the rest of her collection.  Would recommend this for a space saver especially.</li>
            <li> Received my organizer before than expected, was shipped through fedex wich I loved, and it comes really well packaged in its own box with dry ice, I love how they printed on the box Fragile Glass handle with care, even dough is not cause is made of acrylic but still is fragile it comes with a set of four screws and a sign that reads: Nail polish display (better for businesses) wich I did not use cause this is only for my personal use, it comes already assambled all you have to do is attach it to the wall with two screws I placed mine in my walking closet wall and is honestly the best way to organize your nail polish cause you for sure find what you looking for easier-faster, and I know what colors I already own (not duplicates), it can fit several brands of nail polish since bottles are different shapes (CND, OPI, Confetti, Essie, China Glaze, Sally Hansen, Zoya, etc.) I even placed my art nail colors in it, most of them fit but the stripe rite ones since they have such a long cap, totally recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disillusioned with delivery since I paid for 2 day shipping on December 21st but did not receive the item until January 2nd. This was further frustrating since the range of dates for delivery given was December 26th through December 28th. Thus, I sent it home with my brother as it was a Christmas gift from me to his wife, Katie, and our Christmas gathering held on December 29th was over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To further aggravate me, Katie noticed a crack in the display plastic, even though the box was fully intact. I assumed that Beauticom would send me a return label for the damaged one and would ship a nice one back; however, they wanted a photo first. That would be fine if it were for me, but Katie, a mother of three little ones, who is not technologically inclined told me she would just keep it. She did not wish to go through that hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How disappointing!</li>
            <li> Product was nice and as pictured. The display has two holes at the top to hang it by, which doesn&#x27;t really seem sufficient to hold the weight of 96 or so bottles of polish. I&#x27;ll be getting some better hardware other than the cheap stuff that was included to hang it with. My only disappointment with this item is that the acrylic has alot of tiny scratches, and there are visible glue marks everywhere. For something that&#x27;s meant as a display item, it&#x27;s a little frustrating that it really doesn&#x27;t even look new and every single shelf has large glue streaks and splatters. If this were a $15 or so shelf, it wouldn&#x27;t be as much of an issue. But for $33 plus $5.50 shipping - close to $40 spent on an acrylic shelf, you expect it to look well made. I&#x27;m hoping that once it&#x27;s filled up with polish bottles, the imperfections won&#x27;t be as noticeable and it will still look nice. I love the overall design of the rack, but next time I might try another brand or seller. It also came with a &amp;#34;polish station&amp;#34; sign, which I opted not to use.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this nail polish rack:&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It does fit a lot of nail polishes  Cons: Do not fit 96bottle if you have OPI bottles&lt;br /&gt;  Easy to install&lt;br /&gt;  Already assembled&lt;br /&gt;  Not too thick so it can fit almost&lt;br /&gt;  anywhere</li>
            <li> The product was broken on arrival. I bought this for my teen daughter&#x27;s room for her gazillions nail polishes and upon opening the box (poor packaging) the corner was broken and the side was falling apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although, it looks great, there is not way that this would survive long. The material is cheap and I could tell that can easily break, even the shelf looks like they could break anytime with weight...so to avoid a huge mess of broken nail polish on my wood floors, I&#x27;m returning it. :-(</li>
            <li> decent display. bought it for my gf and she will probably need another with her collection.  this thing is a bit sturdier than I thought.</li>
            <li> I thought my collection was not that large but it filled this rack up. I even had to give some away. I didn&#x27;t like having then in a drawer before. I might one day purchase another if I decide to expand my collection. It fits China Glaze, Sally Hansen (Have not tried insta-dry), OPI, NYC, Revlon, and well those are most of what I have. I mostly have China Glaze and have no issues with it.</li>
            <li> This shelf is easy to wall mount. It gives a nice visual of all your nail colors. I like to organize mine by color and brand. I even have a 2nd one - mounted right above the first one and it looks like one big unit. I will probably end up buying a 3rd one!</li>
            <li> great buy, bought it as a gift for my 15 year old niece and see loved it... i&#x27;ll be buying another one for myself. !!!</li>
            <li> Received rack 6 days after placing order.  This was the 2nd one I ordered and it was not the exact same one, although it came in with the same model number. They look identical, although the first one seems to be of a little better quality. This one came with the &amp;#34;Polish Station&amp;#34; top piece and has a lot more visible glue around the shelves.  Once it is filled with polish the glue is not really noticable.  All in all I am still happy with it.</li>
            <li> So great I might have to get another one!! The rack displays my nail polishes so beautifully I might have to get another one!!</li>
            <li> My nail polish collection had outgrown the tackle-box it was stored in, and I had starting duplicating colors purchased (because I could not easily see what I already had).  This solved both problems.  Mounted it to the back of my linen closet door (fit perfectly).  For the two mounting/screw holes (only two, as others have stated) I used a special &amp;#34;hollow door anchor&amp;#34; and silicone washers (to protect against over tightening screws thus cracking acrylic) and used a ~stretch-to-remove~ adhesive to secure bottom corners.&lt;br /&gt;Took one point off because, as, others have stated, I too had one shelf that was not fully glued.  But it is strong enough to hold polish bottle weight.</li>
            <li> It is a great place to store nailpolish. Fits nicely on any wall. Not tacky but attractive. Looks like a salon item.  Could use for other things.</li>
            <li> This rack looks like the ones in the professional nail salon. I love it! Wish I could have room for more.</li>
            <li> Came broken into several different pieces. The box was very thin and had huge holes all over it. Also wasnt very well protected inside of the box. Very very disappointed. :(</li>
            <li> This item took about 5 days to arrive, but it was well boxed (in two boxes) and I had no problems with it arriving damaged in any way.  It arrived all in one piece and came with screws and anchors.  It was REALLY EASY to install in my wall and it is great for me so that now I can see all of my pretty nail polishes!!!! It does hold OPI nail polish just fine and does hold about 96 bottles ( I haven&#x27;t counted but that sounds right.)  I am very  happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> This product was exactly as described and will work out great for what I need if for. Would recommend this.</li>
            <li> I wish the acrylic had been a ilttle thicker, or better quality (rounded edges maybe?). It didn&#x27;t come with screws and my husband had to drill one of the holes because it was too small. I was worried it would crack, but it didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does the job fine though and is holding up very well. I placed it on the inside of the bathroom closet door, which is used all the time.</li>
            <li> I have been on a reorganization kick as of the beginning of the New Year. My craft room and nail polish collection were the main focus of this revamp, and I couldn&#x27;t have done it without this awesome nail polish rack. I ended up putting it in my craft room and setting up a nail station, and it looks amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit disappointed that the pre-drilled holes were 16.5&amp;#34; apart instead of the regular 16&amp;#34; of wall studs. However, the wall I put it on had wonky stud spacing anyway, so we pre-drilled 2 holes in the center of the rack, and it&#x27;s holding up just fine. There aren&#x27;t any issues with cracking or pulling, and it&#x27;s holding my polishes just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of my polishes with stranger shaped bottles don&#x27;t fit (ie my Nicole by OPI), but most of my bottles, including Gelish, fit just fine. I&#x27;ve currently got about 102 bottles total, many are smaller Julep brand, but I still plan on buying another rack to hold the rest of my stash!</li>
            <li> I was running out of space in one of my vanity drawers and wanted a place to display all my nail polish. We hung up the rack on the wall in my walk in closet and it has held up well.</li>
            <li> I have previously ordered this polish rack and loved it! great condition easy to hang up! I didn&#x27;t realize how much polish i actually had so i ordered another. When i recieved it, it was scratched and there was glue all over it, carelessly put together. I&#x27;m very disappointed in the second rack I purchased. and am now looking for an identical one from a different company. It was a good rack but i guess its hit and miss on what you&#x27;re realy going to get.</li>
            <li> so nice to keep track of my colors so that I don&#x27;t end up with too much in the same shade.</li>
            <li> This product worked out great.  It holds so many bottles, is sturdy, and is very basic looking, so it doesn&#x27;t draw too much attention to the actual rack.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it is not deep enough to hold my rectangular shaped nail polish remover on the top (however, that&#x27;s not a big enough issue to knock it down a star for me).</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter to keep her nail polish organized (ahem...off the floor!). The rack looks small when you pull it out of the well-packed box, but it really holds the 96 bottles of polish it claims! It takes up a small space on the wall. It is well made and looks nice.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, purchased for my daughters nail polish collection she simply loved it. The rack  holds all of  her name brand polishes and some unknowns.</li>
            <li> Saw a picture of this on Pinterest they said they got it on amazon.  This is exactly what I wanted and it came in a couple of day.</li>
            <li> We hung this in our master bath where I do all make up and hair at and guests cant see. I LOVE having all pinks on one shelf, all reds on another! Great way to keep them all organized</li>
            <li> Nice unit.  Went up without a problem.  Claims to hold 96 bottles but in my opinion that would only be if you merely buy drugstore brands only.  I have all sorts of brands and some take up more room than others.  I did end up needing to turn all my Wet N Wild sideways to be able to accommodate brands like Orly or OPI.  Mine is completely full now at 86 bottles so if I buy anymore I will need to buy another shelf!  LOL</li>
            <li> This item is just amazing is big and I&#x27;m able to put all my nail polish in there....I love it!</li>
            <li> Arrived intact. Fairly easy to hang. Also, mine did vome with the &amp;#34;polish station &amp;#34; sign, which although cute i really have no use for.</li>
            <li> Great nail polish rack recommend 100%</li>
            <li> Very disappointed! Amazon box was not damaged, but item inside was cracked and broken pieces. Item was not well padded, it was sliding around inside bigger box. Tried to superglue, but shouldn&#x27;t have to.</li>
            <li> My nail polish collection is on the verge of obsessive. I decided to purchase this rack so that I might bring order to the chaos. This rack is amazing! It hold approximately 95 bottles of polish (I only use OPI and Essie; both brands fit comfortably on the rack). My outrageous collection of polish now looks like a piece of art on my wall. I might have to buy a second one because my collection keeps growing.</li>
            <li> exactly what my 13 year old daughter wanted! Easy to put on the wall!</li>
            <li> Very nice too bad it&#x27;s too big for my bathroom</li>
            <li> Good product. Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> works perfect and holds a ton of polishes!</li>
            <li> It came broken, in three pieces despite the sellers attempts to ship it safely.  It was surrounded by styrofoam to keep it safe, but the bottom shelf was in pieces.  I used some plastic adhesive and it works just fine.  You can see the crack and the glue, but it works.  It&#x27;s made very cheaply, but will get the job done.  Not the most attractive piece if you have to glue it all back together, though.</li>
            <li> Beautiful display for my nail polishes. Now that my collection is growing, i might need to buy another lol</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE IT!! I am finally able to organize all of my nail polish &amp; now it&#x27;s time to order another one!! Great space saver!!!</li>
            <li> I love the Nail polish rack. I could not find my polishes before in a bin and ended up buying multiples of the same color. Now I can see them all.</li>
            <li> Item was delievered when expected and was exactly what I needed! I will be glad to hang it to hold all of my items!</li>
            <li> ITS PERFECT !!! !!! !!!!!! !!!!!! !!!!!! !!!!! !!!! ah i&#x27;m in love with the rack and nail polish so helpful</li>
            <li> This is my second polish wall rack.  I really love how it looks on the wall and how the polishes fit.</li>
            <li> Product ordered was in multiples, none were exactly the same... First rack In mint condition, however scratches from abrasives n blemishes in the acrylic in the next two.</li>
            <li> I mounted this is my bathroom because I&#x27;m obssessed with nails. It comes with a cheasy top piece that says nail polish center but I just threw that away. Works great and it&#x27;t filling up fast.</li>
            <li> Christmas present for 12 year old granddaughter who has many, many bottles of nail polish and really begged for two of these. She got only one from me as I had already reached her limit and promised another for her birthday if she still felt the need. She loves it.</li>
            <li> Holds so many bottles of nail polish.  Very nice.</li>
            <li> Works great for my doTerra oil bottles</li>
            <li> Every thing I needed and affordable!</li>
            <li> Love it so much I have two! One was a gift and since I needed more space I bought another.</li>
            <li> Love it. I have all my essential oils organized - it&#x27;s attached to the inside of my bathroom cupboard door :)</li>
            <li> It got on time, &amp; in great condition. Just what I expected</li>
            <li> Great gift for a girl.</li>
            <li> It is so perfect!!!! It looks exactly like the picture. It holds so many nail polishes. The only brand I had trouble placing was Nicole by OPI, but I managed to squeeze them all in without it looking tacky. Depending on the kinds of nail polishes you have will effect the amount that the rack can hold. It&#x27;s simple: the way the nail polishes are shaped whether large or small in size will effect how many the rack is able to hold. Everyone complaining about it not holding exactly 96 polishes is missing the point. It&#x27;s perfect in my opinion and a bonus is that the seller ships really fast! This is the second rack I have purchased from this seller and am one hundred percent satisfied. Love love love love love it! It&#x27;s a must have for any nail polish junkie like myself. Another plus is: it&#x27;s the best price on Amazon. Cannot go wrong, people. If you&#x27;re looking for a nail polish rack THIS is the one. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Wife loves how she can now see all her polishes and I don&#x27;t have to watch her for hours digging and looking for the particular color she wants on any given day. lol</li>
            <li> Sadly, I need one more.  great product.</li>
            <li> Very durable and fit over 96 bottles of polish. Highly recommended and I&#x27;ll soon be purchasing another.</li>
            <li> Product just as described.  Looks terrific on the wall.</li>
            <li> Perfect solution for the semi-large volume of nail polish bottles laying around the house with no real place to put them... It&#x27;s light-weight, but not flimsy construction, and mounts very easily; I used hercules hooks for the extra weight of the bottles of polish.&lt;br /&gt;Also shipped quickly, and I&#x27;ll absolutely buy another when I run out of room on this one.</li>
            <li> As some have said, the glue shows a tiny bit and there is a scratch near the top, but other than that, it&#x27;s perfect for storing nail polish. If you also have those 2-oz bottles of acrylic paint used for nail art, they will fit on the top shelf. The rack came packaged nicely, but the screws were loose in the bottom of the box; almost threw them out by accident. It came with a separate header piece that said \\&quot;polish station\\&quot;, but it looks kind of tacky, so I&#x27;m not using it. The shelves appear to be glued on straight. I only gave it 4 stars due to the scratch. However, it&#x27;s not even noticeable once you hang it up. I do highly recommend it if your nail polish is getting out of hand!</li>
            <li> Great price, product, and shipping arrival timing!</li>
            <li> This product was a wonderful gift for my teenaged daughter. I would definitely buy it again. The only downside was that you could see the glue that holds the shelves together. At least the nail polish will cover it.</li>
            <li> Living with a wife and teenage daughter can be challenging at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems that I can&#x27;t go anywhere in the house without finding women&#x27;s shoes, lip-gloss or nail polish laying around. Well, this product solved for one of those issues.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s by no means super-fancy...but it is definately worth the $30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may seem like overkill, buying a rack that holds this much nail polish for use at home, but once some time is spent searching drawers, purses, cabints and cars...you may just find that two are needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I did.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice nail polish rack, good quality construction. My daughter has all her polish, finger/toe Separators, and cotton balls in it with room to spare. I would recomend this to anyone needing a place to store polish and supplies.</li>
            <li> As expected . Our second rack. Love the organization up on the wall and easy to select design/displays professionally.  I ordered one for both of my teens and they were a big hit.</li>
            <li> I love this rack!! it holds so many bottles, now I don&#x27;t have to guess what colors I have, I can just look at the wall, I put it behind the bedroom door so it is very visible, but only when I want to see it, so perfect, and it&#x27;s easy to hang, just a few screws (I used ancors so I never have issues) The rack is clear plastic, so it is very lightwieght. it did come with a section that you can add to the top that says &amp;#34;polish station&amp;#34; but it is optional (not attached) I think it made it look stupid, so I left it off, duh, I know it&#x27;s polish, what else could it be? No much better than the baskets I kept them in before....I love, love, love this rack!!</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my daughters bedroom to keep all her polish in one place. This product is great. Well made, holds different size bottles and brands of polish. Simple look fits in with any decor. So glad I found this!!</li>
            <li> This nail polish rack made my heart whole! I have about 100 bottles on nail polish on my rack right now. When I need another rack, I will be reordering. All my friends are in amazement and jealous when they come and look at my nail polish collection. :-)</li>
            <li> I like this product, it is what is on description. I enjoyed it. Good product.</li>
            <li> The product is scratched up and the glue is visible, but overall it works.  I was unable to track the package, and that is incredibly frustrating.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect I love it I might buy another soon &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> My polish rack was in great shape (there were a few scratches or smudges but I didn&#x27;t mind) I did however opt to use bigger equipment to hang it because I did not feel the tiny screws they sent with it would be as safe as I wanted for the wall. I actually chose to add glitter to the fronts of my shelves with modpogde and it turned out amazing! I love this polish rack and I will probably be purchasing a new one sometime soon as I only have room for 4 more polishes. This did hold 100 polishes for me, but I also have about 10 mini&#x27;s.    Here is my polish rack with the glitter and polish on it.  [...]</li>
            <li> I like the rack but it doesnt hold 96 regular size nail polish bottles maybe small sample bottles&lt;br /&gt;i will buy another rack soon to fit the rest of my polish .</li>
    </ol>
