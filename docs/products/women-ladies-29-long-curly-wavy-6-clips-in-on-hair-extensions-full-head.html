            <li>looks amazing on my daughter</li>

            <li>Soft hair, great color and great curls match my own (brown/black).  </li>
            <li>They did everything they could to make sure their customer was satisfied and nothing feels better than knowing your in good hands.</li>
            <li>This is my first wig and I am happy.</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>I love the length but gurrrllll the thing tangles.</li>
            <li>I love this hair</li>
            <li>and she fell in love.</li>
            <li>Are very nice and soft</li>
            <li>Love the price and quick delivery.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pretty!</li>
            <li>it started falling out so cheap.</li>
            <li>They came sooner than I thought and looked fabulous wearing them.</li>
            <li>it feels so good like natural virgin hair.</li>
            <li>clips in great just too brown does not combine easily with black hair and tangles quickly</li>
            <li>Is it true that hair pieces cannot be exchanged or refunded??</li>
            <li>My hair is also full and the extensions are shiny</li>
            <li>Also you can&#x27;t apply any heat or it will flatten itself out that way and won&#x27;t be pretty.  </li>
            <li>the color was more of a red brown.</li>
            <li>Overall I am impressed with the color match, I ordered brown black and it matches well with my natural hair.</li>
            <li>I am really dissapointed and when I took it out of the bag I slid my fingers through the hair</li>
            <li>They blend really well</li>
            <li>Very nice!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>made it look real</li>
            <li>i love them but it took like a month and a half to get here</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a good product but missing some length</li>
            <li>It arrived with a cute hair tie and several extra hair clips in case you need to sew it on your hair piece.</li>
            <li>I have Ben buying extensions for a long period of time good quality bad quality and for the price these are good quality.</li>
            <li>is actually quite thick and full, and nice quality.</li>
            <li>And for an extra secure hold, tease the part that you are attaching the hair to a bit, and spray a bit of hairspray on it first.. then secure the hair piece well with the attached clips and then use a few bobby pins!</li>
            <li>Mine were very thick and good quality for the price.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s easy to trim off a few inches if you want..</li>
            <li>Was a little too light for my hair.</li>
            <li>The seller also included a personal note which I appreciated.</li>
            <li>One piece isn&#x27;t enough for the whole head.</li>
            <li>The hair is decent quality but ridiculously long.</li>
            <li>Choosing the brown black, (thinking it&#x27;d be closer to black instead of red), the shipping was pretty fast to get to Florida from China.</li>

            <li> It is long.</li>
            <li> Like, down-to-the-butt long.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s unbelievably long, and you would have to cut to wear unless it&#x27;s a Halloween costume</li>
            <li> like, butt length long.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not as long</li>
            <li> Not HAPPY with color of product, it was a little too light.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a it shiny by alittke bit of dry shampoo</li>
            <li> My natural hair is past my shoulders and I wanted long hair for going out.</li>
            <li> It came in as expected, I ordered it for my daughter</li>
            <li> On the other hand, the color threw me off and I immediately contacted the seller.</li>
            <li> It tangles easily and bad.</li>
            <li> (I recently owned synthetic extensions, those suckers couldn&#x27;t straighten).</li>
            <li> * a few tips, do not brush synthetic hair when it is wet.</li>
            <li> I chose the brown black BEWARE that is not the color</li>
            <li> I ordered brown black and</li>
            <li> but they tangle a little on the bottom.</li>
            <li> Any way we did not know that it was missing a couple of inches until we measured it</li>
            <li> I might buy again not sure though.</li>
            <li> I am 5&amp;#34;1 and it looks silly this long...</li>
            <li> /&gt;they are horrible easily tangled and does NOT untangle after a while of me having them they started to smell</li>
            <li> Nothing bad to say about this product at all, except that it was a few inches short.</li>
            <li> but if you have thick hair I recommend getting 2 of this product.</li>
            <li> not what I expected at all :(</li>
            <li> the only bad  thing i can say is that its somewhat shiny!</li>
            <li> Unsatisfied I hate this purchase plastic hair</li>

            <li> i love it i am ordering another one 😍😍😍</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pretty! I love the length but gurrrllll the thing tangles. It tangles easily and bad. There is also no to way to brush it out without ruining it. Also you can&#x27;t apply any heat or it will flatten itself out that way and won&#x27;t be pretty.  However ladies you buy this product knowing its synthetic hair and for being synthetic hair I think it&#x27;s beautiful.  I might buy again not sure though.</li>
            <li> i love them but it took like a month and a half to get here</li>
            <li> i loved this !! the only bad  thing i can say is that its somewhat shiny! but i took care of that :) i put some shampoo powder and wasnt as shiny !!</li>
            <li> clips in great just too brown does not combine easily with black hair and tangles quickly</li>
            <li> I love this hair the texture is great I suggest you get two since one isn&#x27;t enough but it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> A bit reddish, so it won&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> looks amazing on my daughter</li>
            <li> Nothing bad to say about this product at all, except that it was a few inches short. It came in as expected, I ordered it for my daughter and she fell in love. The thickness is great but if you have thick hair I recommend getting 2 of this product. Any way we did not know that it was missing a couple of inches until we measured it it came out to be 23&amp;#34; instead of 29&amp;#34;. Overall, this is a good product but missing some length I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> I chose the brown black BEWARE that is not the color it actually looks redish orange I am really dissapointed and when I took it out of the bag I slid my fingers through the hair it started falling out so cheap. I&#x27;m si dissapointed not what I expected at all :(</li>
            <li> Not HAPPY with color of product, it was a little too light. Is it true that hair pieces cannot be exchanged or refunded??</li>
            <li> I bought two of these&lt;br /&gt;they are horrible easily tangled and does NOT untangle after a while of me having them they started to smell</li>
            <li> Unsatisfied I hate this purchase plastic hair</li>
            <li> Are very nice and soft</li>
            <li> This product is not what is described</li>
            <li> I ordered brown black and the color was more of a red brown. My hair is also full and the extensions are shiny so it will most likely look fake. I kinda regret ordering these and would&#x27;ve ordered different extensions if I knew the color would&#x27;ve been off.</li>
            <li> Since my cousin was turning eighteen, all she ever wanted was extensions. So I thought I could order here. For only about $7, you couldn&#x27;t beat the price! Choosing the brown black, (thinking it&#x27;d be closer to black instead of red), the shipping was pretty fast to get to Florida from China. I&#x27;m not going to lie, these were the absolute best extensions ever! (I recently owned synthetic extensions, those suckers couldn&#x27;t straighten). They were real human hair, really long, and manageable with the comb from my wig kit.&lt;br /&gt;  On the other hand, the color threw me off and I immediately contacted the seller. They did everything they could to make sure their customer was satisfied and nothing feels better than knowing your in good hands.</li>
            <li> But darn it, please help me! I am 5&amp;#34;1 and it looks silly this long...so i need to cut it. Any i don&#x27;t even know how to put it on...i might have&lt;br /&gt;missed instructions. I just don&#x27;t know how to use it. Please tell me how do use this:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> Ordered mine on the 5th of August, recieved them on the 17th. Was a little too light for my hair. They blend really well but they tangle a little on the bottom. Mine were very thick and good quality for the price. Love them!</li>
            <li> Very nice!&lt;br /&gt;This is actually quite thick and full, and nice quality. It arrived with a cute hair tie and several extra hair clips in case you need to sew it on your hair piece. The seller also included a personal note which I appreciated. Overall I am impressed with the color match, I ordered brown black and it matches well with my natural hair. It is long. Like, down-to-the-butt long. But it&#x27;s easy to trim off a few inches if you want..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* a few tips, do not brush synthetic hair when it is wet. Also, for detangeling, use fabric softner.. and just finger- comb thru the hair. And for an extra secure hold, tease the part that you are attaching the hair to a bit, and spray a bit of hairspray on it first.. then secure the hair piece well with the attached clips and then use a few bobby pins!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t specify it was one clip . it&#x27;s unbelievably long, and you would have to cut to wear unless it&#x27;s a Halloween costume</li>
            <li> They only come with one piece. The hair is decent quality but ridiculously long. like, butt length long. One piece isn&#x27;t enough for the whole head. Don&#x27;t get these.</li>
            <li> I loved these! They came sooner than I thought and looked fabulous wearing them. Amazing product !</li>
            <li> This is my first wig and I am happy. My natural hair is past my shoulders and I wanted long hair for going out. Soft hair, great color and great curls match my own (brown/black).  Love the price and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> really great hair my sister loved it.</li>
            <li> I loved it!! it&#x27;s not as long it says but the quality is really good it&#x27;s a it shiny by alittke bit of dry shampoo made it look real n it feels so good like natural virgin hair. I have Ben buying extensions for a long period of time good quality bad quality and for the price these are good quality. I loved them</li>
            <li> I like it but the color didn&#x27;t match.  It looks great and makes my hair fuller but I would need to get one that&#x27;s closer to my hair color or dye my hair to match.</li>
