            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for more than 5 years</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li>I have used many many products.</li>
            <li>its so much better than it was before.</li>
            <li>dug through my cabinet looking for some of my many hair products in an effort to find a leave in conditioner</li>
            <li>I love L.T.R ^_^</li>
            <li>and I was able to keep the bounce and movement in my hair with each style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>This Clairol one is more like a leave in conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Glad we got it.  </li>
            <li>And they all seem to be fairly safe, which is a plus.</li>
            <li>my hair has a lot more moisture</li>
            <li>I really really love this product.  </li>
            <li>I let my kids use it and they abosolutely love.</li>
            <li>I love this product, you apply after you wash and condition your hair.</li>
            <li>Love this product for my hair.</li>
            <li>This has got to be one of my favorite leave in conditioners.</li>
            <li>and it definitely is more healthy looking.</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells</li>
            <li>But if you don&#x27;t use it consistently, all it&#x27;ll do is make your hair smell good.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite Leave-In conditioner!!</li>
            <li>I do have natural African-American hair texture and for me it gave me some great</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner - wish it were still available in the stores.  </li>
            <li>dryed hair right out of the shower to brush with ease!!</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time and love it!</li>
            <li>and it seems they have changed the product and or packaging and our local store no longer carries, but I was able to find a great deal here on Amazon</li>
            <li>it was so easy to detangle and it came out with a silky and shiny finish.</li>
            <li>But I soon figured out that if I put it on in the morning rather than letting it sit on my hair overnight, it wasn&#x27;t as strong.    </li>
            <li>I have medium/long fine, wavy hair (fragile) that I have chemically processed and I require a great conditioner to make sure there is no damage.</li>
            <li>This leave in conditioner really makes my hair grow nice and strong.  </li>
            <li>My hair has always been smooth and well cared,I use all herbal line (shampoo and conditioner),I bought this product to prevent split</li>
            <li>This product seems to be no longer gratuitously available.  </li>
            <li>I only use it when I wash my hair and the results are great.</li>
            <li>My hair feels silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>I use it as a leave in conditioner and so far so good.</li>
            <li>As the other reviewers have mentioned it does smell great, but that&#x27;s not all i love about it.  </li>
            <li>I heard many good things about this moisturizer for a long time</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth looking in to!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worth the price!  </li>
            <li>12 hours later and it still feels soft and smells great!</li>
            <li>All the bottles arrived sealed and clean.</li>
            <li>I was saddened when they retired it but later learned they had just changed it to be part of the Touchably Smooth line, although it makes me very pleased to find the original is still available right here on Amazon!</li>
            <li>Not really raspberry, but it still has a great clean smell.</li>
            <li>Thanks :)</li>
            <li>When they wake up in the morning it is a full on fro.  </li>
            <li>This is a great, inexpensive alternative to other products that are made specifically for their hair type.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>The main thing is to use just a little, and work up to what works best.  </li>
            <li>For an all around good working hair product routine, i would suggest the long term relationship shampoo, conditioner, and potion.</li>
            <li>I am not by any means an organic freak, but I am sure there are many women that have the exact same problem I am experiencing, which is that NOTHING seemed to give my hair moisture...</li>
            <li>It really does help repair split ends!!</li>
            <li>Its very vversatile because it can be used on dry hair as a moisturizer and it works great</li>
            <li>This is a nice, pleasant smelling leave-in conditioner that works well on middle aged hair.  </li>
            <li>sometime now I must say it is worth buying.  </li>
            <li>Their ingredients just SOUND healthier, but I won&#x27;t waste ya&#x27;lls time going into that, you can research it on your own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good thing about this product</li>
            <li>I started putting it on my hair each day after showering and it is the only thing making my now damaged hair ends manageable until I am able to find time to go to the salon for a hair cut.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So this time I concentrated on just the ends with this product and it worked really well!</li>
            <li>I was satisfied with my purchase and would recommend it to others and definitely consider purchasing again for my hair.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time to straighten my hair and the smell of the product</li>
            <li>My was very soft and sweet smelling.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t even make my hair soft like the stuff i originally used.</li>
            <li>Thanks much!</li>
            <li>This makes your hair nice n soft but the smell does not stay long on the hair once blow dryed the strawberry flavoured fragnace does not stay on the hair</li>
            <li>First, just to give you an idea on what kind of hair I have, I&#x27;m an African American (AA) woman with type 4a hair (for those who don&#x27;t know -</li>
            <li>so it gets really tangled and unmanageable.</li>
            <li>, that reminded me of when I had very damaged hair when I bleached it blond for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this leave-in conditioner.  </li>
            <li>As with all leave in conditioners, too much will leave your hair greasy.  </li>
            <li>I bought this leave in conditioner at walmart once,but when I was ready to buy another bottle they didn&#x27;t stock it anymore.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really like shampoo smell.</li>
            <li>This product is what I had been waiting for my whole life.</li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about this product is that the product does have a sweet smell - something I didn&#x27;t mind at first but soon found it wearing on me.</li>
            <li>The other benefit to this product is that aside from it protecting hair against the rough effects of rubbing against my shirt, it also does a great job with moisturizing my hair without making it oily.</li>
            <li>I get fewer split ends than if I absolutely did not use conditioner, but I get about as many split ends as if I use any other conditioner at all.</li>
            <li>Like most other products, I noticed no difference in my hair...</li>
            <li>If you are looking for split end protection or just something to keep the breakage down when you are brushing your hair out wet, this is a great product.  </li>
            <li>I have a hard time finding a great conditioner, as I look for what my hair looks like after using, not the actual product in the hand.  </li>
            <li>I previously used Bedhead Split End Mender, and found that one worked much better at preventing split ends.  </li>
            <li>so it was a relief to find this older version.</li>
            <li>I like this particular one more than some of my more expensive leave ins.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if it&#x27;s really doing anything about my damage and split ends (part of why I give it 4 stars vs. 5), but I love the way my hair feels after a shower when I put in some of this leave-in.  </li>
            <li>At first I was skeptical because I didn&#x27;t think it would work good for my hair type which is really course.</li>
            <li>I would highly reccommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>and I have tried so many other brands!!</li>
            <li>It can be difficult to find, so I was happy to find it here.</li>
            <li>I will post an update after a few more months use.</li>
            <li>I live in Arizona and use this every day.</li>
            <li>The new formula for this product does not work as well</li>
            <li>other than that i highly recommend this product to anyone who has trouble finding a good moisturizing product</li>
            <li>Going to order a set of 4 bottles if they&#x27;re available next payday so that I&#x27;ll have some to last for a while.</li>
            <li>and I can use a wide toothed comb or pick to have it looking gorgeous in just a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>Even though this product isn&#x27;t made specifically for mixed race or african american hair types, I am not surprised at the good reviews it is getting from people with these types of hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is also super thick, so I have to use 2 full boxes of hair coloring to cover all of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Here are the ingredients, for those interested: Water, Stearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Juice, Hydrolyzed Silk, Dimethicone, Glutamic Acid, Fragrance, Benzyl Alcohol, Citric Acid, Sodium Chloride, Edta, Propylene Glycol, Dmdm Hydantoin, Red 33</li>
            <li>I was told by my hairdresser that my first problem was in the second ingredient.</li>
            <li>I have extremely fine, long, blonde hair</li>
            <li>In truth, I tend to mix it with a hair gel and the combination keeps my hair soft but well controlled.  </li>
            <li>It made my hair soft and silky..</li>
            <li>Leaves it feeling really soft, without getting gummy.</li>
            <li>I have Naturally Curly Hair</li>
            <li>--don&#x27;t put too much or it&#x27;ll leave a white film on your hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is by far my favourite hair care product.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the only leave-in conditioner that really works for me.</li>
            <li>The smell of this product is a little hard to describe, but it is a pleasant, non-fruity smell.</li>
            <li>Here are the first things you see when you look at the back of this bottle: Water, Stearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Juice, Hydrolyzed Silk, Dimethicone, Glutamic Acid, Fragrance, Benzyl Alcohol, Citric Acid, Sodium Chloride, Edta, Propylene Glycol, Dmdm Hydantoin, Red 33.</li>
            <li>It really weighed my hair down and didn&#x27;t seem to do much else.</li>
            <li>FYI, I also use it on my own hair (long, slightly wavy) on days that I blow dry or straighten it</li>
            <li>/&gt;I feel comfortable rubbing it in wet &amp; dry hair.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works for dry damaged hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not super thick like most leave in treatments, but it does just as much work.  </li>
            <li>I am left with soft, shiny, non-greasy hair.</li>
            <li>So much so that I wondered what would happen if I used it on wet hair and combed it through!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t seem like it did much to moisturize and was just too thick to really work for me as a leave-in.</li>
            <li>The seller offered for me to send it back but with having to do a border crossing at $6.50 round trip because they won&#x27;t ship to Canada, plus my gas and a $5.00 fee to where i had it delivered it just wasn&#x27;t worth sending it back.</li>

            <li> it was so easy to detangle and it came out with a silky and shiny finish.</li>
            <li> But I soon figured out that if I put it on in the morning rather than letting it sit on my hair overnight, it wasn&#x27;t as strong.    </li>
            <li> I have medium/long fine, wavy hair (fragile) that I have chemically processed and I require a great conditioner to make sure there is no damage.</li>
            <li> This leave in conditioner really makes my hair grow nice and strong.  </li>
            <li> My hair has always been smooth and well cared,I use all herbal line (shampoo and conditioner),I bought this product to prevent split</li>
            <li> This product seems to be no longer gratuitously available.  </li>
            <li> I only use it when I wash my hair and the results are great.</li>
            <li> My hair feels silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> I use it as a leave in conditioner and so far so good.</li>
            <li> As the other reviewers have mentioned it does smell great, but that&#x27;s not all i love about it.  </li>
            <li> I heard many good things about this moisturizer for a long time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth looking in to!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worth the price!  </li>
            <li> 12 hours later and it still feels soft and smells great!</li>
            <li> All the bottles arrived sealed and clean.</li>
            <li> I was saddened when they retired it but later learned they had just changed it to be part of the Touchably Smooth line, although it makes me very pleased to find the original is still available right here on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Not really raspberry, but it still has a great clean smell.</li>
            <li> Thanks :)</li>
            <li> When they wake up in the morning it is a full on fro.  </li>
            <li> This is a great, inexpensive alternative to other products that are made specifically for their hair type.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> The main thing is to use just a little, and work up to what works best.  </li>
            <li> For an all around good working hair product routine, i would suggest the long term relationship shampoo, conditioner, and potion.</li>
            <li> I am not by any means an organic freak, but I am sure there are many women that have the exact same problem I am experiencing, which is that NOTHING seemed to give my hair moisture...</li>
            <li> It really does help repair split ends!!</li>
            <li> Its very vversatile because it can be used on dry hair as a moisturizer and it works great</li>
            <li> This is a nice, pleasant smelling leave-in conditioner that works well on middle aged hair.  </li>
            <li> sometime now I must say it is worth buying.  </li>
            <li> Their ingredients just SOUND healthier, but I won&#x27;t waste ya&#x27;lls time going into that, you can research it on your own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good thing about this product</li>
            <li> I started putting it on my hair each day after showering and it is the only thing making my now damaged hair ends manageable until I am able to find time to go to the salon for a hair cut.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So this time I concentrated on just the ends with this product and it worked really well!</li>
            <li> I was satisfied with my purchase and would recommend it to others and definitely consider purchasing again for my hair.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time to straighten my hair and the smell of the product</li>
            <li> My was very soft and sweet smelling.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even make my hair soft like the stuff i originally used.</li>
            <li> Thanks much!</li>
            <li> This makes your hair nice n soft but the smell does not stay long on the hair once blow dryed the strawberry flavoured fragnace does not stay on the hair</li>
            <li> First, just to give you an idea on what kind of hair I have, I&#x27;m an African American (AA) woman with type 4a hair (for those who don&#x27;t know -</li>
            <li> so it gets really tangled and unmanageable.</li>
            <li> , that reminded me of when I had very damaged hair when I bleached it blond for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this leave-in conditioner.  </li>
            <li> As with all leave in conditioners, too much will leave your hair greasy.  </li>
            <li> I bought this leave in conditioner at walmart once,but when I was ready to buy another bottle they didn&#x27;t stock it anymore.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t really like shampoo smell.</li>
            <li> This product is what I had been waiting for my whole life.</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about this product is that the product does have a sweet smell - something I didn&#x27;t mind at first but soon found it wearing on me.</li>
            <li> The other benefit to this product is that aside from it protecting hair against the rough effects of rubbing against my shirt, it also does a great job with moisturizing my hair without making it oily.</li>
            <li> I get fewer split ends than if I absolutely did not use conditioner, but I get about as many split ends as if I use any other conditioner at all.</li>
            <li> Like most other products, I noticed no difference in my hair...</li>
            <li> If you are looking for split end protection or just something to keep the breakage down when you are brushing your hair out wet, this is a great product.  </li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding a great conditioner, as I look for what my hair looks like after using, not the actual product in the hand.  </li>
            <li> I previously used Bedhead Split End Mender, and found that one worked much better at preventing split ends.  </li>
            <li> so it was a relief to find this older version.</li>
            <li> I like this particular one more than some of my more expensive leave ins.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if it&#x27;s really doing anything about my damage and split ends (part of why I give it 4 stars vs. 5), but I love the way my hair feels after a shower when I put in some of this leave-in.  </li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical because I didn&#x27;t think it would work good for my hair type which is really course.</li>
            <li> I would highly reccommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> and I have tried so many other brands!!</li>
            <li> It can be difficult to find, so I was happy to find it here.</li>
            <li> I will post an update after a few more months use.</li>
            <li> I live in Arizona and use this every day.</li>
            <li> The new formula for this product does not work as well</li>
            <li> other than that i highly recommend this product to anyone who has trouble finding a good moisturizing product</li>
            <li> Going to order a set of 4 bottles if they&#x27;re available next payday so that I&#x27;ll have some to last for a while.</li>
            <li> and I can use a wide toothed comb or pick to have it looking gorgeous in just a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> Even though this product isn&#x27;t made specifically for mixed race or african american hair types, I am not surprised at the good reviews it is getting from people with these types of hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is also super thick, so I have to use 2 full boxes of hair coloring to cover all of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Here are the ingredients, for those interested: Water, Stearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Juice, Hydrolyzed Silk, Dimethicone, Glutamic Acid, Fragrance, Benzyl Alcohol, Citric Acid, Sodium Chloride, Edta, Propylene Glycol, Dmdm Hydantoin, Red 33</li>
            <li> I was told by my hairdresser that my first problem was in the second ingredient.</li>
            <li> I have extremely fine, long, blonde hair</li>
            <li> In truth, I tend to mix it with a hair gel and the combination keeps my hair soft but well controlled.  </li>
            <li> It made my hair soft and silky..</li>
            <li> Leaves it feeling really soft, without getting gummy.</li>
            <li> I have Naturally Curly Hair</li>
            <li> --don&#x27;t put too much or it&#x27;ll leave a white film on your hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is by far my favourite hair care product.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the only leave-in conditioner that really works for me.</li>
            <li> The smell of this product is a little hard to describe, but it is a pleasant, non-fruity smell.</li>
            <li> Here are the first things you see when you look at the back of this bottle: Water, Stearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Juice, Hydrolyzed Silk, Dimethicone, Glutamic Acid, Fragrance, Benzyl Alcohol, Citric Acid, Sodium Chloride, Edta, Propylene Glycol, Dmdm Hydantoin, Red 33.</li>
            <li> It really weighed my hair down and didn&#x27;t seem to do much else.</li>
            <li> FYI, I also use it on my own hair (long, slightly wavy) on days that I blow dry or straighten it</li>
            <li> /&gt;I feel comfortable rubbing it in wet &amp; dry hair.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really works for dry damaged hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super thick like most leave in treatments, but it does just as much work.  </li>
            <li> I am left with soft, shiny, non-greasy hair.</li>
            <li> So much so that I wondered what would happen if I used it on wet hair and combed it through!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem like it did much to moisturize and was just too thick to really work for me as a leave-in.</li>
            <li> The seller offered for me to send it back but with having to do a border crossing at $6.50 round trip because they won&#x27;t ship to Canada, plus my gas and a $5.00 fee to where i had it delivered it just wasn&#x27;t worth sending it back.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s dry and frizzy, but even after the first use I noticed my hair felt a lot softer after it dried.  </li>
            <li> When I first tried this product I didn&#x27;t use this on wet hair but on dry hair and the reason I didn&#x27;t was because I&#x27;ve dealt with other products that were specifically designed for \\&quot;split end</li>
            <li> her hair looked greesy and nasty before and after looked nice and clean.</li>
            <li> (Funny enough, no matter what I spent on leave in conditioner products it STILL dried out my hair.)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because of a handful of stubborn grey hairs, I left the hair dye in WAY too long the last time.</li>
            <li> She also told me fragrances that are not natural and color (I.E. Red 33)</li>
            <li> that means it&#x27;s pretty thick ;</li>
            <li> I use this product as a daily leave-in on dry hair</li>
            <li> is, oddly enough, the reason my hair remained dry.</li>
            <li> This leave in conditioner is protein heavy but leaves my ends very soft and well conditioned.  </li>
            <li> My hair is long and dry and requires a lot of extra moisture that this leave-in provides.</li>
            <li> but when I used this product my hair was 3/4 of the way down my back, wavy/curly, fine, thin, and dry.</li>
            <li> I tried it and come to find out, it still didn&#x27;t make my hair stiff but it came out soft and manageable!     </li>
            <li> i use all of the long term relations ship products out there and recommend it to every one.</li>
            <li> I have been doing this for years, and my hair is now quite long.</li>
            <li> and I found this Herbal Essences Long Term Relationship Split End Protector that I had purchased a while ago and then forgot about.</li>
            <li> I am African American with long, thick, naturally curly (but relaxed) hair.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few leave in conditioners that work well, leaving my hair soft but not greasy.  </li>
            <li> I started using the Long Term Relationship collection specifically because I am growing out my hair.</li>
            <li> and thst&#x27;s what i&#x27;ve been looking for, for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have long, curly hair</li>
            <li> I will be using this for a long time.  </li>
            <li> stayed in for a long time.</li>
            <li> of caution don&#x27;t get too heavy handed, I found when I used too much my hair felt a little crispy or left a white firm.  </li>
            <li> can dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> This Leave in Conditions Says it all \\&quot;Long Term Relationship\\&quot;!!</li>
            <li> She told me alcohol will dry out my hair; and I have curly hair, I need all the moisture I can get!</li>
            <li> Also, it says you can use it on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> I used on my relaxed hair while it was wet and let it air dry</li>
            <li> This little bottle lasted me about a year of constant use.  </li>
            <li> I try to take scissors to my hair as little as possible and this leave in conditioner helps me do that.  </li>
            <li> I have absolutely no complaints.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it on twists for overnight twist-outs and used for curl defining before adding my gel on wet hair.  </li>
            <li> I am trying to grow out my hair and am careful about what I put in it.  </li>
            <li> All I do is put this in after  bathing or wet their hair before applying</li>
            <li> The only drawback that I can think of is that it comes in such a small bottle!    </li>
            <li> As mentioned in other reviews, it leaves a soft, delicate texture without looking oily at all.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores, I think everyone uses it, so it don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> With some other leave-in conditioners my hair starts to look greasy by the end the day but with this i have not had that problem.  </li>
            <li> I have ALWAYS had problems with my hair; it&#x27;s wavy and EXTREMELY susceptible to damage.</li>
            <li> The store I work for has decided to stop carrying it (as a small store we have to constantly change out products)</li>
            <li> Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried other brands when this has been out of stock and they don&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> I would suggest only using it on wet, otherwise it gets stiff and a little clumpy.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it does not weigh my hair down at all.</li>
            <li> I have two little ones who are mixed race (caucasion and afrian-american) and their hair has very tight, springy curls.  </li>
            <li> :) Plus the price of this wasn&#x27;t all that bad compared to what I&#x27;ve paid for in the past.</li>
            <li> I have mixed hair, wavy and thick.</li>
            <li> I would say using no more than a single pump and a half in each section can get the job done.  </li>
            <li> gave one star because Amazon does not let me give less then</li>
            <li> It also made the split ends much less noticable.  </li>
            <li> and this provides moisture and split end protection without being heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re not washing your hair everyday, it&#x27;s bound to happen at some point.</li>
            <li> the opposite turned out, my hair now looks sloppy and dull</li>
            <li> I mean, for less than 5 dollars a bottle, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> and knew that when I tried to use them throughout my hair before, it made my hair a bit stiff and hard to manage.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed a reduction lately.</li>
            <li> I AA with thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thick AA hair.</li>
            <li> the person who posted pics saying it sucks must be crazy or something.</li>
            <li> Just not happy with the product at all!!</li>
            <li> Alot of the chemicals we put into our hair have some very disturbing drawbacks.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I tend to get really bad split ends.</li>
            <li> This time is was terribly damaged at the ends and had a horrible texture to it when wet</li>
            <li> am very disappointed with this product and very sad for how looks my hair now.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like this product for my hair. I use it after shampoing to protect the split ends. I&#x27;ve been using it for more than 5 years and I&#x27;m satisfied and I&#x27;ll continue to order this product. It was delivered on time with good packaging.</li>
            <li> This is a good, inexpensive leave in conditioner.  I live in Arizona and use this every day. It can be difficult to find, so I was happy to find it here.</li>
            <li> i baught this leave in at my job at target. i used it after i washed and conditioned my hair. i have 3b-c hair. so it gets really tangled and unmanageable. let me tell ya!!!! this stuff rocks!!! and it was only 2 bucks cant beat that at all!!!</li>
            <li> My hair has always been smooth and well cared,I use all herbal line (shampoo and conditioner),I bought this product to prevent split ends.&lt;br /&gt;But the opposite turned out, my hair now looks sloppy and dull, it seems that I do not take care of my hair. Before I could brush my hair with my fingers ... Now I try to do it and my fingers  tangle in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I gave one star because Amazon does not let me give less then that.&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed with this product and very sad for how looks my hair now.</li>
            <li> I have used many many products. This one is the best. my hair still smells good the day after. its so much better than it was before. I 100000% recommend this. the person who posted pics saying it sucks must be crazy or something. her hair looked greesy and nasty before and after looked nice and clean. i use all of the long term relations ship products out there and recommend it to every one. you should try it!</li>
            <li> I dye my hair each month with a Feria permanent hair coloring. I have been doing this for years, and my hair is now quite long. My hair is also super thick, so I have to use 2 full boxes of hair coloring to cover all of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of a handful of stubborn grey hairs, I left the hair dye in WAY too long the last time. The stated amount of time is 25 min, I figured I would leave it in for 40 min. I lost track of time and an hour later I am rushing to the shower to wash it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally after dying my hair, it&#x27;s even smoother and softer than before. This time is was terribly damaged at the ends and had a horrible texture to it when wet, that reminded me of when I had very damaged hair when I bleached it blond for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dug through my cabinet looking for some of my many hair products in an effort to find a leave in conditioner and I found this Herbal Essences Long Term Relationship Split End Protector that I had purchased a while ago and then forgot about. I started putting it on my hair each day after showering and it is the only thing making my now damaged hair ends manageable until I am able to find time to go to the salon for a hair cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works so well, it&#x27;s almost as though I never damaged the hair at all. I am thrilled with the results and plan to keep using this since I love how well it is working.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, pleasant smelling leave-in conditioner that works well on middle aged hair.  In truth, I tend to mix it with a hair gel and the combination keeps my hair soft but well controlled.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is The best leave In I ever bought.....It made my hair soft and silky..It also made the split ends much less noticable.  (So Its A must Have) I love L.T.R ^_^</li>
            <li> This products when used daily helped with the dryness and spilt ends of my hair.  I would highly reccommend.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this leave-in conditioner.  As the other reviewers have mentioned it does smell great, but that&#x27;s not all i love about it.  I have extremely fine, long, blonde hair and this provides moisture and split end protection without being heavy or greasy.  I put it on the ends of my hair after i shower and let it sit for about 5 minutes before brushing it though the rest of my hair. With some other leave-in conditioners my hair starts to look greasy by the end the day but with this i have not had that problem.  I have absolutely no complaints.  This production couldn&#x27;t be more perfect for me. If you are looking for split end protection or just something to keep the breakage down when you are brushing your hair out wet, this is a great product.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am African American with long, thick, naturally curly (but relaxed) hair. I use this product as a daily leave-in on dry hair and I love it! I am left with soft, shiny, non-greasy hair. I use about a quarter-sized amount on my entire head of hair. As for split ends, I have had issues with them for some time and I have noticed a reduction lately. Nothing can repair hairs that have already split, but this leave-in has definitely reduced this occurrence in my hair. The smell of this product is a little hard to describe, but it is a pleasant, non-fruity smell. The only drawback that I can think of is that it comes in such a small bottle!    Here are the ingredients, for those interested: Water, Stearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Juice, Hydrolyzed Silk, Dimethicone, Glutamic Acid, Fragrance, Benzyl Alcohol, Citric Acid, Sodium Chloride, Edta, Propylene Glycol, Dmdm Hydantoin, Red 33</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding a great conditioner, as I look for what my hair looks like after using, not the actual product in the hand.  I have medium/long fine, wavy hair (fragile) that I have chemically processed and I require a great conditioner to make sure there is no damage. This is one of the few leave in conditioners that work well, leaving my hair soft but not greasy.  The main thing is to use just a little, and work up to what works best.  As with all leave in conditioners, too much will leave your hair greasy.  A fantastic product!! Smells great and even more important works well!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product since August of last year and after using it for sometime now I must say it is worth buying.  I do have natural African-American hair texture and for me it gave me some great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it on twists for overnight twist-outs and used for curl defining before adding my gel on wet hair.  On both accounts, my hair had amazing definition.  Nor did I see any frizz and I was able to keep the bounce and movement in my hair with each style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word of caution don&#x27;t get too heavy handed, I found when I used too much my hair felt a little crispy or left a white firm.  I would say using no more than a single pump and a half in each section can get the job done.  The product is marketed as a leave-in but found it to be moisturizing as well.</li>
            <li> It smells so good and i love it. I use it as a leave in conditioner and so far so good.</li>
            <li> I have always used the Herbal Essences collection because its affordable and smells amazing. I started using the Long Term Relationship collection specifically because I am growing out my hair. I have ALWAYS had problems with my hair; it&#x27;s wavy and EXTREMELY susceptible to damage. I began using the protector in hopes of saving every inch every time I went to the salon. Like most other products, I noticed no difference in my hair... and this is why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began learning and teaching myself about the ingredients that were in the hair care products I was using. Here are the first things you see when you look at the back of this bottle: Water, Stearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Juice, Hydrolyzed Silk, Dimethicone, Glutamic Acid, Fragrance, Benzyl Alcohol, Citric Acid, Sodium Chloride, Edta, Propylene Glycol, Dmdm Hydantoin, Red 33. I was told by my hairdresser that my first problem was in the second ingredient. She told me alcohol will dry out my hair; and I have curly hair, I need all the moisture I can get! She also told me fragrances that are not natural and color (I.E. Red 33) can dry out my hair. She suggested I go organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I am not by any means an organic freak, but I am sure there are many women that have the exact same problem I am experiencing, which is that NOTHING seemed to give my hair moisture... that&#x27;s when I switched to organic shampoos and conditioners. Their ingredients just SOUND healthier, but I won&#x27;t waste ya&#x27;lls time going into that, you can research it on your own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good thing about this product is, oddly enough, the reason my hair remained dry. I always loved the smell, and my fiance would have to agree 100%. :) Plus the price of this wasn&#x27;t all that bad compared to what I&#x27;ve paid for in the past. (Funny enough, no matter what I spent on leave in conditioner products it STILL dried out my hair.)</li>
            <li> not only does the scent last all day from this product. It actually feels weightless in my hair. It gives my strands managability, softness, and shine. For an all around good working hair product routine, i would suggest the long term relationship shampoo, conditioner, and potion.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I use it almost every day and it is the only thing that helps me get a brush through my hair.  Leaves it feeling really soft, without getting gummy.</li>
            <li> She loves it, she requested this specifically and it seems they have changed the product and or packaging and our local store no longer carries, but I was able to find a great deal here on Amazon</li>
            <li> I hope the company isn&#x27;t discontinuing this product now that I&#x27;ve found it.  The store I work for has decided to stop carrying it (as a small store we have to constantly change out products) so I decided to buy a bottle while it was at a lower price.  After one use I bought the last bottle as well!  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if it&#x27;s really doing anything about my damage and split ends (part of why I give it 4 stars vs. 5), but I love the way my hair feels after a shower when I put in some of this leave-in.  Usually the first day or so after washing my hair it&#x27;s dry and frizzy, but even after the first use I noticed my hair felt a lot softer after it dried.  Going to order a set of 4 bottles if they&#x27;re available next payday so that I&#x27;ll have some to last for a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 6 months now and it works so well that it&#x27;s now officially one of my must-have products! Here&#x27;s why.....    First, just to give you an idea on what kind of hair I have, I&#x27;m an African American (AA) woman with type 4a hair (for those who don&#x27;t know - that means it&#x27;s pretty thick ;-D). When I first tried this product I didn&#x27;t use this on wet hair but on dry hair and the reason I didn&#x27;t was because I&#x27;ve dealt with other products that were specifically designed for \\&quot;split end protection\\&quot; and knew that when I tried to use them throughout my hair before, it made my hair a bit stiff and hard to manage. So this time I concentrated on just the ends with this product and it worked really well! So much so that I wondered what would happen if I used it on wet hair and combed it through! I tried it and come to find out, it still didn&#x27;t make my hair stiff but it came out soft and manageable!     The other benefit to this product is that aside from it protecting hair against the rough effects of rubbing against my shirt, it also does a great job with moisturizing my hair without making it oily. This is a big plus because I can&#x27;t tolerate oily hair!    The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about this product is that the product does have a sweet smell - something I didn&#x27;t mind at first but soon found it wearing on me. But I soon figured out that if I put it on in the morning rather than letting it sit on my hair overnight, it wasn&#x27;t as strong.    All in all, it&#x27;s a great product for split end protection and moisture and that makes it great for length retention. Not to mention that the price is more than fair for what it does! It&#x27;s definitely worth looking in to!</li>
            <li> I cannot find this in stores anymore and it does wonders for my hair.  I suggest this for anyone with frizzy, split ends.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for the last two years. I have Naturally Curly Hair and I put a dollop in my towel dryed hair right out of the shower to brush with ease!! It works so great and I have tried so many other brands!! This Leave in Conditions Says it all \\&quot;Long Term Relationship\\&quot;!! For some reason I have been trying to find this locally and haven&#x27;t had any luck I sure hope that it isn&#x27;t being discontinued!!! So, here I am again AMAZON you always have everything I need when I cannot find it locally! Free Shipping too can&#x27;t get better then that!</li>
            <li> This leave in conditioner is protein heavy but leaves my ends very soft and well conditioned.  I like this particular one more than some of my more expensive leave ins.</li>
            <li> I previously used Bedhead Split End Mender, and found that one worked much better at preventing split ends.  This Clairol one is more like a leave in conditioner.  I get fewer split ends than if I absolutely did not use conditioner, but I get about as many split ends as if I use any other conditioner at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I tend to get really bad split ends. First off, this stuff smells great! Not really raspberry, but it still has a great clean smell. If you use this every time you wash and style, you will see a reduction of split ends. But if you don&#x27;t use it consistently, all it&#x27;ll do is make your hair smell good. Also, it says you can use it on wet or dry hair. I would suggest only using it on wet, otherwise it gets stiff and a little clumpy.</li>
            <li> The product smells really great, and even though it is a leave in conditioner, it doesn&#x27;t make your hair crackly or anything as it dries. My only problem is that one of the bottles in my package was faulty - the pump doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner - wish it were still available in the stores.  Thanks much!</li>
            <li> This leave in conditioner really makes my hair grow nice and strong.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I was satisfied with my purchase and would recommend it to others and definitely consider purchasing again for my hair.</li>
            <li> This product seems to be no longer gratuitously available.  Glad we got it.  This is a very good detangler and at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> I bought this leave in conditioner at walmart once,but when I was ready to buy another bottle they didn&#x27;t stock it anymore.  By ordering on amazon I got 4 bottles so I won&#x27;t have to worry about that for a while.   The stuff works amazing.  It really does help repair split ends!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this about 2 months now and have been having favourable results. I have recently been hearing all sorts of information/rumours about the ingredients in our hair products so I went and did some research on the ingredients in this one. And they all seem to be fairly safe, which is a plus. Alot of the chemicals we put into our hair have some very disturbing drawbacks. I will continue to use and monitor the results. I will post an update after a few more months use.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything to give my hair a silky finish nothing works. I bought the split end protector after reviews. The price is great by the way for those looking for something affordable. I used on my relaxed hair while it was wet and let it air dry it was so easy to detangle and it came out with a silky and shiny finish. Its very vversatile because it can be used on dry hair as a moisturizer and it works great I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  I AA with thick hair.  I am trying to grow out my hair and am careful about what I put in it.  I am a youtube junkie and have been following a girl on there that uses this product. After her review I searched everywhere for this product. It was always sold out!! I FINALLY found it at a Target out of town for only $2.87. I used it for the first time and love it! I put it on after washing and conditioning my hair with non-Herbal Essences products. The smell is amazing! My was very soft and sweet smelling. 12 hours later and it still feels soft and smells great! This is my new favorite Leave-In conditioner!!</li>
            <li> I heard many good things about this moisturizer for a long time so I decided that I wanted to try it for myself. At first I was skeptical because I didn&#x27;t think it would work good for my hair type which is really course. but I decided to anyways and I was really impressed by how soft and managable it made my hair. I only use it when I wash my hair and the results are great. my hair has a lot more moisture and thst&#x27;s what i&#x27;ve been looking for, for a long time. the only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the smell. it smells like shampoo and I don&#x27;t really like shampoo smell. other than that i highly recommend this product to anyone who has trouble finding a good moisturizing product</li>
            <li> This formula smells so amazing.  This little bottle lasted me about a year of constant use.  I have long, curly hair and I keep it up by regularly trimming the ends (I&#x27;ve never actually had a hair cut).  I try to take scissors to my hair as little as possible and this leave in conditioner helps me do that.  It&#x27;s not super thick like most leave in treatments, but it does just as much work.  I like the pump bottle and it&#x27;s worth the price!  I mean, for less than 5 dollars a bottle, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> This item was discontinued and now replaced with another product like it.&lt;br /&gt;i like herbal essence product.&lt;br /&gt;The newer version works great too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;fast ship</li>
            <li> I really really love this product.  It hydrates my hair, smells great, I protect my ends.  I will be using this for a long time.  I let my kids use it and they abosolutely love.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and gets the tangles out so easily, don&#x27;t need much use sparingly or can make your hair look greasy. Arrived quickly. All the bottles arrived sealed and clean.</li>
            <li> This product keeps your hair moisturized &amp; soft!&lt;br /&gt;I feel like I&#x27;m protecting my hair when I put this in.&lt;br /&gt;I feel comfortable rubbing it in wet &amp; dry hair.  What a pleasant smell as well!&lt;br /&gt;Note--don&#x27;t put too much or it&#x27;ll leave a white film on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re not washing your hair everyday, it&#x27;s bound to happen at some point.</li>
            <li> The new formula for this product does not work as well so it was a relief to find this older version.</li>
            <li> Great detangler and doesn&#x27;t leave hair greasy. I wish I could find it I n stores. It Seems to be discontinued.</li>
            <li> This makes your hair nice n soft but the smell does not stay long on the hair once blow dryed the strawberry flavoured fragnace does not stay on the hair</li>
            <li> This stuff works great on my curly hair ! smells great too!</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because i used to use this product all the time. The product i received isn&#x27;t like what i had before. It doesn&#x27;t even smell the same. It doesn&#x27;t even make my hair soft like the stuff i originally used. The seller offered for me to send it back but with having to do a border crossing at $6.50 round trip because they won&#x27;t ship to Canada, plus my gas and a $5.00 fee to where i had it delivered it just wasn&#x27;t worth sending it back. I would of had to spend another $6.50 for border crossing and my gas so i would of been out quite a bit of money to return it. Just not happy with the product at all!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, They have stopped selling it in the stores. I had to look online for it. This is the second time I have had to purchase it on line.</li>
            <li> I love this product, you apply after you wash and condition your hair. After you get out of shower, apply this product and leave in. It makes it easier to comb your hair and prevents split end, just like it says. Hard to find in stores, I think everyone uses it, so it don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t that impressed by this. I&#x27;ve since cut my hair but when I used this product my hair was 3/4 of the way down my back, wavy/curly, fine, thin, and dry. It didn&#x27;t seem like it did much to moisturize and was just too thick to really work for me as a leave-in. It really weighed my hair down and didn&#x27;t seem to do much else. The plus side was that it did seem to offer some split-end protection and smelled amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is what I had been waiting for my whole life. I have mixed hair, wavy and thick. I used it for the first time to straighten my hair and the smell of the product stayed in for a long time. My hair feels silky and smooth. Thanks :)</li>
            <li> This stuff really works for dry damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product for my hair. This protect my ends and assist with hair growth. Will re-purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I have thick AA hair. I using this as a leave-in at night and when styling. This has got to be one of my favorite leave in conditioners. I have been using this for years. A little goes a long way and it does not weigh my hair down at all.</li>
            <li> Even though this product isn&#x27;t made specifically for mixed race or african american hair types, I am not surprised at the good reviews it is getting from people with these types of hair.  I have two little ones who are mixed race (caucasion and afrian-american) and their hair has very tight, springy curls.  When they wake up in the morning it is a full on fro.  All I do is put this in after  bathing or wet their hair before applying and I can use a wide toothed comb or pick to have it looking gorgeous in just a few minutes.  As mentioned in other reviews, it leaves a soft, delicate texture without looking oily at all.  For my children, one application lasts until they go to bed.  This is a great, inexpensive alternative to other products that are made specifically for their hair type.  FYI, I also use it on my own hair (long, slightly wavy) on days that I blow dry or straighten it and it definitely is more healthy looking.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favourite hair care product. I love the way it smells and it&#x27;s the only leave-in conditioner that really works for me. Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried other brands when this has been out of stock and they don&#x27;t compare. My hair is long and dry and requires a lot of extra moisture that this leave-in provides. If it weren&#x27;t for this stuff, I probably couldn&#x27;t comb my hair, honestly. I was saddened when they retired it but later learned they had just changed it to be part of the Touchably Smooth line, although it makes me very pleased to find the original is still available right here on Amazon! Definitely buy! Everyone will tell you how wonderful your hair smells.</li>
