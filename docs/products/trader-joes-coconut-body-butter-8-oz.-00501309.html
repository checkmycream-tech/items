            <li>I&#x27;m always looking for a good coconut smelling product.  </li>
            <li>but, I always loved the store.  </li>
            <li>This is a first quality body butter that smells wonderful and does a great job.  </li>
            <li>Very good fragrance and smooth and buttery.</li>
            <li>This absorbs great in your skin and doesnt just sit on top.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Much better and cheaper than BodyShop body butter!</li>
            <li>But I wish they&#x27;d come out with more permanent scents of this body butter!</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite body lotions (creams) of all times!</li>

            <li>I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>The packaging is nice because it has a flip top lid!</li>
            <li>There are more positives:  1) GREAT PRICE (4.99 at TJ&#x27;s) 2) not greasy  3) smells great, not a fake scent!</li>
            <li>I give it five starts because the product itself is amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>the smell is amazing. ..</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic, feels great.  </li>
            <li>Nice cream.....</li>
            <li>flip up lid is handy - no need to screw it on or off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t greasy and soaks it nicely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and it feels nice.  </li>
            <li>Coworkers seek it out on my desk, its that nice.</li>
            <li>I opened the very handy flip top lid, I thought the smell was too good to be true.</li>
            <li>(I also wash my hands a lot) but for the price this is nice and just as good or better than ones that cost twice the price (or more).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read and heard so many wonderful reviews on this body butter that I really wanted to try it.</li>
            <li>My legs feel so soft, this product reminds me of summer, smells great!</li>
            <li>I love the warm, tropical, coconut scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have started to use it as a moisturizer on my hands and legs before going to bed and I am very happy with how soft and supple my skin is in the morning.</li>
            <li>It is a good moisturiser and it nourishes the skin, leaving it smooth and supple.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to people who enjoy a good cream.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best body butter I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Love, love ,love this stuff!</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful, rich body butter that seems to really benefit your skin.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how quickly this came!!</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even gotten it for 2.99 on occasion when it&#x27;s on &amp;#34;sale&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;The wickedness of the folks on amazon and ebay are over the top.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>and I love it on her....</li>
            <li>I love, love, LOVE this body butter.  </li>
            <li>love that the body butter tub has a flip top instead of just a screw on lid.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and texture.  </li>
            <li>If you like the smell of coconut, you will love this product.</li>
            <li>so no worries touching my face with my hands.</li>
            <li>This is my family&#x27;s favorite lotion/body butter.</li>
            <li>If I use a pumice stone and then put this on before bed, my feet feel so much better in the morning.</li>
            <li>smell after a minute of initial wonderful coconut aroma - smells like...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think there is a way to make this stuff better.</li>
            <li>I would return this item, but shipping and everything would just be more of a hassle.</li>
            <li>Love this body butter.  </li>
            <li>and I so love it.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t hesitate to buy this.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s about $5 in a Trader Joe&#x27;s store, but we don&#x27;t have one in my area, so this was the next best thing.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried many.</li>
            <li>Smells more like yogurt than coconut to me, though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this cream makes my skin feel silky and</li>
            <li>We love this body butter.</li>
            <li>Ok, for those of you who do not have a Trader Joes in the area, I suppose this is an ok price, but you can get it at the store for about $8.00.  </li>
            <li>Amazon was a better choice than driving 80 miles to the closest Trader Joe&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Love this fragrence.  </li>
            <li>just okay.  </li>
            <li>TD&#x27;s is an okay alternative.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;works better than ANY lotion I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>You will love the smell and the look of your radiant skin.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li>love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering and it gives you that beach scent that I love.</li>
            <li>love Amazon but for the price listed here, I can literally get two at Trader Joe&#x27;s as I paid $4.99 for one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love love love this lotion.</li>
            <li>It has a wonderful coconut smell that last threw the day.  </li>
            <li>They love the product, used the product all the time.  </li>
            <li>My favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I think The Body Shop coconut body butter has much better coconut smell</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cruelty free!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad so many agree with me</li>
            <li>love this product...</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and feel</li>
            <li>It has an interesting flip top lid.</li>
            <li>you are looking for a great body or hand lotion in a pump bottle, I highly recommend Avalon Organics, esp.</li>
            <li>The price is great also for a more natural product.</li>
            <li>The best thing for dry skin that I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I just wanted to rattle off my distaste for the way the world is becoming.</li>
            <li>Lovely, silky smooth.</li>
            <li>and it spreads more evenly and smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I loved it so much that I bought three of them.</li>
            <li>It smells good and works good to moisturize my dry skin.</li>
            <li>Easy to access.</li>
            <li>It slides on the skin making massaging easy and relaxing.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t strong or overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Trying to buy more natural beauty items, good buy.</li>
            <li>but the coconut smell is strong.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It feels so luxurious and lovely to the touch and has a sweet, coconut smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The coconut butter has a mild smell and works well!</li>
            <li>It arrived promptly thanks to Prime Shipping, and I love it!</li>
            <li>If we run out and don&#x27;t get another one for a week or two we notice a huge difference in our skin.</li>
            <li>It smells really delicious, and lingers for a few hours.</li>
            <li>Makes skin smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy both the texture and the smell of this.</li>
            <li>It is smooth and spreads well.</li>
            <li>Light smell</li>
            <li>stuff is smooth, but not overly oily or greasy.  </li>
            <li>And it is such a great deal.</li>
            <li>people are always complimenting me on how great I smell.. will be buying this regularly</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin feeling smooth and hydrated all day.</li>
            <li>My hands and cuticles feel silky smooth</li>
            <li>Right after putting it on, I was able to put my stockings on with no problem at all.</li>
            <li>However, I do think this is a nice product and the anti-greasy texture is HIGHLY recommended.</li>
            <li>that was 100% clean coconut smell.  </li>
            <li>I use only this (body)&amp; Watts Beauty Argan Gold oil(face) on my 54 year old gorgeous skin!!</li>
            <li>The coconut helps keep me smelling clean at all times</li>
            <li>I love using it right after the shower and fresh shaved legs.</li>
            <li>Absorbs better than pure coconut oil and like the packaging.  </li>
            <li>My husband really likes it, too. :)</li>
            <li>I heard from a friend about all sorts of cool stuff</li>
            <li>And recommend to anyone looking for a very luxurious body butter on the cheap!</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it absorbs into my skin really quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I immediately put some of the body butter on my dry skin and loved the way it soaked in and has left my skin so nice!</li>
            <li>The coconut body butter has a strong scent when you first apply it.  </li>
            <li>Ok guys, here&#x27;s the deal: If you find yourself in trouble, want to score &#x27;nice guy&#x27; points, want some peace and quiet, or just want to make your lady happy, this is the stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a calm, sweet, and clean sent all in one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a lotion fanatic and this is my FAVORITE!!!</li>
            <li>love that the ingredients are all natural and that the product is cruelty free.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is for sure my new favorite butter in particular for my hands.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found it here on Amazon since I don&#x27;t live close to a Trader Joes.</li>
            <li>It is absorbed quickly and is not greasy.  </li>
            <li>It makes us better people, who can easily be respected if we actually do the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; thing.</li>
            <li>It is a very rich creamy product with a very natural coconut smell.</li>
            <li>I needed a good body cream for my very dry skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to see that I can get it from Amazon if I were unable to go to TJ&#x27;s, and I suppose the higher price wouldn&#x27;t be an issue with free shipping (prime members)&amp; with gas prices being what they are, this is a good option!</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;-Price: This is cheaper at Trader Joe&#x27;s, but even at the Amazon price I would say it&#x27;s definitely worth</li>
            <li>She showed me how easily it took her makeup off, cleared up her face, and made her skin soft and clean feeling.</li>
            <li>Well, it was well worth it.</li>
            <li>Definately worth the money.</li>
            <li>The texture is perfect - very creamy, thick but spreadable - and not at all greasy.</li>
            <li>I have 40 year old skin and LOVE this.  </li>
            <li>The price of this was worth it.</li>
            <li>The smell is pure rich coconut.</li>
            <li>If you are selling it on here to folks who live no where near a TJ&#x27;s I can see marking it up a couple dollars, to make a fair and reasonable profit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a serviceable, cheap body butter with a decent ingredient</li>
            <li>This $10.99 was by far the most reasonable price on here yet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great and easier to use especially mid-application and trying to screw the lid back on with body butter all over your hands.</li>
            <li>The scent is fabulous and skin feels so soft and moisturized!  </li>
            <li>It is not greasy and absorbs very fast.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not super strong or overwhelming.</li>
            <li>This stuff is not only cheaper, it&#x27;s BETTER.</li>
            <li>Use it daily and love it.  </li>
            <li>I love the flip up lid, as is easier to open and close.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am in awe of how much this has helped my son!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This smells like natural coconut, without a perfume&#x27;y scent, which is important to me.</li>
            <li>I insist on mostly natural products for skin lotions, as I feel it&#x27;s important to our health.  </li>
            <li>I first heard about it via a Youtube channel I subscribe to</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>I thought I would give this a try first.</li>
            <li>It works great on your dry spots and sinks in quickly without ruining your clothes.</li>
            <li>However I am lucky again to live in San Francisco.</li>
            <li>I picked it up this weekend at my local Trader Joe&#x27;s, and let me tell you, I was not disappointed at all!</li>
            <li>Makes my skin super soft!</li>
            <li>The staff is extremely friendly and I came across a few more items then planned</li>
            <li>The consistency is VERY creamy and thick, but what&#x27;s amazing about this product is that it soaks RIGHT into your skin unbelievably quickly.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Coconut Body Butter, but this specific brand is definitely of high and pure quality.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin and have tried so many products.</li>
            <li>I also love Amazon, but... if you live close enough to shop at Trader Joe&#x27;s, then do so when purchasing this coconut body butter.</li>
            <li>this straight up smells like pure coconut.</li>
            <li>Really folks</li>
            <li>I recommended this to my family members, and they really like it as well.</li>
            <li>I rate the product 4-5 stars because I really like it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>My son has very severe eczema</li>
            <li>really moisturize well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product before and really like it.  </li>
            <li>but this is much nicer.  </li>
            <li>but really like the quality.</li>
            <li>It smells like coconut oil and is very moisturizing without being tacky.</li>
            <li>So those of you paying almost 30 bucks for one of these, may have the same kind of house, same specs, and be paying 900 a month.</li>
            <li>Thick and smells good.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this lotion, it is so soft and whipped, it sinks right into the skin.</li>
            <li>: The list of ingredients is better than any body butter I&#x27;ve picked up at other stores.</li>
            <li>I have had much better Body Butters from other companies.</li>
            <li>I have a badly damaged leg that requires extra moisturizing on the area with skin grafts, and this body butter feels great on that area, and left it feeling nice and smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I liked this better than some much more expensive brands (think Italian or American Company that thinks their stuff smells like frosting).  </li>
            <li>Since I don&#x27;t live close to a Trader Joe&#x27;s, the price seems reasonable for the item, considering how much it costs to ship things these days.</li>
            <li>Even give it out as gifts, but be aware that it is $4.99 direct from TraderJoes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is mainly coconut with a hint of a vanilla-marshmallow scent to my nose.</li>
            <li>More expensive than Trader Joe, but more convenient.  </li>
            <li>I  bought this product mainly because I wanted something with that coconut scent to bring with me on my cruise.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I use it daily and it absorbs fast and makes my skin super soft.</li>
            <li>The quality of natural ingredients are way better for you then alot of other brands you find.</li>
            <li>I will suggest you to buy directly from Trader Joe&#x27;s store,at much cheaper price.</li>
            <li>We then made a few more stops, went to ikea for 3 hours, washed our hands 3 times.</li>
            <li>Thanks for reading, and go with the cheapest on here if you don&#x27;t live anywhere near a TJ&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased the same size same exact product from Trader Joe&#x27;s (of which I&#x27;m lucky to have three in the town where I live) for 4.59 per item.</li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend this or any other coconut product to help with these types of skin conditions!</li>
            <li>It seems to leave her skin smooth, but the bathroom looks like a refugee camp for all sorts of body lotions and hair spray and other &#x27;chick stuff&#x27; that it could be something else.  </li>
            <li>You have to apply a little more for complete coverage.  </li>
            <li>I did notice a little grit, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s from the natural ingredients</li>
            <li>I wish we would get a trader Joe&#x27;s where I live.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>a trader Joe&#x27;s anywhere closer than a 3 hour round trip drive, I&#x27;m fine paying a few bucks more for it here.  </li>
            <li>This is a thick and luxurious, creamy, sweet smelling super hydrating body butter.</li>
            <li>Buying my refills at TJ&#x27;s directly from now on!</li>
            <li>/&gt;After applying it to my skin, I find that my skin is supple and soft to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love trader joes!</li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t have a Trader Joe&#x27;s near where I live</li>
            <li>Little bit sticky for use as massage oil as it seems to like to get absorbed quite fast.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t bother me</li>
            <li>Smells like heaven and makes you so soft.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin hydrated and soft.  </li>
            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t recommend this item enough, however do try to purchase it from an actual Trader Joe&#x27;s store as it is much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is such a reasonable body butter for the price.</li>
            <li>It definitly smells like coconut and makes my skin soft.  </li>
            <li>So far, I don&#x27;t care for Trader Joe products and would not purchase again.</li>
            <li>However it is cheaper to buy directly from Trader Joe&#x27;s for $4.99.</li>
            <li>but so far I&#x27;m liking it.</li>
            <li>others have noted, it&#x27;s much cheaper if purchased from your local TJ&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I was really surprised.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell fake coconut, it has a nice coconut cupcake smell and really absorbs into the sink.</li>
            <li>It seriously does not feel like a cheap product, it feels like a $50 one!</li>
            <li>The only real issue that I see with this product is that it&#x27;s not quite as long term moisturizing as I would prefer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as greasy feeling as the pure shea butter body butters that I&#x27;ve bought from other sellers</li>
            <li>, it is super hydrating not greasy at all, and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>you live near a Trader Joe&#x27;s, you can buy this for about half the price</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for a good coconut smelling product.  </li>
            <li> but, I always loved the store.  </li>
            <li> This is a first quality body butter that smells wonderful and does a great job.  </li>
            <li> Very good fragrance and smooth and buttery.</li>
            <li> This absorbs great in your skin and doesnt just sit on top.</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Much better and cheaper than BodyShop body butter!</li>
            <li> But I wish they&#x27;d come out with more permanent scents of this body butter!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite body lotions (creams) of all times!</li>

            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> The packaging is nice because it has a flip top lid!</li>
            <li> There are more positives:  1) GREAT PRICE (4.99 at TJ&#x27;s) 2) not greasy  3) smells great, not a fake scent!</li>
            <li> I give it five starts because the product itself is amazing.</li>

            <li> the smell is amazing. ..</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic, feels great.  </li>
            <li> Nice cream.....</li>
            <li> flip up lid is handy - no need to screw it on or off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t greasy and soaks it nicely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy and it feels nice.  </li>
            <li> Coworkers seek it out on my desk, its that nice.</li>
            <li> I opened the very handy flip top lid, I thought the smell was too good to be true.</li>
            <li> (I also wash my hands a lot) but for the price this is nice and just as good or better than ones that cost twice the price (or more).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read and heard so many wonderful reviews on this body butter that I really wanted to try it.</li>
            <li> My legs feel so soft, this product reminds me of summer, smells great!</li>
            <li> I love the warm, tropical, coconut scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have started to use it as a moisturizer on my hands and legs before going to bed and I am very happy with how soft and supple my skin is in the morning.</li>
            <li> It is a good moisturiser and it nourishes the skin, leaving it smooth and supple.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to people who enjoy a good cream.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best body butter I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Love, love ,love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful, rich body butter that seems to really benefit your skin.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how quickly this came!!</li>
            <li> Love the smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even gotten it for 2.99 on occasion when it&#x27;s on &amp;#34;sale&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;The wickedness of the folks on amazon and ebay are over the top.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> and I love it on her....</li>
            <li> I love, love, LOVE this body butter.  </li>
            <li> love that the body butter tub has a flip top instead of just a screw on lid.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and texture.  </li>
            <li> If you like the smell of coconut, you will love this product.</li>
            <li> so no worries touching my face with my hands.</li>
            <li> This is my family&#x27;s favorite lotion/body butter.</li>
            <li> If I use a pumice stone and then put this on before bed, my feet feel so much better in the morning.</li>
            <li> smell after a minute of initial wonderful coconut aroma - smells like...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there is a way to make this stuff better.</li>
            <li> I would return this item, but shipping and everything would just be more of a hassle.</li>
            <li> Love this body butter.  </li>
            <li> and I so love it.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t hesitate to buy this.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s about $5 in a Trader Joe&#x27;s store, but we don&#x27;t have one in my area, so this was the next best thing.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried many.</li>
            <li> Smells more like yogurt than coconut to me, though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this cream makes my skin feel silky and</li>
            <li> We love this body butter.</li>
            <li> Ok, for those of you who do not have a Trader Joes in the area, I suppose this is an ok price, but you can get it at the store for about $8.00.  </li>
            <li> Amazon was a better choice than driving 80 miles to the closest Trader Joe&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrence.  </li>
            <li> just okay.  </li>
            <li> TD&#x27;s is an okay alternative.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;works better than ANY lotion I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> You will love the smell and the look of your radiant skin.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li> love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering and it gives you that beach scent that I love.</li>
            <li> love Amazon but for the price listed here, I can literally get two at Trader Joe&#x27;s as I paid $4.99 for one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love love love this lotion.</li>
            <li> It has a wonderful coconut smell that last threw the day.  </li>
            <li> They love the product, used the product all the time.  </li>
            <li> My favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I think The Body Shop coconut body butter has much better coconut smell</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cruelty free!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad so many agree with me</li>
            <li> love this product...</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and feel</li>
            <li> It has an interesting flip top lid.</li>
            <li> you are looking for a great body or hand lotion in a pump bottle, I highly recommend Avalon Organics, esp.</li>
            <li> The price is great also for a more natural product.</li>
            <li> The best thing for dry skin that I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I just wanted to rattle off my distaste for the way the world is becoming.</li>
            <li> Lovely, silky smooth.</li>
            <li> and it spreads more evenly and smoothly.  </li>
            <li> I loved it so much that I bought three of them.</li>
            <li> It smells good and works good to moisturize my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Easy to access.</li>
            <li> It slides on the skin making massaging easy and relaxing.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t strong or overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Trying to buy more natural beauty items, good buy.</li>
            <li> but the coconut smell is strong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It feels so luxurious and lovely to the touch and has a sweet, coconut smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The coconut butter has a mild smell and works well!</li>
            <li> It arrived promptly thanks to Prime Shipping, and I love it!</li>
            <li> If we run out and don&#x27;t get another one for a week or two we notice a huge difference in our skin.</li>
            <li> It smells really delicious, and lingers for a few hours.</li>
            <li> Makes skin smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy both the texture and the smell of this.</li>
            <li> It is smooth and spreads well.</li>
            <li> Light smell</li>
            <li> stuff is smooth, but not overly oily or greasy.  </li>
            <li> And it is such a great deal.</li>
            <li> people are always complimenting me on how great I smell.. will be buying this regularly</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin feeling smooth and hydrated all day.</li>
            <li> My hands and cuticles feel silky smooth</li>
            <li> Right after putting it on, I was able to put my stockings on with no problem at all.</li>
            <li> However, I do think this is a nice product and the anti-greasy texture is HIGHLY recommended.</li>
            <li> that was 100% clean coconut smell.  </li>
            <li> I use only this (body)&amp; Watts Beauty Argan Gold oil(face) on my 54 year old gorgeous skin!!</li>
            <li> The coconut helps keep me smelling clean at all times</li>
            <li> I love using it right after the shower and fresh shaved legs.</li>
            <li> Absorbs better than pure coconut oil and like the packaging.  </li>
            <li> My husband really likes it, too. :)</li>
            <li> I heard from a friend about all sorts of cool stuff</li>
            <li> And recommend to anyone looking for a very luxurious body butter on the cheap!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it absorbs into my skin really quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I immediately put some of the body butter on my dry skin and loved the way it soaked in and has left my skin so nice!</li>
            <li> The coconut body butter has a strong scent when you first apply it.  </li>
            <li> Ok guys, here&#x27;s the deal: If you find yourself in trouble, want to score &#x27;nice guy&#x27; points, want some peace and quiet, or just want to make your lady happy, this is the stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a calm, sweet, and clean sent all in one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lotion fanatic and this is my FAVORITE!!!</li>
            <li> love that the ingredients are all natural and that the product is cruelty free.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is for sure my new favorite butter in particular for my hands.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found it here on Amazon since I don&#x27;t live close to a Trader Joes.</li>
            <li> It is absorbed quickly and is not greasy.  </li>
            <li> It makes us better people, who can easily be respected if we actually do the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; thing.</li>
            <li> It is a very rich creamy product with a very natural coconut smell.</li>
            <li> I needed a good body cream for my very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to see that I can get it from Amazon if I were unable to go to TJ&#x27;s, and I suppose the higher price wouldn&#x27;t be an issue with free shipping (prime members)&amp; with gas prices being what they are, this is a good option!</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;-Price: This is cheaper at Trader Joe&#x27;s, but even at the Amazon price I would say it&#x27;s definitely worth</li>
            <li> She showed me how easily it took her makeup off, cleared up her face, and made her skin soft and clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Well, it was well worth it.</li>
            <li> Definately worth the money.</li>
            <li> The texture is perfect - very creamy, thick but spreadable - and not at all greasy.</li>
            <li> I have 40 year old skin and LOVE this.  </li>
            <li> The price of this was worth it.</li>
            <li> The smell is pure rich coconut.</li>
            <li> If you are selling it on here to folks who live no where near a TJ&#x27;s I can see marking it up a couple dollars, to make a fair and reasonable profit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a serviceable, cheap body butter with a decent ingredient</li>
            <li> This $10.99 was by far the most reasonable price on here yet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great and easier to use especially mid-application and trying to screw the lid back on with body butter all over your hands.</li>
            <li> The scent is fabulous and skin feels so soft and moisturized!  </li>
            <li> It is not greasy and absorbs very fast.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super strong or overwhelming.</li>
            <li> This stuff is not only cheaper, it&#x27;s BETTER.</li>
            <li> Use it daily and love it.  </li>
            <li> I love the flip up lid, as is easier to open and close.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am in awe of how much this has helped my son!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This smells like natural coconut, without a perfume&#x27;y scent, which is important to me.</li>
            <li> I insist on mostly natural products for skin lotions, as I feel it&#x27;s important to our health.  </li>
            <li> I first heard about it via a Youtube channel I subscribe to</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> I thought I would give this a try first.</li>
            <li> It works great on your dry spots and sinks in quickly without ruining your clothes.</li>
            <li> However I am lucky again to live in San Francisco.</li>
            <li> I picked it up this weekend at my local Trader Joe&#x27;s, and let me tell you, I was not disappointed at all!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin super soft!</li>
            <li> The staff is extremely friendly and I came across a few more items then planned</li>
            <li> The consistency is VERY creamy and thick, but what&#x27;s amazing about this product is that it soaks RIGHT into your skin unbelievably quickly.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Coconut Body Butter, but this specific brand is definitely of high and pure quality.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and have tried so many products.</li>
            <li> I also love Amazon, but... if you live close enough to shop at Trader Joe&#x27;s, then do so when purchasing this coconut body butter.</li>
            <li> this straight up smells like pure coconut.</li>
            <li> Really folks</li>
            <li> I recommended this to my family members, and they really like it as well.</li>
            <li> I rate the product 4-5 stars because I really like it</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My son has very severe eczema</li>
            <li> really moisturize well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and really like it.  </li>
            <li> but this is much nicer.  </li>
            <li> but really like the quality.</li>
            <li> It smells like coconut oil and is very moisturizing without being tacky.</li>
            <li> So those of you paying almost 30 bucks for one of these, may have the same kind of house, same specs, and be paying 900 a month.</li>
            <li> Thick and smells good.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion, it is so soft and whipped, it sinks right into the skin.</li>
            <li> : The list of ingredients is better than any body butter I&#x27;ve picked up at other stores.</li>
            <li> I have had much better Body Butters from other companies.</li>
            <li> I have a badly damaged leg that requires extra moisturizing on the area with skin grafts, and this body butter feels great on that area, and left it feeling nice and smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I liked this better than some much more expensive brands (think Italian or American Company that thinks their stuff smells like frosting).  </li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t live close to a Trader Joe&#x27;s, the price seems reasonable for the item, considering how much it costs to ship things these days.</li>
            <li> Even give it out as gifts, but be aware that it is $4.99 direct from TraderJoes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is mainly coconut with a hint of a vanilla-marshmallow scent to my nose.</li>
            <li> More expensive than Trader Joe, but more convenient.  </li>
            <li> I  bought this product mainly because I wanted something with that coconut scent to bring with me on my cruise.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I use it daily and it absorbs fast and makes my skin super soft.</li>
            <li> The quality of natural ingredients are way better for you then alot of other brands you find.</li>
            <li> I will suggest you to buy directly from Trader Joe&#x27;s store,at much cheaper price.</li>
            <li> We then made a few more stops, went to ikea for 3 hours, washed our hands 3 times.</li>
            <li> Thanks for reading, and go with the cheapest on here if you don&#x27;t live anywhere near a TJ&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased the same size same exact product from Trader Joe&#x27;s (of which I&#x27;m lucky to have three in the town where I live) for 4.59 per item.</li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend this or any other coconut product to help with these types of skin conditions!</li>
            <li> It seems to leave her skin smooth, but the bathroom looks like a refugee camp for all sorts of body lotions and hair spray and other &#x27;chick stuff&#x27; that it could be something else.  </li>
            <li> You have to apply a little more for complete coverage.  </li>
            <li> I did notice a little grit, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s from the natural ingredients</li>
            <li> I wish we would get a trader Joe&#x27;s where I live.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> a trader Joe&#x27;s anywhere closer than a 3 hour round trip drive, I&#x27;m fine paying a few bucks more for it here.  </li>
            <li> This is a thick and luxurious, creamy, sweet smelling super hydrating body butter.</li>
            <li> Buying my refills at TJ&#x27;s directly from now on!</li>
            <li> /&gt;After applying it to my skin, I find that my skin is supple and soft to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love trader joes!</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t have a Trader Joe&#x27;s near where I live</li>
            <li> Little bit sticky for use as massage oil as it seems to like to get absorbed quite fast.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t bother me</li>
            <li> Smells like heaven and makes you so soft.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin hydrated and soft.  </li>
            <li> I really couldn&#x27;t recommend this item enough, however do try to purchase it from an actual Trader Joe&#x27;s store as it is much cheaper.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is such a reasonable body butter for the price.</li>
            <li> It definitly smells like coconut and makes my skin soft.  </li>
            <li> So far, I don&#x27;t care for Trader Joe products and would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> However it is cheaper to buy directly from Trader Joe&#x27;s for $4.99.</li>
            <li> but so far I&#x27;m liking it.</li>
            <li> others have noted, it&#x27;s much cheaper if purchased from your local TJ&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I was really surprised.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell fake coconut, it has a nice coconut cupcake smell and really absorbs into the sink.</li>
            <li> It seriously does not feel like a cheap product, it feels like a $50 one!</li>
            <li> The only real issue that I see with this product is that it&#x27;s not quite as long term moisturizing as I would prefer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as greasy feeling as the pure shea butter body butters that I&#x27;ve bought from other sellers</li>
            <li> , it is super hydrating not greasy at all, and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> you live near a Trader Joe&#x27;s, you can buy this for about half the price</li>
            <li> The lotion is thick and creamy and blends right into the skin.</li>
            <li> Another really nice thing about it is that it has a flip lid rather than a screw off lid, which can be difficult to maneuver if your hands are covered in lotion!  </li>
            <li> Long lasting too.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this long enough to determine if it will be beneficial</li>
            <li> I use this especially in the winter, and now I have no traces of rash on my hands, dry skin, or eczema.  </li>
            <li> Not only does the scent of coconut smell yummy , but the thick body butter is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> With really dry skin especially in the winter, I have to reapply a lot all day long</li>
            <li> She&#x27;ll probably start off gabbing, but then she&#x27;ll slow down, her eyelids will get heavy, and she&#x27;ll ease into a blissful sleep, giving you some guy time to go put more chrome doodads on your motorcycle....</li>
            <li> BUT, if you can&#x27;t go to a Trader Joe&#x27;s, 12$ still isn&#x27;t a bad price for really decent body butter (much better than any other body butter/lotion/cream that I&#x27;ve ever tried).</li>
            <li> I have very dry winter skin and was hoping to relieve my itchiness, but about 2-3 hours later, I am itchy again.</li>
            <li> Lasts long time.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not too cloying and doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy residue yet remains on the skin and helps retain the bodies natural moisture.  </li>
            <li> It goes on very thick, but soaks right into your skin.  </li>
            <li> This is the third time I have re-ordered it and gave away all my other body creams.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase again and would try their other versions too.</li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing, and creamy and the scent is subtle but lasts ALL day.</li>
            <li> I use this on dry spots like knees and elbows and everywhere else.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it would smell too much like coconut which I don&#x27;t really like (think suntan lotion)</li>
            <li> However the body butter helps my itch, dry legs.</li>
            <li> So far there is amazingly little scarring!</li>
            <li> I mean, really, when does that happen with other lotions???  </li>
            <li> In the winter months, my skin on my hands gets very dry and is prone to eczema.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is that you have to reaply it after a few hours.  </li>
            <li> I use it for my feet which get rough and calloused.</li>
            <li> Way before expected...</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;-Results:</li>
            <li> I wish this came in other scents.</li>
            <li> This isnt that foody like some other coconut scents</li>
            <li> The other thing I use it for is complimenting my TJ&#x27;s non-aluminum deodorant when I go to the gym that my cloths no longer smell sweaty.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a thick but fluffy whipped texture that melts into your skin and leaves you soft and feeling pampered.</li>
            <li> If you are a die hard coconut fan, definitely give this a try.  </li>
            <li> Sour smelling lotion.</li>
            <li> its just like a thick generic cream,</li>
            <li> I adore the smell as well, a little like coconut birthday cake.</li>
            <li> Little details like these are what make a product</li>
            <li> I wish it was a little stonger scented.</li>
            <li> so I dab a little under my arms each day.</li>
            <li> I am used to using coconut oil as a moisturizer anyway, so I add a few drops with the butter.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I always buy a few at a time.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a few highlights:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After landing on a steroid cream with harmful side effects as our doctor&#x27;s solution, I decided to try going an all natural route and ditch the expensive prescriptions.</li>
            <li> It does seem to be making my keratosis pilaris bumps on my arms worse though - possibly from the coconut oil which can be comedogenic.</li>
            <li> Buys ever few months.</li>
            <li> It is less expensive at an actual Trader Joes.</li>
            <li> The greed of the evil people selling it on here is astonishing.</li>
            <li> I usually like the Hemp Body Butter from The Body Shop, but was shopping at TJ&#x27;s and found this while looking for a birthday gift for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Not sure of the company that  makes it</li>
            <li> We have never found any other product that he could use that would get him off steroids without having major painful breakouts.</li>
            <li> I have nummular eczema that typically responds poorly to all creams/lotions that are not prescription.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to explain.  </li>
            <li> : This is a very thick, heavy body butter.</li>
            <li> The consistency is thick but not as creamy as I&#x27;m used to.  </li>
            <li> My sister and I put a very small dab on our hands at about 1:30.</li>
            <li> This gets one star not because of the product but because of the ridiculous markup of said product.  </li>
            <li> a little scoop, smear it on your hands so she doesn&#x27;t get shocked from the cold, and rub her feet, hands, back, or whatever.  </li>
            <li> This is very thick and non greasy or your skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but this was so awful</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s saying a lot since my mom usually buys very expensive products</li>
            <li> Evil is actually a word that comes to mind.</li>
            <li> BOY WAS I WRONG.</li>
            <li> Expensive online....</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this body lotion.</li>
            <li> Smells like expensive cake frosting!  </li>
            <li> I figured that meant something else had to be very wrong with it.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not that fake smell that we all grow to hate.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed with Trader Joe&#x27;s Coconut Body Butter &amp; for anyone who cares, like I do..</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The coconut body butter has a strong scent when you first apply it.  It is milder as the day goes on.  The consistency is thick but not as creamy as I&#x27;m used to.  You have to apply a little more for complete coverage.  I am used to using coconut oil as a moisturizer anyway, so I add a few drops with the butter.</li>
            <li> Absorbs better than pure coconut oil and like the packaging.  Easy to access.</li>
            <li> I had been using coconut body butter from The Body Shop. Well that stuff is pricey so I started looking for an alternative. I saw the great reviews on Trader Joes Body Butter and decided to give it a try. This stuff is not only cheaper, it&#x27;s BETTER. I use it every time I get out of the shower. The scent is so yummy, like a mix of coconuts and marshmellows. My husband really likes it, too. :)</li>
            <li> luxurious in every way. I use it daily and it absorbs fast and makes my skin super soft. Love the smell. I have extremely sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t bother me</li>
            <li> Now! I give it five starts because the product itself is amazing. The greed of the evil people selling it on here is astonishing. I&#x27;ve purchased the same size same exact product from Trader Joe&#x27;s (of which I&#x27;m lucky to have three in the town where I live) for 4.59 per item. I&#x27;ve even gotten it for 2.99 on occasion when it&#x27;s on &amp;#34;sale&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;The wickedness of the folks on amazon and ebay are over the top. Karma is a word for a reason, it&#x27;s something to be followed. It makes us better people, who can easily be respected if we actually do the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; thing. If you are selling it on here to folks who live no where near a TJ&#x27;s I can see marking it up a couple dollars, to make a fair and reasonable profit. This $10.99 was by far the most reasonable price on here yet. I am even seeing some jerks trying to get close to 30 dollars for one of these great items. That&#x27;s just highway robbery. Evil is actually a word that comes to mind. Really folks it&#x27;s a great product. I use it everyday. However I am lucky again to live in San Francisco. I guess it somehow works out a bit in the laundry. As my 2 bed 2 bath 1200 square foot house i&#x27;m renting, with no backyard, and only one car garage is $3,500 a month. So those of you paying almost 30 bucks for one of these, may have the same kind of house, same specs, and be paying 900 a month. Anyway, I just wanted to rattle off my distaste for the way the world is becoming. Thanks for reading, and go with the cheapest on here if you don&#x27;t live anywhere near a TJ&#x27;s. Happy Thanksgiving!</li>
            <li> Excellent relief for my eczema!&lt;br /&gt; In the winter months, my skin on my hands gets very dry and is prone to eczema.  When I apply this body butter, it calms, moisturizes.  It is not greasy and absorbs very fast.  I use this especially in the winter, and now I have no traces of rash on my hands, dry skin, or eczema.  This body butter sells around five dollars at Trader Joe.  My rating for this cream is absolutely above five stars for the relief it has given me!</li>
            <li> I would give this 100 stars. Smells like heaven and makes you so soft. I&#x27;m a lotion fanatic and this is my FAVORITE!!! I WILL BUY AGAIN AND AGAIN</li>
            <li> I love this product! Even give it out as gifts, but be aware that it is $4.99 direct from TraderJoes. Much better and cheaper than BodyShop body butter!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion, it is so soft and whipped, it sinks right into the skin. I adore the smell as well, a little like coconut birthday cake. I loved it so much that I bought three of them. I am so glad I found it here on Amazon since I don&#x27;t live close to a Trader Joes.</li>
            <li> I use this day and night.  It is amazing!  It keeps my skin hydrated and soft.  I recommended this to my family members, and they really like it as well.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff.  I use it all the time!  It is so buttery and moisturizing.  I wish it came in different scents.  I do buy at trader joes where it is like 4.99. I always buy a few at a time.</li>
            <li> Use it daily and love it.  Not greasy or filmy.</li>
            <li> This is truly a great product. It&#x27;s creamy on the skin and moisturizing! Never oily and smells so good, just like you would imagine cocoanut milk to smell. I rate the product 4-5 stars because I really like it but it&#x27;s grossly over priced at 12.99 that&#x27;s alot. I bought some from trader joes for 4.99 so if u can I suggest u buy it there.</li>
            <li> I love the product but was pretty disappointed to see that someone is buying up the body butter and selling it at double the price of Trader Joe&#x27;s!  Buying my refills at TJ&#x27;s directly from now on!</li>
            <li> Love, love ,love this stuff!</li>
            <li> again....she loves it....and I love it on her....we&#x27;re all good here.</li>
            <li> My package just came, and I am delighted! I immediately put some of the body butter on my dry skin and loved the way it soaked in and has left my skin so nice! I have a badly damaged leg that requires extra moisturizing on the area with skin grafts, and this body butter feels great on that area, and left it feeling nice and smooth and moisturized. The pleasant scent is a plus! Since I don&#x27;t live close to a Trader Joe&#x27;s, the price seems reasonable for the item, considering how much it costs to ship things these days. I love the flip up lid, as is easier to open and close.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely will keep using this body butter.</li>
            <li> Nice cream.....just not too happy with the scent.</li>
            <li> Using through my pregnancy instead of coco butter because I cannot tolerate the smell of coco butter.  The coconut butter has a mild smell and works well!</li>
            <li> I love, love, LOVE this body butter.  I have nummular eczema that typically responds poorly to all creams/lotions that are not prescription.  However, the second I put on this body butter I could tell that it was different.  It goes on very thick, but soaks right into your skin.  Instantly my skin feels 10X softer and is not irritated at all.  Plus, the smell is heavenly.  Another really nice thing about it is that it has a flip lid rather than a screw off lid, which can be difficult to maneuver if your hands are covered in lotion!  I really couldn&#x27;t recommend this item enough, however do try to purchase it from an actual Trader Joe&#x27;s store as it is much cheaper.  BUT, if you can&#x27;t go to a Trader Joe&#x27;s, 12$ still isn&#x27;t a bad price for really decent body butter (much better than any other body butter/lotion/cream that I&#x27;ve ever tried).</li>
            <li> My legs feel so soft, this product reminds me of summer, smells great! Lasts long time. Only wish they made bigger</li>
            <li> The texture and scent of this is so good you&#x27;ll probably want to eat it. But don&#x27;t eat it, ok?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a thick but fluffy whipped texture that melts into your skin and leaves you soft and feeling pampered. It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is mainly coconut with a hint of a vanilla-marshmallow scent to my nose. It smells really delicious, and lingers for a few hours. It isn&#x27;t strong or overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that the body butter tub has a flip top instead of just a screw on lid. It&#x27;s great and easier to use especially mid-application and trying to screw the lid back on with body butter all over your hands. Little details like these are what make a product even greater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that the ingredients are all natural and that the product is cruelty free. But I wish they&#x27;d come out with more permanent scents of this body butter! I&#x27;d recommend it to all coconut lovers.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite body lotions (creams) of all times! I absolutely love Coconut Body Butter, but this specific brand is definitely of high and pure quality.</li>
            <li> It smells good and works good to moisturize my dry skin. Trying to buy more natural beauty items, good buy.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product. Goes nice on the skin and the scent of the coconut is great! We will buy this again!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and texture.  Best moisturizer!</li>
            <li> If you like the smell of coconut, you will love this product. Makes skin smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy both the texture and the smell of this. I use it after gardening and washing my hands all day. It feels great , not greasy...so no worries touching my face with my hands. I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This is my family&#x27;s favorite lotion/body butter. We go through about a tub of it a month between 3 of us using it. Everything about it is perfect. Here&#x27;s a few highlights:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Scent: This smells heavenly! I love the warm, tropical, coconut scent.&lt;br /&gt;-Texture: This is a very thick, heavy body butter. It is smooth and spreads well. A little bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;-Results: My daughter and I use it on our feet almost every night. If we run out and don&#x27;t get another one for a week or two we notice a huge difference in our skin. If I use a pumice stone and then put this on before bed, my feet feel so much better in the morning. I&#x27;m doing that a lot since it&#x27;s summer and I&#x27;m walking around barefoot in the grass and sand a lot.&lt;br /&gt;-Ingredients: The list of ingredients is better than any body butter I&#x27;ve picked up at other stores. It&#x27;s an all around wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;-Price: This is cheaper at Trader Joe&#x27;s, but even at the Amazon price I would say it&#x27;s definitely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is such a reasonable body butter for the price. I bought my mom and mother-in-law each a tub of this for Christmas last year and they are both hooked now. That&#x27;s saying a lot since my mom usually buys very expensive products and she&#x27;s officially sold on this. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice. It definitly smells like coconut and makes my skin soft.  Long lasting too.  I use it when I  spray Lollia Imagine edp.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price and quality.  Light smell so it&#x27;s not too cloying and doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy residue yet remains on the skin and helps retain the bodies natural moisture.  I bought it to help a surgical incision heal.  So far there is amazingly little scarring! I have started to use it as a moisturizer on my hands and legs before going to bed and I am very happy with how soft and supple my skin is in the morning.</li>
            <li> Ok guys, here&#x27;s the deal: If you find yourself in trouble, want to score &#x27;nice guy&#x27; points, want some peace and quiet, or just want to make your lady happy, this is the stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take a little scoop, smear it on your hands so she doesn&#x27;t get shocked from the cold, and rub her feet, hands, back, or whatever.  She&#x27;ll probably start off gabbing, but then she&#x27;ll slow down, her eyelids will get heavy, and she&#x27;ll ease into a blissful sleep, giving you some guy time to go put more chrome doodads on your motorcycle....don&#x27;t ask me how I know this.  Whatever, she&#x27;ll get her Quality Time with you, she can brag to her friends about your awesome foot rubs, and your bike will be chromey shiny pretty...Everybody wins!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is smooth, but not overly oily or greasy.  It slides on the skin making massaging easy and relaxing.  It seems to leave her skin smooth, but the bathroom looks like a refugee camp for all sorts of body lotions and hair spray and other &#x27;chick stuff&#x27; that it could be something else.  Either way, she likes it, and that&#x27;s all that counts in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> My son has very severe eczema and we have tried it all for the last 10 years! After landing on a steroid cream with harmful side effects as our doctor&#x27;s solution, I decided to try going an all natural route and ditch the expensive prescriptions. I am in awe of how much this has helped my son! We have never found any other product that he could use that would get him off steroids without having major painful breakouts. I would strongly recommend this or any other coconut product to help with these types of skin conditions! LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this wonderful cream. It smells so wonderful and moisturizes like nothing else I have ever purchased. It&#x27;s really superior to anything I have ever used. If you try it once you will be hooked like I am. This is the third time I have re-ordered it and gave away all my other body creams.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;absorbs quickly&lt;br /&gt;non-greasy&lt;br /&gt;thick&lt;br /&gt;cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;unpleasant smell after a minute of initial wonderful coconut aroma - smells like... tar or something&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t really moisturize well</li>
            <li> I like the consistency of the body butter but the coconut smell is strong. I ended up mixing some essential oil in another scent to decrease the coconut scent. I wish this came in other scents.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the bomb diggity! Smells great, works great. Skin is better than ever!!!</li>
            <li> I usually like the Hemp Body Butter from The Body Shop, but was shopping at TJ&#x27;s and found this while looking for a birthday gift for my daughter. I decided to get one for myself and one for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This smells like natural coconut, without a perfume&#x27;y scent, which is important to me. I insist on mostly natural products for skin lotions, as I feel it&#x27;s important to our health.  The skin is our largest organ and soaks up whatever we put on it.&lt;br /&gt;If you live near a Trader Joe&#x27;s, you can buy this for about half the price there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This absorbs well without leaving a greasy residue. I did notice a little grit, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s from the natural ingredients and it just sloughs off easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flip up lid is handy - no need to screw it on or off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s winter now and this just reminds me of summertime while hydrating nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a great body or hand lotion in a pump bottle, I highly recommend Avalon Organics, esp. the Lavender.</li>
            <li> I heard from a friend about all sorts of cool stuff she&#x27;s been doing with coconut oil. She showed me how easily it took her makeup off, cleared up her face, and made her skin soft and clean feeling. So I decided to do some research. I started out with some refined coconut oil just from Walmart. I tried some things with it but kept reading online that virgin and nonrefined is the best. That lead me to coconut oil from trader joes. I&#x27;ve never been there and it is about an hour and 20 min away from me. So I checked here. I read reviews about it being pricier online but I was going to order it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;This lead me to this body butter. I have dry skin and have tried so many products. But the reviews also said it is way pricier here. For just those two items it would&#x27;ve been $30 and in store $11.&lt;br /&gt;I had nothing to do and decided instead of ordering these two items online for more money, I made the trip to TJ! Well, it was well worth it. The staff is extremely friendly and I came across a few more items then planned on.&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the very handy flip top lid, I thought the smell was too good to be true. I figured that meant something else had to be very wrong with it. BOY WAS I WRONG. It is the perfect texture. It moisturizes without feeling greasy. The smell stays all day! My sister and I put a very small dab on our hands at about 1:30. We then made a few more stops, went to ikea for 3 hours, washed our hands 3 times. And at 8pm, when we got home, OUR HANDS STILL SMELLED GOOD. The smell is obviously a personal opinion, but I can&#x27;t get enough. It&#x27;s not super strong or overwhelming. It&#x27;s a calm, sweet, and clean sent all in one. I don&#x27;t think there is a way to make this stuff better.</li>
            <li> Terrible. Sour smelling lotion. I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but this was so awful, I had to. I would return this item, but shipping and everything would just be more of a hassle. In the trash it goes.</li>
            <li> This gets one star not because of the product but because of the ridiculous markup of said product.  Hell of a markup since this stuff is 4 to 5 bucks in the actual store. Can&#x27;t believe they are trying to rip people off like this....read 4th paragraph.  [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stuff works great but the price from this person....smh&lt;br /&gt;Just go to the store.</li>
            <li> Love this body butter.  The scent is fabulous and skin feels so soft and moisturized!  Second time I have purchased!</li>
            <li> This is the best product ever! Thank you Trader Joes for offering this through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this  Body butter! It is less expensive at an actual Trader Joes. Expensive online....</li>
            <li> Very good fragrance and smooth and buttery.</li>
            <li> My sis sent me some of this body butter and I so love it.  Not having a trader Joe&#x27;s anywhere closer than a 3 hour round trip drive, I&#x27;m fine paying a few bucks more for it here.  I get compliments weekly on how it smells and people want me to let them try it.  I mean, really, when does that happen with other lotions???  It doesn&#x27;t smell fake coconut, it has a nice coconut cupcake smell and really absorbs into the sink.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews before buying and I was really happy when I realized that ALL of the reviews were/are correct. This stuff is amazing. It is very moisturizing, and creamy and the scent is subtle but lasts ALL day. I first heard about it via a Youtube channel I subscribe to and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t hesitate to buy this. Definately worth the money. I know it&#x27;s about $5 in a Trader Joe&#x27;s store, but we don&#x27;t have one in my area, so this was the next best thing.</li>
            <li> Does a great job on my tattoos...smells great too</li>
            <li> This. Smells. Delicious. Like a coconutty dessert! And it is such a great deal. The texture is perfect - very creamy, thick but spreadable - and not at all greasy. The packaging is nice because it has a flip top lid! It does seem to be making my keratosis pilaris bumps on my arms worse though - possibly from the coconut oil which can be comedogenic. So id suggest using it sparingly on arms if you have KP, and sparingly on chest and back areas if you&#x27;re prone to acne. But it&#x27;s great for the tummy and legs, feet, hands etc. even though I can&#x27;t use it all over I WOULD repurchase. And recommend to anyone looking for a very luxurious body butter on the cheap! It seriously does not feel like a cheap product, it feels like a $50 one! Best body butter I&#x27;ve used yet and I&#x27;ve tried many.</li>
            <li> Lovely, silky smooth. Smells more like yogurt than coconut to me, though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this cream makes my skin feel silky and the smell is amazing. .. people are always complimenting me on how great I smell.. will be buying this regularly</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this body lotion. It works great on your dry spots and sinks in quickly without ruining your clothes. The only downside is that you have to reaply it after a few hours.  There are more positives:  1) GREAT PRICE (4.99 at TJ&#x27;s) 2) not greasy  3) smells great, not a fake scent!</li>
            <li> It is a good moisturiser and it nourishes the skin, leaving it smooth and supple. However I am not a fan of its smell. I gave it away to my mum who loves using it.</li>
            <li> More expensive than Trader Joe, but more convenient.  We love this body butter.</li>
            <li> Delicious coconut scent, great moisturizer for after the shower.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely great and the scent is lovely! Just love it!!</li>
            <li> Ok, for those of you who do not have a Trader Joes in the area, I suppose this is an ok price, but you can get it at the store for about $8.00.  The consistency is VERY creamy and thick, but what&#x27;s amazing about this product is that it soaks RIGHT into your skin unbelievably quickly. Right after putting it on, I was able to put my stockings on with no problem at all. The only real issue that I see with this product is that it&#x27;s not quite as long term moisturizing as I would prefer. I have very dry winter skin and was hoping to relieve my itchiness, but about 2-3 hours later, I am itchy again. However, I do think this is a nice product and the anti-greasy texture is HIGHLY recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and really like it.  Amazon was a better choice than driving 80 miles to the closest Trader Joe&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Reminded me of lotion from a dollar store.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrence.  Competitive with The Body Shop.  I will keep this item on&lt;br /&gt;my Wish List.</li>
            <li> just okay.  it does have a coconut scent,but it smells a wee bit like play dough too....i miss Hawaiian tropic coconut after sun cream...that was 100% clean coconut smell.  TD&#x27;s is an okay alternative.</li>
            <li> Thick and smells good. Not greasy but moisturizers . I would recommend to people who enjoy a good cream. Awesome.</li>
            <li> like always good butter</li>
            <li> great product and smells wonderful&lt;br /&gt;works better than ANY lotion I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> The best hand and body cream, very happy with this item and arrived so fast.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best body butter I have ever used. The quality of natural ingredients are way better for you then alot of other brands you find. This is very thick and non greasy or your skin. This absorbs great in your skin and doesnt just sit on top. The smell is pure rich coconut. This isnt that foody like some other coconut scents this straight up smells like pure coconut. It is the best coconut product around. This didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. Keeps my skin feeling smooth and hydrated all day. I just have to apply this once and my skin is flawless feeling and looking through out the day. The price is great also for a more natural product. Head on to trader Joes for this Gem! You will love the smell and the look of your radiant skin. I use this on dry spots like knees and elbows and everywhere else. I love using it right after the shower and fresh shaved legs. My skin is glowing with moisture. I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:moN47MNWI7E9LA]]I use this body butter after I shower every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels so luxurious and lovely to the touch and has a sweet, coconut smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After applying it to my skin, I find that my skin is supple and soft to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love trader joes!</li>
            <li> Too overwhelming, smells like cake icing Yuck!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful, rich body butter that seems to really benefit your skin.  It is absorbed quickly and is not greasy.  My only hit is I wish it was a little stonger scented. I wanted to smell like a coconut!</li>
            <li> I  bought this product mainly because I wanted something with that coconut scent to bring with me on my cruise. It arrived promptly thanks to Prime Shipping, and I love it! The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering and it gives you that beach scent that I love. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read and heard so many wonderful reviews on this body butter that I really wanted to try it. I picked it up this weekend at my local Trader Joe&#x27;s, and let me tell you, I was not disappointed at all! This is a thick and luxurious, creamy, sweet smelling super hydrating body butter. My hands and cuticles feel silky smooth, it is super hydrating not greasy at all, and a little bit goes a long way. I love the fact that it absorbs into my skin really quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Amazon but for the price listed here, I can literally get two at Trader Joe&#x27;s as I paid $4.99 for one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is for sure my new favorite butter in particular for my hands. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic, feels great.  Little bit sticky for use as massage oil as it seems to like to get absorbed quite fast.</li>
            <li> I love love love this lotion. It makes my skin very soft. The lotion is thick and creamy and blends right into the skin. It has a wonderful coconut smell that last threw the day.  The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is the price the lotion is only around $5 at trader joe&#x27;s and double that on line. I wish we would get a trader Joe&#x27;s where I live.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift.  They love the product, used the product all the time.  Buys ever few months.</li>
            <li> The coconut body butter  sold for its scent has no scent whatsoever. its just like a thick generic cream,</li>
            <li> My favorite moisturizer. smells so good it will make you hungry.</li>
            <li> I have had much better Body Butters from other companies. So far, I don&#x27;t care for Trader Joe products and would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Smells like expensive cake frosting!  I liked this better than some much more expensive brands (think Italian or American Company that thinks their stuff smells like frosting).  I was afraid it would smell too much like coconut which I don&#x27;t really like (think suntan lotion) but this is much nicer.  I like the pop up jar because of my arthritis in my fingers.  With really dry skin especially in the winter, I have to reapply a lot all day long (I also wash my hands a lot) but for the price this is nice and just as good or better than ones that cost twice the price (or more).  It&#x27;s not as greasy feeling as the pure shea butter body butters that I&#x27;ve bought from other sellers and it spreads more evenly and smoothly.  Really nice product!</li>
            <li> This is wonderful.  I&#x27;m always looking for a good coconut smelling product.  If you are a die hard coconut fan, definitely give this a try.  I think it smells like whipped coconut (if that&#x27;s possible)  or maybe a buttery coconut.  It&#x27;s hard to explain.  But it&#x27;s not that fake smell that we all grow to hate.  ;)  I have 40 year old skin and LOVE this.  But I did buy it in the summer.  Hopefully, it moisturizes well in the winter.  Something to keep in mind.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Makes my skin super soft!</li>
            <li> I am a coconut lover, but this body butter smells like a mix coconut with burnt rubber. However the body butter helps my itch, dry legs. I think The Body Shop coconut body butter has much better coconut smell and it is around 10 bucks if you get it during sale.</li>
            <li> Love this! However it is cheaper to buy directly from Trader Joe&#x27;s for $4.99.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this long enough to determine if it will be beneficial but so far I&#x27;m liking it. I use it for my feet which get rough and calloused. It isn&#x27;t greasy and soaks it nicely. We don&#x27;t have a Trader Joe&#x27;s near where I live so I was happy to find this item on Amazon as it had been recommended by a blogger.</li>
            <li> This is my ALL TIME favorite body butter/lotion!! I use this on my entire body after every shower &amp; at night on my feet &amp; arms/elbows/hands. I use only this (body)&amp; Watts Beauty Argan Gold oil(face) on my 54 year old gorgeous skin!! I LOVE this product! I also love Amazon, but... if you live close enough to shop at Trader Joe&#x27;s, then do so when purchasing this coconut body butter. I pay $4.99 @ TJ&#x27;s for this. I&#x27;m glad to see that I can get it from Amazon if I were unable to go to TJ&#x27;s, and I suppose the higher price wouldn&#x27;t be an issue with free shipping (prime members)&amp; with gas prices being what they are, this is a good option! You will not be disappointed with Trader Joe&#x27;s Coconut Body Butter &amp; for anyone who cares, like I do.. it&#x27;s cruelty free!</li>
            <li> Mmmmmmmm, this stuff smells awesome!  It&#x27;s not greasy and it feels nice.  Wife loves it!</li>
            <li> The smell is of coconut and vanilla (smells to me like the icing on my grandmother&#x27;s coconut cake).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a serviceable, cheap body butter with a decent ingredient list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have noted, it&#x27;s much cheaper if purchased from your local TJ&#x27;s (it&#x27;s $4.99 in my area).</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, feels great, soaks in and makes your skin feel amazing. I  buy this product again. Coworkers seek it out on my desk, its that nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad so many agree with me this is the best body butter ever. At TJ&#x27;s they sell for 4.99.  I discovered this works well on the face as a night cream too.  The other thing I use it for is complimenting my TJ&#x27;s non-aluminum deodorant when I go to the gym that my cloths no longer smell sweaty. The coconut helps keep me smelling clean at all times so I dab a little under my arms each day. Truly a great body butter.</li>
            <li> This is a first quality body butter that smells wonderful and does a great job.  Not sure of the company that  makes it but really like the quality. It smells like coconut oil and is very moisturizing without being tacky. I will definitely purchase again and would try their other versions too.</li>
            <li> The best thing for dry skin that I have ever tried. AND I have tried a lot!</li>
            <li> love this product...great smell and not too oily...</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how quickly this came!! Way before expected...I was really surprised. Love this product. Thank you for your professionalism.</li>
            <li> I wanted a cream and this is great - I love the smell and feel</li>
            <li> It is a very rich creamy product with a very natural coconut smell. I use this before going to bed on hands, legs and feet. It has an interesting flip top lid. I will suggest you to buy directly from Trader Joe&#x27;s store,at much cheaper price.</li>
            <li> I needed a good body cream for my very dry skin. I wanted to purchase a different cream with argan oil (sold on qvc) It was 3 times the price. I thought I would give this a try first. Not only does the scent of coconut smell yummy , but the thick body butter is very moisturizing. I do not have a Trader Joe&#x27;s nearby me but, I always loved the store.  The price of this was worth it. I would buy this again.</li>
