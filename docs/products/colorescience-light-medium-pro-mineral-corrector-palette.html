            <li>Great coverage.</li>
            <li>Great for bruise coverage on face, arms, and so on.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing!</li>
            <li>i love this product, the best out there.  </li>
            <li>It blends beautifully, and stays on most of the day!</li>
            <li>amazing looks great feels great</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and use them all depending on the season.</li>
            <li>Good color match.</li>
            <li>Does a good job of covering blemishes and a scar I have on my face.</li>
            <li>Love the product!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I am glad that Amazon has the Colorscience brand for sale on their website.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love the color choices.</li>
            <li>I LOVE</li>
            <li>LOVE Colorescience.</li>
            <li>Runs out too quickly and the brush is not as effective as the sponge.</li>
            <li>I bruise easily</li>
            <li>this product is for anyone who wants a more effective concealer than a face powder - I used it after surgery</li>
            <li>A worthy use of your money!</li>
            <li>not only does it do a perfect job of hiding imperfections (i.e. dark circles, discolorations, blemishes etc.), but I discovered this summer it makes a great \\&quot;finishing\\&quot; powder for use on spider veins of the legs.  </li>
            <li>It is great for covering any red spots I might have at any time.</li>
            <li>The brush is great for pin pointing those smaller areas, but I also use my own brush for larger spots to conceal.  </li>
            <li>I will totally be purchasing more when it runs out!</li>
            <li>but works nicely as a setting powder over a cream concealer for extra coverage.</li>
            <li>I am an Amazon Prime customer and rarely return or complain about my purchases.  </li>
            <li>I love how it conceals my red zones on my nose and cheeks.  </li>
            <li>but I  cannot give this purchase a good rating when it is incomplete and my attempts to obtain the missing parts go unanswered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Color Science is a product I have used in the past with good results.  </li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of Colorscience and have been for several years.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I do really like the mineral corrector palette by Colorscience.</li>
            <li>I find though, that I use the color in the very center more than the others.</li>
            <li>A great product and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t live without my concealer pack!</li>
            <li>I really like this product so far.</li>
            <li>Whereas I rarely use the last two circles.</li>
            <li>so I use the first two circles from the left.</li>
            <li>I love the different hues, so you have the flexibility of using them for various problems and the back of the compartment tells you which color to use for different problem areas.</li>
            <li>Read about it on a website for professional makeup artists.</li>
            <li>I only wish I could get one particular one in a larger container -</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like this product so far. It is great for covering any red spots I might have at any time. It came in a timely manner too. I am glad that Amazon has the Colorscience brand for sale on their website. It saved me some money.</li>
            <li> This is a nonono no no no product.</li>
            <li> i love this product, the best out there.  not only does it do a perfect job of hiding imperfections (i.e. dark circles, discolorations, blemishes etc.), but I discovered this summer it makes a great \\&quot;finishing\\&quot; powder for use on spider veins of the legs.  i will never be without this gem of a product...and it lasts a long time too!  5 plus stars!!!</li>
            <li> amazing looks great feels great</li>
            <li> Excellent spot coverage and does not cause breakouts for my acne prone skin! Used after having surgery to hide bruising &amp; for hiding scars &amp; breakouts!  A great product and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Only use the 1st 2 colors, though.</li>
            <li> The best concealer pallet you&#x27;ll ever use. I find though, that I use the color in the very center more than the others. I wish Colorescience would sell them in larger single sizes as some of the pallet I never touch.</li>
            <li> This is the best match for skin that I&#x27;ve ever found. It blends beautifully, and stays on most of the day! A worthy use of your money!</li>
            <li> I am returning it. It burns my face.  Tried to save money as I use this product but palette must be bad.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, great price! Fast shipping. Love the color choices. I have fair skin and use them all depending on the season.</li>
            <li> This dried my skin out really bad.  My sister loves this stuff though so it just depends on your skin type</li>
            <li> Item was what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Colorscience and have been for several years. This is the 1st time I tried the corrector palette.  I love how it conceals my red zones on my nose and cheeks.  The brush is great for pin pointing those smaller areas, but I also use my own brush for larger spots to conceal.  I will order again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I do really like the mineral corrector palette by Colorscience. I have very red cheeks, a couple sun spots, sometimes get a pimple, etc... this covers it all. I only wish I could get one particular one in a larger container - for example, I have ALOT of red in my skin and so I use this to cover it all so I use the first two circles from the left. Whereas I rarely use the last two circles. So if I could</li>
            <li> AMAZING!!  I LOVE THIS  STUFF!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found anything that comes close to this gem. Hides every imperfection, especially dark circles. I love the different hues, so you have the flexibility of using them for various problems and the back of the compartment tells you which color to use for different problem areas.</li>
            <li> Runs out too quickly and the brush is not as effective as the sponge.</li>
            <li> Not that great alone but works nicely as a setting powder over a cream concealer for extra coverage.</li>
            <li> Wish you could get the colors separate, two of them I never use.</li>
            <li> A must in my life. Couldn&#x27;t live without my concealer pack! LOVE Colorescience.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! It covers dark circles under the eyes and conceals little skin imperfections. I will keep buying it!</li>
            <li> This concealer is a life saver when I don&#x27;t have time for makeup touch up.&lt;br /&gt;Ordinary concealer:  apply cream concealer, then powder&lt;br /&gt;Colorscience: single application.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, this does not have enough color range but I&#x27;m very happy to have thi in my kit.</li>
            <li> this product is for anyone who wants a more effective concealer than a face powder - I used it after surgery and it allowed me to go out in public</li>
            <li> Color Science is a product I have used in the past with good results.  This is the reason I placed this order.  The illustration indicates that it includes two applicator brushes.  Neither arrived.  All I am asking is that you send me the missing part of the Palette I purchased.  I am an Amazon Prime customer and rarely return or complain about my purchases.  I really do not understand what the problem is here but I  cannot give this purchase a good rating when it is incomplete and my attempts to obtain the missing parts go unanswered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please help</li>
            <li> Love the product!  Great coverage.</li>
            <li> Great for bruise coverage on face, arms, and so on.  I bruise easily and this is the best cover I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> The BEST color correcting makeup! Love it!</li>
            <li> I had bought one of these from a cosmetic surgeon&#x27;s office, but lost it soon after.  Found this online &amp; since the price was a little less than the one from the dr. thought, okay, at least I&#x27;ll save a little.  Even at this price I would expect a brush - there is a place in the case that is obviously for a brush.  Tried using a brush I already had and the product seemed dry &amp; was hard to pick up on the brush - not sure if it&#x27;s just my brush or if the product was old.  If I somehow managed to use this up, I would not replace it from the same source.</li>
            <li> Read about it on a website for professional makeup artists. I have hyperpigmentation issues and this covers it totally. I put a dab on, then my overall makeup, and a follow up dab. It does look caked on in the spot and comes off at the end of day with makeup remover. I will totally be purchasing more when it runs out!</li>
            <li> Did not cover my melasma.  Did not come with a brush.</li>
            <li> It does as expected but I thought it was a cream my mistake still works well tho for contouring.</li>
            <li> Good color match. Does a good job of covering blemishes and a scar I have on my face.</li>
