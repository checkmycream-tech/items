            <li>Really clean scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the tester either, its the original retail product with it&#x27;s lid and fancy box that I really  didn&#x27;t even care about just happened to be better deal than even testers for sale.</li>

            <li>I am a big Bvlgari fan and I love ALL of their scents.</li>

            <li>excellent price on this fab fragrance, a little slow on the , but it did have to go a long ways</li>
            <li>It may have been the particular vendor possibly selling counterfeits</li>

            <li> This has to be one of my favorite scents right now, I cant even describe it. A great daytime or nighttime scent, I will definitely be buying this again.</li>
            <li> is very delicious has a unique flavor</li>
            <li> The parfum smelled different than the one I bought from nordstrom. The spray smelled very similar originally, but after it lingered it smelled different, and almost sour.</li>
            <li> This smells so good and it lasts all day long.  I receive compliments about it all the time.  You have to try it.  I have been searching for this fragrance and thank you Amazon -- you had it a perfect price.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome but the scent wears off in about an hour or so... This wasnt the case with my last bottle I purchased from sephora... Hmmm.</li>
            <li> Thanks for such a great product!! Love bulgari!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this after I went to Macy&#x27;s, and I could not believe the price difference!!  Same parfum, same packaging, but such a big difference in price. I would only purchase this from Amazon in the future, no more department stores!</li>
            <li> I had a slightly smaller one and was almost finished with it.  This was a good size and price.  I was not able to find it in any store locally.  Really clean scent.</li>
            <li> I got this perfume a few years ago and I still love it I love wearing this perfume!!!!! I have received so many compliments on fragrance! Great scent!</li>
            <li> I had a very difficult time finding this particular fragrance (one I used before and became a favorite of mine) locally and when I did find it local it was a price I couldn&#x27;t afford even for the smallest bottle. I was able to get the largest bottle here cheaper than the smallest one locally. Ex. local cost $48 for 1 oz, $60 for 1.7 oz, &amp; approx $90 for 2.5 oz... I bought the 2.5 oz on Amazon for approx $33! It&#x27;s not the tester either, its the original retail product with it&#x27;s lid and fancy box that I really  didn&#x27;t even care about just happened to be better deal than even testers for sale. I get compliments every time I wear it!</li>
            <li> This product is great. My boyfriend got me this scent for valentines day last year and I absolutely loved it. Plus getting it from Diva fragrances at a great price, was a win,win!</li>
            <li> Crisp clean scent. So many compliments. It&#x27;s a great daytime scent. Not overpowering. Just fresh.</li>
            <li> Get at least 1 compliment a week on this fragrance.  Is the only thing I wear anymore!  Clean and subtle.</li>
            <li> I gave this fragrance 5 stars because you can wear it year-round and it smells ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!! I am a big Bvlgari fan and I love ALL of their scents. Layer it with the lotion (which I also bought) and a little lasts ALL day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great thank you, just make sure to read all description of the item since sometimes it&#x27;s a tester so just a heads up :)</li>
            <li> Bulgari fragrances are exquisite, I loved the quality of this product, I recommend it 100% because I am very happy birthday on my expectations</li>
            <li> excellent price on this fab fragrance, a little slow on the , but it did have to go a long ways</li>
            <li> This fragrance smells differently on each person who wears it.  It&#x27;s Light and crisp and not over powering howerver it has enough presence to have people inquire as to what perfume you&#x27;re wearing.  I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> FAKE,BUT SMELLS REAL GOOD YOU MUST SPEND A LOT MORE ON PARFUM FOR IT TO STAY ON AND LAST IT SMELLS VERY GOOD GETS COMPLIMENTS BUT I HAVE TO PUT IT ON RIGHT THEN IN ORDER FOR PEOPLE TO SMELL HOW IT SMELLS,VERY FAKE,BUT SMELLS GREAT. SO I&#x27;LL GIVE IT A THREE TODAY.</li>
            <li> Love it, smells amazing. My room mate steals it all the time also. Sooo worth it! Cheap and awesome.</li>
            <li> I am wondering if because it was so discounted that it isn&#x27;t a knock off. It smells great for about 5 minutes and then it is gone. I have not had the same response with the men&#x27;s Bvlgari  that I have purchased.  It may have been the particular vendor possibly selling counterfeits</li>
            <li> I bought this for a gift, so I can&#x27;t tell you what it smells like on me - and if I could you probably wouldn&#x27;t want to know.  But it smell great on women - great. Any questions?</li>
            <li> Great anniversary gift.  Wife LOVED it... smells fantastic.  The only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as some other perfumes she&#x27;s had in the past.</li>
            <li> I have used all kinds of perfumes, colognes, body sprays, etc., but I have never had more compliments than the ones I get with BLV. I have had women and men wanting to know what it was and how they could find it. This is now my signature scent!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this scent....</li>
            <li> Arrived in great condition</li>
            <li> nice perfume and they were pretty fast for getting it to me though they didn&#x27;t get it for christmas like the thing said but oh well.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves this perfume</li>
            <li> the smell is wonderful and noble. This is one of my favorite perfum.&lt;br /&gt;I like it ! i will buy a other one</li>
            <li> I get many compliments!!</li>
            <li> Just as described. Quick delivery.</li>
