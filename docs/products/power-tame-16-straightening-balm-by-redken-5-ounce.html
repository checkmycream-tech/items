            <li>Completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to order this from Amazon and a cheaper price than at my salon.</li>
            <li>It is coarse, has fly a-ways, frizzy, and damaged in some spots.</li>

            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t think it kept hair straight or from curling when humid out.</li>
            <li>The product does about as well as many of the other products in straightening my hair.  </li>
            <li>You have to make sure your hair is completely blown dry in order for this to work.</li>
            <li>This works great for thick, coarse hair -</li>

            <li> the product was just as I expected and it arrived in 3 days!</li>

            <li> I gave it to a friend as a gift and she liked it.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick, and difficult to manage dark brown hair. I&#x27;ve tried literally every serum and shine spray that is ou there to help tame the beast. I was hesitant due to the price but I know know you get what you pay for. So much of my money was being wasted on Wal-Mart and CVS type products that just don&#x27;t work on thick full hair. The Redken Power Tame 16 is not oily or greasy. It makes my hair very manageable after washing. Not only can I run a run a comb through my wet hair but I can run my fingers through it without causing tangles! I have hair down to my waist and it only takes about a quarter size blob to cover all of it. I will never by cheap products again!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT! After washing and conditioning,this is the only product I use in my hair and it is wonderful. I usually put this on freshly towel-dried hair before blow-drying and flat-ironing.I love the way the product feels and smells. I have been using it everytime I wash my hair for about a month and my hair is soft,straight, and silky. I definitely recommend trying this product!</li>
            <li> This works great for thick, coarse hair - my frizz has almost disappeared and the bounce is back!  Used with Redken shampoo/conditioner for color-treated hair and I saw lots of improvement in just 1-2 uses.  &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Works great and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film on hair!  I have super thick hair and it helps!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and order it every 6 months or so.  Only use a little or it will weigh your hair down and make it greasy.  But it really tames frizzy hair, just use a small amount!</li>
            <li> The product smelled old. I have used Power Tame 16 before and it had a great scent. I would buy it again, but not online.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally wavy to spiral curly. It is coarse, has fly a-ways, frizzy, and damaged in some spots. I love this product because not only does it take out the curl, it makes it smooth in the process. I apply a small amount in small sections to ensure all is covered. Blow dry with a flat brush. I do NOT need to flat iron afterward! Big time saver!!! I especially love thus product for higher humidity days. It can be heavy on the hair, so don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my daughter who swears by it and as you can see forced me to go online to hunt it down! :)</li>
            <li> i bought this product because of the awesome reviews it got. it tames my wavy hair, making it much more managable. but that&#x27;s about all it does. argon oil does this same thing and runs even cheaper than this product. i tried this product out with my straightener and it just made it stringy and straw-like. i wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this serum.  It does help quite a bit. For me this is how the serum works best: Apply to hair after towel blotted. You have to make sure your hair is completely blown dry in order for this to work. Even if your hair is slightly damp it will curl or wave. I have very curly and somewhat wiry hair.</li>
            <li> Works great!  I don&#x27;t have a lot of curl but what I have is stubborn and thick.  This product really helps tame the curl and the thickness.</li>
            <li> The product does about as well as many of the other products in straightening my hair.  The biggest lesson to learn is \\&quot;more is not better.\\&quot;  More just makes the hair feel like it&#x27;s coated in wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is another story.  There&#x27;s no cap.  Every use requires a THOROUGH washing of the nozzle to prevent any product left in the nozzle from drying out.  If it&#x27;s not washed out the next use will deposit dried up little balls of product in your hair.  Not good.</li>
            <li> I use this product on my hair after every shampoo when I blowdry my hair straight.  Great conditioning, and yes, it makes my curly, frizzy Irish hair straight.  I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed, and I won&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> it makes your hair oily and always makes your hair look wet and unclean,I will never buy this again and just stick with chi products</li>
            <li> This is the best leave-in product for wavy hair that tends to frizz the day of or the next day after shampooing. I have had this problem ever since my teens. I have used hundreds of products from the priciest to the cheapest and was never fully satisfied until I tried this product. It was recommended by my beautician in Downers Grove. I would still be looking and not be satisfied. Thanks Rocco and Rocco. Michele Dietrick</li>
            <li> I have wild hair.  If I straighten it, it gets fly away.  This product eases the straightening process and controls the fly away without being greasy.  Concentrate on the ends and use sparingly near the roots.  I use it every day on the roots and fly away areas.  Apply from your palms instead of fingers to avoid using too much.  Beautiful, silky finish.  Thank you, Redken.</li>
            <li> this is a great product for anyone who has thick somewhat curly hair.  it decreased the frizz and straightened the hair.  I  have used this once before and have always been happy with it and I am happy amazon carries this because it is hard to find.  thanks</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It actually works well for both straight and curly hair. I use if for both.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Doesn&#x27;t do anything for my thick hair. I&#x27;m sorry I wasted my money on the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied. the product was just as I expected and it arrived in 3 days!</li>

            <li> This is the first straightening balm I have used so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  It was sticky and had a strong (not necessarily unpleasant) smell.</li>
            <li> Very smooth transaction.  Have used the product before.  Completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love Redken products and this one is by far the best straightening product I have ever come across! Now that I have found it, it&#x27;s a shame the company has Discontinued it😭! Why Redken, why? They have no other product that has taken its place either! After 5 kids and years of using a flat iron, my hair has become thick, wavy, frizzy &amp; unruly. With this product, it does the job Without making hair greasy which is the biggest problem with all other products, with the other being they simply don&#x27;t work! Also I love the thick cream and white lotion products, not the clear greasy serums!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think it kept hair straight or from curling when humid out.</li>
            <li> This product is no longer in production but there&#x27;s a readily available product at Walmart. It&#x27;s Loreal sleek it frizz vanisher cream</li>
