            <li>I bought this humidifier 2 weeks ago and am very happy that it is quieter</li>

            <li>Convection is a beautiful thing.</li>
            <li>Great, except that when I let go, it turned off again.</li>
            <li>If the unit I recieved worked as described, it would be a great product.  </li>
            <li>Construction of the humidifer, isn&#x27;t the best it could be much better.</li>
            <li>I knew I needed a good humidifier.</li>
            <li>Hamilton Beach is still a good name.</li>
            <li>But, I suppose that&#x27;s also a good thing if you don&#x27;t want it to leak.  </li>
            <li>It does a fair job.&lt;BR&gt;3.</li>
            <li>These blowers make a good bit of noise even on the quietest setting.</li>
            <li>excellent product well worth the expense.</li>
            <li>as many great things I have to say about this unit</li>
            <li>as many great things I have to say about this unit</li>
            <li>Out of the box it looked nice but my happiness soon faded.</li>
            <li>After examining and using many units, I honestly feel this is the best cool-mist, fan-based unit available - and hope these insights help you make a wise choice.</li>
            <li>The automatic shutoff feature is nice as well.  </li>
            <li>so that was nice.</li>
            <li>It has balanced out the air humidity nicely.</li>
            <li>It lists the square footage it can cover effectively for a reason.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best humidifier I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many models and I&#x27;m satisfied I got the best cool-mist fan unit available.  </li>
            <li>is very easy to operate.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I recieved it, I was happy to see how easy it was to set up, and how easy it was to fill the tank.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through a million humidifiers and this is the best so far.  </li>
            <li>than that, I&#x27;ve felt that this is a very fine product.  </li>
            <li>Easy to buy refills for the filters online too!</li>
            <li>When we first got this humidifier home, it worked great.</li>
            <li>After examining and using many units, I honestly feel this is the best cool-mist, fan-based unit available - and hope these insights help you make a wise choice.irly wide (5\\&quot; across), so a petite hand, wrist and arm could reach inside to scrub the unit if that was ever needed</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend the TrueAir Cool Mist Humidifier to anyone!!!!  </li>
            <li>It would sure be lovely to have a humidifier with no upkeep, but I&#x27;ll gladly pay to replace the filters for the relief it provides.</li>
            <li>I bought this humidifier because Hamilton Beach advertises that the tank and tray are dishwasher safe</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s when you need it most anyway.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give Hamilton Beach one more shot to see what happens.  </li>
            <li>I would prefer to be able to wash them periodically and save myself some money.</li>
            <li>The final word, though, if used correctly this is an excellent product.</li>
            <li>but there aren&#x27;t too many alternatives I would even consider</li>
            <li>Sure, I can order a bunch of them online and be set thru the winter</li>
            <li>I would have been able to try this unit out for a month before purchasing it, I would have returned it and kept looking around for something else because of the filter.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;they found me just what i needed,and i bought it, and am well satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Sure the filters have to be replaced and for the most part, are easier to find online.  </li>
            <li>After reading all the mixed reviews on this product, I bought it anyway as it seemed the best deal for the amount of space I needed to humidify (1100- 1200 sf).  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that you can put the tank in the dishwasher.  </li>
            <li>after using it in my bedroom, I decided I needed it more.  </li>
            <li>WILL eventually (every two months or so) develop dozens of hairline cracks, both at the bottom AND at the top of the water tank.  </li>
            <li>Since the container faces into a humid environment, it&#x27;s worthwhile to shake the container once or twice before you carry it across the room to shake any droplets of humidity away.  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent humidifier, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>The reasons it is better are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It worked ok for a while</li>
            <li>We have  tried all kinds of cool air humidifiers and so far, this one is the best.</li>
            <li>Dialing a particular humidity is great.  </li>
            <li>Dishwasher safe; Easy to clean&lt;BR&gt;6.</li>
            <li>It seems that the humidity gauge is still not the most accurate, but it works nonetheless once it starts going.  </li>
            <li>This humidifier is great, and within hours of use I noticed a considerable difference in the air quality of my bedroom.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been great so far.</li>
            <li>From my experience with these types of units 3 years is pretty good service and at this price it&#x27;s really fantastic.</li>
            <li>The humidifier is easily assembled and seems to be constructed of a quality material.  </li>
            <li>It is reasonably easy to fill, but it emties about once a day and that does become a chore quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy cleanup-</li>
            <li>The filter is easy to change - lift up the front housing and drop it in.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use.&lt;BR&gt;6.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy to see the level of water through the tinted tank.</li>
            <li>The water tank is easily removable when handled vertically.</li>
            <li>It has taken the abuse of being run every night for a year or more and we liked it so much we purchased another for our newborns room.  </li>
            <li>Also, it is easy to fill up with water and wash all the parts.  </li>
            <li>The tank easily lasts a full 24 hours between refills, and it is easily placed on the top rack of the dishwasher for cleaning.  </li>
            <li>It works fine.</li>
            <li>I have never seen a unit as easy and accessible as this one.  </li>
            <li>I have never seen a unit as easy and accessible as this one.  </li>
            <li>I was fine with it right away, and although my wife was cautious, she took to it by the morning and has enjoyed it ever since.  </li>
            <li>For the one piece that cannot be put into the dishwasher, the fan unit is remarkably open with a great deal of free space for cleaning.  </li>
            <li>For the one piece that cannot be put into the dishwasher, the fan unit is remarkably open with a great deal of free space for cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I think this is an important feature so that you don&#x27;t &#x27;over humidify&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>The humidifier works as advertised and the digital controls are great.  </li>
            <li>and I assumed this meant that I could enjoy the convenience of cleaning the tank in the dishwasher.</li>
            <li>the tank is a pain, doesn&#x27;t fit in a sink so have to lean into the tub and hope I don&#x27;t topple forward and smash my head against the soap dish.</li>
            <li>(like the hunter care free type) and see how it goes from there.  </li>
            <li>A nice size fan pushes the air to circulate the whole room.</li>
            <li>This product is extremely easy to use, fill and clean.  </li>
            <li>I find it too easy to clean in the sink to bother with the dishwasher.</li>
            <li>Within days I was sleeping soundly waking refreshed and no longer having headaches.  </li>
            <li>hope this detailed description helps you decide to buy this unit.  </li>
            <li>hope this detailed description helps you decide to buy this unit.  </li>
            <li>The Vortex seemed to get good marks, but almost every reviewer said the \\&quot;glugging\\&quot; was unbelievably loud.  </li>
            <li>This model also has a nice size water tank that can be filled without taking the whole unit to the sink.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to clean and I absolutely find it easy to fill.</li>
            <li>digital readout is very nice, I can&#x27;t imagine one of these without a readout.  </li>
            <li>It has a digital readout (very nice feature).&lt;BR&gt;4.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>My wife originally scoffed at the purchase.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am very satisfied with the unit&#x27;s performance and recommend it to any able-bodied adult considering a cool-mist humidifier.</li>
            <li>I have a warm mist model that works just as well and requires only a bit more attention to maintain.</li>
            <li>So far, I love it!  </li>
            <li>Automatic shut-off when moisture level which you set is reached and most of all very easy to clean and quiet with 3 speed settings.</li>
            <li>This is true with any \\&quot;wick\\&quot; humidifier.  </li>
            <li>Generate good humids at desirable setting, but queit operation is NOT quiet!!  </li>
            <li>After 27 months of using an Evenflo cool mist humidifier, I purchased this model for my 27-month-old&#x27;s room.  </li>
            <li>the 4 gallon true air humidifier, and i wouldn&#x27;t take anything for it.</li>
            <li>initial thinking is that this is a good humidifier.  </li>
            <li>initial thinking is that this is a good humidifier.  </li>
            <li>We like the cool mist humidifier for 2 reasons...</li>
            <li>The TruAir 4.0 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier has done wonders for us.  </li>
            <li>First off its a cool mist which for me is great especially when you have kids that could get burned by the steam.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not a bad unit.  </li>
            <li>The tank size is generous, the product is easy to assemble and clean, the humidistat is accurate and easy to use, and the whole product seems to be very well built.  </li>
            <li>I did a lot of research before deciding on this particular humidifier, and I am glad we got the one we did.</li>
            <li>I wash it with mild soap and water once a week and no mineral buildup.</li>
            <li>I was pregnant and it was winter</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>This model is much better built than some other brand models that I own.  </li>
            <li>LCD display is large and easy to read.  </li>
            <li>The HIGH setting is really good for humidifying multiple rooms and blasts quite a strong swirl of moisture into any room in no time at all.  </li>
            <li>Unless you live in a mansion, this humidifier SHOULD be able to control the humidity in a bedroom with ease.  </li>
            <li>In fact the whole thing comes apart quite easily for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>You have to put some pretty good torque on it to get it to open.  </li>
            <li>It pretty good humidifer, but I only gave it 4 star because of it constructions.  </li>
            <li>I bought two different humidifiers- a Slant/Fin warm mist and this True Air.  </li>
            <li>The high makes a good amount a sound, but I only use it when no one is in the room and need a boost of humidity.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been searching for a good humidifier (at the right price) for a long time...</li>
            <li>Water tank is too large to fit under kitchen faucet&lt;BR&gt;2.</li>
            <li>Although I can&#x27;t comment on someone else&#x27;s concern about the humidistat not being accurate, in my experience it works very well.  </li>
            <li>I dohave to change the filter more frequently than I anticipated.</li>
            <li>(actually kind of soothing as I go to sleep because it functions like white noise).&lt;br /&gt;An</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s WELL worth it to avoid doctor visits, and antibiotics.  </li>
            <li>but I think if I&#x27;m gonna invest big bucks in filters, that I might just try to design my own \\&quot;perma-wick\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It holds enough water for a day or two, which is nice.  </li>
            <li>Even though it works well, it just isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>Surely the quality of water in your area dictates how frequently you will need to change the filter.</li>
            <li>firstly the tank is too large to fit under the faucet in the kitchen sink, so you need a jug or hose to fill it up or use the faucet in the bathtub...</li>
            <li>To put water in the air, right?  </li>
            <li>Carrying is an easy one-handed operation thanks to the white handle built into the top of the jug</li>
            <li>SETINGS&lt;BR&gt;-HOLDS A LARGE WATER TANK TO DISPERSE COOL, SOOTHING MIST.</li>
            <li>After much research, I decided on the Hamilton Beach 05521 TrueAir Cool Mist Humidifier.  </li>
            <li>This has been a great humidifier for the past year.  </li>
            <li>I was quite pleased to see that the opening on the water tank was large enough that you could put your hand inside to clean it out....</li>
            <li>One call to Hamilton Beach and a new one was on its way, free of charge.  </li>
            <li>Although we really like our Slant/Fin for the baby&#x27;s room, this unit is much easier to clean.  </li>
            <li>You MUST follow the maintenance instructions EXACTLY to avoid problems with filter odor.  </li>
            <li>Recently, I found that I if vary the place of the humidifier to be more central to the room, it works much more efficiently.</li>
            <li>thought about returning it within the first week</li>
            <li>With such high-maintenance storage instructions, many owners will have units that stay out and get grimy inside.  </li>
            <li>They really should make it easy to thoroughly clean all of the internal parts.    </li>
            <li>It appears to work pretty well.  </li>
            <li>She also claimed that she couldn&#x27;t tell any difference by having it on, at first anyway.  </li>
            <li>She also claimed that she couldn&#x27;t tell any difference by having it on, at first anyway.  </li>
            <li>and I was getting pretty dehydrated from the drying heat in my apartment.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s the first I bought</li>
            <li>Why could they not simply provide a flip-up-to-open cover on the top of the tank to avoid these problems?  </li>
            <li>We live in a very dry climate in Texas and this humidifier can keep certain rooms at a good humidity level.  </li>
            <li>The up-side is that - without a lock or latch to secure these two pieces more tightly, lifting the jug for refills is a one-handed</li>
            <li>The up-side is that - without a lock or latch to secure these two pieces more tightly, lifting the jug for refills is a one-handed</li>
            <li>I was concerned at first because I noticed no mist coming from the fan, but I am absolutely certain its evaporation is working up to par because of the results I get.</li>
            <li>months.&lt;br /&gt;The large capacity of the water tank is good enough for 24 hour operation (on quiet setting).</li>
            <li>Well, they may be dishwasher safe, but the tank is TOO BIG to fit in a standard dishwasher.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy another just like it if I had use for another one, but this pretty much does the whole house.</li>
            <li>This water in the tray is taken up graduallyby the filter (which sits under the motorized fan), to generate the humidity when the fan is on.&lt;br /&gt;The digital panel is easy to read.</li>
            <li>Well, the humidifier certainly humidifies.  </li>
            <li>I did like the Humidistat feature and the large tank, although cumbersome to fill</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m off to find a large capacity ultrasonic humidifier.</li>
            <li>It has a large water tank.&lt;BR&gt;5.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The water container is a smart design.  </li>
            <li>We changed the filter and it was back to working fine.  </li>
            <li>Else, it&#x27;s back to the drawing board.&lt;br /&gt;ADDENDUM: The replacement humidifer works fine.  </li>
            <li>The filter is holding up just fine after 4 weeks, despite daily use.</li>
            <li>Although no cool mist-based fan can be SILENT, I am impressed with just how quiet this lowest setting is.  </li>
            <li>Underneath the fan unit resides the filter which is easy to replace and sits almost too easily into a small molded, shaped guide in the bottom tray.  </li>
            <li>The new one came with a tank made of a different kind of plastic - slightly more rubbery and not so stiff.  </li>
            <li>But overall, I liked the digital control panel and that it covered a large area.  </li>
            <li>It clicks on very silently.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>As a light sleeper, that was enough to steer me to the Hamilton Beach.  </li>
            <li>Upon setup, the machine ran quite smoothly and quietly...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if all humidifiers go through filters this fast</li>
            <li>The filters have to be replaced about once a week, otherwise they get moldy and start to smell (and who wants to breathe in mold?)&lt;BR&gt;2.</li>
            <li>However, I purchased this unit thinking that the digital humidity level operation would work precisely.  </li>
            <li>I bought this humidifier a month ago after much research.</li>
            <li>This requires the user to slide the jug straight up when removing it for refills - otherwise</li>
            <li>This requires the user to slide the jug straight up when removing it for refills - otherwise</li>
            <li>It is rather noisy when the water tray is filling (it makes a glugging sound that sounds like someone knocking on your window in the middle of the night- spooky!), but for ease of use and maintenance, it can&#x27;t be beat.  </li>
            <li>I find it to be nice and quiet at the low setting</li>
            <li>We baby these water tanks to prevent this, but all to no avail;  believe me, this all gets very old, very fast.  </li>
            <li>For one, if you want to humidify an entire house or very large apartment/duplex, either buy a bigger model or get more than one.</li>
            <li>itself.&lt;br /&gt;The 3 non-motorized plastic pieces can be placed in a dishwasher, but you will need a dishwasher with a fairly deep main section in order for the 3-gallon jug to fit.  </li>
            <li>Finally, the 3-gallon container is very easy to fill, but because of its depth, you will need to have either a reasonably deep basin kitchen or utility sink or fill the jug up in a bathtub.  </li>
            <li>I got this humifier thinking I would be able to get away with filling it every other day.</li>
            <li>Much better than other humidifiers I&#x27;ve used.    </li>
            <li>i have been bying smaller humidifiers for a number of years, never satisfied with the results.i bought the best that i could find, locally, until i got on amazon, and started a search.</li>
            <li>for the main unit, the humidistat works very well.  </li>
            <li>I wish all of these humidifers were easier to fill, but this one is pretty typical and the cap or whatever you&#x27;d call it has an easy grip handle.  </li>
            <li>Although I bought it for my bedroom, I had no problem running it in my main living area which is well over the 1200 sq ft rating.  </li>
            <li>We like being able to set the actual humidity level we want, and seeing the current level.</li>
            <li>Two main problems with this model:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is sooooooo quiet in the low mode and it easily keeps our large bedroom up to 50% humidity.  </li>
            <li>If you need to quickly get the humidity up in a room you can turn it on high then run it at normal or the quiet settings.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this humidifier to anyone.</li>
            <li>I talked my husband into trying this humidifier, and have to recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even let it run on high all day once in awhile, and all that does is use up all the water faster.</li>
            <li>When I ratchet it up to a high humidity level, I get lots of moist air.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, I&#x27;ve had other humidifiers that don&#x27;t work nearly as well.  </li>
            <li>While Hamilton Beach is very responsive in sending us out new tanks every time ours begins to leak, EACH AND EVERY new tank ALWAYS begins to leak within the two month period.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;completely dry, sealed and in its original box\\&quot;, when not used for over two weeks.  </li>
            <li>other part of the unit, housing the motor and fan, comes off easily too.</li>
            <li>I clean it thoroughly once a week, letting it dry well and am getting 4 or 5 weeks use from each filter.</li>
            <li>digital display is also well worth it, as it will cycle on and off if the room becomes humid and you can set it to your comfort level.  </li>
            <li>Of course it is much more convenient to do so after removing the heavy water tank.</li>
            <li>Perhaps the old, harder plastic cracked too easily or something.  </li>
            <li>The water tank on the back has a sturdy handle and pulls right up.  </li>
            <li>The motor is quiet - not silent, but it is in the bedroom and we sleep fine.  </li>
            <li>Another bonus, the filters are cheap compared to other models that I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>It keeps our 3 back bedrooms humidified nicely just as long as you don&#x27;t open the windows of course.</li>
            <li>agonized on a new humidifier for weeks looking at review after review.  </li>
            <li>The new tank isok, but one time after filling it up, the plug came out and I had to sop up a couple of gallons of water off my bedroom floor.  </li>
            <li>well the thing is new</li>
            <li>so it was just stuck from being new.</li>
            <li>Also, order the filters designed for it, not the cheap imitation ones at Walmart; they do not filter.</li>
            <li>It makes the same tiny gurgling sound periodically during operation too.</li>
            <li>Low operating sound on quiet setting&lt;BR&gt;3.</li>
            <li>The lowest fan level is very quiet, the higher ones are not.</li>
            <li>First, the humidity can only be increased/decreased at 5% increments.  </li>
            <li>This is the first and only unit where that has not been a problem.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>This is the first and only unit where that has not been a problem.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s about the same, if not, a little better, than our other humidifier.  </li>
            <li>Not really a bothersome noise, its gentle susurations are not disturbing to sleep.</li>
            <li>Also, the cap is so secure that I end up hurting my knuckles every single time I open it</li>
            <li>We have had many great humidifiers, both large and small, cheap and expensive, and NONE have been as poorly designed and constructed as this Hamilton Beach model&#x27;s water tank.  </li>
            <li>It appears to me that some people purchased this product expecting a miracle cure for their dry winter air without realizing that it&#x27;s just a machine and dependant on many other factors.</li>
            <li>Due to the fan, this humidifier is not extremely quiet but we do run it in the livingroom and can easily listen to the tv or radio over it.</li>
            <li>I know I had it set up correctly - that was clearly defined in the manual,</li>
            <li>This model also included a filter system to help clear out dust and pollen.</li>
            <li>We took it out of our bedroom and put it in the hall, it was still loud.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Bought mine directly from Babies R Us and paid $62.99.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a vast improvement over a much inferior humidifier</li>
            <li>We purchased this humidifer for our baby&#x27;s room, and so far it has worked quite well.  </li>
            <li>I have a 4 month old daughter, and living in the desert</li>
            <li>Also, it doen&#x27;t shut off if water runs out, so you want to frequently check for water level.&lt;BR</li>
            <li>This wouldn&#x27;t matter if the click wasn&#x27;t so loud...</li>
            <li>no sign of it so far.</li>
            <li>After five years, the old unit was gunked up on the inside beyond cleaning.  </li>
            <li>then my old Holmes humidifier.</li>
            <li>old baby.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is a knock against the product as much as it might be a problem related to our water hardness (which is notorious) in our area.&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li>She doesn&#x27;t have a sensitive throat and sinuses like I do.  </li>
            <li>On the highest speed, it&#x27;s about as loud as having an osculating fan going in your room.  </li>
            <li>We followed the instructions completely, but it just didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>I only fill it up every other day at most during driest times (outside humidity &#x3D; 9% today!)  </li>
            <li>So, your mileage may vary, but keep in mind that if you are a very light sleeper and bothered by slight noises, there probably is NO humidifier that will be quiet enough for</li>
            <li>In the summer it can be extremely humid here so it rarely runs.  </li>
            <li>the Quiet mode was very loud!....</li>
            <li>There are 3 speed settings; quiet, med, and high.</li>
            <li>To open the tank for re-filling, first you have to flip the tank upside down, then you have to use A LOT OF FORCE to twist the large cap.  </li>
            <li>every nook and cranny proves not worth the effort.  </li>
            <li>every nook and cranny proves not worth the effort.  </li>
            <li>It is very quiet, it seems to be made very well, and is relatively sturdy.</li>
            <li>As far as the sound, I usually have mine set on the lowest speed which is quiet.  </li>
            <li>Reading the other reviews, I&#x27;m not the first to experience quality problems.  </li>
            <li>We have VERY hard water and the filters don&#x27;t need to be changed as often as with most humidifiers which is a long-run cost savings.  </li>
            <li>, the noise is not overwhelming and is similar to any white noise often used to put and keep kids asleep, I had no problem refilling it, my 2 year-old even liked to help, finally if you turn the filters faithfully once a week 2-3 filters should last the season.   </li>
            <li>The tank is completely sealed, so after filling it you can carry it back without risk of spilling anything.  </li>
            <li>On quiet, it creates just enough white noise that our daughter sleeps very well.  </li>
            <li>certainly quieter than virtually every other manufacturer.  </li>
            <li>Although you will have to fill it every day or two if you live in the desert (as I do), it lasts longer than the others and the filters seem to work for a long time too.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking of buying another smaller digital unit for the bedroom and using this for the main area so that my entire house is humidified.</li>
            <li>Usually I simply throw out humidifiers after a season or two since disassembling them enough to clear</li>
            <li>Usually I simply throw out humidifiers after a season or two since disassembling them enough to clear</li>
            <li>I woke up with no dry throat.  </li>
            <li>I was actually surprised that it lasted as long as it did (almost 3 weeks) but could have been cuz I used my vapor steam cleaner on it once a week.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s somewhat simple to fill up, but since you have to flip the tank upside down to fill it, it&#x27;s cumbersome to fill in a bathtub, which is the only place other than the kitchen sink that the tank will fit for.  </li>
            <li>secondly, the cap on the fill hole is pretty tight (the upside is that it is spill-proof)</li>
            <li>The unit comes in 4 pieces; the large fan unit section that contains the controls, the translucent 3-gallon water container, the bottom tray that both of the previously-mentioned pieces slide upright into and a hidden water reservoir tray inside the bottom tray</li>
            <li>Second, I have not been able to reach my desired humidity of 50%, even when I&#x27;ve blasted it at HIGH.  </li>
            <li>If you live in a place bigger than the recommended square footage, you&#x27;ll have to keep doors closed in the room (like a bedroom) for this humidifier to have an effect in that space.</li>
            <li>New filters are flattened for shipping and need to be reshaped into a cylinder before replacing them - and filters seem to last longer than I expected at 1 filter every 5-6 weeks - even after which they do not look gross, moldy or dirty.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The machine is far from quiet on any setting.&lt;BR&gt;2.It humidifies far less square footage than specified, even on the highest setting.</li>
            <li>Either way, 3 gallons of water is easy to heft for an adult, but may be difficult for an elderly parent or friend (consider a smaller capacity unit if this is the case).  </li>
            <li>Instead of a steady readout, it bounces around up or down a percent or two.  </li>
            <li>At first the low setting may seem noisy especially if there is very little ambient noise around you</li>

            <li> If the unit I recieved worked as described, it would be a great product.  </li>
            <li> Construction of the humidifer, isn&#x27;t the best it could be much better.</li>
            <li> I knew I needed a good humidifier.</li>
            <li> Hamilton Beach is still a good name.</li>
            <li> But, I suppose that&#x27;s also a good thing if you don&#x27;t want it to leak.  </li>
            <li> It does a fair job.&lt;BR&gt;3.</li>
            <li> These blowers make a good bit of noise even on the quietest setting.</li>
            <li> excellent product well worth the expense.</li>
            <li> as many great things I have to say about this unit</li>
            <li> as many great things I have to say about this unit</li>
            <li> Out of the box it looked nice but my happiness soon faded.</li>
            <li> After examining and using many units, I honestly feel this is the best cool-mist, fan-based unit available - and hope these insights help you make a wise choice.</li>
            <li> The automatic shutoff feature is nice as well.  </li>
            <li> so that was nice.</li>
            <li> It has balanced out the air humidity nicely.</li>
            <li> It lists the square footage it can cover effectively for a reason.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best humidifier I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many models and I&#x27;m satisfied I got the best cool-mist fan unit available.  </li>
            <li> is very easy to operate.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I recieved it, I was happy to see how easy it was to set up, and how easy it was to fill the tank.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through a million humidifiers and this is the best so far.  </li>
            <li> than that, I&#x27;ve felt that this is a very fine product.  </li>
            <li> Easy to buy refills for the filters online too!</li>
            <li> When we first got this humidifier home, it worked great.</li>
            <li> After examining and using many units, I honestly feel this is the best cool-mist, fan-based unit available - and hope these insights help you make a wise choice.irly wide (5\\&quot; across), so a petite hand, wrist and arm could reach inside to scrub the unit if that was ever needed</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend the TrueAir Cool Mist Humidifier to anyone!!!!  </li>
            <li> It would sure be lovely to have a humidifier with no upkeep, but I&#x27;ll gladly pay to replace the filters for the relief it provides.</li>
            <li> I bought this humidifier because Hamilton Beach advertises that the tank and tray are dishwasher safe</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when you need it most anyway.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give Hamilton Beach one more shot to see what happens.  </li>
            <li> I would prefer to be able to wash them periodically and save myself some money.</li>
            <li> The final word, though, if used correctly this is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> but there aren&#x27;t too many alternatives I would even consider</li>
            <li> Sure, I can order a bunch of them online and be set thru the winter</li>
            <li> I would have been able to try this unit out for a month before purchasing it, I would have returned it and kept looking around for something else because of the filter.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;they found me just what i needed,and i bought it, and am well satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Sure the filters have to be replaced and for the most part, are easier to find online.  </li>
            <li> After reading all the mixed reviews on this product, I bought it anyway as it seemed the best deal for the amount of space I needed to humidify (1100- 1200 sf).  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that you can put the tank in the dishwasher.  </li>
            <li> after using it in my bedroom, I decided I needed it more.  </li>
            <li> WILL eventually (every two months or so) develop dozens of hairline cracks, both at the bottom AND at the top of the water tank.  </li>
            <li> Since the container faces into a humid environment, it&#x27;s worthwhile to shake the container once or twice before you carry it across the room to shake any droplets of humidity away.  </li>
            <li> This is an excellent humidifier, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> The reasons it is better are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It worked ok for a while</li>
            <li> We have  tried all kinds of cool air humidifiers and so far, this one is the best.</li>
            <li> Dialing a particular humidity is great.  </li>
            <li> Dishwasher safe; Easy to clean&lt;BR&gt;6.</li>
            <li> It seems that the humidity gauge is still not the most accurate, but it works nonetheless once it starts going.  </li>
            <li> This humidifier is great, and within hours of use I noticed a considerable difference in the air quality of my bedroom.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been great so far.</li>
            <li> From my experience with these types of units 3 years is pretty good service and at this price it&#x27;s really fantastic.</li>
            <li> The humidifier is easily assembled and seems to be constructed of a quality material.  </li>
            <li> It is reasonably easy to fill, but it emties about once a day and that does become a chore quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy cleanup-</li>
            <li> The filter is easy to change - lift up the front housing and drop it in.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use.&lt;BR&gt;6.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is easy to see the level of water through the tinted tank.</li>
            <li> The water tank is easily removable when handled vertically.</li>
            <li> It has taken the abuse of being run every night for a year or more and we liked it so much we purchased another for our newborns room.  </li>
            <li> Also, it is easy to fill up with water and wash all the parts.  </li>
            <li> The tank easily lasts a full 24 hours between refills, and it is easily placed on the top rack of the dishwasher for cleaning.  </li>
            <li> It works fine.</li>
            <li> I have never seen a unit as easy and accessible as this one.  </li>
            <li> I have never seen a unit as easy and accessible as this one.  </li>
            <li> I was fine with it right away, and although my wife was cautious, she took to it by the morning and has enjoyed it ever since.  </li>
            <li> For the one piece that cannot be put into the dishwasher, the fan unit is remarkably open with a great deal of free space for cleaning.  </li>
            <li> For the one piece that cannot be put into the dishwasher, the fan unit is remarkably open with a great deal of free space for cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I think this is an important feature so that you don&#x27;t &#x27;over humidify&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> The humidifier works as advertised and the digital controls are great.  </li>
            <li> and I assumed this meant that I could enjoy the convenience of cleaning the tank in the dishwasher.</li>
            <li> the tank is a pain, doesn&#x27;t fit in a sink so have to lean into the tub and hope I don&#x27;t topple forward and smash my head against the soap dish.</li>
            <li> (like the hunter care free type) and see how it goes from there.  </li>
            <li> A nice size fan pushes the air to circulate the whole room.</li>
            <li> This product is extremely easy to use, fill and clean.  </li>
            <li> I find it too easy to clean in the sink to bother with the dishwasher.</li>
            <li> Within days I was sleeping soundly waking refreshed and no longer having headaches.  </li>
            <li> hope this detailed description helps you decide to buy this unit.  </li>
            <li> hope this detailed description helps you decide to buy this unit.  </li>
            <li> The Vortex seemed to get good marks, but almost every reviewer said the \\&quot;glugging\\&quot; was unbelievably loud.  </li>
            <li> This model also has a nice size water tank that can be filled without taking the whole unit to the sink.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to clean and I absolutely find it easy to fill.</li>
            <li> digital readout is very nice, I can&#x27;t imagine one of these without a readout.  </li>
            <li> It has a digital readout (very nice feature).&lt;BR&gt;4.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> My wife originally scoffed at the purchase.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am very satisfied with the unit&#x27;s performance and recommend it to any able-bodied adult considering a cool-mist humidifier.</li>
            <li> I have a warm mist model that works just as well and requires only a bit more attention to maintain.</li>
            <li> So far, I love it!  </li>
            <li> Automatic shut-off when moisture level which you set is reached and most of all very easy to clean and quiet with 3 speed settings.</li>
            <li> This is true with any \\&quot;wick\\&quot; humidifier.  </li>
            <li> Generate good humids at desirable setting, but queit operation is NOT quiet!!  </li>
            <li> After 27 months of using an Evenflo cool mist humidifier, I purchased this model for my 27-month-old&#x27;s room.  </li>
            <li> the 4 gallon true air humidifier, and i wouldn&#x27;t take anything for it.</li>
            <li> initial thinking is that this is a good humidifier.  </li>
            <li> initial thinking is that this is a good humidifier.  </li>
            <li> We like the cool mist humidifier for 2 reasons...</li>
            <li> The TruAir 4.0 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier has done wonders for us.  </li>
            <li> First off its a cool mist which for me is great especially when you have kids that could get burned by the steam.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not a bad unit.  </li>
            <li> The tank size is generous, the product is easy to assemble and clean, the humidistat is accurate and easy to use, and the whole product seems to be very well built.  </li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before deciding on this particular humidifier, and I am glad we got the one we did.</li>
            <li> I wash it with mild soap and water once a week and no mineral buildup.</li>
            <li> I was pregnant and it was winter</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> This model is much better built than some other brand models that I own.  </li>
            <li> LCD display is large and easy to read.  </li>
            <li> The HIGH setting is really good for humidifying multiple rooms and blasts quite a strong swirl of moisture into any room in no time at all.  </li>
            <li> Unless you live in a mansion, this humidifier SHOULD be able to control the humidity in a bedroom with ease.  </li>
            <li> In fact the whole thing comes apart quite easily for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> You have to put some pretty good torque on it to get it to open.  </li>
            <li> It pretty good humidifer, but I only gave it 4 star because of it constructions.  </li>
            <li> I bought two different humidifiers- a Slant/Fin warm mist and this True Air.  </li>
            <li> The high makes a good amount a sound, but I only use it when no one is in the room and need a boost of humidity.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been searching for a good humidifier (at the right price) for a long time...</li>
            <li> Water tank is too large to fit under kitchen faucet&lt;BR&gt;2.</li>
            <li> Although I can&#x27;t comment on someone else&#x27;s concern about the humidistat not being accurate, in my experience it works very well.  </li>
            <li> I dohave to change the filter more frequently than I anticipated.</li>
            <li> (actually kind of soothing as I go to sleep because it functions like white noise).&lt;br /&gt;An</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s WELL worth it to avoid doctor visits, and antibiotics.  </li>
            <li> but I think if I&#x27;m gonna invest big bucks in filters, that I might just try to design my own \\&quot;perma-wick\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It holds enough water for a day or two, which is nice.  </li>
            <li> Even though it works well, it just isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> Surely the quality of water in your area dictates how frequently you will need to change the filter.</li>
            <li> firstly the tank is too large to fit under the faucet in the kitchen sink, so you need a jug or hose to fill it up or use the faucet in the bathtub...</li>
            <li> To put water in the air, right?  </li>
            <li> Carrying is an easy one-handed operation thanks to the white handle built into the top of the jug</li>
            <li> SETINGS&lt;BR&gt;-HOLDS A LARGE WATER TANK TO DISPERSE COOL, SOOTHING MIST.</li>
            <li> After much research, I decided on the Hamilton Beach 05521 TrueAir Cool Mist Humidifier.  </li>
            <li> This has been a great humidifier for the past year.  </li>
            <li> I was quite pleased to see that the opening on the water tank was large enough that you could put your hand inside to clean it out....</li>
            <li> One call to Hamilton Beach and a new one was on its way, free of charge.  </li>
            <li> Although we really like our Slant/Fin for the baby&#x27;s room, this unit is much easier to clean.  </li>
            <li> You MUST follow the maintenance instructions EXACTLY to avoid problems with filter odor.  </li>
            <li> Recently, I found that I if vary the place of the humidifier to be more central to the room, it works much more efficiently.</li>
            <li> thought about returning it within the first week</li>
            <li> With such high-maintenance storage instructions, many owners will have units that stay out and get grimy inside.  </li>
            <li> They really should make it easy to thoroughly clean all of the internal parts.    </li>
            <li> It appears to work pretty well.  </li>
            <li> She also claimed that she couldn&#x27;t tell any difference by having it on, at first anyway.  </li>
            <li> She also claimed that she couldn&#x27;t tell any difference by having it on, at first anyway.  </li>
            <li> and I was getting pretty dehydrated from the drying heat in my apartment.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s the first I bought</li>
            <li> Why could they not simply provide a flip-up-to-open cover on the top of the tank to avoid these problems?  </li>
            <li> We live in a very dry climate in Texas and this humidifier can keep certain rooms at a good humidity level.  </li>
            <li> The up-side is that - without a lock or latch to secure these two pieces more tightly, lifting the jug for refills is a one-handed</li>
            <li> The up-side is that - without a lock or latch to secure these two pieces more tightly, lifting the jug for refills is a one-handed</li>
            <li> I was concerned at first because I noticed no mist coming from the fan, but I am absolutely certain its evaporation is working up to par because of the results I get.</li>
            <li> months.&lt;br /&gt;The large capacity of the water tank is good enough for 24 hour operation (on quiet setting).</li>
            <li> Well, they may be dishwasher safe, but the tank is TOO BIG to fit in a standard dishwasher.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d buy another just like it if I had use for another one, but this pretty much does the whole house.</li>
            <li> This water in the tray is taken up graduallyby the filter (which sits under the motorized fan), to generate the humidity when the fan is on.&lt;br /&gt;The digital panel is easy to read.</li>
            <li> Well, the humidifier certainly humidifies.  </li>
            <li> I did like the Humidistat feature and the large tank, although cumbersome to fill</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m off to find a large capacity ultrasonic humidifier.</li>
            <li> It has a large water tank.&lt;BR&gt;5.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The water container is a smart design.  </li>
            <li> We changed the filter and it was back to working fine.  </li>
            <li> Else, it&#x27;s back to the drawing board.&lt;br /&gt;ADDENDUM: The replacement humidifer works fine.  </li>
            <li> The filter is holding up just fine after 4 weeks, despite daily use.</li>
            <li> Although no cool mist-based fan can be SILENT, I am impressed with just how quiet this lowest setting is.  </li>
            <li> Underneath the fan unit resides the filter which is easy to replace and sits almost too easily into a small molded, shaped guide in the bottom tray.  </li>
            <li> The new one came with a tank made of a different kind of plastic - slightly more rubbery and not so stiff.  </li>
            <li> But overall, I liked the digital control panel and that it covered a large area.  </li>
            <li> It clicks on very silently.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> As a light sleeper, that was enough to steer me to the Hamilton Beach.  </li>
            <li> Upon setup, the machine ran quite smoothly and quietly...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if all humidifiers go through filters this fast</li>
            <li> The filters have to be replaced about once a week, otherwise they get moldy and start to smell (and who wants to breathe in mold?)&lt;BR&gt;2.</li>
            <li> However, I purchased this unit thinking that the digital humidity level operation would work precisely.  </li>
            <li> I bought this humidifier a month ago after much research.</li>
            <li> This requires the user to slide the jug straight up when removing it for refills - otherwise</li>
            <li> This requires the user to slide the jug straight up when removing it for refills - otherwise</li>
            <li> It is rather noisy when the water tray is filling (it makes a glugging sound that sounds like someone knocking on your window in the middle of the night- spooky!), but for ease of use and maintenance, it can&#x27;t be beat.  </li>
            <li> I find it to be nice and quiet at the low setting</li>
            <li> We baby these water tanks to prevent this, but all to no avail;  believe me, this all gets very old, very fast.  </li>
            <li> For one, if you want to humidify an entire house or very large apartment/duplex, either buy a bigger model or get more than one.</li>
            <li> itself.&lt;br /&gt;The 3 non-motorized plastic pieces can be placed in a dishwasher, but you will need a dishwasher with a fairly deep main section in order for the 3-gallon jug to fit.  </li>
            <li> Finally, the 3-gallon container is very easy to fill, but because of its depth, you will need to have either a reasonably deep basin kitchen or utility sink or fill the jug up in a bathtub.  </li>
            <li> I got this humifier thinking I would be able to get away with filling it every other day.</li>
            <li> Much better than other humidifiers I&#x27;ve used.    </li>
            <li> i have been bying smaller humidifiers for a number of years, never satisfied with the results.i bought the best that i could find, locally, until i got on amazon, and started a search.</li>
            <li> for the main unit, the humidistat works very well.  </li>
            <li> I wish all of these humidifers were easier to fill, but this one is pretty typical and the cap or whatever you&#x27;d call it has an easy grip handle.  </li>
            <li> Although I bought it for my bedroom, I had no problem running it in my main living area which is well over the 1200 sq ft rating.  </li>
            <li> We like being able to set the actual humidity level we want, and seeing the current level.</li>
            <li> Two main problems with this model:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is sooooooo quiet in the low mode and it easily keeps our large bedroom up to 50% humidity.  </li>
            <li> If you need to quickly get the humidity up in a room you can turn it on high then run it at normal or the quiet settings.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this humidifier to anyone.</li>
            <li> I talked my husband into trying this humidifier, and have to recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even let it run on high all day once in awhile, and all that does is use up all the water faster.</li>
            <li> When I ratchet it up to a high humidity level, I get lots of moist air.  </li>
            <li> I love this product, I&#x27;ve had other humidifiers that don&#x27;t work nearly as well.  </li>
            <li> While Hamilton Beach is very responsive in sending us out new tanks every time ours begins to leak, EACH AND EVERY new tank ALWAYS begins to leak within the two month period.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;completely dry, sealed and in its original box\\&quot;, when not used for over two weeks.  </li>
            <li> other part of the unit, housing the motor and fan, comes off easily too.</li>
            <li> I clean it thoroughly once a week, letting it dry well and am getting 4 or 5 weeks use from each filter.</li>
            <li> digital display is also well worth it, as it will cycle on and off if the room becomes humid and you can set it to your comfort level.  </li>
            <li> Of course it is much more convenient to do so after removing the heavy water tank.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the old, harder plastic cracked too easily or something.  </li>
            <li> The water tank on the back has a sturdy handle and pulls right up.  </li>
            <li> The motor is quiet - not silent, but it is in the bedroom and we sleep fine.  </li>
            <li> Another bonus, the filters are cheap compared to other models that I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> It keeps our 3 back bedrooms humidified nicely just as long as you don&#x27;t open the windows of course.</li>
            <li> agonized on a new humidifier for weeks looking at review after review.  </li>
            <li> The new tank isok, but one time after filling it up, the plug came out and I had to sop up a couple of gallons of water off my bedroom floor.  </li>
            <li> well the thing is new</li>
            <li> so it was just stuck from being new.</li>
            <li> Also, order the filters designed for it, not the cheap imitation ones at Walmart; they do not filter.</li>
            <li> It makes the same tiny gurgling sound periodically during operation too.</li>
            <li> Low operating sound on quiet setting&lt;BR&gt;3.</li>
            <li> The lowest fan level is very quiet, the higher ones are not.</li>
            <li> First, the humidity can only be increased/decreased at 5% increments.  </li>
            <li> This is the first and only unit where that has not been a problem.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> This is the first and only unit where that has not been a problem.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s about the same, if not, a little better, than our other humidifier.  </li>
            <li> Not really a bothersome noise, its gentle susurations are not disturbing to sleep.</li>
            <li> Also, the cap is so secure that I end up hurting my knuckles every single time I open it</li>
            <li> We have had many great humidifiers, both large and small, cheap and expensive, and NONE have been as poorly designed and constructed as this Hamilton Beach model&#x27;s water tank.  </li>
            <li> It appears to me that some people purchased this product expecting a miracle cure for their dry winter air without realizing that it&#x27;s just a machine and dependant on many other factors.</li>
            <li> Due to the fan, this humidifier is not extremely quiet but we do run it in the livingroom and can easily listen to the tv or radio over it.</li>
            <li> I know I had it set up correctly - that was clearly defined in the manual,</li>
            <li> This model also included a filter system to help clear out dust and pollen.</li>
            <li> We took it out of our bedroom and put it in the hall, it was still loud.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bought mine directly from Babies R Us and paid $62.99.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a vast improvement over a much inferior humidifier</li>
            <li> We purchased this humidifer for our baby&#x27;s room, and so far it has worked quite well.  </li>
            <li> I have a 4 month old daughter, and living in the desert</li>
            <li> Also, it doen&#x27;t shut off if water runs out, so you want to frequently check for water level.&lt;BR</li>
            <li> This wouldn&#x27;t matter if the click wasn&#x27;t so loud...</li>
            <li> no sign of it so far.</li>
            <li> After five years, the old unit was gunked up on the inside beyond cleaning.  </li>
            <li> then my old Holmes humidifier.</li>
            <li> old baby.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is a knock against the product as much as it might be a problem related to our water hardness (which is notorious) in our area.&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t have a sensitive throat and sinuses like I do.  </li>
            <li> On the highest speed, it&#x27;s about as loud as having an osculating fan going in your room.  </li>
            <li> We followed the instructions completely, but it just didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> I only fill it up every other day at most during driest times (outside humidity &#x3D; 9% today!)  </li>
            <li> So, your mileage may vary, but keep in mind that if you are a very light sleeper and bothered by slight noises, there probably is NO humidifier that will be quiet enough for</li>
            <li> In the summer it can be extremely humid here so it rarely runs.  </li>
            <li> the Quiet mode was very loud!....</li>
            <li> There are 3 speed settings; quiet, med, and high.</li>
            <li> To open the tank for re-filling, first you have to flip the tank upside down, then you have to use A LOT OF FORCE to twist the large cap.  </li>
            <li> every nook and cranny proves not worth the effort.  </li>
            <li> every nook and cranny proves not worth the effort.  </li>
            <li> It is very quiet, it seems to be made very well, and is relatively sturdy.</li>
            <li> As far as the sound, I usually have mine set on the lowest speed which is quiet.  </li>
            <li> Reading the other reviews, I&#x27;m not the first to experience quality problems.  </li>
            <li> We have VERY hard water and the filters don&#x27;t need to be changed as often as with most humidifiers which is a long-run cost savings.  </li>
            <li> , the noise is not overwhelming and is similar to any white noise often used to put and keep kids asleep, I had no problem refilling it, my 2 year-old even liked to help, finally if you turn the filters faithfully once a week 2-3 filters should last the season.   </li>
            <li> The tank is completely sealed, so after filling it you can carry it back without risk of spilling anything.  </li>
            <li> On quiet, it creates just enough white noise that our daughter sleeps very well.  </li>
            <li> certainly quieter than virtually every other manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> Although you will have to fill it every day or two if you live in the desert (as I do), it lasts longer than the others and the filters seem to work for a long time too.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking of buying another smaller digital unit for the bedroom and using this for the main area so that my entire house is humidified.</li>
            <li> Usually I simply throw out humidifiers after a season or two since disassembling them enough to clear</li>
            <li> Usually I simply throw out humidifiers after a season or two since disassembling them enough to clear</li>
            <li> I woke up with no dry throat.  </li>
            <li> I was actually surprised that it lasted as long as it did (almost 3 weeks) but could have been cuz I used my vapor steam cleaner on it once a week.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s somewhat simple to fill up, but since you have to flip the tank upside down to fill it, it&#x27;s cumbersome to fill in a bathtub, which is the only place other than the kitchen sink that the tank will fit for.  </li>
            <li> secondly, the cap on the fill hole is pretty tight (the upside is that it is spill-proof)</li>
            <li> The unit comes in 4 pieces; the large fan unit section that contains the controls, the translucent 3-gallon water container, the bottom tray that both of the previously-mentioned pieces slide upright into and a hidden water reservoir tray inside the bottom tray</li>
            <li> Second, I have not been able to reach my desired humidity of 50%, even when I&#x27;ve blasted it at HIGH.  </li>
            <li> If you live in a place bigger than the recommended square footage, you&#x27;ll have to keep doors closed in the room (like a bedroom) for this humidifier to have an effect in that space.</li>
            <li> New filters are flattened for shipping and need to be reshaped into a cylinder before replacing them - and filters seem to last longer than I expected at 1 filter every 5-6 weeks - even after which they do not look gross, moldy or dirty.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The machine is far from quiet on any setting.&lt;BR&gt;2.It humidifies far less square footage than specified, even on the highest setting.</li>
            <li> Either way, 3 gallons of water is easy to heft for an adult, but may be difficult for an elderly parent or friend (consider a smaller capacity unit if this is the case).  </li>
            <li> Instead of a steady readout, it bounces around up or down a percent or two.  </li>
            <li> At first the low setting may seem noisy especially if there is very little ambient noise around you</li>
            <li> I sleep with the unit on the floor in the same room I am in, slightly below the level of our bed, and a mere 10 feet away and am very pleased with the quiet hum of the lowest setting.  </li>
            <li> After you change the setting by pressing either the UP or DOWN humidity buttons to increment the humidity level in 5% increments, the display flashes for 3 seconds after which the unit responds (either turns on or off) based on the new setting.  </li>
            <li> I took it apart looked it over and gave it another try (on a towel in a less new room).</li>
            <li> Sometimes it cycles on for one second, off for one sec, on for one second, off for one second, etc.  </li>
            <li> I kept the old, hard tank from the old unit and am using that now.  </li>
            <li> large tank should mean less fillups, however, I found myself filling up nearly every night, and I only used the humidifier at \\&quot;quiet\\&quot; when I went to bed.  </li>
            <li> I turned it over every single time I refilled the tank (that&#x27;d be daily for those keeping track at home) as the instructions recommend</li>
            <li> Depending on the day and how oftern the air conditioning comes on, I have to refill generally every other day.   </li>
            <li> After looking at other reviews, I decided to purchase this model which has digital controls for the humidity setting of your preference (as well as the current room humidity level).  </li>
            <li> When the weather gets dry, our entire house is way too dry.</li>
            <li> But the LCD display and operation is not worth the extra cost, above the cheaper models.  </li>
            <li> So far, it hasn&#x27;t shown any mechanical trouble.</li>
            <li> (i&#x27;m in nyc, we&#x27;re talking SMALL) and even when running it at full throttle the humidistat never got up past 35 other than when I showered with the bathroom door open.</li>
            <li> We live at 7000ft altitude and humidifiers are necessary due to the very dry mountain air all year round.</li>
            <li> The middle level is quieter than our previous humidifier&#x27;s low level.  </li>
            <li> I live in Alabama and in the winter, I usually have to refill it every to every day.  </li>
            <li> I have had other even cheaper humidifiers and sometimes forgot they were on because they were so quiet.  </li>
            <li> I would buy other brand in future.</li>
            <li> Stay away from this model, or any other Hamilton Beach unit that uses this same water tank design.</li>
            <li> and I still had a dry nose and mouth</li>
            <li> I want to say that I also got relief from my dry skin and chapped lips.</li>
            <li> In the winter, with heat on, we are sleeping in extremely dry air.</li>
            <li> Not wanting to go through another winter with dry skin, I decided to look into purchasing a humidifier.  </li>
            <li> skin is still dry, but I don&#x27;t think it is AS dry as it would have been.  </li>
            <li> Also, I haven&#x27;t woken up with a dry throat since I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t dry anymore..</li>
            <li> LET THIS AWSOME DEVICE HELP YOU DURING THOSE DRY SPELLS.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;PRO/CON depending on whether you live in hot or cold climate</li>
            <li> I use it all day night long on the low setting and it uses up about half the amount of water in the tank.</li>
            <li> I found the top on the Hamilton Beach humidifier tank very difficult to get off at times.</li>
            <li> I tried everything, then I pressed down on the digital read-out area, the unit started up!</li>
            <li> My apartment is just outside the recommendation so the humidifier runs a little longer, but the QuietMist setting 24/7 only has me filling the tank every other day so as not to let it fall below a quarter of a tank.</li>
            <li> I especially felt relief from the slight sinus headache</li>
            <li> The fan started moving a little and then finally worked</li>
            <li> But after a few minutes it sounds just like a dull whirring sound that is hardly objectionable.</li>
            <li> My other complaint is that I&#x27;m having to buy a new filter.  </li>
            <li> , surely they can&#x27;t all be this bad, can they?  </li>
            <li> only complaint is that no one locally sells the filter</li>
            <li> biggest complaint is the loud click that the relay switch inside it makes as it turns itself on and off.  </li>
            <li> I feel opposite of some of the reviews, my husband(who is a heavy sleeper)</li>
            <li> I had a few years back.  </li>
            <li> Some days we leave it on with the door closed while we&#x27;re at work or whatever.  </li>
            <li> There is a wide fill hole at the bottom of tank for refilling water.</li>
            <li> I do wish it had a latch, because you need to be careful not to knock it off when removing the water tank.</li>
            <li> humidity in the winter and white noise all year round.  </li>
            <li> Once it was about 2/3 empty for some reason it decided to simply empty itself onto whatever it was sitting...</li>
            <li> Refills are every two days for me - but we only use this in the evening and sleeping hours, so constant usage would likely require daily refills.&lt;br /&gt;Every once in while, you may hear a slight gurgle as air bubbles float up from the bottom of the container while the humidifier is in use, but this also is hardly noticeable - especially since it is usually quieter than the fan itself on the lowest setting - and flat up impossible to hear if the fan is set to medium or high.  </li>
            <li> Not only does this mean chaning the water less often, the bottles are designed such that they have no moving parts.  </li>
            <li> A filter typically lasts almost an entire season here in dry Arizona (usually October til April</li>
            <li> Ours has no problem reaching 50% humidity, unlike problems mentioned in other reviews.  </li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews I wanted to throw my 2 cents onto the pile.</li>
            <li> The color may be due the mineral deposit in water.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about that other reviewer, what they might have been doing to get cracks, but my fill tank is fine.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave the floor and walls wet!  </li>
            <li> In other words, it was not humidifying the air.  </li>
            <li> Very minimal gurgle...hardly noticable on this unit.</li>
            <li> HAVE TROUBLE SLEEPING BECAUSE OF DRY WEATHER, OR DO YOU DRINK GALLONS OF WATER AT NIGHT?</li>
            <li> The fill hole is at the bottom of the 3-gallon jug, but seals tightly by way of an integrated plunger built into the wide screw-release fill cap.  </li>
            <li> We have worked it pretty hard, living in Las Vegas, but I would consider a less expensive one next time.  </li>
            <li> I would like to add that recently, I knocked the water tank against the sink - fairly hard (I slipped) - and the bottom corner of the tank cracked, and was leaking.  </li>
            <li> I think the fill tank is hard to open.  </li>
            <li> However, after it operated for about 2 minutes, the humidity gauge pegged at &gt;60%, shutting down the machine.  </li>
            <li> You need to flip the filter upside down to prolong life.  </li>
            <li> addition to the UP humidity button and DOWN humidity buttons</li>
            <li> Follow directions for no more than 45% humidity, rotate the filter and dry it out every couple of days</li>
            <li> I got back and what looked like the entire contents of the reservoir had spilled onto my brand new Pergo flooring and expensive raw maple wall trim!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a few uses, the cap to the H2O reservoir became so hard to open</li>
            <li> I also discovered today that mold was accumulating in the filter that I replaced less than a month ago.&lt;BR</li>
            <li> Using another humidity gauge, I verified that humidity in the room was less than 30%.  </li>
            <li> I wake up with less throat irritation and without stuffed up sinuses.  </li>
            <li> The noise factor is less when you put it in \\&quot;quiet\\&quot; mode and after a dy or so, you just get used to it.  </li>
            <li> am not sure what the reviewers that reviewed this product badly expected, having to refill it often</li>
            <li> Cap on fill hole is tight.</li>
            <li> , I have one exceptionally minor complaint: the two largest units (the water jug and the fan unit) slide too easily away from the base.  </li>
            <li> , I have one exceptionally minor complaint: the two largest units (the water jug and the fan unit) slide too easily away from the base.  </li>
            <li> It gets really filthy very quickly, even after turning it over every time I fill the tank like the directions say.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The base is easy to lift if the unit needs to be moved.</li>
            <li> I noticed the fan was twitching a little bit</li>
            <li> The cap on the water tank is VERY hard to open.  </li>
            <li> For hypersensitive people (like my mom) where any noise would be too much noise, I&#x27;m afraid NO cool-mist system will be sufficient.  </li>
            <li> So, now that the filter is history I&#x27;ve hit my tolerance level for being annoyed; been to a handful of different pharmacies and hardware stores and can&#x27;t find a replacement!</li>
            <li> I have used this humidifier for a few months now</li>
            <li> However, at $10.00 per replacement filter, it wasn&#x27;t something we wanted to replace every few weeks.</li>
            <li> no matter how carefully and delicately you fill it and move it about --</li>
            <li> When the water tank is replaced on the base tray, some water from the container fills up the tray, making a gurgling sound.</li>
            <li> While I am not a light sleeper by any means I found the noise level of this humidifier to be quite tolerable.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money or your time.  </li>
            <li> A few humid days with the hamilton beach humidifier to make the water sit, and</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s way up to speed after a few seconds.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had ANY problems with spilling, leakage or difficulty opening the fill cap as at least one other reviewer has mentioned.  </li>
            <li> and yet it&#x27;s already getting stiff.  </li>
            <li> Being the clutz that I am, I&#x27;m always making a mess, but not with this model!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already shipped this unit back to Amazon.com and purchased a less expensive Holmes model from Target, which you can also purchase through Amazon.com.  </li>

            <li> I read in one review where it was hard to refill the tank in the tub since you have to turn the tank upside down to refill it, but I&#x27;ve never had a problem refilling the tank.  </li>
            <li> After about 3-4 weeks it starts smelling pretty bad and needs to be changed.  </li>
            <li> This is due to the shallow crevice they sit in and the lack of a clip, latch or groove that would otherwise &#x60;lock&#x27; the two units into place.  </li>

            <li> br /&gt;humidity is , and what it should be.so i can tell when the humidity needs to be changed, and i can do it, myself.if you have been searching for one, and you are tired of dry skin, throats,and sinus problems, this is what you need.</li>
            <li> I have sinus problems and all of the symptoms I usually exhibit during the winter months sleeping in my bedroom, were no longer exhibited.</li>
            <li> Yep, it was definitely quiet!&lt;BR&gt;CLEARLY, there was something wrong with this unit!&lt;BR</li>
            <li> I keep it in my bedroom which is really really small</li>
            <li> Not many places carry them.&lt;BR&gt;4.</li>
            <li> On the \\&quot;quiet\\&quot; setting the water usually lasts 24+ hours before needing a refill.&lt;BR&gt;</li>
            <li> If you decide to purchase this item, buy several replacement filters.&lt;BR&gt;4.The tank cap is difficult to remove and appears to have been designed for the hands of a small child, but a child with the strength of an adult.&lt;BR&gt;5.</li>
            <li> The humidifier&#x27;s reading is always lower, usually by 8 to 10 percent.</li>
            <li> The only reason I give 4 instead of 5 stars is that the humidistat failed after 3 years of use.</li>
            <li> others are so small.  </li>
            <li> Even though the cap is hard to get off, it isn&#x27;t impossible and its something I can live with.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to tell if the humidifier has helped or not.    </li>
            <li> Filters are hard to find.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find the unit noisy when it is running, however at times it does make a random &#x27;glugging&#x27; sound which is annoying.</li>
            <li> If all else fails, the mouth of the jug is fairly wide (5\\&quot; across), so a petite hand, wrist and arm could reach inside to scrub the unit if that was ever needed (it doesn&#x27;t seem to get dirty, moldy or gross in the time I&#x27;ve used the unit).  </li>
            <li> (it doesn&#x27;t seem to get dirty, moldy or gross in the time I&#x27;ve used the unit).  </li>
            <li> But, if you have weak hand strength, this unit might be hard to work with.  </li>
            <li> and I thought it was loud and annoying.  </li>
            <li> This seems like misleading advertising at the least!</li>
            <li> after 4 - 5 frustrating nights refilling it, I just didn&#x27;t tighten to the max.  </li>
            <li> And my wife and I are getting tired of filling up the tank all the time.   </li>
            <li> Even worse, my sensor seems to have gotten the jitters over the years.  </li>
            <li> simply because I hate shelling out 28 bucks every month for filters.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed that after 1 year, it is started to not work well; beeping a lot, fading digital display and randomly coming on and off in a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> As long as care is taken not to slant the base tray, there is no leakage or spill.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive.  </li>
            <li> The filters are WAY too expensive.  </li>
            <li> &lt;BR&gt;3.It eats filters, which are difficult to find by the way.</li>
            <li> It is relatively expensive.</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the unit for feeble people.</li>
            <li> Motor unit is not securely latched to base tray to prevent accidentally knocking it off when removing water tank.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it did not.  </li>
            <li> After just a couple of weeks it looked all broken down and we thought it might need replacing and it smelled awful.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the unit DID NOT WORK~!</li>
            <li> (This isn&#x27;t that bad since the humidifier shuts off when it reaches your desired humidity level.)  </li>
            <li> I was still refilling it about every 22 hrs and yet still wake up every day thinking someone has been stuffing my head with steel wool, although that was an improvement from the when I didn&#x27;t have a humidifier and thought someone was pouring crazy glue into my sinuses every night!</li>
            <li> one thing that I really hate about this unit is the filter.  </li>
            <li> Boy what a bad purchase...do NOT buy this humidifier!</li>
            <li> I was VERY disappointed to have received an item that was defective.</li>
            <li> VERY annoying.  </li>
            <li> But that is not the worst part to these models:  </li>
            <li> PIECE OF CRAP!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> the Quiet mode was very loud!....and I still had a dry nose and mouth it didnt feel like the humidity was there at all!...I tryed to adjust it and it would only still stay at 55%??? and the filter looked like it needed to be changed after a week?..at 12 dollars a filter, I dont think so.....wouldnt recomend it!...</li>
            <li> After looking at other reviews, I decided to purchase this model which has digital controls for the humidity setting of your preference (as well as the current room humidity level).  I think this is an important feature so that you don&#x27;t &#x27;over humidify&#x27;.  The automatic shutoff feature is nice as well.  Just set and forget.  The whisper feature is just that...It clicks on very silently.&lt;br /&gt;The unit was very simple to use and operate.  I had mine running in about 5 minutes.   Although I bought it for my bedroom, I had no problem running it in my main living area which is well over the 1200 sq ft rating.  I&#x27;m thinking of buying another smaller digital unit for the bedroom and using this for the main area so that my entire house is humidified.</li>
            <li> Well, the humidifier certainly humidifies.  The tank size is generous, the product is easy to assemble and clean, the humidistat is accurate and easy to use, and the whole product seems to be very well built.  &lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  You MUST follow the maintenance instructions EXACTLY to avoid problems with filter odor.  This is true with any \\&quot;wick\\&quot; humidifier.  This involves changing the water once a day and sanitizing the tank and tank tray once a week.  The wick lasts for several months if you take care of it properly.</li>
            <li> The humidifier works as advertised and the digital controls are great.  I feel for some of the folks who have troulbe unlocking the water bin... after 4 - 5 frustrating nights refilling it, I just didn&#x27;t tighten to the max.  Now I have no problem refilling!  No leakage either.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, here in NJ, I go through 1 filter a month as the filter gets stinky and moldy in that time.  This thing is on 24/7 but I&#x27;m using it cover my townhouse of about 1200sf.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that no one locally sells the filter so I have to plan ahead to buy.</li>
            <li> I feel opposite of some of the reviews, my husband(who is a heavy sleeper) and I thought it was loud and annoying.  All I heard all night was the constant rotation of the fan.  I have had other even cheaper humidifiers and sometimes forgot they were on because they were so quiet.  We ran the humidifier upstairs and could hear it downstairs with the TV on.  We took it out of our bedroom and put it in the hall, it was still loud.  VERY annoying.  I did like the Humidistat feature and the large tank, although cumbersome to fill I didn&#x27;t have to fill it every day so that was nice.</li>
            <li> Very good unit for the price.  Simple design and the critical parts that develope mold can be washed in the dishwasher. &lt;br /&gt;How good is that!  Priceless!  Follow directions for no more than 45% humidity, rotate the filter and dry it out every couple of days and everyone breathes easier.  Noise level of fan blower is very quiet at the medium and low range.  Simple design and tool to do a simple job.  Convection is a beautiful thing. &lt;br /&gt;Bought mine directly from Babies R Us and paid $62.99.</li>
            <li> I purchased this humidifier a month ago and have not regretted one minute. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It is sooooooo quiet in the low mode and it easily keeps our large bedroom up to 50% humidity.  Depending on the day and how oftern the air conditioning comes on, I have to refill generally every other day.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I agonized on a new humidifier for weeks looking at review after review.  The Vortex seemed to get good marks, but almost every reviewer said the \\&quot;glugging\\&quot; was unbelievably loud.  As a light sleeper, that was enough to steer me to the Hamilton Beach.  Very minimal gurgle...hardly noticable on this unit. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t think twice about buying another one.</li>
            <li> This humidifier is great, and within hours of use I noticed a considerable difference in the air quality of my bedroom. I have sinus problems and all of the symptoms I usually exhibit during the winter months sleeping in my bedroom, were no longer exhibited. I especially felt relief from the slight sinus headache I almost always had. I want to say that I also got relief from my dry skin and chapped lips. I was concerned at first because I noticed no mist coming from the fan, but I am absolutely certain its evaporation is working up to par because of the results I get. I dohave to change the filter more frequently than I anticipated. It would sure be lovely to have a humidifier with no upkeep, but I&#x27;ll gladly pay to replace the filters for the relief it provides. It is very easy to clean and I absolutely find it easy to fill. I have had it for several months now. I am currently using it alongside a room heater. It has balanced out the air humidity nicely. I would highly recommend this humidifier to anyone.</li>
            <li> I bought this humidifier in desperation after suffering from a lingering sore throat, waking up each morning parched from thirst.  It made a difference almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;It is a vast improvement over a much inferior humidifier I had a few years back.  The tank easily lasts a full 24 hours between refills, and it is easily placed on the top rack of the dishwasher for cleaning.  In fact the whole thing comes apart quite easily for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;The digital display is also well worth it, as it will cycle on and off if the room becomes humid and you can set it to your comfort level.  I find it to be nice and quiet at the low setting (actually kind of soothing as I go to sleep because it functions like white noise).&lt;br /&gt;An excellent product well worth the expense.</li>
            <li> I bought this humidifier based on the reviews and (mistakenly) thinking it was an ultrasonic humidifier.  I have a room that is 25x14 with 9 ft. ceilings.  Even at the highest level this humidifier doesn&#x27;t make a difference, except in the noise level - which is deafening.  At the lowest level it doesn&#x27;t work at all - even when I leave it on all the time.  &lt;BR&gt;I also discovered today that mold was accumulating in the filter that I replaced less than a month ago.&lt;BR&gt;Totally ineffective, is my impression of the machine.&lt;BR&gt;I&#x27;m off to find a large capacity ultrasonic humidifier.</li>
            <li> We purchased this humidifer for our baby&#x27;s room, and so far it has worked quite well.  Ours has no problem reaching 50% humidity, unlike problems mentioned in other reviews.  The only time it did not humidify properly was when the filter needed to be changed.  We changed the filter and it was back to working fine.  I don&#x27;t find the unit noisy when it is running, however at times it does make a random &#x27;glugging&#x27; sound which is annoying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through a million humidifiers and this is the best so far.  Although you will have to fill it every day or two if you live in the desert (as I do), it lasts longer than the others and the filters seem to work for a long time too.  I wish all of these humidifers were easier to fill, but this one is pretty typical and the cap or whatever you&#x27;d call it has an easy grip handle.  Another bonus, the filters are cheap compared to other models that I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> I bought this humidifier because Hamilton Beach advertises that the tank and tray are dishwasher safe and I assumed this meant that I could enjoy the convenience of cleaning the tank in the dishwasher. Well, they may be dishwasher safe, but the tank is TOO BIG to fit in a standard dishwasher. This seems like misleading advertising at the least!</li>
            <li> I have a 4 month old daughter, and living in the desert I knew I needed a good humidifier. I chose this model because of its features like the ability to select the desired humidity, see what the current level of humidity is, and the promise of the quiet motor/fan. When I recieved it, I was happy to see how easy it was to set up, and how easy it was to fill the tank. I got it all set up, selected my desired humidity level, and NOTHING hapenned. Unfortunately, the unit DID NOT WORK~! The fan would not engage no matter what level or setting I set. After reading through the book, I found nothing that addressed the lack of response from the system.&lt;BR&gt;Finally, I rechecked the unit set up. I know I had it set up correctly - that was clearly defined in the manual, but still nothing happened. I tried everything, then I pressed down on the digital read-out area, the unit started up! Great, except that when I let go, it turned off again. Yep, it was definitely quiet!&lt;BR&gt;CLEARLY, there was something wrong with this unit!&lt;BR&gt;I was VERY disappointed to have received an item that was defective.</li>
            <li> We live at 7000ft altitude and humidifiers are necessary due to the very dry mountain air all year round. In the winter, with heat on, we are sleeping in extremely dry air. We have  tried all kinds of cool air humidifiers and so far, this one is the best. We like being able to set the actual humidity level we want, and seeing the current level. The lowest fan level is very quiet, the higher ones are not. There is no indicator when water is low, so it is necessary to check the water level. We expect to change the filter every 6 weeks or so, which is not a problem.</li>
            <li> Generate good humids at desirable setting, but queit operation is NOT quiet!!  Also, it doen&#x27;t shut off if water runs out, so you want to frequently check for water level.&lt;BR&gt;I would buy other brand in future.</li>
            <li> This humidifier saved me from having a sinus infection last year.  Years prior, before I purchased this, I had sinus problems every year.  It&#x27;s WELL worth it to avoid doctor visits, and antibiotics.  You need to know this is designed, probably, for one room.  Don&#x27;t think you can buy this and it&#x27;ll work throughout your entire house.  I suggest keeping it in your bedroom and crank it up while you&#x27;re asleep.  That&#x27;s when you need it most anyway.  I love this product, I&#x27;ve had other humidifiers that don&#x27;t work nearly as well.  Also, order the filters designed for it, not the cheap imitation ones at Walmart; they do not filter.</li>
            <li> The humidifier is easily assembled and seems to be constructed of a quality material.  Upon setup, the machine ran quite smoothly and quietly...certainly quieter than virtually every other manufacturer.  However, after it operated for about 2 minutes, the humidity gauge pegged at &gt;60%, shutting down the machine.  Using another humidity gauge, I verified that humidity in the room was less than 30%.  As such, I have arranged for a replacement humidifier.  I&#x27;ll give Hamilton Beach one more shot to see what happens.  Else, it&#x27;s back to the drawing board.&lt;br /&gt;ADDENDUM: The replacement humidifer works fine.  It seems that the humidity gauge is still not the most accurate, but it works nonetheless once it starts going.  Recently, I found that I if vary the place of the humidifier to be more central to the room, it works much more efficiently.</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews I wanted to throw my 2 cents onto the pile. It appears to me that some people purchased this product expecting a miracle cure for their dry winter air without realizing that it&#x27;s just a machine and dependant on many other factors. For one, if you want to humidify an entire house or very large apartment/duplex, either buy a bigger model or get more than one. It lists the square footage it can cover effectively for a reason. If you live in a place bigger than the recommended square footage, you&#x27;ll have to keep doors closed in the room (like a bedroom) for this humidifier to have an effect in that space. My apartment is just outside the recommendation so the humidifier runs a little longer, but the QuietMist setting 24/7 only has me filling the tank every other day so as not to let it fall below a quarter of a tank. Plus, it can reach my setting of 45% without a problem. I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my skin, I don&#x27;t electrocute my cats anymore, and my tropical plants have perked up and multiplied. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because of the filters and how often they have to be replaced. I would prefer to be able to wash them periodically and save myself some money. The final word, though, if used correctly this is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before deciding on this particular humidifier, and I am glad we got the one we did. It is very quiet, it seems to be made very well, and is relatively sturdy. When the weather gets dry, our entire house is way too dry. Skin, furniture, houseplants...I talked my husband into trying this humidifier, and have to recommend it highly. I&#x27;d buy another just like it if I had use for another one, but this pretty much does the whole house. Hamilton Beach is still a good name.</li>
            <li> After 27 months of using an Evenflo cool mist humidifier, I purchased this model for my 27-month-old&#x27;s room.  So far, I love it!  (But please note, I&#x27;ve only had it for 3 weeks)  The middle level is quieter than our previous humidifier&#x27;s low level.  I&#x27;ve had no problems filling the tank, and found that it needs refilling every 2 to 3 nights, going 12 to 14 hours each night!  That&#x27;s about the same, if not, a little better, than our other humidifier.  The filter seems to cost about as much as similar filters...and I haven&#x27;t had to change mine yet, and it doesn&#x27;t appear that it needs it anytime soon.  I plan on purchasing the same unit for our baby on-the-way!</li>
            <li> I got this humifier thinking I would be able to get away with filling it every other day. I keep it in my bedroom which is really really small (i&#x27;m in nyc, we&#x27;re talking SMALL) and even when running it at full throttle the humidistat never got up past 35 other than when I showered with the bathroom door open. I was still refilling it about every 22 hrs and yet still wake up every day thinking someone has been stuffing my head with steel wool, although that was an improvement from the when I didn&#x27;t have a humidifier and thought someone was pouring crazy glue into my sinuses every night! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Filling the tank is a pain, doesn&#x27;t fit in a sink so have to lean into the tub and hope I don&#x27;t topple forward and smash my head against the soap dish. Also, the cap is so secure that I end up hurting my knuckles every single time I open it (and I swear, I&#x27;m not a wimp). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I thought about returning it within the first week but there aren&#x27;t too many alternatives I would even consider and I figured I shouldn&#x27;t expect a humidifier to be total perfection. So, I kept it and no sooner had I thrown out the box then I ran into my next problem... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The filter. I was actually surprised that it lasted as long as it did (almost 3 weeks) but could have been cuz I used my vapor steam cleaner on it once a week. So, now that the filter is history I&#x27;ve hit my tolerance level for being annoyed; been to a handful of different pharmacies and hardware stores and can&#x27;t find a replacement! Sure, I can order a bunch of them online and be set thru the winter but I think if I&#x27;m gonna invest big bucks in filters, that I might just try to design my own \\&quot;perma-wick\\&quot; (like the hunter care free type) and see how it goes from there.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Not wanting to go through another winter with dry skin, I decided to look into purchasing a humidifier.  After much research, I decided on the Hamilton Beach 05521 TrueAir Cool Mist Humidifier.  I have used this humidifier for a few months now and it&#x27;s hard to tell if the humidifier has helped or not.    &lt;br /&gt;My skin is still dry, but I don&#x27;t think it is AS dry as it would have been.  The humidifier runs 24/7 on quiet.  &lt;br /&gt;The digital readout is very nice, I can&#x27;t imagine one of these without a readout.  The thing is though, it almost never raises the humidity above 35-40%.  I&#x27;ve even let it run on high all day once in awhile, and all that does is use up all the water faster. Even on quiet, I have to fill the tank twice a day.  And my wife and I are getting tired of filling up the tank all the time.   &lt;br /&gt;The one thing that I really hate about this unit is the filter.  It gets really filthy very quickly, even after turning it over every time I fill the tank like the directions say.  After about 3-4 weeks it starts smelling pretty bad and needs to be changed.  At ten bucks a pop, I would expect the filters to last a lot longer. &lt;br /&gt;If I would have been able to try this unit out for a month before purchasing it, I would have returned it and kept looking around for something else because of the filter.  I don&#x27;t know if all humidifiers go through filters this fast, surely they can&#x27;t all be this bad, can they?  &lt;br /&gt;Other than the filter, it&#x27;s not a bad unit.  And I would definitely recommend getting a unit with a digital readout so you can see what the humidity level is before and after you use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for 2 years now.  It is quiet, but not silent.  It is reasonably easy to fill, but it emties about once a day and that does become a chore quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint is the loud click that the relay switch inside it makes as it turns itself on and off.  Even worse, my sensor seems to have gotten the jitters over the years.  Instead of a steady readout, it bounces around up or down a percent or two.  This makes the machine turn itself on and off quite often.  Sometimes it cycles on for one second, off for one sec, on for one second, off for one second, etc.  This wouldn&#x27;t matter if the click wasn&#x27;t so loud...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give it 4 stars, but since mine seems to be on its death bed already I&#x27;m giving it 3.</li>
            <li> I have this humidifier for 3 month now and running 24 hours a day. I have to refill water almost  twice a day for 1200sq ft apartment . It&#x27;s been great so far. I used to get  rashes  and eczema  during winter- no sign of it so far. I woke up with no dry throat.  Easy cleanup- I wash it with mild soap and water once a week and no mineral buildup. You need to flip the filter upside down to prolong life.  &lt;br /&gt;Cons: I have to replace filter ($10) about once a month since it gets all yellow and grosslooking. The color may be due the mineral deposit in water.</li>
            <li> (This review refers model (5519).  Same review applies,     this model just has a bigger holding tank...)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been searching for a good humidifier (at the right price) for a long time... Finally, here it is! One that can control humidity level and give me a digital read out of the current humidity. This model also has a nice size water tank that can be filled without taking the whole unit to the sink. This model also included a filter system to help clear out dust and pollen. A nice size fan pushes the air to circulate the whole room. It also shuts on and off automatically, to keep the desired humidity level. There are 3 speed settings; quiet, med, and high. The high makes a good amount a sound, but I only use it when no one is in the room and need a boost of humidity. Quiet is just that... Like a portable fan at low speed. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This product is extremely easy to use, fill and clean.  The water tank on the back has a sturdy handle and pulls right up.  The tank is completely sealed, so after filling it you can carry it back without risk of spilling anything.  It holds enough water for a day or two, which is nice.  The filter is easy to change - lift up the front housing and drop it in.  The motor is quiet - not silent, but it is in the bedroom and we sleep fine.  Dialing a particular humidity is great.  It turns itself on and off to maintain that level - you just dial and leave it alone.  It keeps our 10x18 bedroom at 50% no matter the weather.  Much better than other humidifiers I&#x27;ve used.    October 2004:  Replacment Tank.  I would like to add that recently, I knocked the water tank against the sink - fairly hard (I slipped) - and the bottom corner of the tank cracked, and was leaking.  One call to Hamilton Beach and a new one was on its way, free of charge.  Now *that* is customer service.    November 2005:  Repurchase.  After five years, the old unit was gunked up on the inside beyond cleaning.  The instructions say to store it, \\&quot;completely dry, sealed and in its original box\\&quot;, when not used for over two weeks.  I never bothered (who has time for all that?), so it was out in the room permanently for 5 years.  Of course, it collected dust and grime on the fan blades and inside the housing.  It was not possible to disassemble the unit for cleaning - I tried but it looks like once put together, it was never meant to be taken apart by anyone, not even a technician.  With such high-maintenance storage instructions, many owners will have units that stay out and get grimy inside.  They really should make it easy to thoroughly clean all of the internal parts.    That said, I purchased another of these units.  The new one came with a tank made of a different kind of plastic - slightly more rubbery and not so stiff.  Perhaps the old, harder plastic cracked too easily or something.  The new tank isok, but one time after filling it up, the plug came out and I had to sop up a couple of gallons of water off my bedroom floor.  I kept the old, hard tank from the old unit and am using that now.  It works fine.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS HUMIDIFIER!  All I want is a basic humidifier that can put some moisture into the air....I was quite pleased to see that the opening on the water tank was large enough that you could put your hand inside to clean it out....&lt;br /&gt;After a few uses, the cap to the H2O reservoir became so hard to open that I had to have my husband open it every night for me...trust me, I am no weakling, I even tried prying it open with various objects to no avail....this product is great except for the cap!  Boy what a bad purchase...do NOT buy this humidifier!</li>
            <li> i have been bying smaller humidifiers for a number of years, never satisfied with the results.i bought the best that i could find, locally, until i got on amazon, and started a search. &lt;br /&gt;they found me just what i needed,and i bought it, and am well satisfied with this product. &lt;br /&gt;its the 4 gallon true air humidifier, and i wouldn&#x27;t take anything for it. it has digital controls,that tell you what the  &lt;br /&gt;humidity is , and what it should be.so i can tell when the humidity needs to be changed, and i can do it, myself.if you have been searching for one, and you are tired of dry skin, throats,and sinus problems, this is what you need. &lt;br /&gt;THANKS AMAZON, FOR GETTING ME A REAL GOOD THING!</li>
            <li> This has been a great humidifier for the past year.  Sure the filters have to be replaced and for the most part, are easier to find online.  But overall, I liked the digital control panel and that it covered a large area.  We had it in our family room and would move it to the children&#x27;s rooms when needed.  The gurgling noise didn&#x27;t bother me.  I am very disappointed that after 1 year, it is started to not work well; beeping a lot, fading digital display and randomly coming on and off in a few seconds.  It&#x27;s like it knew when the warranty was up.  We have worked it pretty hard, living in Las Vegas, but I would consider a less expensive one next time.  Anyone need a couple of filters?</li>
            <li> I bought this humidifier 2 weeks ago and am very happy that it is quieter then my old Holmes humidifier. I use it on the quiet setting all day, and I only have to fill it once a day.&lt;BR&gt;I would suggest buying extra filters when you order.</li>
            <li> I like this humidifier.  We&#x27;ve had it for about about two months now.  It appears to work pretty well.  I can&#x27;t comment on the accuracy of the humidity gauge because I don&#x27;t have another to check it with.  But, I will say that I can feel the difference in the room when it&#x27;s on.  Some days we leave it on with the door closed while we&#x27;re at work or whatever.  (This isn&#x27;t that bad since the humidifier shuts off when it reaches your desired humidity level.)  When you open the door, you can feel the humidity in the air.  Also, I haven&#x27;t woken up with a dry throat since I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;Now, isn&#x27;t that why you buy a humidifier?  To put water in the air, right?  Well, it does that.&lt;br /&gt;I have had zero problems with any leakage.  I don&#x27;t have any cracks in it.  I don&#x27;t know about that other reviewer, what they might have been doing to get cracks, but my fill tank is fine.&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s plenty quiet on the quiet mist setting.  There&#x27;s three of us sleeping in the room, myself, my wife, and our 7 mo. old baby.  Not one of us is ever bothered by the unit switching on and off.&lt;br /&gt;Now, for some complaints.  I think the fill tank is hard to open.  You have to put some pretty good torque on it to get it to open.  But, I suppose that&#x27;s also a good thing if you don&#x27;t want it to leak.  But, if you have weak hand strength, this unit might be hard to work with.  My other complaint is that I&#x27;m having to buy a new filter.  I turned it over every single time I refilled the tank (that&#x27;d be daily for those keeping track at home) as the instructions recommend and yet it&#x27;s already getting stiff.  In fact, I&#x27;ve noticed that the unit is having a tougher time putting water in the air as a result of this.  I don&#x27;t know if this is a knock against the product as much as it might be a problem related to our water hardness (which is notorious) in our area.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I&#x27;ve felt that this is a very fine product.  My wife originally scoffed at the purchase.  She doesn&#x27;t have a sensitive throat and sinuses like I do.  She also claimed that she couldn&#x27;t tell any difference by having it on, at first anyway.  But, after a couple weeks, she thanked me for buying it and said she could feel a difference.&lt;br /&gt;My initial thinking is that this is a good humidifier.  It&#x27;s expensive.  But, remember, you get what you pay for.e throat and sinuses like I do.  She also claimed that she couldn&#x27;t tell any difference by having it on, at first anyway.  But, after a couple weeks, she thanked me for buying it and said she could feel a difference.&lt;br /&gt;My initial thinking is that this is a good humidifier.  It&#x27;s expensive.  But, remember, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I have had this humidifier for about two months now and have found the following:&lt;br /&gt;PROS:  &lt;BR&gt;1.This humidifier works well for me.  I keep it in my bedroom and only use it at night and I like the white noise that the quiet setting gives off.&lt;BR&gt;2. It does a fair job.&lt;BR&gt;3. It has a digital readout (very nice feature).&lt;BR&gt;4. It has a large water tank.&lt;BR&gt;5. It is easy to use.&lt;BR&gt;6. I have not had any mechanical problems with it.&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;BR&gt;1. The filters have to be replaced about once a week, otherwise they get moldy and start to smell (and who wants to breathe in mold?)&lt;BR&gt;2. The filters are WAY too expensive.  Amazon sells them for seven bucks and this is the cheapest I have found.  This is a lot of money to shell out every week.&lt;BR&gt;3. Filters are hard to find.  Not many places carry them.&lt;BR&gt;4. The cap on the water tank is VERY hard to open.  It takes forever to get it off.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I would not purchase this humidifier again simply because I hate shelling out 28 bucks every month for filters.  Even though the cap is hard to get off, it isn&#x27;t impossible and its something I can live with.  Maybe HB will come out with a filter that can be reused by putting it through the dishwasher or something, but until then I would not recommend purchasing this humidifier unless you have a lot of money to put into buying filters.  Even though it works well, it just isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this humidifier for a year (well, not in summer), and It does what is supposed to do and does it quite well. I find it too easy to clean in the sink to bother with the dishwasher. I clean it thoroughly once a week, letting it dry well and am getting 4 or 5 weeks use from each filter. (I flip the filter each time I fill the tank.) These blowers make a good bit of noise even on the quietest setting. Not really a bothersome noise, its gentle susurations are not disturbing to sleep. But it is additional noise in the house. An audiophile would probably prefer the steam vaporizer products for the music room.</li>
            <li> After reading all the mixed reviews on this product, I bought it anyway as it seemed the best deal for the amount of space I needed to humidify (1100- 1200 sf).  I was pregnant and it was winter and I was getting pretty dehydrated from the drying heat in my apartment.  Within days I was sleeping soundly waking refreshed and no longer having headaches.  I would have given this 5 stars but it&#x27;s the first I bought and I cannot make any comparisons. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am not sure what the reviewers that reviewed this product badly expected, having to refill it often just means that it is putting a lot of moisture into the air, the noise is not overwhelming and is similar to any white noise often used to put and keep kids asleep, I had no problem refilling it, my 2 year-old even liked to help, finally if you turn the filters faithfully once a week 2-3 filters should last the season.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best humidifier I&#x27;ve ever owned.  It doesn&#x27;t leave the floor and walls wet!  I live in Alabama and in the winter, I usually have to refill it every to every day.  In the summer it can be extremely humid here so it rarely runs.  I read in one review where it was hard to refill the tank in the tub since you have to turn the tank upside down to refill it, but I&#x27;ve never had a problem refilling the tank.  I love the fact that you can put the tank in the dishwasher.  As far as the sound, I usually have mine set on the lowest speed which is quiet.  On the highest speed, it&#x27;s about as loud as having an osculating fan going in your room.  Some people might like it  because it drowns out all white noise.  All I can say is....My skin isn&#x27;t dry anymore..My sinuses are open and my lips are no longer chapped!!!!!!  I would highly recommend the TrueAir Cool Mist Humidifier to anyone!!!!  Did I mention this humidifier was suppose to be for my daughter but after using it in my bedroom, I decided I needed it more.  I&#x27;m going to be purchasing another one for my daugther&#x27;s room!</li>
            <li> When we first got this humidifier home, it worked great. Then, after only  a couple of weeks, we noticed that we didn&#x27;t have to add any water into the container anymore -- the water level in the container remained constant. In other words, it was not humidifying the air.  We followed the instructions completely, but it just didn&#x27;t work.  &lt;br /&gt;One additional problem is the filter.  After just a couple of weeks it looked all broken down and we thought it might need replacing and it smelled awful.  However, at $10.00 per replacement filter, it wasn&#x27;t something we wanted to replace every few weeks.</li>
            <li> In need of a humidifier and having read some of the reviews, I decided to purchase the Hamilton Beach Humidifer. &lt;BR&gt;The pros: 1. On the \\&quot;quiet\\&quot; setting the water usually lasts 24+ hours before needing a refill.&lt;BR&gt;The cons: 1. The machine is far from quiet on any setting.&lt;BR&gt;2.It humidifies far less square footage than specified, even on the highest setting. &lt;BR&gt;3.It eats filters, which are difficult to find by the way. If you decide to purchase this item, buy several replacement filters.&lt;BR&gt;4.The tank cap is difficult to remove and appears to have been designed for the hands of a small child, but a child with the strength of an adult.&lt;BR&gt;5. It is relatively expensive. I have a warm mist model that works just as well and requires only a bit more attention to maintain.</li>
            <li> Water Tank:&lt;br /&gt;A large tank should mean less fillups, however, I found myself filling up nearly every night, and I only used the humidifier at \\&quot;quiet\\&quot; when I went to bed.  It&#x27;s somewhat simple to fill up, but since you have to flip the tank upside down to fill it, it&#x27;s cumbersome to fill in a bathtub, which is the only place other than the kitchen sink that the tank will fit for.  Since I use this product in my bedroom, I use the tub.&lt;br /&gt;Noise Level:&lt;br /&gt;I thought that the quietest setting was quite tolerable while I slept and I probably could sleep through the mid-level.  However, I purchased an identical model for my mother, and she said it kept her awake all night.  So, your mileage may vary, but keep in mind that if you are a very light sleeper and bothered by slight noises, there probably is NO humidifier that will be quiet enough for you.&lt;br /&gt;Operation:&lt;br /&gt;The LCD display is large and easy to read.  The 2 buttons to increase/decrease the desired humidity and the control knob for OFF/Quiet/Medium/High fan level is very easy to operate.&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness:&lt;br /&gt;All in all, yes, the humidifier is doing what I hoped it would do.  I wake up with less throat irritation and without stuffed up sinuses.  However, I purchased this unit thinking that the digital humidity level operation would work precisely.  First, the humidity can only be increased/decreased at 5% increments.  Second, I have not been able to reach my desired humidity of 50%, even when I&#x27;ve blasted it at HIGH.  The highest I&#x27;ve reached is 45% and it&#x27;s in my bedroom.  Unless you live in a mansion, this humidifier SHOULD be able to control the humidity in a bedroom with ease.  Not so I found out.  Furthermore, when the humidifier is off, the LCD still displays the humidity, but will always drop 3-5% when you turn it back on.  What&#x27;s the purpose of having a humidistat when it doesn&#x27;t appear to be accurate?&lt;br /&gt;Summary:&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it does the job.  But the LCD display and operation is not worth the extra cost, above the cheaper models.  I&#x27;ve already shipped this unit back to Amazon.com and purchased a less expensive Holmes model from Target, which you can also purchase through Amazon.com.  We&#x27;ll see how that one fares.ra cost, above the cheaper models.  I&#x27;ve already shipped this unit back to Amazon.com and purchased a less expensive Holmes model from Target, which you can also purchase through Amazon.com.  We&#x27;ll see how that one fares.</li>
            <li> Two main problems with this model:&lt;br /&gt;1. To open the tank for re-filling, first you have to flip the tank upside down, then you have to use A LOT OF FORCE to twist the large cap.  Why could they not simply provide a flip-up-to-open cover on the top of the tank to avoid these problems?  I have no ideas why.&lt;br /&gt;2. The machine does not detect when the water level is low, meaning it does not have a low-water indicator nor automatically shut itself off (stop the fan).</li>
            <li> We have had many great humidifiers, both large and small, cheap and expensive, and NONE have been as poorly designed and constructed as this Hamilton Beach model&#x27;s water tank.  The water tank -- no matter how carefully and delicately you fill it and move it about -- WILL eventually (every two months or so) develop dozens of hairline cracks, both at the bottom AND at the top of the water tank.  These cracks soon create a water leakage and overflow condition that cannot be stopped (which damages our furniture AND our carpet).  But that is not the worst part to these models:  While Hamilton Beach is very responsive in sending us out new tanks every time ours begins to leak, EACH AND EVERY new tank ALWAYS begins to leak within the two month period.  We baby these water tanks to prevent this, but all to no avail;  believe me, this all gets very old, very fast.  Stay away from this model, or any other Hamilton Beach unit that uses this same water tank design.</li>
            <li> I bought this humidifier a month ago after much research. So far, it hasn&#x27;t shown any mechanical trouble. The filter is holding up just fine after 4 weeks, despite daily use. Surely the quality of water in your area dictates how frequently you will need to change the filter. Nevertheless, it is recommended that you flip the filter over (to prolong it&#x27;s life)when you refill the water. In my case, filter change maybe warranted no sooner than 2-3 months.&lt;br /&gt;The large capacity of the water tank is good enough for 24 hour operation (on quiet setting). I use it all day night long on the low setting and it uses up about half the amount of water in the tank. At first the low setting may seem noisy especially if there is very little ambient noise around you (like when you can hear the wall clocks in your house ticking). But after a few minutes it sounds just like a dull whirring sound that is hardly objectionable. I use it in my bedroom at night and it doesn&#x27;t disturb my sleep. &lt;br /&gt;It is easy to see the level of water through the tinted tank. The water tank is easily removable when handled vertically. There is no leakage/spilling when you do so. There is a wide fill hole at the bottom of tank for refilling water. There are two problems though with refilling ...firstly the tank is too large to fit under the faucet in the kitchen sink, so you need a jug or hose to fill it up or use the faucet in the bathtub...secondly, the cap on the fill hole is pretty tight (the upside is that it is spill-proof) so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the unit for feeble people. &lt;br /&gt;The other part of the unit, housing the motor and fan, comes off easily too. I do wish it had a latch, because you need to be careful not to knock it off when removing the water tank. When the water tank is replaced on the base tray, some water from the container fills up the tray, making a gurgling sound. It makes the same tiny gurgling sound periodically during operation too. This water in the tray is taken up graduallyby the filter (which sits under the motorized fan), to generate the humidity when the fan is on.&lt;br /&gt;The digital panel is easy to read. I do not however agree with the humidistat&#x27;s reading. I have another humidistat in the room that I compare the reading to. The humidifier&#x27;s reading is always lower, usually by 8 to 10 percent. Setting the desired level of humidity is simple although it can be done only in 5 percent increments. The unit shuts of automatically when the desired hunidity level is reached.&lt;br /&gt;The base is easy to lift if the unit needs to be moved. Of course it is much more convenient to do so after removing the heavy water tank. As long as care is taken not to slant the base tray, there is no leakage or spill. &lt;br /&gt;One point to consider if you are paying heating bills in the winter is that, since this IS a cool-mist himidifier, it will make the room cooler. So you may need to turn up the heat in the room a notch.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very satisfied with the unit&#x27;s performance and recommend it to any able-bodied adult considering a cool-mist humidifier. To sum up, here are the PROS and CONS:&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;BR&gt;1. Water tank is too large to fit under kitchen faucet&lt;BR&gt;2. Cap on fill hole is tight. Some strength required to turn it&lt;BR&gt;3. Humidistat not accurate&lt;BR&gt;4. Motor unit is not securely latched to base tray to prevent accidentally knocking it off when removing water tank.&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;BR&gt;1. Very good performance&lt;BR&gt;2. Low operating sound on quiet setting&lt;BR&gt;3. No leakage or spilling when handled correctly&lt;BR&gt;4. Portable&lt;BR&gt;5. Dishwasher safe; Easy to clean&lt;BR&gt;6. Desired humidity level can be set manually &lt;BR&gt;7. Automatic shut-off when desired humidity reached&lt;br /&gt;PRO/CON depending on whether you live in hot or cold climate:  Makes the room cooler.</li>
            <li> While I am not a light sleeper by any means I found the noise level of this humidifier to be quite tolerable.  Being the clutz that I am, I&#x27;m always making a mess, but not with this model!  I have yet to spill!</li>
            <li> The digital humidity monitor works well.  This model is much better built than some other brand models that I own.  The only con is the filter cost.</li>
            <li> HAVE TROUBLE SLEEPING BECAUSE OF DRY WEATHER, OR DO YOU DRINK GALLONS OF WATER AT NIGHT? LET THIS AWSOME DEVICE HELP YOU DURING THOSE DRY SPELLS. &lt;br /&gt;IT INCLUDES:&lt;br /&gt;-ACTS AS AN AIR FILTER&lt;BR&gt;-A DIGITAL READOUT FOR YOUR CURRENT HUMIDITY AND FUTURE HUMIDITY.&lt;BR&gt;-MULTIPLE SETINGS&lt;BR&gt;-HOLDS A LARGE WATER TANK TO DISPERSE COOL, SOOTHING MIST.</li>
            <li> I have tried many models and I&#x27;m satisfied I got the best cool-mist fan unit available.  The unit comes in 4 pieces; the large fan unit section that contains the controls, the translucent 3-gallon water container, the bottom tray that both of the previously-mentioned pieces slide upright into and a hidden water reservoir tray inside the bottom tray that&#x27;s not visible from the product photograph.&lt;br /&gt;As for the main unit, the humidistat works very well.  Although I can&#x27;t comment on someone else&#x27;s concern about the humidistat not being accurate, in my experience it works very well.  When I ratchet it up to a high humidity level, I get lots of moist air.  After you change the setting by pressing either the UP or DOWN humidity buttons to increment the humidity level in 5% increments, the display flashes for 3 seconds after which the unit responds (either turns on or off) based on the new setting.  It&#x27;s quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the UP humidity button and DOWN humidity buttons, there&#x27;s a 4-point switch for OFF/QUIET/MEDIUM/HIGH.  The HIGH setting is really good for humidifying multiple rooms and blasts quite a strong swirl of moisture into any room in no time at all.  The QUIET setting is remarkably quiet.  Although no cool mist-based fan can be SILENT, I am impressed with just how quiet this lowest setting is.  I was fine with it right away, and although my wife was cautious, she took to it by the morning and has enjoyed it ever since.  For hypersensitive people (like my mom) where any noise would be too much noise, I&#x27;m afraid NO cool-mist system will be sufficient.  I sleep with the unit on the floor in the same room I am in, slightly below the level of our bed, and a mere 10 feet away and am very pleased with the quiet hum of the lowest setting.  Underneath the fan unit resides the filter which is easy to replace and sits almost too easily into a small molded, shaped guide in the bottom tray.  New filters are flattened for shipping and need to be reshaped into a cylinder before replacing them - and filters seem to last longer than I expected at 1 filter every 5-6 weeks - even after which they do not look gross, moldy or dirty.&lt;br /&gt;The water container is a smart design.  The fill hole is at the bottom of the 3-gallon jug, but seals tightly by way of an integrated plunger built into the wide screw-release fill cap.  I haven&#x27;t had ANY problems with spilling, leakage or difficulty opening the fill cap as at least one other reviewer has mentioned.  Since the container faces into a humid environment, it&#x27;s worthwhile to shake the container once or twice before you carry it across the room to shake any droplets of humidity away.  Refills are every two days for me - but we only use this in the evening and sleeping hours, so constant usage would likely require daily refills.&lt;br /&gt;Every once in while, you may hear a slight gurgle as air bubbles float up from the bottom of the container while the humidifier is in use, but this also is hardly noticeable - especially since it is usually quieter than the fan itself on the lowest setting - and flat up impossible to hear if the fan is set to medium or high.  This occasional gurgling of air bubbles is infrequent and no distraction at all.  Finally, the 3-gallon container is very easy to fill, but because of its depth, you will need to have either a reasonably deep basin kitchen or utility sink or fill the jug up in a bathtub.  Either way, 3 gallons of water is easy to heft for an adult, but may be difficult for an elderly parent or friend (consider a smaller capacity unit if this is the case).  Carrying is an easy one-handed operation thanks to the white handle built into the top of the jug itself.&lt;br /&gt;The 3 non-motorized plastic pieces can be placed in a dishwasher, but you will need a dishwasher with a fairly deep main section in order for the 3-gallon jug to fit.  Consider removing the upper rack (if possible) for smaller dishwashers.  If all else fails, the mouth of the jug is fairly wide (5\\&quot; across), so a petite hand, wrist and arm could reach inside to scrub the unit if that was ever needed (it doesn&#x27;t seem to get dirty, moldy or gross in the time I&#x27;ve used the unit).  For the one piece that cannot be put into the dishwasher, the fan unit is remarkably open with a great deal of free space for cleaning.  I have never seen a unit as easy and accessible as this one.  Usually I simply throw out humidifiers after a season or two since disassembling them enough to clear every nook and cranny proves not worth the effort.  This is the first and only unit where that has not been a problem.&lt;br /&gt;With as many great things I have to say about this unit, I have one exceptionally minor complaint: the two largest units (the water jug and the fan unit) slide too easily away from the base.  This is due to the shallow crevice they sit in and the lack of a clip, latch or groove that would otherwise &#x60;lock&#x27; the two units into place.  This requires the user to slide the jug straight up when removing it for refills - otherwise, you run the risk of knocking the fan unit over and onto the floor.  The up-side is that - without a lock or latch to secure these two pieces more tightly, lifting the jug for refills is a one-handed operation.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this detailed description helps you decide to buy this unit.  After examining and using many units, I honestly feel this is the best cool-mist, fan-based unit available - and hope these insights help you make a wise choice.irly wide (5\\&quot; across), so a petite hand, wrist and arm could reach inside to scrub the unit if that was ever needed (it doesn&#x27;t seem to get dirty, moldy or gross in the time I&#x27;ve used the unit).

            <li> EDIT - the humidistat stopped working during the 2nd season of use. I would now rate this 2 stars.    This is an excellent humidifier, especially for the price. It&#x27;s very quiet. A filter typically lasts almost an entire season here in dry Arizona (usually October til April or whenever we turn the swamp cooler back on). It keeps our 3 back bedrooms humidified nicely just as long as you don&#x27;t open the windows of course. I only fill it up every other day at most during driest times (outside humidity &#x3D; 9% today!)  The only reason I give 4 instead of 5 stars is that the humidistat failed after 3 years of use. From my experience with these types of units 3 years is pretty good service and at this price it&#x27;s really fantastic. I&#x27;m about to purchase another one...</li>
            <li> We like the cool mist humidifier for 2 reasons...humidity in the winter and white noise all year round.  It has taken the abuse of being run every night for a year or more and we liked it so much we purchased another for our newborns room.  We like the big water tank....others are so small.  Easy to buy refills for the filters online too!</li>
            <li> The TruAir 4.0 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier has done wonders for us.  We live in a very dry climate in Texas and this humidifier can keep certain rooms at a good humidity level.  It turns on and off by itself to maintian the 50% humidity level that we set it at.  Also, it is easy to fill up with water and wash all the parts.  If you need to quickly get the humidity up in a room you can turn it on high then run it at normal or the quiet settings.  On quiet, it creates just enough white noise that our daughter sleeps very well.  Due to the fan, this humidifier is not extremely quiet but we do run it in the livingroom and can easily listen to the tv or radio over it.</li>
            <li> It pretty good humidifer, but I only gave it 4 star because of it constructions.  Construction of the humidifer, isn&#x27;t the best it could be much better.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a humidifer for awhile and this one is perfect.  First off its a cool mist which for me is great especially when you have kids that could get burned by the steam.  Automatic shut-off when moisture level which you set is reached and most of all very easy to clean and quiet with 3 speed settings. I suggest to anybody thats buys a humidifer with a filter, buy alot of filters, ($ for this one) so you can keep using this machine for years to come. I change filters about once or twice a year. It all depends on the type of water you use and the amount of time you use the machine.</li>
            <li> If the unit I recieved worked as described, it would be a great product.  Unfortunately, it did not.  Mine stopped working within 12 hours of purchase.  Reading the other reviews, I&#x27;m not the first to experience quality problems.  Hamilton Beach will replace it - in 4-6 weeks.  Don&#x27;t waste your money or your time.  Buy a different brand of humidifier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Edit - I replaced this with a 4 gallon humidifier from Vornado that cost about the same amount.  It works great!  So well, in fact, I also got one for my office.  Then my wife got one for her office.  The reasons it is better are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Standardized wicks.  No guessing, just buy the one type of wick Vornado sells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. No computer.  Pick a setting and it just runs.  No need to reboot the humidifier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Since it&#x27;s just on, when humid days come around, it keeps running.  This prevents the wick from molding, allowing the wick to last 4-8 weeks.  A few humid days with the hamilton beach humidifier to make the water sit, and your $10 wick is smelly garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Double capacity, with 2 2 gallon bottles.  Not only does this mean chaning the water less often, the bottles are designed such that they have no moving parts.  I found the top on the Hamilton Beach humidifier tank very difficult to get off at times.</li>
            <li> Out of the box it looked nice but my happiness soon faded. I set it up just like the manual says. When I plugged it in and turned it on nothing happened. I noticed the fan was twitching a little bit so I turned it to \\&quot;HI\\&quot;. The fan started moving a little and then finally worked it&#x27;s way up to speed after a few seconds. I figured oh well the thing is new so it was just stuck from being new. It worked ok for a while and then I went out of the house for a couple hours. I got back and what looked like the entire contents of the reservoir had spilled onto my brand new Pergo flooring and expensive raw maple wall trim!!! I now have water under my floor, soaked through my trim and soaked under the wall and into the next room!!! I took it apart looked it over and gave it another try (on a towel in a less new room). Once again it worked well but this time I checked on it every 10 minutes. Once it was about 2/3 empty for some reason it decided to simply empty itself onto whatever it was sitting... PIECE OF CRAP!!! DO NOT BUY!!!</li>
            <li> I bought two different humidifiers- a Slant/Fin warm mist and this True Air.  Although we really like our Slant/Fin for the baby&#x27;s room, this unit is much easier to clean.  It is rather noisy when the water tray is filling (it makes a glugging sound that sounds like someone knocking on your window in the middle of the night- spooky!), but for ease of use and maintenance, it can&#x27;t be beat.  The noise factor is less when you put it in \\&quot;quiet\\&quot; mode and after a dy or so, you just get used to it.  We have VERY hard water and the filters don&#x27;t need to be changed as often as with most humidifiers which is a long-run cost savings.  I recommend this item and have done the research- replacment filters are cheapest through Amazon (cheaper than at the manufacturers website).</li>
