            <li>It works great!  </li>
            <li>it works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>This Himalayan salt bar is wonderful as a deodorant soap bar, as well as a complexion &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; to cleanse cosmetics from my face!  </li>
            <li>well the look on his face was just priceless.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, about the salt deodorant bar â€“ I&#x27;m thoroughly impressed.  </li>
            <li>Excellent seller, item was as advertised</li>
            <li>/&gt;In fact, for whatever reason my stench seemed to have been greatly amplified by using this!  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with it!</li>
            <li>One of the best ones I have tried.</li>
            <li>I think this item is a very good thing.  </li>
            <li>This has been a great after shower bar for the armpits.  </li>
            <li>it works great and is drawing.</li>
            <li>so I wouldnt recommend it as a deodarant bar but what I have found it to be great for is feet.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a great deal, however for me it burns.</li>
            <li>it works great.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been a great deodorant.</li>
            <li>It comes with a great price and a great promise.</li>
            <li>this is a really great product, but if you&#x27;re looking for a soap, don&#x27;t bother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great product-</li>
            <li>I have now been using it for years with great results.</li>
            <li>Great Product.</li>
            <li>I made the switch from aluminum-laden antiperspirant, and I&#x27;m so glad I did!!</li>
            <li>This does not work as a deodorant for more than a five or six hours at best.</li>
            <li>have found that it works remarkable well as a deodorant (note that salt doesn&#x27;t work as an antiperspirant, it just controls odor by preventing bacterial growth).</li>
            <li>There are no perfumes in this Salt Bar to cover up Body Oder which to me is a good thing.</li>
            <li>It cleans my skin so good.</li>
            <li>and a good price-</li>
            <li>When I started using &amp;#34;Crystal,&amp;#34; I was very pleased to be rid of underarm odors.  </li>
            <li>Lol I&#x27;m sure it was also the toxins leaving my body.</li>
            <li>Works great,  better than the &amp;#34;rock chemical crystal&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>it is much better for your skin than soap!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>kind of like being a hermit</li>
            <li>Item as described, shipped quickly, packaging great.</li>
            <li>It is nice to have something that is really safe to use.</li>
            <li>...we just love h own it works and cleans.  </li>
            <li>I thought this was some kind of magic stuff.</li>
            <li>well you must be freshly showered (right after is best)</li>
            <li>The ones I have seen in stores have a uniform texture and very smooth rounded corners.  </li>
            <li>This bar is so very smooth, &amp; it works, &amp; it lasts forever.</li>
            <li>burned me for sure and didn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
            <li>I already have 3 himlayan salt lamps in the house :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many antiperspirants and deodorants, which all seem to just attempt to mask the body odor.</li>
            <li>and I have really enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li>I bought a Salt Block 2\\&quot;x 2\\&quot; square of wonderful clear Salt,smooth edges and smooth all over.</li>
            <li>I love my Salt Block.hen</li>
            <li>I love my Salt Block.</li>
            <li>I love this suff</li>
            <li>I am one of the saltiest people I know but its worth it to reep the good effects thank you</li>
            <li>Glad I did.</li>
            <li>The moment that I put it on, it was as if my body was trying to remove it by perspiring more.  </li>
            <li>Unless you sweat a lot, this is better for you than the aluminum in any antiperspirant deodorant.</li>
            <li>I trust my brain is all the better for it.</li>
            <li>look forward to purchasing more in the future.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love this stone.</li>
            <li>I fear chemical deodorants and feel that the more you use them the more you need them and breast cancer seems to be on the rise.  </li>
            <li>I wanted this to work, very cheap (compared to a year of deodorant), feels fine, no chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Its a nice size for the price and shipped fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>I live in Houston (a very warm climate) and I never feel stinky.</li>
            <li>so far, this works great killing the smell.  </li>
            <li>and this is great because salt is a natural antibiotic and there are no additives in the block.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gets rid of odar and easily works off calluses.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for over a year, and still going strong.</li>
            <li>Huge block</li>
            <li>Edges are smooth, even after being used.  </li>
            <li>its as smooth as a bar of soap...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard about this kind of bar for years, but didn&#x27;t know much about it.  </li>
            <li>With the bar I don&#x27;t need the deodorant, I just use it because I enjoy the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but after a use or two the bar will smooth out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Enjoy a carefree day....</li>
            <li>Cheap</li>
            <li>During that time I worked outside in the yard and garden working up a really great sweat.</li>
            <li>Ok, so when i told people i wanted to switch from &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; deodorant to this EVERYONE made fun of me, but i just wanted to give it a shot.</li>
            <li>so the bar surface should remain smooth so we won&#x27;t have to experience scratchiness</li>
            <li>It helps take the Placque from my skin and makes it smooth.</li>
            <li>leaves my feet smooth and silky..</li>
            <li>I made sure to try it out on a hot summer day (over 100 degrees Fahrenheit) to make certain it was effective.</li>
            <li>I love this bar, it seems to work great, and we&#x27;ve had a lot of hot / humid days recently.</li>
            <li>In reality, it makes you more aware of hygiene.  </li>
            <li>I found a product that is similar and much more convenient and effective.</li>
            <li>I live in Puerto Rico, so it&#x27;s ALWAYS hot here, and I&#x27;ve found that this bar works great still at keeping my &#x27;pits smelling normal and not stinky.</li>
            <li>and if you stay clean you rarely will have odor.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Use our natural Himalayan Salt Purifying bars to cleanse, exfoliate, and add minerals to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For best results, dilute the salt bar by rubbing it on a wet wash cloth or on your hands, and then rub your body with the cloth.</li>
            <li>Avoid rubbing quickly or with a lot of pressure to prevent irritation.</li>
            <li>yes, it tingles, but quickly subsides.  </li>
            <li>because  my underarms  B.O. was becoming too much.</li>
            <li>I used it like I&#x27;ve been successfully using a deodorant stone for years; wet it and rub it over my arm pits and soles of my feet.  </li>
            <li>The less use of chemicals the better!!</li>
            <li>It was quite amazing and definitely sold me on the product.</li>
            <li>This technique applies enough salt to the skin to be effective.</li>
            <li>Tried switching to this from an alum crystal product because what&#x27;s more natural than salt?</li>
            <li>Well worth the discomfort.</li>
            <li>Eventually, my SO told me that I stunk, and I was the only one that thought it kind of worked and that I needed to start using deodorant if I didn&#x27;t want to be a hermit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I received the bar right away</li>
            <li>I shaved and used this RIGHT after while still in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Really helps in keeping me feeling clean.</li>
            <li>And it actually really feels really cool when you rub it on-</li>
            <li>Well then I told him of the new Salt Block I got, and how he just confirmed that it worked.</li>
            <li>I told him of the new Salt Block I got, and how he just confirmed that it worked.</li>
            <li>but this thing lasts forever and really does work!</li>
            <li>My wife also got hooked after we got married.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it stung, but was bearable.  </li>
            <li>At first it does scratch</li>
            <li>Salt deodorant does not have perfume so don&#x27;t expect a pretty smell with it.</li>
            <li>When I first got it</li>
            <li>OK this is funny and was a definite TEST to see if it worked.</li>
            <li>So got it just before the Hot Summer months and applied as I have explained.</li>
            <li>I can tell you, it really, really does work!</li>
            <li>However, this was my first experience with the deodorant bar</li>
            <li>I think the Himalayan salts bar works very well!</li>
            <li>love product, I use on the back of my feet in shower...</li>
            <li>So, it&#x27;s hard to tell specifically which had the best impact when used at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>as for effectiveness, so far (not into the super hot summer yet)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Warning: The Salt deodorant bar does not lather like traditional soap and can fracture easily if dropped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also place the bar into a large bar soap container so that when I move the bar around I won&#x27;t dust salt onto everything.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m purely in the:  &amp;</li>
            <li>Clean your armpits first (regular soap will do)&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I may not have as much reaction as some first-time salt users.  </li>
            <li>it does work, it goes away really fast.</li>
            <li>This works very well.  </li>
            <li>and it has not broken.</li>
            <li>HE MINDS REALLY WELL</li>
            <li>I also feel like it really works as a deodarant but has to be used midway through the day again for it to work.</li>
            <li>our routine is shaving at night, so we won&#x27;t have to find out how much the salt stings...  </li>
            <li>This works really well for me and keeps me from getting body odor.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t need them that much</li>
            <li>This Salt Deodorant works great for everyday normal use and on a regular day I could not smell Body order at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really excited to finally have tried it!  </li>
            <li>yes at first I noticed it,but not any more unless I shaved a little too close and irritate the skin.</li>
            <li>And finally, I would NOT reccomend putting it on on freshly shaven underarms, ouch!</li>
            <li>This deordorant bar actually does work, but you MUST apply it to very newly clean skin.</li>
            <li>dear daughter needed more protection as the temperature rises, but it works will in combination (so far as it is not super hot yet)&lt;br /&gt;2.)</li>
            <li>and I believe it is best to be all natural and not use artificial ingredients and chemicals,</li>
            <li>I did notice on days that I was involved in heavier activity and sweat more there would be a slight smell of body odor by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>A few things it will not do: it will not get rid of odor if odor is already there, i.e. putting it on without showering or cleaning stinky underarms will do pretty much Nothing; it does NOT stop you from sweating, its deodorant, not antiperspirant, so you WILL sweat, you just wont stink, which for me, is totally fine.</li>
            <li>This is a such an obvious and genious idea, why don&#x27;t more people use this?</li>
            <li>we have sprayed the bar then apply to tiny bit of quick stinging</li>
            <li>it works for others, it&#x27;s low cost/risk if you might be one of the lucky.</li>
            <li>The very first day I used the salt bar, I was constantly smelling my armpits to see if they smelled.</li>
            <li>It did, however, make sense that the high salt content would kill the odor-causing bacteria.</li>
            <li>Using the salt bar directly on the skin may cause irritation, as pure salt is highly concentrated.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin looks great without any of the toxic chemicals in all those expensive creams.</li>
            <li>But unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t kill bacteria or fight odor for me, unlike the alum, which worked great.</li>
            <li>do have a sensitive skin, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me much.</li>
            <li>Wet bar, apply under arm, and pat down with powder and good to go.</li>
            <li>The salt bar is amazing and I will never go back to typical antiperspirants/</li>
            <li>I jumped over to him and put my pit right in his face and told him to take a deep breath....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d suggest people give multiple brands a shot until they find the right one.  </li>
            <li>Give the Salt Block at least a couple weeks of daily using (clean and dry the pits, give it the fair shake)</li>
            <li>Give the Salt Block at least a couple weeks of daily using (clean and dry the pits, give it the fair shake)</li>
            <li>It is smooth, and I keep it in the same cellophane bag it was shipped in by a different company.</li>
            <li>as for the formed tiny salt crystal with usage, we simply scrape the bar smooth and no scratching at all&lt;br /&gt;3.) be cautious if you have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>It is like sandpaper in a very sensitive area.</li>
            <li>On the first day of use, I showered and applied directly to my underarms very gently while they were still wet.</li>
            <li>I applied it only that first day after my shower and shave.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply with a little water.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a smooth oval cylinder with slightly rounded ends.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Simply rub the dry bar on your skin, and notice how smooth and alive the skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li>Wow.. I bought this on a gamble, not really expecting it to work, but it really does!!</li>
            <li>I have used the clear  style for decades and never had this issue before.</li>
            <li>I use it in addition to a natural scented bar.  </li>
            <li>In 24 hours after applying the salt bar, I was nowhere near what I would smell like from antiperspirant use.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s all natural  salt</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get it near eyes though.  </li>
            <li>When I get out my skin is so soft, while still damp I use it under my arms as a deodorant.  </li>
            <li>Keep in mind that some skin types may be sensitive to salt therapy, which was the case with me.  </li>
            <li>I decided to give this a try because of the all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised with the results.</li>
            <li>I like it so much that next time I will order some for my daughter</li>
            <li>I have tried various commercial products, but even the 96H versions didn&#x27;t help much, and caused my armpits to get very irritated.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t have Old Spice in these countries.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t have Old Spice in these countries.</li>
            <li>That was an epic mistake.  </li>
            <li>but as others have stated you shouldn&#x27;t use it directly on your skin.</li>
            <li>So far, the Himalayan salts have lasted all day from 7 am to midnight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used this product and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>The slight sting goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for this bar as an underarm deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I was worried at first because I have had trouble previously with crystal deodorants wearing out very quickly.</li>
            <li>Now, I apply by rubbing the bar onto a wet washcloth first and then use the washcloth on my underarms.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Application can be rough at first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d wet it first, just a bit</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>There are no sharp edges that \\&quot;cut\\&quot; you...</li>
            <li>This one is smooth (the other one had sharp lumpy bits in it).  </li>
            <li>: Definitely don&#x27;t apply directly to your armpit (as others have also warned).</li>
            <li>I have dark olive skin and am not allergic to much, but this is not the deodorant bar for me!</li>
            <li>, the bar must be a bit wet, and you do have to wear it consistently anywhere from a week to two weeks for it to fully have your back.</li>
            <li>and I think each kind works on different people and unfortunately, this one didn&#x27;t work on me.  </li>
            <li>The only drawback I am aware of is that is stings slightly when applied.</li>
            <li>I bought this because the info about the Men/Women in several other high Mountainous Countries found this to be the only thing that would keep the odor away.</li>
            <li>I bought this because the info about the Men/Women in several other high Mountainous Countries found this to be the only thing that would keep the odor away.</li>
            <li>I used this right out of the shower:  just a slight wetting and rubbing on my body, then careful to let the area air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I made the switch from aluminum-laden antiperspirant, and I&#x27;m so glad I did!!</li>
            <li> This does not work as a deodorant for more than a five or six hours at best.</li>
            <li> have found that it works remarkable well as a deodorant (note that salt doesn&#x27;t work as an antiperspirant, it just controls odor by preventing bacterial growth).</li>
            <li> There are no perfumes in this Salt Bar to cover up Body Oder which to me is a good thing.</li>
            <li> It cleans my skin so good.</li>
            <li> and a good price-</li>
            <li> When I started using &amp;#34;Crystal,&amp;#34; I was very pleased to be rid of underarm odors.  </li>
            <li> Lol I&#x27;m sure it was also the toxins leaving my body.</li>
            <li> Works great,  better than the &amp;#34;rock chemical crystal&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> it is much better for your skin than soap!  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Amazing product.</li>
            <li> kind of like being a hermit</li>
            <li> Item as described, shipped quickly, packaging great.</li>
            <li> It is nice to have something that is really safe to use.</li>
            <li> ...we just love h own it works and cleans.  </li>
            <li> I thought this was some kind of magic stuff.</li>
            <li> well you must be freshly showered (right after is best)</li>
            <li> The ones I have seen in stores have a uniform texture and very smooth rounded corners.  </li>
            <li> This bar is so very smooth, &amp; it works, &amp; it lasts forever.</li>
            <li> burned me for sure and didn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
            <li> I already have 3 himlayan salt lamps in the house :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many antiperspirants and deodorants, which all seem to just attempt to mask the body odor.</li>
            <li> and I have really enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li> I bought a Salt Block 2\\&quot;x 2\\&quot; square of wonderful clear Salt,smooth edges and smooth all over.</li>
            <li> I love my Salt Block.hen</li>
            <li> I love my Salt Block.</li>
            <li> I love this suff</li>
            <li> I am one of the saltiest people I know but its worth it to reep the good effects thank you</li>
            <li> Glad I did.</li>
            <li> The moment that I put it on, it was as if my body was trying to remove it by perspiring more.  </li>
            <li> Unless you sweat a lot, this is better for you than the aluminum in any antiperspirant deodorant.</li>
            <li> I trust my brain is all the better for it.</li>
            <li> look forward to purchasing more in the future.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love this stone.</li>
            <li> I fear chemical deodorants and feel that the more you use them the more you need them and breast cancer seems to be on the rise.  </li>
            <li> I wanted this to work, very cheap (compared to a year of deodorant), feels fine, no chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Its a nice size for the price and shipped fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> I live in Houston (a very warm climate) and I never feel stinky.</li>
            <li> so far, this works great killing the smell.  </li>
            <li> and this is great because salt is a natural antibiotic and there are no additives in the block.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gets rid of odar and easily works off calluses.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for over a year, and still going strong.</li>
            <li> Huge block</li>
            <li> Edges are smooth, even after being used.  </li>
            <li> its as smooth as a bar of soap...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard about this kind of bar for years, but didn&#x27;t know much about it.  </li>
            <li> With the bar I don&#x27;t need the deodorant, I just use it because I enjoy the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but after a use or two the bar will smooth out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Enjoy a carefree day....</li>
            <li> Cheap</li>
            <li> During that time I worked outside in the yard and garden working up a really great sweat.</li>
            <li> Ok, so when i told people i wanted to switch from &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; deodorant to this EVERYONE made fun of me, but i just wanted to give it a shot.</li>
            <li> so the bar surface should remain smooth so we won&#x27;t have to experience scratchiness</li>
            <li> It helps take the Placque from my skin and makes it smooth.</li>
            <li> leaves my feet smooth and silky..</li>
            <li> I made sure to try it out on a hot summer day (over 100 degrees Fahrenheit) to make certain it was effective.</li>
            <li> I love this bar, it seems to work great, and we&#x27;ve had a lot of hot / humid days recently.</li>
            <li> In reality, it makes you more aware of hygiene.  </li>
            <li> I found a product that is similar and much more convenient and effective.</li>
            <li> I live in Puerto Rico, so it&#x27;s ALWAYS hot here, and I&#x27;ve found that this bar works great still at keeping my &#x27;pits smelling normal and not stinky.</li>
            <li> and if you stay clean you rarely will have odor.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Use our natural Himalayan Salt Purifying bars to cleanse, exfoliate, and add minerals to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For best results, dilute the salt bar by rubbing it on a wet wash cloth or on your hands, and then rub your body with the cloth.</li>
            <li> Avoid rubbing quickly or with a lot of pressure to prevent irritation.</li>
            <li> yes, it tingles, but quickly subsides.  </li>
            <li> because  my underarms  B.O. was becoming too much.</li>
            <li> I used it like I&#x27;ve been successfully using a deodorant stone for years; wet it and rub it over my arm pits and soles of my feet.  </li>
            <li> The less use of chemicals the better!!</li>
            <li> It was quite amazing and definitely sold me on the product.</li>
            <li> This technique applies enough salt to the skin to be effective.</li>
            <li> Tried switching to this from an alum crystal product because what&#x27;s more natural than salt?</li>
            <li> Well worth the discomfort.</li>
            <li> Eventually, my SO told me that I stunk, and I was the only one that thought it kind of worked and that I needed to start using deodorant if I didn&#x27;t want to be a hermit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I received the bar right away</li>
            <li> I shaved and used this RIGHT after while still in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Really helps in keeping me feeling clean.</li>
            <li> And it actually really feels really cool when you rub it on-</li>
            <li> Well then I told him of the new Salt Block I got, and how he just confirmed that it worked.</li>
            <li> I told him of the new Salt Block I got, and how he just confirmed that it worked.</li>
            <li> but this thing lasts forever and really does work!</li>
            <li> My wife also got hooked after we got married.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it stung, but was bearable.  </li>
            <li> At first it does scratch</li>
            <li> Salt deodorant does not have perfume so don&#x27;t expect a pretty smell with it.</li>
            <li> When I first got it</li>
            <li> OK this is funny and was a definite TEST to see if it worked.</li>
            <li> So got it just before the Hot Summer months and applied as I have explained.</li>
            <li> I can tell you, it really, really does work!</li>
            <li> However, this was my first experience with the deodorant bar</li>
            <li> I think the Himalayan salts bar works very well!</li>
            <li> love product, I use on the back of my feet in shower...</li>
            <li> So, it&#x27;s hard to tell specifically which had the best impact when used at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> as for effectiveness, so far (not into the super hot summer yet)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Warning: The Salt deodorant bar does not lather like traditional soap and can fracture easily if dropped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also place the bar into a large bar soap container so that when I move the bar around I won&#x27;t dust salt onto everything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m purely in the:  &amp;</li>
            <li> Clean your armpits first (regular soap will do)&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I may not have as much reaction as some first-time salt users.  </li>
            <li> it does work, it goes away really fast.</li>
            <li> This works very well.  </li>
            <li> and it has not broken.</li>
            <li> HE MINDS REALLY WELL</li>
            <li> I also feel like it really works as a deodarant but has to be used midway through the day again for it to work.</li>
            <li> our routine is shaving at night, so we won&#x27;t have to find out how much the salt stings...  </li>
            <li> This works really well for me and keeps me from getting body odor.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t need them that much</li>
            <li> This Salt Deodorant works great for everyday normal use and on a regular day I could not smell Body order at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really excited to finally have tried it!  </li>
            <li> yes at first I noticed it,but not any more unless I shaved a little too close and irritate the skin.</li>
            <li> And finally, I would NOT reccomend putting it on on freshly shaven underarms, ouch!</li>
            <li> This deordorant bar actually does work, but you MUST apply it to very newly clean skin.</li>
            <li> dear daughter needed more protection as the temperature rises, but it works will in combination (so far as it is not super hot yet)&lt;br /&gt;2.)</li>
            <li> and I believe it is best to be all natural and not use artificial ingredients and chemicals,</li>
            <li> I did notice on days that I was involved in heavier activity and sweat more there would be a slight smell of body odor by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> A few things it will not do: it will not get rid of odor if odor is already there, i.e. putting it on without showering or cleaning stinky underarms will do pretty much Nothing; it does NOT stop you from sweating, its deodorant, not antiperspirant, so you WILL sweat, you just wont stink, which for me, is totally fine.</li>
            <li> This is a such an obvious and genious idea, why don&#x27;t more people use this?</li>
            <li> we have sprayed the bar then apply to tiny bit of quick stinging</li>
            <li> it works for others, it&#x27;s low cost/risk if you might be one of the lucky.</li>
            <li> The very first day I used the salt bar, I was constantly smelling my armpits to see if they smelled.</li>
            <li> It did, however, make sense that the high salt content would kill the odor-causing bacteria.</li>
            <li> Using the salt bar directly on the skin may cause irritation, as pure salt is highly concentrated.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin looks great without any of the toxic chemicals in all those expensive creams.</li>
            <li> But unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t kill bacteria or fight odor for me, unlike the alum, which worked great.</li>
            <li> do have a sensitive skin, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me much.</li>
            <li> Wet bar, apply under arm, and pat down with powder and good to go.</li>
            <li> The salt bar is amazing and I will never go back to typical antiperspirants/</li>
            <li> I jumped over to him and put my pit right in his face and told him to take a deep breath....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d suggest people give multiple brands a shot until they find the right one.  </li>
            <li> Give the Salt Block at least a couple weeks of daily using (clean and dry the pits, give it the fair shake)</li>
            <li> Give the Salt Block at least a couple weeks of daily using (clean and dry the pits, give it the fair shake)</li>
            <li> It is smooth, and I keep it in the same cellophane bag it was shipped in by a different company.</li>
            <li> as for the formed tiny salt crystal with usage, we simply scrape the bar smooth and no scratching at all&lt;br /&gt;3.) be cautious if you have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> It is like sandpaper in a very sensitive area.</li>
            <li> On the first day of use, I showered and applied directly to my underarms very gently while they were still wet.</li>
            <li> I applied it only that first day after my shower and shave.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply with a little water.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a smooth oval cylinder with slightly rounded ends.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Simply rub the dry bar on your skin, and notice how smooth and alive the skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li> Wow.. I bought this on a gamble, not really expecting it to work, but it really does!!</li>
            <li> I have used the clear  style for decades and never had this issue before.</li>
            <li> I use it in addition to a natural scented bar.  </li>
            <li> In 24 hours after applying the salt bar, I was nowhere near what I would smell like from antiperspirant use.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s all natural  salt</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get it near eyes though.  </li>
            <li> When I get out my skin is so soft, while still damp I use it under my arms as a deodorant.  </li>
            <li> Keep in mind that some skin types may be sensitive to salt therapy, which was the case with me.  </li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try because of the all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised with the results.</li>
            <li> I like it so much that next time I will order some for my daughter</li>
            <li> I have tried various commercial products, but even the 96H versions didn&#x27;t help much, and caused my armpits to get very irritated.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t have Old Spice in these countries.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t have Old Spice in these countries.</li>
            <li> That was an epic mistake.  </li>
            <li> but as others have stated you shouldn&#x27;t use it directly on your skin.</li>
            <li> So far, the Himalayan salts have lasted all day from 7 am to midnight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used this product and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> The slight sting goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this bar as an underarm deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I was worried at first because I have had trouble previously with crystal deodorants wearing out very quickly.</li>
            <li> Now, I apply by rubbing the bar onto a wet washcloth first and then use the washcloth on my underarms.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Application can be rough at first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d wet it first, just a bit</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> There are no sharp edges that \\&quot;cut\\&quot; you...</li>
            <li> This one is smooth (the other one had sharp lumpy bits in it).  </li>
            <li> : Definitely don&#x27;t apply directly to your armpit (as others have also warned).</li>
            <li> I have dark olive skin and am not allergic to much, but this is not the deodorant bar for me!</li>
            <li> , the bar must be a bit wet, and you do have to wear it consistently anywhere from a week to two weeks for it to fully have your back.</li>
            <li> and I think each kind works on different people and unfortunately, this one didn&#x27;t work on me.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback I am aware of is that is stings slightly when applied.</li>
            <li> I bought this because the info about the Men/Women in several other high Mountainous Countries found this to be the only thing that would keep the odor away.</li>
            <li> I bought this because the info about the Men/Women in several other high Mountainous Countries found this to be the only thing that would keep the odor away.</li>
            <li> I used this right out of the shower:  just a slight wetting and rubbing on my body, then careful to let the area air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is not meant for direct application to the skin... rub onto a wet towel and then apply to your body!</li>
            <li> The bar has sharp edges even though slightly beveled and a section of impurities running through it like little ribbon of finely ground sea shells.  </li>
            <li> which is what actually causes any kind of unpleasant odor.  </li>
            <li> After coming home and using the salt bar twice daily for a few days my armpits returned to their normal self.</li>
            <li> we wet the bar by spraying it with a witch hazel mixed with tea tree essential oil (this might have even gave the bar that extra boost in killing power) prior to application to underarm.  </li>
            <li> Appears the bar will last for a long time also.</li>
            <li> I am somewhat sensitive to regular deodorants and occasionally using deodorants with harsh chemicals will cause my underarms to feel irritated.</li>
            <li> I have used the same block for well over 3 years and it hardly shows much use at all.</li>
            <li> This will last a long time and save you money in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and i actually received earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> To apply, just slowly rub it across clean skin a few times.</li>
            <li> I purchased Himalayan Salt deodorant as a natural alternative to regular deodorant but the salt blocks have very little if any effect on neutralizing the odor causing bacteria under my armpits as advertised.</li>
            <li> Sadly this didn&#x27;t fit the bill or make the grade.</li>
            <li> This seller is selling an item that is meant to be used on rough skin, as a deodorant bar, I assume to try to use a product in a second way.  </li>
            <li> I wet it and roll it in my hands then simply wash with my hands from my face to my toes.</li>
            <li> The bar lasts a long time &amp; works well as a deodorant, without any aluminum.  </li>
            <li> and it does make your armpits tingly for a few minutes after you apply it for the first few times.</li>
            <li> Yes I especially use it just after shaving the pits...as I dry off and dry the pits I wet the salt block under a dribble of water and apply it to the pits.</li>
            <li> BUT...after about  three days use I had to  switch back to  my other  deodorant  </li>
            <li> sun burn with extreme constant stinging pain and redness.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can even use your purifying bar dry as a massage bar.</li>
            <li> Then I let my armpits dry and apply deodorant for the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Dry your armpits&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do feel  the product is individualized, only because every one&#x27;s body chemistry is different whereas increasing its use a few times a day.</li>
            <li> Me being lazy, and frequently travelling, I never seem to have something on hand.</li>
            <li> 2nd Bar from same mfg that has very little salt content.. switching mfg&#x27;s</li>
            <li> /&gt;Solid product when used as one of several proactive tools to reduce he toxicity that is one part of several small actions we can implement to reduce levels of toxicity in our bodies.  </li>
            <li> It came with no instructions, I can only assume I&#x27;m supposed to wet it down,</li>
            <li> It dry on your face for a few minutes prior to rinsing.</li>
            <li> but if youve recently shaved there might be a little stinging...</li>
            <li> When I purchased this Natural Chemical-Free Himalayan Salt Deodorant Bar, it worked at least as well as the &amp;#34;Crystal&amp;#34; without the aluminum salts.  </li>
            <li> and it is as expected.  </li>
            <li> Just wet it and use it.  </li>
            <li> I wet the salt bar and rub thoroughly on my underarms.</li>
            <li> Use your wet hands to apply a salty water film to your armpits&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was really rough and scratches the skin</li>
            <li> we are careful with the swiping motion</li>
            <li> It works but be careful -</li>
            <li> it has some rough edges that will scratch your skin.</li>
            <li> but you just wet it and rub on.  </li>
            <li> Have tried a few different salt deodorants</li>
            <li> It works great for cleansing the skin and doesn&#x27;t have any nasty chemicals that come with other cleansers.</li>
            <li> Over the years, I have grown less and less keen on wearing deodorant simply from the standing point that it never worked.  </li>
            <li> Like some other reviewers have mentioned, you have to wet the bar before you use it</li>
            <li> Ive also disovered that after Ive applied the salt bar and let it dry, applying a thin layer of extra virgin coconut oil keeps the results lasting through the day.</li>
            <li> There was a brochure in my packet which explained how to use this and the other sized products.</li>
            <li> This one irritates my skin, causing a rash while the other &amp;#34;salt bars&amp;#34; I have used do not.</li>
            <li> I usually place it on after I get out of the shower on wet armpits or dry armpits once running the bar under water.</li>
            <li> By the way, you don&#x27;t rub and rub and rub to put it on, just a couple swipes up and down is all that is needed, basically you just feel dampness and your done, let it dry a few seconds</li>
            <li> I wanted to use this product so I would not have to use conventional OTC deodorant products while breast-feeding</li>
            <li> When I woke the next morning, I noticed that I had a slight body odor, but hardly anything at all.</li>
            <li> I did have slight burning</li>
            <li> I gave this product five (5) stars because, previously, I had been using &amp;#34;Crystal&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It basically just gets a layer of water over it and it&#x27;s easier and less scratchy to apply.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This worked about half the day.  </li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive.  </li>
            <li> A little scruffy at times</li>
            <li> Gave this a shot, sometimes I felt like it worked, but often by the end of the day, I could detect some BO smell, maybe just a little though.  </li>
            <li> I used to get little bumps under my pits from deodorant/anti-perspirant, I don&#x27;t anymore.</li>
            <li> I used to get little bumps under my pits from deodorant/anti-perspirant, I don&#x27;t anymore.</li>
            <li> /&gt;its a little scratchy,</li>
            <li> Try a little moisturizing lotion instead of water and you are set.</li>
            <li> This product was a waste of money in which I will never buy again.</li>
            <li> Definitely not comfortable to run over the skin.  </li>
            <li> (It burned after application for a few days)</li>
            <li> my daughter has heavy odor and it seems to work on her.  </li>
            <li> All day protection baring any heavy work-outs.</li>
            <li> and I find plain deodorants</li>
            <li> I sometimes use it after shaving, but generally speaking it&#x27;s a bad idea and regret it the second I apply it.</li>
            <li> I cant even tell if it works for killing bacteria or not cause first time I tried using it, before going to bed (as a small test), it scraped badly my skin.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t sting, just goes on with very little water, apply &amp; you are done.</li>
            <li> It causes small cuts on your armpit, which then fill in with salt.  </li>
            <li> No more stinky feet or tennis shoes.</li>
            <li> We usually use it to wash our faces or any areas with acne.</li>
            <li> The next day I reapplied  thinking wrongly that my body would adjust.  </li>
            <li> I have been using for a couple of weeks, there is a small adjustment period.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it does the job the past reviewers have evoked in their opinion.  </li>
            <li> Or was until I dropped it on my counter and chipped off a small corner.</li>
            <li> NO Problem...still using this small block.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why they dont sell it for the feet rather than deodorant.</li>
            <li> i am not entirely sure how to use this product...?</li>
            <li> I would wind up reapplying at least once throughout the day and sill was not satisfied with the products.</li>
            <li> i thought it would come with instructions for us common american idiots who are used to smearing some gross gel in our pits...</li>
            <li> Try not to scrub too hard and it should be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical trying out the salt bar.</li>
            <li> I am very clumsy and have dropped the bar a billion times already</li>
            <li> It goes on while you are still mostly wet after a shower and keeps the bad bacteria at bay.</li>
            <li> it didnt work at all and instead made my armpits feel sticky and uncomfortable all day.</li>
            <li> But I did not want to unfairly blame the product.  </li>
            <li> I was so skeptical, but for the $3.99 charge I had to try it.</li>
            <li> For those of us who have out of control hormones, like me, it is difficult to use this product.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately my hormones and sweat glands will not allow my continued use of this product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it just did not work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it did not work.  </li>
            <li> this stings like CRAZY.....</li>
            <li> It did not prevent odor and burned REALLY bad after a couple of days of using it, even when I hadn&#x27;t shaved.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite painful.  </li>
            <li> Was disappointed in this.  </li>
            <li> had surgery and after the surgery my armpits had a horrible B.O. I never had B.O. this bad in my life, not even as a tween.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten really sick of having soaps loaded with chemicals !</li>
            <li> Not what I thought it was, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very Disappointed.</li>
            <li> nothing terrible.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE- burns the skin .</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Reviews on these products were so varied I was a little apprehensive.  But I received the bar right away and it is as expected.  Edges are smooth, even after being used.  I did have slight burning but I shave daily.  I also am accustom to using a Thai Salt Crystal so I may not have as much reaction as some first-time salt users.  There was a brochure in my packet which explained how to use this and the other sized products.</li>
            <li> burned me for sure and didn&#x27;t work for me at all. The Primal pit paste is my go to.. and actually works!</li>
            <li> Burns and did not last.</li>
            <li> A little scruffy at times but this thing lasts forever and really does work! I go back and forth between this one and another crystal deo I have And they are the best!</li>
            <li> This seller is selling an item that is meant to be used on rough skin, as a deodorant bar, I assume to try to use a product in a second way.  This product was never meant to be used as a deodorant bar.  It causes small cuts on your armpit, which then fill in with salt.  It&#x27;s quite painful.  You should purchase a product that was meant to be used as deodorant.  A salt block meant for deodorant is solid salt crystal, and will not cut your underarm up, or cause pain.</li>
            <li> This deordorant bar actually does work, but you MUST apply it to very newly clean skin. I keep my bar in the shower with me. There are no sharp edges that \\&quot;cut\\&quot; you...its as smooth as a bar of soap...but if youve recently shaved there might be a little stinging...nothing terrible. Ive also disovered that after Ive applied the salt bar and let it dry, applying a thin layer of extra virgin coconut oil keeps the results lasting through the day.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE- burns the skin . I have used the clear  style for decades and never had this issue before. Had not waxed underarms in weeks when I used it so I know that was not the reason . Tried several times OWWWW! did not bother to hassle to return. What else can it be used for ? I already have 3 himlayan salt lamps in the house :)</li>
            <li> This has been a great after shower bar for the armpits.  I use it in addition to a natural scented bar.  It goes on while you are still mostly wet after a shower and keeps the bad bacteria at bay.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Himalayan Salt Deodorant Bar for about three weeks. It does work well. The only drawback I am aware of is that is stings slightly when applied. However, the stinging only lasts for about 10-15 seconds. It is nice to have something that is really safe to use. Appears the bar will last for a long time also.</li>
            <li> I think this item is a very good thing.  The less use of chemicals the better!!</li>
            <li> I purchased Himalayan Salt deodorant as a natural alternative to regular deodorant but the salt blocks have very little if any effect on neutralizing the odor causing bacteria under my armpits as advertised. This product was a waste of money in which I will never buy again.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that didn&#x27;t have a laundry list of ingredients and would work well to keep the body order in check. I also wanted something that didn&#x27;t have a scent. I&#x27;ve tried many antiperspirants and deodorants, which all seem to just attempt to mask the body odor. I would wind up reapplying at least once throughout the day and sill was not satisfied with the products. I was a little skeptical trying out the salt bar. It did, however, make sense that the high salt content would kill the odor-causing bacteria. So, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I made sure to try it out on a hot summer day (over 100 degrees Fahrenheit) to make certain it was effective. The very first day I used the salt bar, I was constantly smelling my armpits to see if they smelled. I lasted ALL day without any odor issues. It was quite amazing and definitely sold me on the product. When I woke the next morning, I noticed that I had a slight body odor, but hardly anything at all. In 24 hours after applying the salt bar, I was nowhere near what I would smell like from antiperspirant use. The salt bar is amazing and I will never go back to typical antiperspirants/deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Definitely don&#x27;t apply directly to your armpit (as others have also warned). On the first day of use, I showered and applied directly to my underarms very gently while they were still wet. OUCH!!! I wound up with multiple scratches that burned for about 15 minutes. Now, I apply by rubbing the bar onto a wet washcloth first and then use the washcloth on my underarms. This technique applies enough salt to the skin to be effective.</li>
            <li> I was hoping  this would  work  since  it&#x27;s all natural  salt BUT...after about  three days use I had to  switch back to  my other  deodorant  because  my underarms  B.O. was becoming too much.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. ...we just love h own it works and cleans.  We use it as a foot pumice, body soao, and facial cleanser!</li>
            <li> I gave this product five (5) stars because, previously, I had been using &amp;#34;Crystal&amp;#34; deodorant and found out it was made of aluminum salts.  Deodorants just never seemed to work for me.  And believe me, I&#x27;ve tried all kinds.  When I started using &amp;#34;Crystal,&amp;#34; I was very pleased to be rid of underarm odors.  Then, I found out what I had been using.  When I purchased this Natural Chemical-Free Himalayan Salt Deodorant Bar, it worked at least as well as the &amp;#34;Crystal&amp;#34; without the aluminum salts.  I&#x27;m sold!</li>
            <li> This is NOT soap.  I use this after I lather up with Dr Bonner&#x27;s Unscented wash. I wet it and roll it in my hands then simply wash with my hands from my face to my toes. Don&#x27;t get it near eyes though.  When I get out my skin is so soft, while still damp I use it under my arms as a deodorant.  Will continue to order and spread the word.  My skin looks great without any of the toxic chemicals in all those expensive creams.</li>
            <li> Worked well as a deodorant but because it&#x27;s salt it caused my blood pressure to go up.  Beware if you use it.</li>
            <li> Tried switching to this from an alum crystal product because what&#x27;s more natural than salt? But unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t kill bacteria or fight odor for me, unlike the alum, which worked great. So maybe I&#x27;ll wash it and leave for the deer as a salt lick.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years.  The bar lasts a long time &amp; works well as a deodorant, without any aluminum.  I use it on  Underarms and my feet.  No more stinky feet or tennis shoes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years as a skin cleanser and it works great! My wife also got hooked after we got married. We usually use it to wash our faces or any areas with acne. It works great for cleansing the skin and doesn&#x27;t have any nasty chemicals that come with other cleansers. I even bought a bunch to give out to my friends! I&#x27;d recommend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li> I like this...it does work, it goes away really fast. Keep it away from moisture when not in use. Burning sensation but goes away after you rinse.</li>
            <li> this stings like CRAZY..... it is awful.  it didnt work at all and instead made my armpits feel sticky and uncomfortable all day.</li>
            <li> I should have known that the least expensive bar I could find would not be so great.  The bar has sharp edges even though slightly beveled and a section of impurities running through it like little ribbon of finely ground sea shells.  Definitely not comfortable to run over the skin.  The ones I have seen in stores have a uniform texture and very smooth rounded corners.  Sadly this didn&#x27;t fit the bill or make the grade.</li>
            <li> I have used this as my deodorant for about a year now and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  I live in Houston (a very warm climate) and I never feel stinky.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that some skin types may be sensitive to salt therapy, which was the case with me.  But I did not want to unfairly blame the product.  Therefore, the seller forwarded the following explanation to me which I hope will be helpful for you as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use our natural Himalayan Salt Purifying bars to cleanse, exfoliate, and add minerals to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For best results, dilute the salt bar by rubbing it on a wet wash cloth or on your hands, and then rub your body with the cloth. Using the salt bar directly on the skin may cause irritation, as pure salt is highly concentrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can even use your purifying bar dry as a massage bar. Simply rub the dry bar on your skin, and notice how smooth and alive the skin looks and feels.Try not to scrub too hard and it should be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That Himalayan salt is being used in 32 Industries. You also can Google all the benefits of Himalayan salt.</li>
            <li> This does not work as a deodorant for more than a five or six hours at best. I suspect everyone is different along with different levels of physical activity and temperature and humidity levels. I found a product that is similar and much more convenient and effective. It&#x27;s called &amp;#34;Crystal body deodorant stick&amp;#34;. It is also at Amazon.com. I found it at Walgreens to. The 24 hour locations don&#x27;t carry it however.</li>
            <li> The bar that arrived did not say it was a deodorant bar, though the deodorant bar is what I ordered and I am reviewing from my the list of my orders so it is the bar you are looking at now.  The wrapper said &amp;#34;soap bar&amp;#34; and maybe it would work for that, though after my experience I will not give it a try.  I used it like I&#x27;ve been successfully using a deodorant stone for years; wet it and rub it over my arm pits and soles of my feet.  I&#x27;ve never had a problem with my doedorant stones.  Thought I&#x27;d try something with no alum, so I tried this salt bar.  The first time I used it, it stung, but was bearable.  The next day I reapplied  thinking wrongly that my body would adjust.  It stung, then it burned, then it became unbearable.  When I looked in the mirror, I saw that my arm pits were fire engine red and quite bumpy with a rash.  I immediately washed my armpits and applied a jewelweed spray (for sunburn and poison ivy) and began to get relief.  I have dark olive skin and am not allergic to much, but this is not the deodorant bar for me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard about this kind of bar for years, but didn&#x27;t know much about it.  I didn&#x27;t know it was actually salt, or that it kills bacteria-which is what actually causes any kind of unpleasant odor.  I only have any issues when it&#x27;s related to hormones.  I&#x27;m really excited to finally have tried it!  It works great!  And it actually really feels really cool when you rub it on-like it&#x27;s moist, but it&#x27;s actually not.  You have to try it!</li>
            <li> This works very well.  I have been using for a couple of weeks, there is a small adjustment period. (It burned after application for a few days) Well worth the discomfort.</li>
            <li> Not what I thought it was, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> All of the sudden I get a rash from deodorant so I gave these bars a try. In conjunction with baby powder it works. Wet bar, apply under arm, and pat down with powder and good to go.</li>
            <li> I began using this with my deodorant and it immediately got rid of any armpit funk within a week. I usually place it on after I get out of the shower on wet armpits or dry armpits once running the bar under water. Then I let my armpits dry and apply deodorant for the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had surgery and after the surgery my armpits had a horrible B.O. I never had B.O. this bad in my life, not even as a tween. Lol I&#x27;m sure it was also the toxins leaving my body. But I was in my family&#x27;s country of Brasil and I did not bring the salt bar with me. After almost two months in Brasil the B.O. was horrid even with using my regular deodorant and maintaining my cleanliness. After coming home and using the salt bar twice daily for a few days my armpits returned to their normal self. I keep the bar in my routine now. With the bar I don&#x27;t need the deodorant, I just use it because I enjoy the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I am very clumsy and have dropped the bar a billion times already and it has not broken. I also place the bar into a large bar soap container so that when I move the bar around I won&#x27;t dust salt onto everything.</li>
            <li> Just wet it and use it.  it works wonderfully.  No underarm odors.</li>
            <li> Does not work as a deodorant in any way.  Leaves pits hurting and smelly. DO NOT recommend.</li>
            <li> Gave this a shot, sometimes I felt like it worked, but often by the end of the day, I could detect some BO smell, maybe just a little though.  Eventually, my SO told me that I stunk, and I was the only one that thought it kind of worked and that I needed to start using deodorant if I didn&#x27;t want to be a hermit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kind of like being a hermit and I believe it is best to be all natural and not use artificial ingredients and chemicals, so I will give this some thought.</li>
            <li> This Himalayan salt bar is wonderful as a deodorant soap bar, as well as a complexion &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; to cleanse cosmetics from my face!  it is much better for your skin than soap!  if you have a tendency to break out, let. It dry on your face for a few minutes prior to rinsing. I keep a bar in the shower and one at my sink.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Salt Deodorant for about two months and I have really enjoyed using it. I am somewhat sensitive to regular deodorants and occasionally using deodorants with harsh chemicals will cause my underarms to feel irritated. I decided to give this a try because of the all natural ingredients. I am pleasantly surprised with the results. This Salt Deodorant works great for everyday normal use and on a regular day I could not smell Body order at the end of the day.  I did notice on days that I was involved in heavier activity and sweat more there would be a slight smell of body odor by the end of the day. I knocked a star for the reason that I would smell after heavier activity. There are no perfumes in this Salt Bar to cover up Body Oder which to me is a good thing. My wife uses the same bar and after two months it is only slightly smaller than when it arrived. This will last a long time and save you money in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application can be rough at first. After all it is salt. I wet the salt bar and rub thoroughly on my underarms. At first it does scratch but after a use or two the bar will smooth out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Salt deodorant does not have perfume so don&#x27;t expect a pretty smell with it.</li>
            <li> This is a such an obvious and genious idea, why don&#x27;t more people use this?</li>
            <li> I like it so much that next time I will order some for my daughter</li>
            <li> I accidentally bought a different brand (after I had had this brand)--what a difference!  Never again.  This one is smooth (the other one had sharp lumpy bits in it).  I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this bar, it seems to work great, and we&#x27;ve had a lot of hot / humid days recently. It came with no instructions, I can only assume I&#x27;m supposed to wet it down, which is what I&#x27;ve done, and it seems to go on well and work to reduce - eliminate perspiration smell.</li>
            <li> The bar I received is about the size of a traditional plastic container of deodorant (see pictures I uploaded). It&#x27;s a smooth oval cylinder with slightly rounded ends.&lt;br /&gt;I have found that it works remarkable well as a deodorant (note that salt doesn&#x27;t work as an antiperspirant, it just controls odor by preventing bacterial growth). To apply, just slowly rub it across clean skin a few times. Avoid rubbing quickly or with a lot of pressure to prevent irritation.</li>
            <li> Cannot use this as deodorant-- burns my skin when applied.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it does the job the past reviewers have evoked in their opinion.  It seems to sometimes catch the hair under your arm and give you a bit of a jolt from my experience.  I&#x27;d wet it first, just a bit and you won&#x27;t have that problem.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for over a year, and still going strong. I have tried various commercial products, but even the 96H versions didn&#x27;t help much, and caused my armpits to get very irritated. Nothing seemed to help, but this lasts as well as commercial products. It does not prevent you from sweating (but neither did that 96H stuff in my case...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to make it work:&lt;br /&gt;1. Clean your armpits first (regular soap will do)&lt;br /&gt;2. Dry your armpits&lt;br /&gt;3. Wash your hands with this bar&lt;br /&gt;4. Use your wet hands to apply a salty water film to your armpits&lt;br /&gt;5. Let it dry!&lt;br /&gt;6. Enjoy a carefree day....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have a sensitive skin, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me much. I sometimes use it after shaving, but generally speaking it&#x27;s a bad idea and regret it the second I apply it. However, it does speed up the awakening process.</li>
            <li> It actually burned when i used it.</li>
            <li> I bought a Salt Block 2\\&quot;x 2\\&quot; square of wonderful clear Salt,smooth edges and smooth all over. Or was until I dropped it on my counter and chipped off a small corner. NO Problem...still using this small block. Yes I especially use it just after shaving the pits...as I dry off and dry the pits I wet the salt block under a dribble of water and apply it to the pits. Sting...yes at first I noticed it,but not any more unless I shaved a little too close and irritate the skin. I would still use the Salt block if that happened anyway. The slight sting goes away quickly. By the way, you don&#x27;t rub and rub and rub to put it on, just a couple swipes up and down is all that is needed, basically you just feel dampness and your done, let it dry a few seconds and that is it. I have used the same block for well over 3 years and it hardly shows much use at all. It is smooth, and I keep it in the same cellophane bag it was shipped in by a different company. Cheap and it works. When I first got it I was so skeptical, but for the $3.99 charge I had to try it. I have not bought deodorant since and won&#x27;t. I tested it....OK this is funny and was a definite TEST to see if it worked. So got it just before the Hot Summer months and applied as I have explained. I used it for about 2 weeks and I then proceeded to ON PURPOSE NOT to take a shower for 3 days. I applied it only that first day after my shower and shave. During that time I worked outside in the yard and garden working up a really great sweat. Temp here was in the 90&#x27;s....Remember this was a test. Each day I sniffed the pits, and no odor...I thought this was some kind of magic stuff. Evening of Day 3 Hubby and I got into bed. I jumped over to him and put my pit right in his face and told him to take a deep breath....HE MINDS REALLY WELL TOO... He did and I said \\&quot;Smell anything? I haven&#x27;t showered in 3 days!!!\\&quot;....well the look on his face was just priceless. He said No no smell...then yelled \\&quot;You haven&#x27;t showered for 3 days?\\&quot;....Well then I told him of the new Salt Block I got, and how he just confirmed that it worked. He just shook his head as if I had lost my mind....&lt;br /&gt;  I bought this because the info about the Men/Women in several other high Mountainous Countries found this to be the only thing that would keep the odor away. They don&#x27;t have Old Spice in these countries. The Salt Block stops the bacteria growth under the arms and that is what causes the odor. Men with hairy armpits...I thought \\&quot;Really..and this worked?\\&quot;...So I tried it.And Yes it works.&lt;br /&gt;  Give the Salt Block at least a couple weeks of daily using (clean and dry the pits, give it the fair shake) so your body gets used to it too. Remember, this is not an anti-perspirant. You will still sweat. This also won&#x27;t clog your underarm pores with chemical junk. I used to get little bumps under my pits from deodorant/anti-perspirant, I don&#x27;t anymore. I love my Salt Block.hen I told him of the new Salt Block I got, and how he just confirmed that it worked.

            <li> For those of us who have out of control hormones, like me, it is difficult to use this product. It does not take away the odor-no matter how often you use it. It also burns the skin when applied. I wanted to use this product so I would not have to use conventional OTC deodorant products while breast-feeding but unfortunately my hormones and sweat glands will not allow my continued use of this product.</li>
            <li> It did not prevent odor and burned REALLY bad after a couple of days of using it, even when I hadn&#x27;t shaved.</li>
            <li> I love this suff it works great and is drawing. I am one of the saltiest people I know but its worth it to reep the good effects thank you Himalayan&#x27;s, this is the healthiest my skin has ever been.</li>
            <li> This bar is not meant for armpits or any body part. It is coarse and feels like you are rubbing coarse sand paper on your body.</li>
            <li> This works.  I wondered and decided to try it for myself.  Glad I did.</li>
            <li> Over the years, I have grown less and less keen on wearing deodorant simply from the standing point that it never worked.  The moment that I put it on, it was as if my body was trying to remove it by perspiring more.  Unfortunately, it was always a pain to truly remove the deodorant, and it would actually make me more musky if I didn&#x27;t practically rub myself raw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you think about it, regular deodorants are just fragrances that block your pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, about the salt deodorant bar â€“ I&#x27;m thoroughly impressed.  In comparison to wearing no deodorant at all, it cuts back on body odor about 90% for me.  In reality, it makes you more aware of hygiene.  Since there is no scent, the moment you start smelling anything, it&#x27;s time to take a break and wash up.  It lasts me about 10 hours in the day.  I re-apply at night.  Really helps in keeping me feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Ok, so when i told people i wanted to switch from &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; deodorant to this EVERYONE made fun of me, but i just wanted to give it a shot. I can tell you, it really, really does work! However, because theres always a however, in order for it to work well you must be freshly showered (right after is best), the bar must be a bit wet, and you do have to wear it consistently anywhere from a week to two weeks for it to fully have your back. A few things it will not do: it will not get rid of odor if odor is already there, i.e. putting it on without showering or cleaning stinky underarms will do pretty much Nothing; it does NOT stop you from sweating, its deodorant, not antiperspirant, so you WILL sweat, you just wont stink, which for me, is totally fine. And finally, I would NOT reccomend putting it on on freshly shaven underarms, ouch! All in all, if you use it correctly it does what its supposed to, and without poisoning you in the process!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I expected. Its a nice size for the price and shipped fairly quickly. I also feel like it really works as a deodarant but has to be used midway through the day again for it to work. It was really rough and scratches the skin so I wouldnt recommend it as a deodarant bar but what I have found it to be great for is feet. Gets rid of odar and easily works off calluses. I&#x27;m not sure why they dont sell it for the feet rather than deodorant.</li>
            <li> Huge block so it&#x27;s a great deal, however for me it burns.</li>
            <li> so far, this works great killing the smell.  my daughter has heavy odor and it seems to work on her.  we wet the bar by spraying it with a witch hazel mixed with tea tree essential oil (this might have even gave the bar that extra boost in killing power) prior to application to underarm.  yes, it tingles, but quickly subsides.  no, we have not used it after shaving as it probably stings!  our routine is shaving at night, so we won&#x27;t have to find out how much the salt stings...  as for effectiveness, so far (not into the super hot summer yet) it works great.  we are careful with the swiping motion so the bar surface should remain smooth so we won&#x27;t have to experience scratchiness later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;1.) dear daughter needed more protection as the temperature rises, but it works will in combination (so far as it is not super hot yet)&lt;br /&gt;2.) as for the formed tiny salt crystal with usage, we simply scrape the bar smooth and no scratching at all&lt;br /&gt;3.) be cautious if you have sensitive skin! we have sprayed the bar then apply to tiny bit of quick stinging BUT i tried application just out of the shower wetness and OUCH! it left my underarm feeling like a second degree sun burn with extreme constant stinging pain and redness. washed off and back to the wetting the bar and reapplied to no problems</li>
            <li> I shaved and used this RIGHT after while still in the shower.  That was an epic mistake.  It scratched and burned for a while.  I have kept in the shower and used it since then with no such effect and it&#x27;s been a great deodorant. I keep it in the shower so it &amp;#34;softens&amp;#34; in the steam before I apply it.  It basically just gets a layer of water over it and it&#x27;s easier and less scratchy to apply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using this soap and it helps with the Psoriasis Placque. It cleans my skin so good. It helps take the Placque from my skin and makes it smooth. This is another one of the soaps in which I&#x27;ll always purchase. It comes with a great price and a great promise. Thank you, Amazon!</li>
            <li> Wow.. I bought this on a gamble, not really expecting it to work, but it really does!! Like some other reviewers have mentioned, you have to wet the bar before you use it and it does make your armpits tingly for a few minutes after you apply it for the first few times. I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks now and it don&#x27;t have the tingles anymore after I use it. The bar leaves a residue of salt on your skin so your skin becomes inhospitable to bacterial growth which would make it stinky. I live in Puerto Rico, so it&#x27;s ALWAYS hot here, and I&#x27;ve found that this bar works great still at keeping my &#x27;pits smelling normal and not stinky. I made the switch from aluminum-laden antiperspirant, and I&#x27;m so glad I did!!</li>
            <li> It does help, with eliminating under arm odors. It&#x27;s simply science. I do feel  the product is individualized, only because every one&#x27;s body chemistry is different whereas increasing its use a few times a day. It only takes a nano second.</li>
            <li> this is a really great product, but if you&#x27;re looking for a soap, don&#x27;t bother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten really sick of having soaps loaded with chemicals ! and this is great because salt is a natural antibiotic and there are no additives in the block.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its a little scratchy, but as others have stated you shouldn&#x27;t use it directly on your skin. Me being lazy, and frequently travelling, I never seem to have something on hand. But regardless, it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> It works but be careful - it has some rough edges that will scratch your skin.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed in this.  This one irritates my skin, causing a rash while the other &amp;#34;salt bars&amp;#34; I have used do not.</li>
            <li> This is a great product- and a good price- I will purchase again</li>
            <li> Unless you sweat a lot, this is better for you than the aluminum in any antiperspirant deodorant. Easy to apply with a little water. Can cause irritation after prolonged use. Try a little moisturizing lotion instead of water and you are set. I have now been using it for years with great results. I trust my brain is all the better for it.</li>
            <li> This product meets my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to purchasing more in the future.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend it to my children.</li>
            <li> Excellent seller, item was as advertised and i actually received earlier than expected. Great Product. This product is not meant for direct application to the skin... rub onto a wet towel and then apply to your body! 5 stars!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The bar arrived and was everything as described.  However, this was my first experience with the deodorant bar and I was using a similar product as underarm deodorant at the same time.  So, it&#x27;s hard to tell specifically which had the best impact when used at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: The Salt deodorant bar does not lather like traditional soap and can fracture easily if dropped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solid product when used as one of several proactive tools to reduce he toxicity that is one part of several small actions we can implement to reduce levels of toxicity in our bodies.  Big thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I wanted this to work, very cheap (compared to a year of deodorant), feels fine, no chemicals.  Unfortunately it just did not work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, for whatever reason my stench seemed to have been greatly amplified by using this!  I can&#x27;t quite explain it, but eventually found myself trying to avoid moving my arms away from my body for fear others would go running.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope it works for others, it&#x27;s low cost/risk if you might be one of the lucky.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this bar as an underarm deodorant.  Unfortunately, it did not work.  I contacted the company and they said..it doesn&#x27;t work for all people.  They did not offer a refund or exchange for another product.  Very Disappointed.</li>
            <li> 2nd Bar from same mfg that has very little salt content.. switching mfg&#x27;s</li>
            <li> It cut me once I used it! Never again!</li>
            <li> This works really well for me and keeps me from getting body odor. I was worried at first because I have had trouble previously with crystal deodorants wearing out very quickly. So far, the Himalayan salts have lasted all day from 7 am to midnight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not an antiperspirant. You will sweat. But you will not stink!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I imagine when the weather gets hotter, I may have to reapply midway through the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Himalayan salt bar because I do not want to use the aluminum found in antiperspirant and I find plain deodorants just don&#x27;t work well. I think the Himalayan salts bar works very well! I am very happy with it!</li>
            <li> i am not entirely sure how to use this product...? is this something i am supposed to use only when i need to? like, do i rub it in my arm pits only when i smell? i thought it would come with instructions for us common american idiots who are used to smearing some gross gel in our pits...</li>
            <li> Love this stone. Works great,  better than the &amp;#34;rock chemical crystal&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Item as described, shipped quickly, packaging great. Will order again in the future. I&#x27;ve never used this product and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> love product, I use on the back of my feet in shower...leaves my feet smooth and silky..</li>
            <li> This bar is so very smooth, &amp; it works, &amp; it lasts forever. No crystals in it. Love it! Doesn&#x27;t sting, just goes on with very little water, apply &amp; you are done. One of the best ones I have tried.</li>
            <li> This soap realy eliminates under arm odor.</li>
            <li> I cant even tell if it works for killing bacteria or not cause first time I tried using it, before going to bed (as a small test), it scraped badly my skin. It is like sandpaper in a very sensitive area.</li>
            <li> I fear chemical deodorants and feel that the more you use them the more you need them and breast cancer seems to be on the rise.  I really don&#x27;t need them that much and if you stay clean you rarely will have odor.  This works.  It doesn&#x27;t give you any directions but you just wet it and rub on.  It works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m purely in the:  &amp;#34;don&#x27;t want to stain my clothes camp&amp;#34;  when it comes to deodorants.  Have tried a few different salt deodorants and I think each kind works on different people and unfortunately, this one didn&#x27;t work on me.  I used this right out of the shower:  just a slight wetting and rubbing on my body, then careful to let the area air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This worked about half the day.  By lunch I was beginning to smell.  I&#x27;d suggest people give multiple brands a shot until they find the right one.  Crystal brand seems to to the trick for me.  All day protection baring any heavy work-outs.</li>
