            <li>Excellent.  </li>
            <li>so he is trying to get ahead of the issue :) He says that his hair looks fuller and I think it feels great!</li>
            <li>but this makes a good amount of suds without leaving my hair parched.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think it is good for pipes and</li>
            <li>20 everyone loved my hair ..</li>
            <li>My husband smells amazing.</li>
            <li>already its amazing</li>
            <li>Hair shines nicely the day after using it.  </li>
            <li>I will say that it is very strong.</li>
            <li>i tried this one to see if it was like the cayenne pepper one, but I actually liked the cayenne pepper one way better.</li>
            <li>WOW, I am very impressed!</li>
            <li>It smells ok, sometimes makes your scalp feel awesome and refreshed a lot of the times like normal $4 shampoo.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many hair growth shampoos after losing hair during menopause.</li>
            <li>I feel my hair does better if I vary products for a couple washes every couple weeks anyway.</li>
            <li>This one was okay.</li>
            <li>They need to put it in a softer sided bottle for sure.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s when I decided to order this, and I&#x27;m really glad I did.</li>
            <li>When I took off the top to shake it out, it splattered all over the tub.  </li>
            <li>I just started using healthy hair shampoo for some reason my hair is falling out more then</li>
            <li>bottle #1 will be reordering my hair did fall out a bit more</li>
            <li>As for it being a healthy shampoo that remains to be seen with time.</li>
            <li>an left my hair beautiful</li>
            <li>I decided to give it a shot and see what happens - since it was free anyway.</li>
            <li>Everything up there feels more vibrant now; the blood supply&#x27;s flowing more freely and hairs are cropping up with ease.</li>
            <li>Everything up there feels more vibrant now; the blood supply&#x27;s flowing more freely and hairs are cropping up with ease.</li>
            <li>honestly supplements such as Biotin are way better.</li>
            <li>and he said that it feels very invigorating and refreshing when he uses it.</li>
            <li>When I washed it the drain would be full</li>
            <li>I also tried the genevie it grow out more fast</li>
            <li>It really tingles on my head and has a strong smell.</li>
            <li>I know it is all natural, and my hair is so thankfull to me !!!!!</li>
            <li>Will continue to use it and consider if this is worth reordering after using this batch up.</li>
            <li>But after i use this product, hair feels different and healthy.</li>
            <li>For it to be on the pricey side, I really feel that more of the &amp;#34; real reviews&amp;#34; should be highlighted here on Amazon.. rather than the obvious &amp;#34;fake reviews&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>but now that I&#x27;ve continued using I&#x27;ve been able to wear my hair down an its starting to feel pretty healthy</li>
            <li>but really who f*ing cares anymore.</li>
            <li>This shampoo I have to say has really helped with that.</li>
            <li>So it really helps with that.</li>
            <li>I do like the shampoo and will continue to use it as it really is helping with my hair loss.</li>
            <li>did make much difference to my thinning hair.</li>
            <li>This product was given to me for free when I bought another product from the same company.</li>
            <li>it did grow fast</li>
            <li>Better than I expected</li>
            <li>Cannot say for sure if the hair falling out has slowed down or not.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know about hair growth yet because I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to know if it will grow more hair or if it will make my hair grow faster.</li>
            <li>We are both big on natural ingredients and this shampoo if full of quality stuff.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see any new hair growth in the three plus months of using</li>
            <li>but I see new growth coming out</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really soothing for my hair, my scalp gets clean and refreshed without being tight and flaky so my hair has room to breathe.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do alternate with the other shampoos, mostly just to use them up.  </li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s hoping that it will keeping working as well as it has so far!</li>
            <li>Then thereâ€™s the way it gets in and lathers up, and cleans away all the old unhealthy ick from your scalp, leaving it free to breath and giving my hair back its healthy shine.</li>
            <li>It took just a few weeks for my hair to start looking a whole lot smoother and healthier, and my scalp has been pretty much dandruff-free, too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard a lot of bad things about the sulfates in shampoos stripping hair of natural oils and that the more a shampoo foams up the more drying it is</li>
            <li>My husband &amp;#34;is a big fan of this shampoo.&amp;#34; Both of us really like the smell</li>
            <li>far as improving my hair loss condition it is too early to say.</li>
            <li>As for balding my brother did not see much results in the cayenne pepper one which is the same thing.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll settle for less shedding right now.</li>
            <li>Seriously, I opened the bottle and the smell of clove and peppermint hit my nose, bringing to mind hot apple cider and peppermint hot chocolate.  </li>
            <li>I am 23 years old Male</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good that they balance the regular shampoo ingredients with the botanical extracts, from the label I think instead of using straight water they even use aloe juice as the base of the shampoo.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even care about growing back my hair, I just want to stop where it is now and not loose anymore.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second bottle of this shampoo and no dry hair yet.</li>

            <li> then usual</li>
            <li> The thick, curdled material would not dissolve in water and took excessive cleaning to remove from tub.  </li>
            <li> I can hardly believe it.</li>
            <li> I do have one complaint about the bottle.  </li>
            <li> , it is so thick.</li>
            <li> /&gt;a lot of natural ingredients and crap like that</li>

            <li> My husband &amp;#34;is a big fan of this shampoo.&amp;#34; Both of us really like the smell and he said that it feels very invigorating and refreshing when he uses it. He is just starting to lose his hair so he is trying to get ahead of the issue :) He says that his hair looks fuller and I think it feels great! We are both big on natural ingredients and this shampoo if full of quality stuff.</li>
            <li> It smells ok, sometimes makes your scalp feel awesome and refreshed a lot of the times like normal $4 shampoo. Just uses essential oils which has no real scientific bearing on stopping hair loss. If you think this will be a miracle cure, i have some rocks that keep aliens away i will sell you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a lot of natural ingredients and crap like that but really who f*ing cares anymore. Not worth the price, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard a lot of bad things about the sulfates in shampoos stripping hair of natural oils and that the more a shampoo foams up the more drying it is but this makes a good amount of suds without leaving my hair parched.

It&#x27;s really soothing for my hair, my scalp gets clean and refreshed without being tight and flaky so my hair has room to breathe.&lt;br /&gt;As far as improving my hair loss condition it is too early to say. I will continue using the shampoo and will update this review with my progress as I go on</li>
            <li> Really disappointed. They actually charged me twice so I received an extra bottle. Instead of complaining, I decided to just keep it..hoping that this was miracle shampoo. Sadly it isn&#x27;t. Almost done with the 2nd bottle and have not notice a difference what so ever. For it to be on the pricey side, I really feel that more of the &amp;#34; real reviews&amp;#34; should be highlighted here on Amazon.. rather than the obvious &amp;#34;fake reviews&amp;#34;. I don&#x27;t know anyone who likes throwing their money away... I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> So in loooove with this shampoo! I know it is all natural, and my hair is so thankfull to me !!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many hair growth shampoos after losing hair during menopause. After awhile they all dry my hair out. I&#x27;m on my second bottle of this shampoo and no dry hair yet. I like it. I like the smell and feel and I do shed less. I don&#x27;t see any new hair growth in the three plus months of using but I&#x27;ll settle for less shedding right now. I do alternate with the other shampoos, mostly just to use them up.  I feel my hair does better if I vary products for a couple washes every couple weeks anyway.</li>
            <li> My head&#x27;s cooking and churning out hair again like it did when I was in my twenties. This clove leaf shampoo swept up all the junk that collected on my scalp and choked out my hair&#x27;s ability to grow. Everything up there feels more vibrant now; the blood supply&#x27;s flowing more freely and hairs are cropping up with ease.</li>
            <li> Hair shines nicely the day after using it.  However my scalp itches.  Cannot say for sure if the hair falling out has slowed down or not. Will continue to use it and consider if this is worth reordering after using this batch up.</li>
            <li> Did the opposite for me. Dried out my scalp and left my hair rough and brittle. I waited several months before writing this review. I actually had to stop using it...</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me.</li>
            <li> i tried this one to see if it was like the cayenne pepper one, but I actually liked the cayenne pepper one way better. This one was okay. It helped me with growing my hair a bit faster but honestly supplements such as Biotin are way better. As for balding my brother did not see much results in the cayenne pepper one which is the same thing. But everyone is different and I believe it takes about a month to tell a product works or not. if you have the money and hope you should buy it and try it until you finish the bottle.</li>

Everything up there feels more vibrant now; the blood supply&#x27;s flowing more freely and hairs are cropping up with ease.</li>
            <li> Well this isn&#x27;t a cut and dried review. First off I bought the shampoo because my hair was falling out really bad. I have long hair and I would just get handfuls all day long. When I washed it the drain would be full and then when I combed it out I would get another two or three handfuls. This shampoo I have to say has really helped with that. I have a lot let less hair loss now. So it really helps with that. I don&#x27;t really know about hair growth yet because I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to know if it will grow more hair or if it will make my hair grow faster. I will say that it is very strong. It really tingles on my head and has a strong smell. Really be careful you don&#x27;t get on your face or in your eyes. Also I needed a lot of conditioner. I do like the shampoo and will continue to use it as it really is helping with my hair loss. I do have one complaint about the bottle.  I couldn&#x27;t squeeze out the shampoo I had to take the lid off and bang it out, it is so thick. They need to put it in a softer sided bottle for sure.</li>
            <li> Well I have been using it only for 4 weeks now. I am 23 years old Male and i still notice hair dropping from my head. But after i use this product, hair feels different and healthy. I didn&#x27;t notice any hair grow though but i am going to be optimistic and keep using it, hopefully I will see changes. I don&#x27;t even care about growing back my hair, I just want to stop where it is now and not loose anymore.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I opened the bottle and the smell of clove and peppermint hit my nose, bringing to mind hot apple cider and peppermint hot chocolate.  Then thereâ€™s the way it gets in and lathers up, and cleans away all the old unhealthy ick from your scalp, leaving it free to breath and giving my hair back its healthy shine.</li>
            <li> My husband smells amazing. Yay!</li>
            <li> My hair has always been dry and frizzy, but a recent botched dye job caused it to actually start breaking and falling out. That&#x27;s when I decided to order this, and I&#x27;m really glad I did. It took just a few weeks for my hair to start looking a whole lot smoother and healthier, and my scalp has been pretty much dandruff-free, too. Here&#x27;s hoping that it will keeping working as well as it has so far!</li>
            <li> Unless you are enamoured of your plumber&#x27;s butt crack, I would not advised buying this product.  It does not come out of the &#x27;flip&#x27; lid.  When I took off the top to shake it out, it splattered all over the tub.  The thick, curdled material would not dissolve in water and took excessive cleaning to remove from tub.  Don&#x27;t think it is good for pipes and unclear how I would get it out of my hair, if there is a way to get it on my hair.</li>
            <li> did make much difference to my thinning hair. Over priced</li>
            <li> If i could leave zero stars i would! My hair fell our in clumps using this product and would continue falling out even after washing it out and drying my hair! This has never happened to me before, ever. I only used it a week and my hair was missing in patches and very noticeable thinner. Be careful, please.</li>
            <li> This product was given to me for free when I bought another product from the same company. Even though I do have issues with hair growth, I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever use this. I decided to give it a shot and see what happens - since it was free anyway. WOW, I am very impressed! I had some balding areas going on, and didn&#x27;t think anything can ever fix that. After a few weeks of using this, I started to see hair grow in. I can hardly believe it. Will definitely purchase again when this product runs out.</li>
            <li> I just started using healthy hair shampoo for some reason my hair is falling out more then what  it was I already have very thin hair I was kinda skeptical but now that I&#x27;ve continued using I&#x27;ve been able to wear my hair down an its starting to feel pretty healthy I&#x27;m gonna keep using I&#x27;m very anxious on getting my hair back like it used to be at 20 everyone loved my hair ..fingers crossed..almost done with bottle #1 will be reordering my hair did fall out a bit more then usual but I see new growth coming out already its amazing I tried another product to grow my hair longer it was the 37 grow an it did grow fast an left my hair beautiful I also tried the genevie it grow out more fast but my hair looked thin an flat i have a few spots in the front an side that were balding omg I can see Lil hairs popping out</li>
            <li> Excellent.  Better than I expected</li>
            <li> I am not impressed with this shampoo. I do not like the fragrance. I would not recommend it to anyone. As for it being a healthy shampoo that remains to be seen with time. So I may be judging it prematurely but as for now I would not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Horrible! Horrible! Horrible! Horrible! Horrible!&lt;br /&gt;It smells like something I would spray on bugs.</li>
