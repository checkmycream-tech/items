            <li>These are cute glosses that can be worn at any time.</li>
            <li>Cute colors.</li>
            <li>Product goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t dry your lips and loops awesome.</li>
            <li>The shades are very natural as well, none of them are bright.</li>
            <li>Too sticky and colors aren&#x27;t fantastic.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- smooth application&lt;</li>
            <li>I have dyed jet black hair, blue eyes and very fair skin and all of these colors look great on me.</li>
            <li>I was excited to see these listed on amazon.</li>
            <li>It is a sheer nice bright pink but not TOO bright where it looks funny.</li>
            <li>I like the product because it&#x27;s true to it&#x27;s name.</li>
            <li>Good bang for the buck, and bought an extra to keep at home for a gift</li>
            <li>This lip gloss is so pigmented it shows up so well and last really long, NYX so far is the best, I own MAC lip glass</li>
            <li>and I was happy I didn&#x27;t have to hunt down ulta to find it</li>
            <li>If I use it alone its sticky, but I definitely like on top of lipstick!</li>
            <li>but these are great for everyday use.</li>
            <li>This palette is great for everyday.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be back for more and recommend anyone considering the product to buy it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll come back for more.</li>
            <li>Im actually considering buying another pack already because Im so in love</li>
            <li>A little sticky, but I love nyx products!</li>
            <li>The colors in the \\&quot;Kiss the Stars\\&quot; gloss 3 piece set are very neutral.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and well wrapped.</li>
            <li>It came extremely fast</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this lip gloss.</li>
            <li>Smelled good and were nice colors, that&#x27;s about the only two things though unfortunately.</li>
            <li>Extremely sticky, the new butter glosses by Nyx are way better in by opinion.</li>
            <li>(sorry forget the name off hand) is my favorite b/c it does have a bit more color to it</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE their round lipsticks and lip glosses.</li>
            <li>One thing that I love about this lip gloss is that they are colors that I can where on an everyday basis.</li>
            <li>, I was very surprised.</li>
            <li>My lips are a darker pink so the colors aren&#x27;t true but they are pretty and long lasting,sticky</li>
            <li>During winter, I find it most effective if i put a base on my lips first such as a cocoa butter vaseline</li>
            <li>There were really gloopy and felt gross.</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>They lend a natural, kissable look.</li>
            <li>I am definitely going to purchase one of the other color sets, definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>The Dark pink shine is actually lighter on the lips and stands out more than the Light pink on the far Left.</li>

            <li> Im not to fund of this lip gloss only because it&#x27;s to thick and difficult to spread across my lips other than that it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- slightly tackier than the round lip glosses but far from sticky&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> then the other two.</li>
            <li> I am dark skin</li>
            <li> but I wish the colors were a little darker.</li>
            <li> A little tacky and thick.</li>
            <li> so I was looking for colors that wouldn&#x27;t look so dramatic and this set has passed the test because I am extremely picky.</li>
            <li> I do not own any lip products from the mega shine line.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so hard to find these!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this set.</li>
            <li> it you won,t be disappointed</li>
            <li> So disappointed in this.</li>

            <li> The colors in the \\&quot;Kiss the Stars\\&quot; gloss 3 piece set are very neutral. I wanted something with more color but these are great for everyday use. The pink color in the middle (sorry forget the name off hand) is my favorite b/c it does have a bit more color to it then the other two. It is a sheer nice bright pink but not TOO bright where it looks funny. I have dyed jet black hair, blue eyes and very fair skin and all of these colors look great on me. The smell and the taste of the glosses are so nice, I was very surprised. They smell so nice and you don&#x27;t have that waxy or plastic taste to them. I am definitely going to purchase one of the other color sets, definitely worth it! You can&#x27;t go wrong with this set.</li>
            <li> The two tan colours go great with my &#x27;nude lip&#x27; look. A little sticky, but I love nyx products!</li>
            <li> I like it when used on top of lipstick, the color is nice.  If I use it alone its sticky, but I definitely like on top of lipstick!</li>
            <li> I like the product because it&#x27;s true to it&#x27;s name. It provides mega shine and hydrates my lips without drying them and the shine last out for hours.  I&#x27;ll definitely be back for more and recommend anyone considering the product to buy it.</li>
            <li> I love love love this lipgloss. I was hooked on boy bait by Mac. I save money and my lip look and feel beautiful. I absolutely love these lipgloss.</li>
            <li> Good bang for the buck, and bought an extra to keep at home for a gift</li>
            <li> This lip gloss is so pigmented it shows up so well and last really long, NYX so far is the best, I own MAC lip glass and it last longer than it&lt;br /&gt;Get it you won,t be disappointed</li>
            <li> Colors can clump and staying power isn&#x27;t that great. I use it, but its not in my \\&quot;fav\\&quot; list. I don&#x27;t think I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Extremely sticky, the new butter glosses by Nyx are way better in by opinion. There were really gloopy and felt gross. Smelled good and were nice colors, that&#x27;s about the only two things though unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I just started wearing this brand of lip gloss. My daughter is a makeup artist and gave me a gift set of nyx lip gloss for my birthday. I&#x27;m pleased knowing amazon has it because my daughter told me its like $60 a gift set @ her job and it&#x27;s cheaper here. Will be ordering when l ran out</li>
            <li> These had been recommended to me by a friend and now I know why! The gloss is amazing and I am now hooked. It gives you great shine and it&#x27;s not sticky like most glosses. The shades are very natural as well, none of them are bright. I like that I can wear all three shades with ANY outfit! I will be buying lots more NYX glosses!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and well wrapped. i use these every day. I alternate depending on how i feel.  During winter, I find it most effective if i put a base on my lips first such as a cocoa butter vaseline then i apply the lip gloss for long lasting moisture.</li>
            <li> The gloss is not tacky at all and has a great shine.  This palette is great for everyday. Will definitely by this brand again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not thrilled-the colors are barely sheer and they all look the same -they look pasty</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised. Loved colors, and smell of lip gloss. Not sticky. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is the best lip gloss I&#x27;ve ever tried. The colors are gorgeous. Product goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t dry your lips and loops awesome. I&#x27;ll come back for more.</li>
            <li> I like this product but I wish the colors were a little darker.</li>
            <li> amazing color....very lovely... recommend you buy</li>
            <li> I just love love love this lip gloss it&#x27;s my favorite and I was happy I didn&#x27;t have to hunt down ulta to find it it&#x27;s so hard to find these!</li>
            <li> Too sticky and colors aren&#x27;t fantastic.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of NYX products. I absolutely LOVE their round lipsticks and lip glosses. I do not own any lip products from the mega shine line. I was excited to see these listed on amazon. I&#x27;ve uploaded a swatch of the colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- nice variety of colors&lt;br /&gt;- good pigmentation (as pictured above)&lt;br /&gt;- smooth application&lt;br /&gt;- fruity scent (not overpowering, just right)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- slightly tackier than the round lip glosses but far from sticky&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I am happy with my purchase. Ordered on the 3/8 arrived 3/11 (WHAT?!?!) These are a great buy! :)</li>
            <li> I am in love with this set! It came extremely fast I ordered this on a sunday and it came that Thursday. Im actually considering buying another pack already because Im so in love and I just got this one this week. One thing that I love about this lip gloss is that they are colors that I can where on an everyday basis. I am dark skin so I was looking for colors that wouldn&#x27;t look so dramatic and this set has passed the test because I am extremely picky.</li>
            <li> I like the shine that this lip gloss gives and the colors are good also. I recommend these to others</li>
            <li> Love them! The colors are pretty and they smell good! A bit sticky so don&#x27;t wear it on a windy day unless you want your hair to get stuck on your lip gloss :)</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this lip gloss. It was sticky as soon as I put it on and even after I wiped it off my lips still felt sticky. So disappointed in this.</li>
            <li> These are cute glosses that can be worn at any time. Best suitable for spring/summer, but can be used in fall/winter if so desired. These glosses are SHEER, and are not opaque. Alone, they compliment a strong, dramatic eye look.  They lend a natural, kissable look. Used over matte lipsticks, they lend moisture and a plump look.</li>
            <li> Im not to fund of this lip gloss only because it&#x27;s to thick and difficult to spread across my lips other than that it&#x27;s okay I may give them to my nieces</li>
            <li> Perfect gloss - the color is light.  Good price!</li>
            <li> My lips are a darker pink so the colors aren&#x27;t true but they are pretty and long lasting,sticky yes but I don&#x27;t mind it.</li>
            <li> The Dark pink shine is actually lighter on the lips and stands out more than the Light pink on the far Left.</li>
            <li> A little tacky and thick.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, works great, I love it!</li>
            <li> Cute colors. Nice lip gloss.</li>
