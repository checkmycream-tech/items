            <li> I was afraid this would not be the same color/quality as the one I bought in a store a year ago, but I was not disappointed!</li>
            <li> I just expected a deeper color.</li>
            <li> do have tan skin though so it might be a bit dark if you have lighter skin.</li>
            <li> Its beige with a hint of green.  </li>
            <li> It is a glitter polish, but because of the subtlety of the color can look relaxed or casual and goes with just about everything.</li>
