            <li>Smells clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m deducting a star because this product is just too pricey for most people (myself included) to use on an every day basis, but it IS an exceptionally nice and natural face wash.  </li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of this face wash.</li>
            <li>I tried it alongside the ClearSkin Oil, and really didn&#x27;t see any kind of improvement.</li>

            <li>It makes my skin feel clean without over drying it.  </li>
            <li>Smells great , but makes you skin very dry</li>
            <li>Face wash is a good basic cleanser</li>
            <li>I had to order this quickly because I could not wait for my LRP order.</li>
            <li>It lathers really nice, and really like the fact that it all natural!</li>
            <li>I use this face wash religiously and love it.</li>
            <li>Leaves face clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>truly ive looked for something my whole life to stop my break outs and to find that the doTERRA melaleuca oil was the answer alone</li>
            <li>neve really on my forehead ,</li>
            <li>Really helps for acne problems too.  </li>
            <li>but my advice is just wash your face then dry and apply a LIGHT layer of cocount oil them 3 drops of the oil and rub in well</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>

            <li>I have fairly sensitive skin and haven&#x27;t had any issues with sensitivity or break outs.</li>
            <li>have used it for only two days straight morning and night and now I have set patches on my face ;(</li>
            <li>MAKES YOUR FACE FEEL SOFT</li>
            <li>This face wash is gentle, but it felt like a residue was left on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I recommend ordering directly from do terra and waiting for the shipment.</li>
            <li>Gentle on the skin but deep cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Or at least to see a significant difference in my acne-prone skin.</li>

            <li> How long did it take for you guys.</li>
            <li> My skin was clearer, there was less oil and definitely cleared up my acne.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really helping me yet.</li>
            <li> I use it intermittently with other face washes as my skin tends to like variation anyways when it comes to cleansers.</li>
            <li> Works well with other Doterra products.</li>
            <li> It is a small bottle so use a little at at time to make it last.</li>
            <li> daughters cystic acne has improved dramatically as well as the texture of her skin and much less oiliness</li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t use Pro Active because it&#x27;s too harsh.  </li>
            <li> I just started using this at least 3 days ago.</li>
            <li> I feel it may have even irritated my skin making my acne worse.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to get worse</li>
            <li> i was shocked</li>

            <li> DoTERRA makes great oils and this is a great facewash.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Get&#x27;s my face really clean.  gives me a nice glow.  Does not break me out.  I highly recommend.  I just bought my second bottle.  you can make it go a long way.  I use one squirt and get a night lather going on my face still.  Lasted me a couple of months for one bottle.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Smells clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I have fairly sensitive skin and haven&#x27;t had any issues with sensitivity or break outs. My daughter also loves using this</li>
            <li> did not like the change in ingredients. found a better face wash on Etsy with no preservatives or harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> Best cleanser I have ever used!  Leaves face clean and soft.  Wish I would have discovered this cleanser years ago.</li>
            <li> I use many of the doTerra products and they have great stuff, but this product did not help me one bit. I feel it may have even irritated my skin making my acne worse. Was very disappointed with the product.</li>
            <li> Best cleaner I&#x27;ve tried in a long time- very refreshing</li>
            <li> Smells great , but makes you skin very dry&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for only two days straight morning and night and now I have set patches on my face ;(</li>
            <li> Face wash is a good basic cleanser and then we use essential oils from there.</li>
            <li> MAKES YOUR FACE FEEL SOFT I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> i have acne and i started using the melaleuca essential oil with coconut oil after i washed my face and my acne almost cleaned over night! it was amazing truly ive looked for something my whole life to stop my break outs and to find that the doTERRA melaleuca oil was the answer alone i was shocked and i want to tell the world. now i still need to wash my face and use Neutrgena acne wash im going to try this product instead and see how well it works. but my advice is just wash your face then dry and apply a LIGHT layer of cocount oil them 3 drops of the oil and rub in well thats all ...  :)</li>
            <li> This cleanser cleared my skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m deducting a star because this product is just too pricey for most people (myself included) to use on an every day basis, but it IS an exceptionally nice and natural face wash.  It&#x27;s deep cleansing, leaves no residue whatsoever, and it&#x27;s non-drying and doesn&#x27;t burn the eyes. No artificial fragrance, just wonderful aromatherapy for the skin!  I buy it as a treat to keep in my travel bag.</li>
            <li> I relied on doTERRA&#x27;s reputation when I bought this product to help with my acne.  I can&#x27;t use Pro Active because it&#x27;s too harsh.  This face wash is gentle, but it felt like a residue was left on my skin.  Plus it&#x27;s stinky.  Plus my face just broke out all over the place, even though I diligently used it twice a day for for 3 weeks.  I finally had to give up on it and go back to using Neutragena.  Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> stuff works wonders daughters cystic acne has improved dramatically as well as the texture of her skin and much less oiliness</li>
            <li> This is an excellent face wash. It smells nice, washes well without drying your skin out. However, for the price, I was sort of hoping for a miracle. Or at least to see a significant difference in my acne-prone skin. I tried it alongside the ClearSkin Oil, and really didn&#x27;t see any kind of improvement. If you&#x27;re rich and just looking for a nice cleanser, go for it. But don&#x27;t gamble on the hope that your skin will recognize money.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It cleared up my skin in only a few days and love the smell too! It lathers really nice, and really like the fact that it all natural!</li>
            <li> I love this face wash.  It makes my skin feel clean without over drying it.  I love the smell too!</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of this face wash. I love the smell, I love the way it foams and I love the way my skin feels when I am done. However, I do NOT love the price I have to pay for such a small bottle. This is something I won&#x27;t be purchasing for regular use. I use it intermittently with other face washes as my skin tends to like variation anyways when it comes to cleansers. I would recommend, tho I would definitely advise whoever I recommend this to, to search to make sure you find the best price available.</li>
            <li> The best. I had to order this quickly because I could not wait for my LRP order. I love this wash!</li>
            <li> I used this face wash and saw results in about a week. My skin was clearer, there was less oil and definitely cleared up my acne. I highly recommend this product. It is a small bottle so use a little at at time to make it last.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a month and can not tell a difference in my skin. To top that off it stinks.</li>
            <li> I use this face wash religiously and love it. However, this bottle looked like it had been tampered with and smells diffenert than the others. I recommend ordering directly from do terra and waiting for the shipment.</li>
            <li> I just started using this at least 3 days ago. And I have a acne problem. And I use to just get it on my checks neve really on my forehead , but now that&#x27;s where I get it once I started using this. It&#x27;s not really helping me yet. How long did it take for you guys. I just wanna make sure it works you know . I don&#x27;t want to get worse</li>
            <li> This is a great face wash.  Gentle on the skin but deep cleaning.  Really helps for acne problems too.  Works well with other Doterra products.</li>
