            <li>I&#x27;ve bought it for a couple of BFs and they love it too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried high-end colognes (like Burberry) and none of the high-end colognes (except Fierce by Abercrombie and Fitch) come anywhere close to the exotic smell of this cologne.      </li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite colognes.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS COLOGNE.</li>
            <li>I RECEIVE SO MANY COMPLIMENTS.</li>
            <li>Definitely very modern, but in a good way.</li>
            <li>Unique!</li>
            <li>This is a very cool perfum...</li>
            <li>Amazing, lasts a while, and it&#x27;s pretty cheap too!</li>
            <li>Great masculine scent, lasts almost all day.</li>
            <li>and I bought it cheap :)</li>
            <li>This cologne has the unique combination of smell and staying power that I simply love.</li>
            <li>I bought this when it first came out and liked it eversince.</li>
            <li>I got the first bottle circa 15 years ago for my husband and we&#x27;re still loving it.</li>
            <li>Love at first smell!</li>
            <li>Fortunately</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very distinct....</li>
            <li>It has a very fresh, sporty and clean scents.</li>
            <li>this sell sent mine in its original packaging.  </li>
            <li>Sophisticated and somewhat spicey - which I really like - but does not smell like \\&quot;everything else on the market\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I bought it as the present for my husband and he loved it very much!</li>
            <li>Other than, it&#x27;s great nd</li>
            <li>Some of the earlier fragrances were more inspiring and richer</li>
            <li>smel super fresh</li>
            <li>The cologne smells awesome but doesn&#x27;t last as long as we would like.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband for a Christmas present and he smells fantastic with it on!!  </li>
            <li>Soft, elegant and alluring.</li>
            <li>Other daily colognes I would recommend and use are Thallium sport (pretty unique) and Nautica competition (not to unique, but smells good!)</li>
            <li>My husband likes this Jil Sander perfume very much</li>
            <li>Thank you for the fast delivery!</li>
            <li>I first tried this when I was visiting Stuttgart, Germany.</li>
            <li>Once the sample ran out, I forgot about it until just recently and am glad to see I can still get it.</li>
            <li>my favorite!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I will order it for sure net time from you guys</li>
            <li>Spray in huge morning and the scent will last well into the night.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>one spray goes so far and it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find it around much anymore...</li>
            <li>Hard to describe, but it is very nice and masculine.</li>
            <li>Everyone loves this, I found it first in LA, was not able to find it for men on east coast, went to high end stores and they never heard of it for men, only woman, so glad I found it, bought 4 of them, women love the scent,</li>
            <li>JIL SANDER IS A CLASSIC.</li>
            <li>I give this scent high marks too.</li>
            <li>I highly  recommend it.</li>
            <li>The smell is extremely intoxicating and emits a light sweet smelling fragrance that will surprise you with its staying power (even days later on clothes).</li>
            <li>So many other colognes that merely smell nice can&#x27;t compete with a visit turns into a sleep over, if you catch my drift.</li>
            <li>Fortunately because that&#x27;s why for so many people they have never had the pleasure of smelling this truly unique blend of &#x60;woody-mint&#x27;, unfortunately because this cologne is getting harder and harder to get at a reasonable price.       </li>
            <li>It is an old perfume from Jil Sander</li>
            <li>A real sleeper and one of my personal favorites, especially for the cost.</li>
            <li>This toilette cologne is no longer made by Jil Sander but a few can be found if you&#x27;re lucky;</li>

            <li> This is a very cool perfum... smel super fresh</li>
            <li> Amazing, lasts a while, and it&#x27;s pretty cheap too! Plus, it smells amazing! It&#x27;s perfect as a daily cologne. Definitely very modern, but in a good way. Always get compliments on this cologne. Other daily colognes I would recommend and use are Thallium sport (pretty unique) and Nautica competition (not to unique, but smells good!) Jil Sanders is definitely up there!</li>
            <li> This is just great stuff. Can&#x27;t find it around much anymore... but, people are asking me about it every time I wear it.</li>
            <li> I give this scent high marks too. Hard to describe, but it is very nice and masculine. Sophisticated and somewhat spicey - which I really like - but does not smell like \\&quot;everything else on the market\\&quot;. Competitively priced through Amazon as well. A real sleeper and one of my personal favorites, especially for the cost.</li>
            <li> I bought this when it first came out and liked it eversince. I think the price on it is great.</li>
            <li> This cologne is my favorite. Last all day. LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Sander ever since a friend of mine brought it to me as a gift from Europe eight years ago.  To this day, I still get compliments on it and people are always asking me what it is.  It&#x27;s very distinct....I&#x27;ve never smelled a cologne quite like it.  A great buy on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about how wonderful this smells.  Maybe it&#x27;s just my husband, but OMG..,,,,,,ladies, I can&#x27;t even tell you where my head goes when he wears it!!!</li>
            <li> Soft, elegant and alluring. One of my favorite since discovering it from a sample many years ago. Thank you for the fast delivery!</li>
            <li> This fragrance is alluring and distinguished. I&#x27;ve bought it for a couple of BFs and they love it too. The fragrance is stable, isn&#x27;t differential by person wearing it</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for a Christmas present and he smells fantastic with it on!!  When he runs out, I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve heard that this fragrance is discontinued. They still have it on Amazon and I love it,, best smelling cologne on the market</li>
            <li> I love this smell! Unique! Subtle but noticeable!</li>
            <li> Great smell, price is good</li>
            <li> I do not regret the day my sister gave me a sample vial of Sander for Men. I&#x27;m a stickler for colognes that last long. I&#x27;ve tried high-end colognes (like Burberry) and none of the high-end colognes (except Fierce by Abercrombie and Fitch) come anywhere close to the exotic smell of this cologne.      Usually a close hug and kiss from female family members are received with a \\&quot;what are you wearing.\\&quot; I have had both men and women ask me what cologne I was wearing. I once had an awkward moment when a man approached me with a notepad and pen nervously in hand and asked me flat out \\&quot;what&#x27;s the name of that cologne\\&quot;       Fortunately and unfortunately I&#x27;ve read somewhere that this cologne has been discontinued.

            <li> This is one of my favorite colognes. It has a very fresh, sporty and clean scents. Spray in huge morning and the scent will last well into the night.&lt;br /&gt;This scent will not be mistaken with anything else you have.</li>

            <li> My husband likes this Jil Sander perfume very much and I bought it cheap :) I paid 27 instead of 60 USD</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS COLOGNE. SANDER BY JIL SANDER IS A CLASSIC. I ENCOURAGE EVERY MAN TO TRY THIS FRAGRANCE. EVERYTIME I WEAR IT I RECEIVE SO MANY COMPLIMENTS. I CAN SPRAY IT ON IN THE MORNING AND WHEN I COME HOME I CAN STILL SMELL IT. IT&#x27;S NOT OVER POWERING AT ALL.</li>
            <li> It is really very good with this fantastic price. It is an old perfume from Jil Sander but  smells great! My husband loves it.</li>
            <li> The cologne smells awesome but doesn&#x27;t last as long as we would like. Other than, it&#x27;s great nd and the smell is sexy!</li>
