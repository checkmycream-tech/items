            <li>it&#x27;s the best item I&#x27;ve purchased thus far.</li>
            <li>effective against many causes</li>
            <li>I use it for my hands and face because it doesn&#x27;t have the poisons most products have</li>
            <li>And I absolutely love it on my face.</li>

            <li>plus... she was bitten by a mosquito and after rubbing the cream over the mosquito bites, the itching magically stop.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>I have paid a lot more money for RX from the Dermatologist and that cream did not do what SCRUMPTIOUS did.  </li>
            <li>However, there is a 100% refund guarantee and the seller appears to be sincere in this.</li>
            <li>With a great new cream like this that was so easy to order</li>
            <li>I found that sitting at my computer and ordering from amazon was easy....</li>
            <li>, it is a fine product.  </li>
            <li>I am a huge fan and don&#x27;t ever write reviews</li>
            <li>It also is odor free.  </li>
            <li>Odor free.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s been using it for a few days now and says that it&#x27;s working great!</li>
            <li>Light, odorless</li>
            <li>and I know too much to use most products.</li>
            <li>Glad i found this new product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li>It Really Works!!</li>
            <li>I thought that it was worth trying it.</li>
            <li>Scrumptious absorbed so well that you couldn&#x27;t have seen that I had put on any cream at all.</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin and have been exposed to most of the ingredients listed on the label.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>She loves the all-natural ingredients and likes the smooth and soft feeling that it leaves her</li>
            <li>It really is SCRUMPTIOUS!  </li>
            <li>Thank God SCRUMPTIOUS is out there ;-)</li>
            <li>The name of the product includes the word &amp;#34;relief&amp;#34; and that&#x27;s what was achieved the first time I applied this cream.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your skin soft and smooth without a greasy feel.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different types and this seems to surpass them.</li>
            <li>gave it four stars because it seems to be a good product, even though it has trace amounts of things I don&#x27;t want in a cream and a few of the ingredients listed were organic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it will help my dry itchy skin though,  and I will update this review in a week.</li>
            <li>Though I have long hair in a pony tail, the top and most of the back of my head is near bald.</li>
            <li>When it comes to what I put on my skin, I&#x27;m very picky.</li>
            <li>Something that really works.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased many items and spent lots of money, but nothing helped.  </li>
            <li>her because she finally found something that works and me because I can now watch TV without being distracted with the sound of her scratching.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to all my friends and family and think the whole world needs to know about</li>
            <li>This stuff really, really works and</li>
            <li>It absorbs really well.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t smell or feel greasy and it really gets absorbed quickly to handle any dry skin issues that occur on a desert (I live in L.A.).</li>
            <li>Dries on your skin very fast, and is all natural.</li>
            <li>What a refreshing surprise when after trying many creams purporting to calm my skin with disappointing results I applied Scrumptious and as we say in Chicago, &amp;#34;forget about it&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to try the new oil!</li>
            <li>This cream is instantly absorbed and left no greasy feeling at all.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I ordered the cream and started using it right away along with a prescribed med which doesn&#x27;t really help when my skin is active.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was hoping for -- instant relief with a natural product.</li>
            <li>Decent product only lasted 4 days of normal application, price inflated for product.</li>
            <li>I have tried everything for my itchy skin from prescription to natural.  </li>
            <li>So, I was Surprised</li>
            <li>However, it seems to work for nearly everyone else (which is why I gave it a try).</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a bit expensive for all over application, but ibmainlu bought it for the face and its good.</li>
            <li>The cream is non-greasy and has a slight odor that is not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>being majorly coconut oil based.  </li>
            <li>so maybe I expected too much from it.  </li>
            <li>Thank you :O)</li>
            <li>Very often during the summer, the top of my head itches like crazy and the only remedies so far have been to scratch or wash my head.</li>
            <li>I believe the seller is confident enough to offer a guarantee behind the product and anyone who does this truly believes in customer service.</li>
            <li>My skin is always itchy, dry, and flaky regardless of the amounts of different natural oils that I used on a regular basis.  </li>

            <li> I believe the seller is confident enough to offer a guarantee behind the product and anyone who does this truly believes in customer service.</li>
            <li> My skin is always itchy, dry, and flaky regardless of the amounts of different natural oils that I used on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because of the good reviews, but was rather disappointed.  </li>
            <li> This usually helps to calm the skin down until another episode.</li>
            <li> My skin is very active at this time of the year, especially my feet, ankles and also my back.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try this new cream, &amp;#34;Scrumptious Itchy Relief Cream&amp;#34; to see if it was any different than other creams I had tried in the past.  </li>
            <li> so I have been dealing with skin issues for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> It sure made my hands soft and less itchy,  but the smell is atrocious...</li>
            <li> My only recourse when I am this active, along with a cream, is to go to my dermatologist and get a steriod shot.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this for my very itchie 82 year old mother in law who was driving me crazy with her constant scratching.</li>
            <li> I use it on my psoriasis, my dry cracking feet and even on my face &amp; neck!  </li>
            <li> This could be due to the amount I used or another reason, still unsure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Well it arrived the other day</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have that gooey feeling that other creams have.  </li>
            <li> old son gets heat rash behind the knees and this cream works for him.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other creams before but they were always greasy and messy.</li>
            <li> With the long cold winter already started in New England, my wife and I have both benefited from using this product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After drying on my skin for a couple of hours, I noticed if I rubbed my skin where the cream had been applied, it flaked and rubbed off into little plastic-like pieces.</li>
            <li> I find it a little pricey</li>
            <li> It calms down everything including my nerves!  </li>
            <li> Ive had this now for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I got this a few hours ago.  </li>
            <li> No more itchy skin for me.</li>
            <li> I spent a decent amount of money for an ugly rash!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not loving it.</li>
            <li> However,  I don&#x27;t get it,  it smells  like stale beer.  </li>
            <li> I remember when I got a horrible itching attack on my back from the sun</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this cream did not work for an eczema skin condition, which is why the neutral written review.</li>
            <li> that was so disappointing.  </li>
            <li> I had a terrible allergic reaction to this product that has left me with a nasty rash on my leg.</li>
            <li> Why does it smell so bad?  </li>
            <li> I got that annoying itch today, and gave it some time to see if it was going to stay, (the itch), which it did.</li>
            <li> Everything she tried did not work and she was just miserable until I went on Amazon and found Itch Relief Cream.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> When it comes to what I put on my skin, I&#x27;m very picky. My father (Dr. Arthur Schoch) was a renowned dermatologist and I know too much to use most products. I LOVE this one! I don&#x27;t use it for itching, but if I had an itch, I would. I use it for my hands and face because it doesn&#x27;t have the poisons most products have and it doesn&#x27;t smell or feel greasy and it really gets absorbed quickly to handle any dry skin issues that occur on a desert (I live in L.A.). I&#x27;m so happy I found out about it. My husband has discovered it as well now so I&#x27;ll be buying more soon!</li>
            <li> I have tried everything for my itchy skin from prescription to natural.  Finally!!! Something that really works.  I am a huge fan and don&#x27;t ever write reviews but this is how strong I feel about this wonderful cream.  Can&#x27;t wait to try the new oil!</li>
            <li> Update: Ive had this now for a few weeks and i got used to the smell, bow it doesn&#x27;t smell like anything to me. And I absolutely love it on my face. I don&#x27;t use it on my body BC it&#x27;s a bit expensive for all over application, but ibmainlu bought it for the face and its good. It doesn&#x27;t break me out or anything of the sort.    I got this a few hours ago.  I was looking forward to it being majorly coconut oil based.  However,  I don&#x27;t get it,  it smells  like stale beer.  It sure made my hands soft and less itchy,  but the smell is atrocious...that was so disappointing.  None of the reviews said anything about a nice coconut smell so maybe I expected too much from it.  Why does it smell so bad?  I&#x27;ll use it up bc it&#x27;s not a deal breaker but I&#x27;m not loving it. I&#x27;m sure it will help my dry itchy skin though,  and I will update this review in a week.</li>
            <li> I have Uticara Hives.  I have purchased many items and spent lots of money, but nothing helped.  This did help somewhat with the itching, so it&#x27;s the best item I&#x27;ve purchased thus far.</li>
            <li> The cream is non-greasy and has a slight odor that is not unpleasant. I occasionally have hives, and for my itching, it is soothing, but does not alleviate itching in my case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After drying on my skin for a couple of hours, I noticed if I rubbed my skin where the cream had been applied, it flaked and rubbed off into little plastic-like pieces. This could be due to the amount I used or another reason, still unsure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it four stars because it seems to be a good product, even though it has trace amounts of things I don&#x27;t want in a cream and a few of the ingredients listed were organic.</li>
            <li> My skin is always itchy, dry, and flaky regardless of the amounts of different natural oils that I used on a regular basis.  This product has helped me a lot.  My skin stops itching soon after I apply it.  The moisture locks on your skin after applying it. I find it a little pricey but it is def a good product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my very itchie 82 year old mother in law who was driving me crazy with her constant scratching. Everything she tried did not work and she was just miserable until I went on Amazon and found Itch Relief Cream. All I can say is this creme has made both of us very happy, her because she finally found something that works and me because I can now watch TV without being distracted with the sound of her scratching. This is a great product!</li>
            <li> Just rubbed it on to an itchy spot on my hands and it felt really good.  The itching has stopped.  It also is odor free.  Glad i found this new product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> My wife  was bitten by a mosquito and then  after rubbing the cream over the mosquito bites, the itching magically stop.</li>
            <li> I love it. Odor free. Dries on your skin very fast, and is all natural. I couldn&#x27;t ask for more!&lt;br /&gt;I use this at night. I wake up every morning and my skin looks very healthy and fine,&lt;br /&gt;I have moderate acne and although i cant say this helps you combat acne, it helps you to soothe and relieve you of the stress acne can cause. Gives me peace of mind. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> I have skin issues for many years.  I was diagnosed with Dermographia in 1960 and Morphea in 1999 so I have been dealing with skin issues for a very long time.  My skin is very active at this time of the year, especially my feet, ankles and also my back.  I ordered the cream and started using it right away along with a prescribed med which doesn&#x27;t really help when my skin is active.  The cream did help with the itching and I would order the cream again.  My only recourse when I am this active, along with a cream, is to go to my dermatologist and get a steriod shot.  This usually helps to calm the skin down until another episode.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was hoping for -- instant relief with a natural product.</li>
            <li> My wife was complaining about itching after having shaved her legs, so when I heard of Scrumptious I thought that it was worth trying it. Well it arrived the other day and I immediately gave it to her. She rubbed it on and she said that the itching went away almost immediately. She&#x27;s been using it for a few days now and says that it&#x27;s working great! I remember when I got a horrible itching attack on my back from the sun and I couldn&#x27;t find anything that would help. Well if that happens again I will know what to use! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I used it on my legs after shaving with wonderful results.  Also happy with the quantity for the price.  I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this review on behalf of my mother Hazel. She loves the all-natural ingredients and likes the smooth and soft feeling that it leaves her skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A surprise plus... she was bitten by a mosquito and after rubbing the cream over the mosquito bites, the itching magically stop. She said she will recommend this to all her friends.</li>
            <li> I have been a skin care and make-up artist for many years and this is absolutely THE BEST Cream EVER!  I use it on my psoriasis, my dry cracking feet and even on my face &amp; neck!  It calms down everything including my nerves!  I would recommend this product to all my friends and family and think the whole world needs to know about it&#x27;s GREAT BENEFITS!  It really is SCRUMPTIOUS!  Good pain reliever too!  Thank God SCRUMPTIOUS is out there ;-)</li>
            <li> This cream is instantly absorbed and left no greasy feeling at all. I have been&lt;br /&gt;using it as a moisturizer on my arms and legs, and am very pleased! I will be&lt;br /&gt;reordering!</li>
            <li> Though I have long hair in a pony tail, the top and most of the back of my head is near bald. Very often during the summer, the top of my head itches like crazy and the only remedies so far have been to scratch or wash my head. I got that annoying itch today, and gave it some time to see if it was going to stay, (the itch), which it did. Well, I put on some Scrumptious and the itch was instantly gone. It&#x27;s been over two hours now and the itch is still gone! Fantastic! I&#x27;ve tried other creams before but they were always greasy and messy. Scrumptious absorbed so well that you couldn&#x27;t have seen that I had put on any cream at all. Very cool!</li>
            <li> This product definitely delivers.  The name of the product includes the word &amp;#34;relief&amp;#34; and that&#x27;s what was achieved the first time I applied this cream.  Light, odorless, it is a fine product.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I have always had &amp;#34;skin tags&amp;#34; on my body, growing up, and they can make my skin itch.  I decided to try this new cream, &amp;#34;Scrumptious Itchy Relief Cream&amp;#34; to see if it was any different than other creams I had tried in the past.  I found that sitting at my computer and ordering from amazon was easy.... so lets see how it works!  Surprise!! I have paid a lot more money for RX from the Dermatologist and that cream did not do what SCRUMPTIOUS did.  Scrumptious Itchy Relief Cream is amazing!! It Really Works!! It feels great on my skin and smells nice too. So, I was Surprised but now I am Hooked. No more itchy skin for me. With a great new cream like this that was so easy to order and ACTUALLY was delivered on time and it WORKS, sign me up for my next bottle.</li>
            <li> This stuff really, really works and I think I have tried everything else I could think of.  Great great find.  Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best skin conditioners I have purchased to date.  I use it as a body cream as well as on my face.  Leaves your skin soft and smooth without a greasy feel.  It absorbs really well.</li>
            <li> What a refreshing surprise when after trying many creams purporting to calm my skin with disappointing results I applied Scrumptious and as we say in Chicago, &amp;#34;forget about it&amp;#34;. Thank you Scrumptious!</li>
            <li> I had a terrible allergic reaction to this product that has left me with a nasty rash on my leg. I do not have sensitive skin and have been exposed to most of the ingredients listed on the label. For this reason,  I don&#x27;t recommend this product. I spent a decent amount of money for an ugly rash!</li>
            <li> Living in Hawaii, my 10 yr. old son gets heat rash behind the knees and this cream works for him.</li>
            <li> still itched! Didn&#x27;t do what it said it would</li>
            <li> effective against many causes</li>
            <li> With the long cold winter already started in New England, my wife and I have both benefited from using this product.  Doesn&#x27;t have that gooey feeling that other creams have.  it rocks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gonna get two more for our daughters!</li>
            <li> WOW! Awesome Product... Exactly as described &amp; perfect!  Thank you :O)</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this cream did not work for an eczema skin condition, which is why the neutral written review. However, it seems to work for nearly everyone else (which is why I gave it a try). I do feel this review should be considered in the fact that while it may work for a majority of people, it will not work for everyone. However, there is a 100% refund guarantee and the seller appears to be sincere in this. I believe the seller is confident enough to offer a guarantee behind the product and anyone who does this truly believes in customer service. No product will work for 100% of the population. For this reason, I give this review 4 stars (5 stars for the seller, -1 because it didn&#x27;t work for me).</li>
            <li> Works, and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the good reviews, but was rather disappointed.  While it may work great for others, I didn&#x27;t feel any results on my skin.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin moist and relieves itching.  I&#x27;ve tried many different types and this seems to surpass them.</li>
            <li> Decent product only lasted 4 days of normal application, price inflated for product.</li>
            <li> This is  an Excellent  Cream  at  it best.</li>
