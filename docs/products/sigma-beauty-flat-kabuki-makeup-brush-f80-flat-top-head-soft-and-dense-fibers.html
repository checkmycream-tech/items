            <li>Really good quality brush, I use it to make powder.</li>

            <li>It leaves my foundation looking smooth and flawless.</li>
            <li>It does feel good on my face...</li>
            <li>Applying my liquid foundation has never felt so good.</li>
            <li>I gave this a try after hearing wayne goss talk about how good it was -</li>
            <li>This was bought for a gift and the recipient loved it.</li>
            <li>but I find that it doesn&#x27;t give me as good a finish as my Beauty Blender.  </li>
            <li>loved thsi brush.  </li>
            <li>so I couldn&#x27;t take a look at it in person but figured it must be as good as they say.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t figured out a good use for this brush yet since I don&#x27;t like using it for what I bought it for.</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;ve read good reviews about this so idecided to buy it</li>
            <li>good tool.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a good quality brush and you won&#x27;t regret purchasing it.  </li>
            <li>that sounds good to me.</li>
            <li>I think Sigma is good quality.  </li>
            <li>It is dense and soft--giving a smooth, even, flawless application.  </li>
            <li>Good brush with good value.</li>
            <li>So after I use the Sigma F60 i buff it out to have a smooth flawless HD finish!.</li>
            <li>as good as this.</li>
            <li>Good price too.</li>
            <li>a good foundation blush.</li>
            <li>I loved it for two months.</li>
            <li>But I did not have a good experience.</li>
            <li>Every says my makeup looks so good since I started using sigma.</li>
            <li>I never had a good foundation brush until i came across this one.</li>
            <li>and I loved it....</li>
            <li>Good deal</li>
            <li>It makes your foundation go on ultra smooth and makes your skin look flawless.</li>
            <li>It leaves an airbrushed look which is really good when using liquid foundations.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t express how good of a brush this is.</li>
            <li>Good quality brush for an affordable price.</li>
            <li>Loved it to death for two years.</li>
            <li>Not all brushes from Sigma are that good though...</li>
            <li>I do like the buffing brush with BB creams, but if I want to wear a foundation that is tougher to blend, the F80 is superior.  </li>
            <li>I LOVED it.</li>
            <li>It came within the suggested time and in good condition as well.</li>
            <li>and she loved the quality of the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>i know that the quality is good.</li>
            <li>Good brand and I like it</li>
            <li>The brush is good.</li>
            <li>Good for spreading liquids and creams.</li>
            <li>and I get a good airbrushed finish.</li>
            <li>I got this brush because I was looking for a good foundation brush with good reviews.</li>
            <li>It applies liquid foundation so smoothly and evenly, my skin ends up looking flawless.</li>
            <li>Good job on that Sigma.</li>
            <li>Really good thickness of the brush.</li>
            <li>Provides excellent smooth foundation coverage.</li>
            <li>Good communication with seller also.</li>

            <li>I originally was looking for the M.A.C. 180 brush after watching a couple of makeup artists&#x27; videos and recommendations for the best brush for applying foundation, however, I was dissapointed to found out that M.A.C. has since discontinued that brush.</li>
            <li>Both brushes feel great, and upon first use, work great!</li>
            <li>I will use this for every day looks and the beauty blender for special occasions with a flawless face</li>

            <li>Flawless and fast foundation application with this brush.</li>
            <li>I knew from the reviews that this was a popular brush, but I had no idea</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s kind of pricey for a stick that puts on makeup, it smooths it out</li>
            <li>Applies liquid foundation evenly and nicely.</li>
            <li>Nice effect w translucent powder</li>
            <li>NICE PROTECTIVE PACKAGING.  </li>

            <li>Heard many good things about this brush.</li>
            <li>I use this for my foundation and it works really nicely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments about having &amp;#34;flawless skin.&amp;#34; I do think that it soaks up a lot of product (good for me as a noob since i probably over apply).</li>
            <li>I would inshallah continue buying it because it is what I&#x27;ve been looking for to have an air-brushed kind of finishing for my foundation.</li>
            <li>Do explain why you liked this product.its</li>
            <li>My clients look flawless and airbrushed because the f80 really blends the foundation into the skin.</li>
            <li>It distributes the makeup evenly and really helps it to blend into your face perfectly.  </li>
            <li>and it is SO NICE.</li>
            <li>I can truly say that this brush gave a nice finish with my liquid foundation application.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice brush, but now I realize it&#x27;s a bit overhyped.  </li>
            <li>This is where I kind of had a problem.</li>
            <li>I am loving this brush.</li>
            <li>After reading so many good reviews on this brush, I just couldn&#x27;t wait to try it</li>
            <li>Perfect for applying foundation and an absolute beauty must have.</li>
            <li>I own over a dozen Sigma brushes and all</li>
            <li>It has held up nicely and cleans out well.</li>
            <li>Got here fast and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>Nice brush for blending foundation.  </li>
            <li>I kind of regret not purchasing it from the Sigma site ..</li>

            <li>It makes putting foundation on much easier and makes my face look flawless!</li>
            <li>I read about these online and loved mine so got two more for gifts.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m sure some customers are being sold counterfeit merchandise, without realizing who is fulfilling the order.</li>
            <li>I washed it before using it and it turns ok then 1st time using it ...</li>
            <li>After watching many you tube videos of this, I decided to purchase.</li>

            <li>I love this brush, And I&#x27;ll start off by saying, that there was NO note in my item that said I would receive a gift for a review, so my review is not for a gift, I honestly just love this brush, I use it for both foundation and powder, my makeup goes on very smooth, no lines or patches, I highly recommend brushes for foundation, as they apply it so much better the pads or your fingers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally worth the $16 for sure!</li>

            <li>Just beautiful all the way around, with super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It is dense but soft, and feels very nice when touching the skin.</li>
            <li>Its dense and adds a clean and even finish!  </li>
            <li>This is my first sigma brush and I will be purchasing more for sure!  </li>
            <li>This brush gives a flawless finish that I&#x27;ve never had with any other brush, and I&#x27;ve used many.  </li>
            <li>The Sigma F80, however, is phenomenal at getting you as close to an airbrushed perfect application, without any streaking, flaking, or patchiness that I&#x27;ve had with any other foundation brushes.</li>
            <li>The F80 Flat Top Kabuki brush has synthetic fibers making it ideal is for applying and blending liquid, cream and powder products onto the skin.</li>
            <li>This is my very first Sigma brush and I LOVE IT and am so impressed that I ordered the entire set of precision brushes.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t streak at all and best of all, it doesn&#x27;t shed (even after a deep clean).</li>
            <li>Bristles are very full and dense.</li>
            <li>Overall very good quality and will def.</li>
            <li>It is well constructed and very full.  </li>
            <li>It is perfect, with high quality material and a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perfect size and flat top shape that allows the brush to adequately grip the dimensions of anyones face</li>
            <li>I have to concur with the reviewers - it is comfortable to hold, easy to clean (using either a cosmetic brush cleaner or baby shampoo), super-soft, and effective for either powder or liquid foundation.  </li>
            <li>Love the smooth blending of my foundation.</li>
            <li>so I felt confident that I would get a genuine brush.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the fast shipping!</li>
            <li>It applies foundation so smoothly and evenly, way better than stippling brushes, which is what I have used before.  </li>
            <li>also ordered the F35, which is also brilliant, and I will definitely be ordering others brushes in the future.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Sigma!</li>
            <li>This is a great addition to my Sigma 12 pc professional set.</li>

            <li>I use my beauty blender sponge to apply my liquid foundation and then use this brush to apply my powder foundation lightly over top.  </li>
            <li>Even my cheap drugstore foundations look 10 times better.</li>
            <li>The F80 is incredibly soft and dense, and it feels great on the skin.</li>
            <li>Best $21 I have ever spent.</li>

            <li>but I thought it worked really well, bristles did not fall out and get stuck in the foundation, loved it</li>

            <li>Amazing brush, love it so much,</li>
            <li>This brush is great for blending in foundation, however it does absorb a lot of the makeup thereby wasting product and necessitating deep cleaning more often.</li>
            <li>This brush makes my makeup application very quick process in the mornings.</li>

            <li>Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend buying from Sigma.</li>
            <li>So far so good, pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>A strong chemical smell</li>
            <li>This is the 2nd time when I purchase this brush because my mom snuck my first brush :) We love it!!!</li>
            <li>Initially this brush was great worked wonderfully but after continued use the brush bristles came loose and started coming out.  </li>
            <li>Love the sigma brush  love love love and it came in pretty quick..</li>
            <li>I love the brush specially when putting liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>It is soft and large and it works great applying any kind of mineral foundation.</li>
            <li>I like the brush but only gave it 4 stars because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the greatest foundation brush ever made, but maybe I&#x27;m not using it the right way?</li>
            <li>Super soft and beautiful bristles.</li>
            <li>Very full coverage, but smooth.</li>
            <li>This is one amazing brush, and also my first Sigma purchase.</li>
            <li>Its an amazing brush , it was my first one from Sigma</li>
            <li>But I really have no reason to try another brand since I am very satisfied with this brush.</li>
            <li>It is an amazing brush when you first start using it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for powder, blush, and foundation since it is a flat top.</li>
            <li>but so far, I am really loving it!  </li>
            <li>It is amazingly soft, but with the bristles so compact it stipples nicely!</li>
            <li>The bristles are dense, and I haven&#x27;t experienced much shedding, but the brush isn&#x27;t very sturdy, and some bristles stick up much more than others.</li>
            <li>I watched many sigma review videos on youtube before purchasing this brush and the reviews have been true to fact.</li>
            <li>Its absolutely perfect in its application, incomparable to other brands in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Applies the makeup beautifully and no stray hairs even after multiple washes.</li>
            <li>Hands down best foundation brush for your money!</li>
            <li>I keep clean after ever use with makeup clothes then spray it good with a gentle cleaner once a week.</li>
            <li>HANDS DOWN THE BEST BRUSH EVER !!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Best makeup foundation brush on the market-- hands down.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know if I would be anymore impressed with Sigma brushes than the other brushes I already have, but I am!  </li>
            <li>Super soft, sturdy and dense bristles which allow for a wonderful application and buffs any liquid into the skin really well!</li>
            <li>Good make up brush, worth the price, very dense brush and good size for whole face application.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved it so much, i&#x27;ve purchased this for family and friends and am glad to say they love it as much as I do.  </li>
            <li>I have read and seen several great reviews about this brush being able to give a flawless finish using liquid foundation, however after a few washes the hairs started shedding.</li>
            <li>The Sigma F80 Flat Top Synthetic Kabuki arrived in perfect condition and very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This islands down the best foundation brush on earth, you really can&#x27;t find a better one!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used plenty of brushes in the past for my foundation but this brush leaves the most perfect air-brush-like finish.</li>

            <li>easy to clean as well.</li>
            <li>And the brush is easy to clean</li>
            <li>Thank you for making such a great brush.</li>
            <li>So double edged sword, but great for what I need it</li>
            <li>I ordered and revived my f80 brush fast and with nice packaging.</li>
            <li>just do it cause it&#x27;s worth every penny :)</li>
            <li>The makeup just slides on and it feels so smooth.</li>
            <li>It applies any type of foundation smoothly, streak free.  </li>
            <li>This is fabulous for foundation.  </li>
            <li>The quality is fantastic.</li>
            <li>i liked using the brush to apply liquid foundation and it made distributing the foundation so much easier.</li>
            <li>I use it to buff in my foundation, and it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I found a two-in-one brush from Sigma.</li>
            <li>Ordered the F80 after seeing countless great reviews.</li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this brush....</li>
            <li>This is just a flat-out fantastic foundation brush.</li>
            <li>I have been watching Samantha Schuerman on Youtube for a while, and she is always talking about how fabulous this brush is.</li>
            <li>so it was a genuine brush.</li>
            <li>It applies smoothly and does not shed at all.</li>
            <li>Use it everyday, magnificent investment, airbrush finish, buy it.</li>
            <li>Distributes foundation smoothly with no streaks whatsoever.</li>
            <li>This brush is awesome for applying foundation, however , mine had uneven hairs .</li>
            <li>Great size for getting all over and in smaller parts of your face.</li>
            <li>I bought this from Amazon.com for $24 with free prime shipping.</li>
            <li>Leaves a smooth foundation application, whether it&#x27;s liquid, cream or powder.</li>
            <li>Overall great purchase.</li>
            <li>this is a genuine Sigma brush.  </li>
            <li>This brush is fantastic.</li>
            <li>But after about 6 months, the bristles began falling out after fairly light use, about 2 uses a week.</li>
            <li>Ferule is not attached to the handle securely- the parts move, and I&#x27;m wondering if this construction is going to fall apart at some point.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for liquid and cream foundations, but I personally use it for mineral foundation.</li>
            <li>This works great in the same way my BCC brush does.  </li>
            <li>I like using it with liquid foundation and to smooth out my  concealer.</li>
            <li>Makeup goes on smooth and even.</li>
            <li>so makeup doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>It was suppose to come about five days later, so the shipping was great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and the brush tip is flexible.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Girls, don&#x27;t buy cheap cheap brushes.</li>
            <li>Great brush, and received only 3 days  after placing order.</li>
            <li>only thing is that after a while it got kinda wobbly, but it applies the make up great</li>
            <li>Applies my make-up on effortlessly, flawlessly and doesn&#x27;t waste any product.</li>
            <li>Great overall brush!</li>
            <li>I use it everyday and wash it every month, its working great for me!!</li>
            <li>I received a free E05 eyeliner brush with my F80.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Application is smooth and even.</li>
            <li>Its a great brush, you should definitely buy it.</li>
            <li>It applies foundation smooth.</li>
            <li>for 1 its cheap , cheaper then the brushes at sophora.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really shed either, which is nice compared to the powder kabuki brush I purchased.  </li>
            <li>Makeup goes on perfectly smooth and even.</li>
            <li>It was a nice brush but it wasn&#x27;t a real Sigma brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to clean as well</li>
            <li>They feel smooth - like suede -  when you apply your foundation on in a circular motion.</li>
            <li>Heard so many great things about this from different makeup gurus on YouTube, totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Applies make up even and smooth.</li>
            <li>Applies Smooth makeup.</li>
            <li>I use it with the Dr. Jarts BB cream and my face looks fantastic.</li>
            <li>it gives the face smooth look.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a genuine sigma brush.</li>
            <li>I usually quickly smooth my foundation on with my fingers  </li>
            <li>I use this brush to apply and to buff out the product with light circular motions.</li>
            <li>and you a get a free eyeliner brush with this purchase from the sigma website.</li>
            <li>Brush is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Really a fantastic, quality product.</li>
            <li>It is so light weight but applies foundation smoothly.</li>
            <li>This is a very dense brush, applies my liquid foundation amazingly.</li>
            <li>I own the Real Techniques Brushes as well</li>
            <li>My makeup glides on soooo smoothly every time.</li>
            <li>This brush isn&#x27;t a cheap brush</li>
            <li>Foundation goes on smoothly and does not cake up.</li>
            <li>Blends everything smoothly and its just perfection</li>
            <li>It helps it to go on smooth and streak free without looking cakey.</li>
            <li>Before I made the purchase, I called Sigma to make sure FRESH BOTANICA is an authorized reseller</li>
            <li>When you purchase from Amazon make sure the reseller is FRESH BOTANICA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This brush gives such a flawless, amazing finish - plus there&#x27;s no wetting a sponge and it will last you way longer than a beauty blender.</li>
            <li>Quite indispensable, I&#x27;d say.</li>
            <li>Fantastic feel and quality.</li>
            <li>, I use it everyday and it leaves my foundation looking flawless.</li>
            <li>The real Sigma F80 brush is amazing.</li>
            <li>Its already shedding after only two washes tho and just doesn&#x27;t feel like great quality.</li>
            <li>BUT THE SIGMA BRUSHES DON&#x27;T LEAVE ANY HAIRS ON ME, THE PRODUCT GOES ON MY FACE SMOOTHLY  </li>
            <li>This is the fourth brush I have tried and it is absolutely the best.</li>
            <li>this brush is also very versatile, you can use it for many many things, i just prefer to use it for my liquid foundation.  </li>
            <li>The F80 is also very dense and very big, this makes it perfect for foundation.</li>
            <li>When applying my foundation the brush left my face flawless, it really hid my imperfections, redness, and no problems with dryness.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still experimenting with his brush and so far so good.</li>
            <li>I Loved this brush, It is so soft on the skin.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I wonder how it took me so long to discover Sigma brushes, which are well made, work beautifully, inexpensive, and CRUELTY FREE.</li>
            <li>Its so soft and you can tell a good quality.</li>
            <li>I ordered F80 and just trying how it works out for me, it really makes a big difference on how i applied my foundations, looks flawless!</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>While I still love Real techniques&#x27; stipple brush-the Sigma F80 is the winner for sure.</li>
            <li>It feels so nice on the skin, so smooth, and the makeup goes on very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This brush is great really spreads very well</li>
            <li>After reading several reviews for this brush I was confident that I was making a good purchase.</li>
            <li>I loved how dense and soft the brush was, and it seemed to be living up to all the reviews I had read before purchasing it.</li>
            <li>Using this brush instead of my fingers for application, I have reduced my acne to little to none.. Love, love, love it!!</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft on your face, but not so much that they aren&#x27;t providing you the right amount of pressure to apply perfectly.</li>
            <li>I just cleaned mine for the first time and it was easy!</li>
            <li>Not only is it completely awesome, but I got it super fast!</li>
            <li>but my first one I bought a year agonies still going strong!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super soft and amazing for buffing in foundation!</li>
            <li>I first fell in love with the softness of this brush however it does have a strong plastic (?)</li>
            <li>Super soft, doesnt absorb too much product, super dense and buffs out foundation flawlessly!</li>
            <li>The price is right and the quality is astonishing.</li>
            <li>I have been using my fingers until now,  because I have never been able to find the right tool for the job.  </li>
            <li>Winning duo right there.</li>
            <li>how many YouTube videos I watched and the sephora airbrush effect foundation application brushes I got, I didn&#x27;t have the right tools... but the sigma f80 solved every thing...</li>
            <li>to learn more about this brush and other great makeup tools check out my blog at http://amandagabriella22.blogspot.com</li>
            <li>I am in love w/ this brush, no other foundation brush gives such a flawless finish,  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely going to be buying more Sigma brushes!!</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more Sigma Brushes!!</li>
            <li>From the first stroke, I was sold!!</li>
            <li>Very worth the price.</li>
            <li>and as a plus its super soft! :) This product is also nice quality.</li>
            <li>This flat sigma kabuki brush works great to put on foundation.</li>
            <li>It is soft and gently spreads foundation evenly and smoothly for a beautiful finish.</li>
            <li>I give four stars because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the best brush for my skin, personally, but the brush is of high quality.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much I purchased a new one today &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>This brush has nice soft and smooth bristles that make it easy to apply foundation.</li>
            <li>I tried this brush and it does a good job on foundation application but is not as smooth or as easy to use as my current buffing brush.  </li>
            <li>It blends so effortlessly and is quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Completely changes the look of your foundation to an absolute beautiful airbrush finish.</li>
            <li>I love buffing in my liquid foundations with this brush, definitely recommend purchasing if you&#x27;re in the market for an easy to use, yet effective brush.</li>
            <li>This brush applies my foundation flawlessly, it so easy and quick you never have to worry about streaks or the brush absobing all of your product.</li>
            <li>It picks up a bit too much of my BB cream, but that may just be me, and the application is pretty good.</li>
            <li>Overall, it is an AMAZING brush and worth more than what it costs!  </li>
            <li>It is everything i ever wanted in a foundation brush -- good quality (not flimsy or loose handle like the ELF powder brush), it has dense synthetic fibers, and most importantly, it applies all of my liquid foundations like a dream (MAC studiofix, Revlon Colorstay-- you name it).</li>
            <li>My new every day brush for sure!</li>
            <li>i love it very much 😍</li>
            <li>I am very happy with their service overall as well as my new make up brush.</li>
            <li>I use this to apply foundation, it provides flawless coverage with very little blending, and it does not cake the make up to your face.  </li>
            <li>Best 15 bucks i spent!!!!</li>
            <li>The bristles are super soft and my makeup always looks so good after the application.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super fluffy and the bristles are perfect coverage for my face !</li>
            <li>It blends incredibly good and the bristles are super soft on your face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I loved my brush and a took a very good care of it, making sure the metal part would not get any water, I would also dry it bristles down on a towel.</li>
            <li>Though the quality of the brush is great, it&#x27;s very soft, etc; it does not apply products very well.</li>
            <li>The quality is amazing, no shedding, very soft bristles, dense, even application, blends smoothly, doesn&#x27;t make foundation look</li>
            <li>Definitely multifunctional &amp; applying make up is just amazingly effortless using this brush!</li>
            <li>Not only did this brush come BEFORE the estimated delivery date; it&#x27;s AMAZING!  </li>
            <li>though it was normal because a lot of brushes shed, I have always heard amazing reviews of the sigma brushes and I never heard of anyone&#x27;s kabuki brush shedding.</li>
            <li>but it just doesn&#x27;t have the following and amazing praise that this one does!  </li>
            <li>I originally heard about these brushes online from beauty gurus.</li>
            <li>So excited I ran inside and tried it out.  </li>
            <li>This brush is perfect in my small girly hand.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when i ordered this product.</li>
            <li>The brush has a pretty fat handle and I like it because it gives you more control.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this brush so much!</li>
            <li>Well worth the investment in my opinion!</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s worth the wait!</li>
            <li>I would compare these brushes to more higher end brushes for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>so I was so excited to use it.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this brush because I watched some makeup clips that were reviewing it on YouTube.</li>
            <li>So excited to receive this brush.</li>
            <li>Well, let me tell you, this brush is definitely worth the hype!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the 17 dollars!</li>
            <li>and I must say that I am not disappointed at all.  </li>
            <li>This is my first sigma brush and I&#x27;m looking forward to purchasing more.</li>
            <li>Sigma brushes have never disappointed me.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money!</li>
            <li>but I dont mind really- its still a great brush and its very well worth the money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had to repurchase when I lost my original, and would purchase again if anything happened to the one I have now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was the first \\&quot;expensive\\&quot; brush that I have purchased, i.e. more than $5.  </li>
            <li>this is worth having in your makeup collection!</li>
            <li>This product is totally worth it!</li>
            <li>Worth the $24!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s original while color.</li>
            <li>Love sigma brushes so much!</li>
            <li>This is one of the best brushes I have used, not only is it soft but it blends and applies smoothly and airbrushed.</li>
            <li>When I recieved this brush I was so excited to try it</li>
            <li>I am so excited to use this brush.  </li>
            <li>I was really excited to try this brush out because of its rave reviews.  </li>
            <li>I decided to take a chance, and was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>At first, I was weary of buying this product because I didn&#x27;t know if it was authentic.</li>
            <li>My first sigma brush and I absolutely love it..</li>
            <li>I love this brush sooo much!</li>
            <li>This is my first sigma brush and I love it.</li>
            <li>So far I am very pleased with this brush.</li>
            <li>Love the coverage it provides with my liquid foundation, and will definitely be buying more Sigma brushes!</li>
            <li>This was the first time I tried the sigma beauty line brushes and I love it.</li>
            <li>totally worth the buy!</li>
            <li>I was much more impressed with this brush than all the other ones I looked at and tested out in Sephora, and it is pretty much two-thirds of the price of those brushes!  </li>
            <li>Any Sigma brush is worth the investment!</li>
            <li>First of all, I absolutely love the Sigma F80.</li>
            <li>I love this brush so much!</li>
            <li>I would say it is worth the money, just make sure you are really taking the time to blend your foundation with the brush to get the best airbrush effect, and take extra time blending when the brush isn&#x27;t the cleanest ;)</li>
            <li>Is this the original sigma brush ?</li>
            <li>and I must say it was worth the hype!</li>
            <li>I love this brush soo much!</li>
            <li>SO worth the money!</li>
            <li>It was worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Love it, works exactly what I need it for.</li>
            <li>Applies a flawless finish to the face with small circular outward</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>It is soft, easy to clean, and cost effective.  </li>
            <li>Hesitant on paying 20 dollars for one brush, but so worth the money!</li>
            <li>Get a better application if you spray a mist on it first.</li>
            <li>fibers are soooooo soft and it applies my favorite foundation very smoothly.</li>
            <li>The packaging was cute because you get a nice sheer bag, instructions on how to clean the brush and a free gift.</li>
            <li>its really good quality i imagined it to be bigger but its still fine</li>
            <li>I recently purchased a  flat top synthetic kabuki - f80.&lt;br /&gt;The best foundation brush.</li>
            <li>My new make-up hasn&#x27;t arrived yet, and I&#x27;m waiting until it does to try out the brush, but it is exceptionally soft, has a great usable handle, and overall looks great.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love this flat kabuki brush!</li>
            <li>(I use baby shampoo to clean my makeup brushes).</li>
            <li>Purchased the Sigma F80 flat top synthetic kabuki and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great quality, for not too bad a price, and am I am so happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li>I keep mine clean</li>
            <li>The product itself is a great size, really sturdy, and really soft on the face.</li>
            <li>it is such an amazing brush, i am going to purchase a backup :)...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned makeup brushes before and know how to adequately clean them.</li>
            <li>I am currently using the Sigma F80 for my Make Up For Ever duo mat, and it allows me to obtain a flawless and natural looking finish from my foundation.  </li>
            <li>I have used many brushes for foundation and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>I clean my brushes about once a week (sometimes 2 weeks, depending on my hectic schedule).</li>
            <li>I clean this with baby shampoo and it does the job.</li>
            <li>Essential for a flawless and natural skin look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a clean freak</li>
            <li>fit as expected , they are great</li>
            <li>I believe it&#x27;s how you clean your brushes.</li>
            <li>I have heard so many amazing things especially from beauty gurus on YouTube</li>
            <li>Used it with Revlon Colorstay liquid foundation and it blended it smoothly and quickly.</li>
            <li>It does take some effort to clean though</li>
            <li>As a professional makeup artist I use many many brushes.</li>
            <li>I cannot imagine how much money I have spent trying to find brushes that blend perfectly and do not shed.</li>
            <li>This is the most amazing facial makeup brush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>The brush itself is super smooth and doesn&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li>It really does give a flawless airbrush-type finish with minimal foundation usage.  </li>
            <li>The good thing is Simone the owner of SIgma tweeted a photo of this brush saying it had dried in four hours using some kind of drying product she was developing.</li>
            <li>I use F80 for applying liquid foundation, which is very easy and super fast when working with the brush.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft and feels nice on the skin.</li>
            <li>In any case noticed more positive reviews for this on Amazon and decided to get these for my wife.</li>
            <li>and it is amazing and so soft!</li>
            <li>I have many MAC makeup brushes, but I am becoming a huge fan of Sigma because this brand is comparable and perhaps far exceeds MAC brushes in quality, cost, and performance.</li>
            <li>As far as I can see in this brush, Sigma&#x27;s brushes are top quality!</li>
            <li>and it gives you complete full coverage and a perfect air brushed look</li>
            <li>brush is fairly easy to wash, though the Tarte Amazonian Clay is a bear to clean if I don&#x27;t wash it right away (an issue with that foundation for ALL brushes).</li>
            <li>A little pricy but very good quality.</li>
            <li>The bristles is very smooth, and very dense.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very dense and applies liquid foundation very smoothly.</li>
            <li>The bristles are so nice and soft and thick, the makeup goes on smooth and flawless.</li>
            <li>its very smooth on my skin and doesn&#x27;t absorb too much product.</li>
            <li>This new brush has been great with no shedding at all and seems better put together than the last one.</li>
            <li>I liked the flat top because it helped me concentrate the powder for days</li>
            <li>This brush was shipped very quickly and came with a nice pouch which will come in handy to store quite a few brushes.  </li>
            <li>I had used the Mac version of this brush while playing with a friends brushes,and decided to go with sigma instead due to reviews and how much I had heard about them,and I&#x27;m happy I did!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never seen a good quality product like this, better than MAC and other brushes I used before, I&#x27;ll purchase again</li>
            <li>I have another flat kabuki brush that I thought did a good job but after using this I realize it didn&#x27;t apply as smooth and evenly as this Sigma brush does.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t regret your purchase, I promise!  :)nt with Amazon b/c of the super fast, free shipping from Prime.  </li>
            <li>With the size of the brush, I was able to blend in my foundation in literally seconds since it covers a large portion of my face.</li>
            <li>Nothing special about it at all, however I don&#x27;t mind contouring with a darker foundation around my temples and cheekbones with it.</li>
            <li>and so I did right away!</li>
            <li>And oh was I RIGHT!</li>
            <li>She was right!  </li>
            <li>This brush is super soft, super effective, and super easy to maintain.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite foundation brush and just favorite brush in general!</li>
            <li>It arrived so quickly, in like 3 days, and it feels so soft as if im touching a chinchilla!</li>
            <li>The brush is soft, very dense, and works amazing!</li>
            <li>It Was more than what i expected, Couldn&#x27;t be more happy, would love to order more in the near future.</li>
            <li>the hairs don&#x27;t come off like I expected, and it works great.</li>
            <li>For anyone who desires a flawless finish to their makeup application, then this brush is definitely worth the small investment.</li>
            <li>relatively easy to clean and exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing it is soft and dense.</li>
            <li>This brush is amazing, it is recommended by professional make up artists</li>
            <li>I love this brush so much</li>
            <li>i cant say good enough things about this.</li>
            <li>I love this brush so much.</li>
            <li>Not always true.</li>
            <li>and I love it so much.</li>
            <li>oh and by the way I was expecting the shipment to take a full 7-10 days</li>
            <li>I really recommend Sigma brushes &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I find that I have to apply the foundation twice to get full coverage with this brush</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft and nicely packed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been one to use much make-up, so have not used many brushes.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to keep putting more foundation on, and it really buffs the product onto my skin so it doesn&#x27;t look cakey/uneven.</li>
            <li>Put a nickel sized blob on the back of my hand, dabbed the brush on it, and when I applied it to my face, DANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNG.This spreads stuff around GOOD.</li>
            <li>It is 100 times better, and sooo much cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredibly good at applying liquid foundation but also mineral foundation, double usage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m absolutely going to be buying more Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li>It really is one of my favorite brushes.</li>
            <li>The brush itself is very durable and has held its shape through many washes.</li>
            <li>I do absolutely love it, but if you want to save a buck, buy the eco tools one, or really any one that looks dense.</li>
            <li>I have been using it to apply my foundation and it gives me a nice and natural finish.</li>
            <li>I love it so much.</li>
            <li>Give it a try, it blends my blush nicely into my powder so there are no harsh lines</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this Sigma brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love it this much.</li>
            <li>It works so good with my liquid foundation that I bought a back up.</li>
            <li>I love it so much.</li>
            <li>Using this brush to apply full coverage foundation.</li>
            <li>the full review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>very good!better than sonia kashuk ,and price is somewhat okay for $21,not</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would really like this or</li>
            <li>I really want to love this brush.</li>
            <li>love it so much....</li>
            <li>It also gives me full coverage, and I have acne scars on my cheeks and chin.</li>
            <li>like a toddler had attacked me with fingers full of foundation.  </li>
            <li>so they don&#x27;t have to pay full price to Sigma alway.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s my absolute favorite now</li>
            <li>I use it with my Mac Full Coverage foundation.</li>
            <li>For the price, I don&#x27;t think there is a true comparison.</li>
            <li>I love this brush, it works really well with creamy/ liquid foundations.</li>
            <li>Love it so much.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe it took me this long to own one of these!</li>
            <li>and I could not say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;And thank as well for the fast shipment &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Sigma for everyone! :)</li>
            <li>and I needed something with full coverage...</li>
            <li>Application is smooth and uniform - worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Gives me a full coverage but without looking cakey.</li>
            <li>the price is not my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li>I like it better then the Beauty Blender and the Real Techniques Expert Face Brush.</li>
            <li>Brush is nice and dense and soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve needed a good brush for a while and after watching several video&#x27;s on youtube..</li>
            <li>are top high quality brushes!</li>
            <li>blends much easier and better with this brush too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but his brush gives full coverage no matter the foundation .</li>
            <li>It really makes the liquid foundation look a lot better on your skin.</li>
            <li>I love it so much.</li>
            <li>She later wrote me and said that she loved it and it blended like a dream.</li>
            <li>I like it so much that I ordered two more....</li>
            <li>If you want a heavier/ full coverage foundation brush this is for you.</li>
            <li>I love that one just as much.</li>
            <li>I use it with a full coverage liquid foundation, dab it around and then go in circles to finish it off</li>
            <li>I will be ordering the full set soon.</li>
            <li>I was planning on getting the urban Decay Good Karma brush</li>
            <li>I was using the Real Techniques Sigma brush, but this brush is 100X better.</li>
            <li>I can not say enough good things about this brush.</li>
            <li>I wash it at least once a week for best results.</li>
            <li>gives you a Full Coverage</li>
            <li>It really does look more silky, well blended - no streaking.</li>
            <li>I like this brush - nice and soft and substantial.</li>
            <li>I am quite pleased with this brush &amp; I highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li>I really want to love this brush.</li>
            <li>This brush will turn whatever product youre using (foundation, concealer etc) into a full coverage product.</li>
            <li>It is extremely soft and blends nicely.</li>
            <li>I prefer this much type much more.  </li>
            <li>I am not even sure if its the real one.</li>
            <li>I am really upset with the way this brush has held up and neither sigma or amazon will give me a refund since it&#x27;s more then 30 days</li>
            <li>It was good and now the hair is falling out in big chunks.</li>
            <li>Not a bad price either.  </li>
            <li>Not a bad brush at all.</li>
            <li>love this brush so much so soft and dense!!!</li>
            <li>It cleans up very easy and the brush is very soft on your skin.  </li>
            <li>super soft an work amazing with liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>Very dense but smooth and cleans easily.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was super fast :)</li>
            <li>and it really looks flawless whereas my previous brush required a lot of</li>
            <li>It gives me an airbrushed look every time, and I&#x27;m able to use foundations that I&#x27;d previously written off because I couldn&#x27;t get them to look good after application.</li>
            <li>the brush is super soft and nicely constructed.</li>
            <li>It is super soft and works well leaving your skin tone looking even and nicely blended.</li>
            <li>Item arrived faster than expected, very soft and applies make up flawlessly.</li>
            <li>Works wonderful haven&#x27;t had literally one single hair fall out so soft</li>
            <li>I did notice a pretty strong chemical smell when I opened the package</li>
            <li>real hair brushes is where most of the shedding occurs, as I learnt from experience trying many different companies:)).</li>
            <li>For years I applied my foundation with sponges and while it always came out fine, it didn&#x27;t have that seamless, airbrushed quality that I saw on so many and always wanted.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great for applying foundation and any other face product.</li>
            <li>but other then that i&#x27;m happy with it</li>
            <li>While I have experienced some shedding, it seemed to mostly be in the first few applications.  </li>
            <li>Its extremely high quality, super soft and dense to help the application of makeup go on amazingly!</li>
            <li>Love my new Signma Brush!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this brush to anyone looking for a new foundation brush!  :)</li>
            <li>The brush is incredible soft, does not shed (like other brushes I have) and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>This is seriously the best foundation brush i&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>I buffed out my foundation until it looked airbrushed and flawless, and it seriously took no time at all compared to trying to blend in foundation with my fingers.</li>
            <li>I cannot wait to receive my additional brushes and will most likely order more as I identify holes in my brush collection.</li>
            <li>Everybody should have this brush and should order it through amazon if you want it as quickly as I did.</li>
            <li>so there was a bit of a learning curve, but I quickly got the hang of it.</li>
            <li>It works super well stippling on liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>Super</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shed and blebds super well.</li>
            <li>I use this with my Mac studio fix fluid and it is amazing it makes my skin look so smooth.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different products and brushes but i LOVE this one.</li>
            <li>so glad I didnt buy the MAC brush which was more than double the price.  </li>
            <li>I love it for putting on my powder foundation, and to put on blush :) totally recommend it</li>
            <li>However, as much as I love my regular set, the Sigmax brushes are my favorite.  </li>
            <li>shipping was ridiculously quick.</li>
            <li>I love how it also included the monthly free gift brush that sigma provides from their direct</li>
            <li>Referring to the image above, it was such a perfect application of foundation!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this brush I can get enough of it...:-)  </li>
            <li>Just love it, only drawback is that I noticed a bristle or two popping out of the top when I received it.</li>
            <li>It is super dense, doesn&#x27;t absorb product and distributes evenly.</li>
            <li>It has quickly become a go to for me.</li>
            <li>This brush blends like magic, my foundation has never before blended so smoothly, I am so glad I finally made this purchase</li>
            <li>This brush is super dense.</li>
            <li>Luckily the Amazon store I bought it from offered me a refund, not a replacement because they don&#x27;t carry Sigma anymore</li>
            <li>and I am loyal to my state businesses.</li>
            <li>It looks smooth and more professional.</li>
            <li>It does put foundation on super even and smooth!&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li>Loved this brush but within a few months the top seperate from the bottom.</li>
            <li>Sigma F80 isn&#x27;t just a brush, it&#x27;s a magic wand that erases all your facial imperfections :).</li>
            <li>and since I have Amazon Prime, I figured I would get the brush quickly if I ordered from here(and</li>
            <li>However, It did apply quickly without streaks.</li>
            <li>This foundation really gives great coverage and for just a short amount of swipes around the face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Rec&#x27;d this brush super quick and as described from Etailz.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve found that I can quickly build coverage in spots that need</li>
            <li>ordered my package on 11/17 and it arrived quickly on 11/20.</li>
            <li>Glad I did because I love it and don&#x27;t think I could ever go back to anything else!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying a lot more Sigma brushes in the future :)</li>
            <li>Quick shipment as well ...  </li>
            <li>Application is professional grade and is very easy.</li>
            <li>First, the Sigma Flat Top Kabuki brush is amazing as a foundation brush.  </li>
            <li>I bought this as it was highly recommended by most makeup artists.</li>
            <li>This brush was highly recommended in many YouTube videos.</li>
            <li>Ok I purchased this brush with high hope&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>(PS, I am a licensed cosmetologist &amp; I&#x27;ve used many brushes both high end &amp; lower end</li>
            <li>I started to notice that whenever I used it started to shed hairs, when I lightly picked at it the hairs would easily come right off, eventually the whole brush head came off.</li>
            <li>right away I loovee how my skin felt so clean</li>

            <li>The bristles are soft yet dense enough to really blend in the foundation flawlessly.</li>

            <li>I bought the Flat Top Kabuki brush and the angled blush brush and love both of them.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>This F80 flat top kabuki is one of my favorite brushes to apply my liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>Very very very upset with this brush!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>, if you have not done so, please try this sigma flat top synthetic kabuki..a sure winner</li>
            <li>The fabulous ratings are absolutely correct!</li>
            <li>My very first pricey make up brush</li>
            <li>The shipping on this was super fast!!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and cleans up very well with mild soap.</li>
            <li>This is a decent brush, its soft and dense and good for buffing in foundation, but the e.l.f powder brush is too and it&#x27;s 3 bucks...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so soft and makes my foundation glide on so easily!</li>
            <li>Sent this brush as a gift and not only did it arrive super fast, but the brush itself is amazing!</li>
            <li>Foundation looks natural and aplly easily!</li>
            <li>I have several high end brushes that I thought were great brushes until I tried this one -</li>
            <li>The brush hairs are so soft and make for such a smooth and damn near flawless application of foundation.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this Sigma flat top kabuki brush and it is a great brush to blend my foundation with.</li>
            <li>It deserves every single word of all the positive reviews , I&#x27;m over happy with this brush</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new foundation brush to cover better, so</li>
            <li>I absolutely love my new brush.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love my new Sigma Kabuki brush.</li>
            <li>My favorite new brush</li>
            <li>New favorite foundation blush.</li>
            <li>I live in Australia so the shipping arrived two days before the latest date</li>
            <li>It leaves a great airbrushed look and uses less foundation</li>
            <li>Another great thing about using this brush is that you use less product because of the even application.</li>
            <li>I use less makeup and gives me great coverage.</li>
            <li>had previously heard it was great for liquid foundation application and even saw makeup artists on YouTube using</li>
            <li>I find you get GREAT coverage with LESS product being used.</li>
            <li>First of all, I was pleased with how fast the product arrived.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very dense and makes application of foundation easy.</li>
            <li>Nice to the sight and to the touch, this is actually a professional brush, and that&#x27;s exactly the feel it</li>
            <li>Fast and easy transaction.  </li>
            <li>I will update my review and would love to give full stars if this gets fixed.</li>
            <li>Purchased many MAC brushes and these are just as good if not better.</li>
            <li>My next purchase will probably be the brush cleaning kit, so I make sure I don&#x27;t damage my new favorite brush!</li>
            <li>This brush feels incredibly soft on the skin, blends foundation beautifully, and does a good job getting around tough places (e.g., the nose).  </li>
            <li>It is very soft and my foundation looks so much better when applied by this brush.</li>
            <li>I have to say this was my favorite brush because it helped me achieved a very natural finish.</li>
            <li>Super soft and very dense, LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>The bursh comes with a card from the seller stating that if you write a review and follow their instructions (they did not say the review had to be positive), they would send you a free gift.</li>
            <li>Using the exact same foundation and only changing the brush, my makeup looks nearly flawless and using circular blending motions with the brush while applying the foundation gives you almost a photoshopped look.</li>
            <li>As a first timer this brush lets me feel that I&#x27;m a pro!</li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase more!</li>
            <li>I ordered my brush on Tuesday and Friday it was sitting pretty in my mailbox!</li>
            <li>I am definitely going to be purchasing more Sigma brushes!</li>

            <li>so make sure you have another brush to use while waiting for the Sigma F80 to dry :-)</li>
            <li>I went with Amazon b/c of the super fast, free shipping from Prime.  </li>
            <li>I also made sure to dry them the appropriate way</li>

            <li>As a Prime member, I received my brush in two days in perfect condition and I am positive it is a real Sigma product as it has all the markers other reviewers said a real brush should have.  </li>

            <li>Have lost a few bristles, but it&#x27;s still in great condition.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a makeup guru but the final finish was amazing compared to the foundation brush from Clinique.</li>
            <li>Once I finish buffing the foundation, the coverage is very even and smooth.</li>
            <li>Fabulous high quality brush!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a HUGE difference from applying it with your hands, it really is.  </li>
            <li>This brush really stretches the amount of foundation I need to use and results in a smooth, natural-looking finish.  </li>
            <li>I really like the smooth finish</li>
            <li>Great brush for everyday use.</li>
            <li>It seemed to be glued together (cheaply made) for paying this price, i am very disatisfied.</li>
            <li>There are simply not  enough words to describe how amazing this brush is.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the money and</li>
            <li>This was worth the money.</li>
            <li>I finally decided to try this one based on much research and good reviews.</li>
            <li>It just seemed so time consuming, but it is definitely worth the effort.</li>
            <li>like im soo getting thisss, it seems like its worth the $16</li>

            <li>This brush is really soft and fat, which means better stippling.  </li>
            <li>Not absolutely crazy about this product.</li>
            <li>This brush was 16$ compared to a 40$ brush from Mac and it is well worth  it.</li>

            <li>I loved it so much and will use as soon as possible.</li>
            <li>I ordered F82 and F80 because of their incredible Amazon reviews; however, I must say the reviews were exaggerated - they&#x27;re just okay, not even close to my expectation.</li>
            <li>After using my fingers to apply foundation for many years, I was told to start using brushes in order to clear up my skin.  </li>
            <li>for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still very satisfied with this brush, I&#x27;ve been using it for a really long time almost every day to apply liquid foundation.</li>

            <li>This brush is by far my favorite in foundation brushes of any brand.</li>
            <li>I think but worth trying I guess</li>
            <li>I purchased my brush on Amazon from FRESH BOTANICA about 1 year ago.</li>
            <li>Anyone wondering if it&#x27;s worth the buy, I would buy it 10x&#x27;s over.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>you cannot tell the difference and for what I paid for it is so worth it.</li>
            <li>Well worth it and would buy again.</li>
            <li>Worth the cost.</li>
            <li>I use special solution for washing it and the brush dries super fast.</li>
            <li>The top part of the brush is very soft and goes on very gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li>It gives me a natural flawless finish on my foundation, causes me to use significantly less foundation, and gives me exactly the coverage I want and need.</li>
            <li>Excellent brush, just ordered the whole kit that includes the round kabuki, this flat top kabuki and angled kabuki.</li>
            <li>(I shape it and lay it on a sunny windowsill to dry) but it looks as good as new - the white tips are still perfect white.</li>
            <li>Love the Kabuki--is much softer than my BE flat top brush.</li>
            <li>I have used several flat top kabuki brushes that I loved and I heard about this one and figured I would give it a whirl.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever gotten such a flawless finish before, using other brushes or sponges.</li>
            <li>best brush to use to get the airbrush effect on my face, tried other brush and never get the same result!</li>
            <li>Best purchase seriously!</li>
            <li>The flat kabuki is soft and work great.</li>
            <li>plus I got it super fast!</li>
            <li>Plus super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>It came super fast when I ordered it!</li>
            <li>I lost my first one while traveling and quickly ordered another one.</li>
            <li>I get full coverage with only a little bit of foundation and it blends everything perfectly!</li>
            <li>With good care, I am confident it will last me for a long time and be well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It cleans up nicely and seems to dry quickly.  </li>
            <li>I clean with face cleanser (to remove the make up) or light shampoo (to keep the fibers conditioned and not dried out).</li>
            <li>Amazing flat kabuki brush.</li>
            <li>first was delivery 10 day earlier than the one expected, its a excellent merchandise.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d heard many people raving about this brush on youtube makeup channels and on the web in general, so I finally decided to purchase one of my own.</li>
            <li>really want people to know they are a friendly, helpful company until you have problems.</li>
            <li>waiting a long time to invest in this brush but love it!</li>
            <li>no stray bristles, was unfamiliar with the brand as all my other brushes are MAC,am delighted that it is so well made.</li>
            <li>you want to feel good about yourself for having all Mac brushes, or some other snooty brand, go for it.  </li>
            <li>The handle is a nice weight, the brush stays intact after washing with every single use, and the ends are super soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>wow this brush is my new favorite tool!</li>
            <li>I am very please with this brush and it has high quality written all over it from top to bottom - the handle, the silver ferrule and of course, the hair filaments.</li>
            <li>I am very please with this brush and it has high quality written all over it from top to bottom - the handle, the silver ferrule and of course, the hair filaments.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a high quality product at a good price considering it will last forever instead of having to repurchase $10 brushes that do have the job.</li>
            <li>The reviews were right.</li>
            <li>The price is RIGHT</li>
            <li>It is just the right size.</li>
            <li>It blends, and smoothes my skin just right.</li>
            <li>I had to try it right away.</li>
            <li>, I could never figure out why it never looked right...</li>
            <li>I use MAC Selectint right now and feel with this brush</li>
            <li>and even then it still wouldn&#x27;t look right.</li>
            <li>I had this brush for 6 months and it fell apart and with the amazon receipt they replaced it right away</li>
            <li>So the packaging on this was just right.</li>
            <li>really right...</li>
            <li>When I had received my sigma F80, the handle came off right away.</li>
            <li>just right.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even get to try mine out because it was shedding bristles everywhere right out of the package.</li>
            <li>They were right.</li>
            <li>I bought this one right after I got my Shiseido 113 foundation brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The bristles don&#x27;t fall out and it picks up the right amount of product</li>
            <li>and I wanted to review it right away,</li>
            <li>I decided to buy this one, and my decision was right.</li>
            <li>Right off d bat</li>
            <li>This leaves just the right amount of foundation on to leave you looking polished.</li>
            <li>The brushes handle is just right.</li>
            <li>The bristles and ferrule remained in the plastic sleeve, but the handle just came right off while I was trying to take the brush out of the sleeve.</li>
            <li>turns out all I needed was the right tool.</li>
            <li>hence I got to have the right tools</li>
            <li>Right after I use it I find bristles on my face and even looking at the brush</li>
            <li>and everyone was absolutly right about this product.</li>
            <li>It holds just the right about of product and distributes it evenly.</li>
            <li>I had a few bristles come out the first time I used it, but after a cleaning it was great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for light application of powders, but for any sort of MATTE look, the 187 is not a good choice.</li>
            <li>No matter how much baby shampoo I use to clean it, the stain is still there.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is NOW and will be forever my favorite foundation brush, the bristles are super duper soft and dense, can be used to apply primer, foundation (liquid or powder), tinted moisturizer or anything you want to put on your face really.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super soft and super dense!</li>
            <li>When this product first arrived I couldn&#x27;t stop touching the bristles - they are so incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>It is very soft to the skin and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is very soft and the handle seems strong.</li>
            <li>but finaly I broke down and got one now for sure I&#x27;m going to be buying the rest of the brushes:)</li>
            <li>I have been using this brush for several weeks and it is the best brush for foundation, hands down.  </li>
            <li>My foundation lays down better and looks more natural...even application.</li>
            <li>The synthetic hairs in this brush are extremely packed, dense, soft, and full which are all great things about this brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying a new one because I love it so much.</li>
            <li>I love my new brush, it arrived fast.  </li>
            <li>I really recommend this brush to anyone, specially if your looking for that airbrush</li>
            <li>First of all, shipping was super fast!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft, yet dense enough for good application.</li>
            <li>First of all I got it shipped super fast before the expected delivery date, so that was good.</li>
            <li>I like this brush better than any of my MAC of Bare Escentuals brushes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also incredibly affordable in terms of quality, especially when living in Australia, where I often find difficult to get a hold of good quality brushes which are not exorbitant in cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is my first Sigma brush and it was definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best brush i have used even better than they department stores expensive ones.</li>
            <li>It is so dense and fluffy and amazing!  </li>
            <li>I am a fan of a matte, full coverage finish, which is why the F80 really appealed to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is so soft and smooth, and produce such a nice finish.</li>
            <li>I Use this with MAC BB cream, which can be quite thick, after stippling and blending with this brush it finishes to a beautiful skin-like texture</li>
            <li>Soft, nice and professional brush!</li>
            <li>Traditional Kabuki F80 had tightly bound bristles for flawless finish.</li>
            <li>This is primarily because I suffer from severely sensitive, dry, dehydrated skin, and eczema, which is easily irritated by most all makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>Hugs &amp; xxx to My little sister from hawaii who recommended this fantastic brush to me!  :-)</li>
            <li>High quality brush bought it as a backup for the one on the full kit for my makeup artist friend and she says that it is worth the price</li>
            <li>to blend better than other sigma brushes its just easy to use</li>
            <li>Overall the brush is great and it doesnt fall apart like other cheap brushes.</li>
            <li>Easy to hold handle is not too long, just right to fit in your hand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super happy with it, and expect it to last a very long time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping is super fast and the brush is well packaged.</li>
            <li>I only wished that the shipping was free or there was an offer to have free shipping since the cost for shipping for a product that is $16 was $6.</li>
            <li>THE SHIPPING WAS SUPER FAST</li>
            <li>It came super fast also.</li>
            <li>All brushes that I Oder are soft, easily can take your eye-shadow or any pigment.</li>
            <li>:) it was a great buy and if your hesitant on buying it cause it&#x27;s a bit expensive</li>
            <li>is so soft, dense and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It covers up the scars and blemishes easily and leaves my face looking clear and gives it an airbrushed effect.</li>
            <li>Good brush, but the handle broke in less than a year</li>
            <li>I have owned many different types of makeup brushes and Sigma wins out of all of them.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was super fast, too.</li>
            <li>I am Sigma and Morphe brush loyal thanks to these products.</li>
            <li>but overall great brush and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>it is soo soft and makes application of liquid foundation soo easy.</li>
            <li>By far my favorite foundation brush... it blends very well.  </li>
            <li>Purchased this brush directly from Sigma several months ago and absolutely loved it</li>
            <li>but in my opinion if you want great quality brushes that&#x27;ll last you for quiet some time than sigma is the way to go.</li>
            <li>Fantastic brush and makes coverage application smooth, especially stipling.</li>
            <li>The hairs are so soft and delicate and hold up wonderfully during washes!</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping too.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and dense, so your makeup goes on easily.</li>
            <li>I also started recently using an amazing skin vitamin serum that really make my complexion glow: I have found that combining this mask with [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>It gives me good coverage yet goes on lightly enough so that my face looks natural.</li>
            <li>Very soft, and smooth against the skin.</li>
            <li>They are very soft, making makeup application smooth.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27; am very surprised about the quality of these brushes in a very reasonable price &amp; yet its so smooth in the skin while applying it plus NO shredding.  </li>
            <li>the brush came in a beautiful red sheer bag, very well packed with brush protector and a guide on what the name of the brush is and what it is used for.  </li>
            <li>it gives such you such a flawless look, I have no regrets about buying it.</li>
            <li>It cuts application time in half, leaves a beautiful, natural look</li>
            <li>Shipped super fast and exactly like the picture</li>
            <li>Once you use this it&#x27;s easy to tell that this brush was beautifully made, unfortunately now I want all the sigma brushes and</li>
            <li>Very smooth, with no left over streaks.</li>
            <li>They came in very fast.</li>
            <li>Also the shipping for this product was very fast.</li>
            <li>I am very much a bargain hunter</li>
            <li>i like it very much</li>
            <li>I received my brush today- shipping was very fast.  </li>
            <li>The brush is so fine and so soft that you end up with an air-brushed look.</li>
            <li>All my other cheap brushes are better quality.</li>
            <li>I have used foundation brushes before and found that the traditional ones leave streaks &amp; other kabukis use too make foundation but with this brush I can blend brilliantly.</li>
            <li>Originally this brush had such a smooth application, but now I get a bristle or two each time I apply my foundation on.</li>
            <li>I am so excited with my new brush.</li>
            <li>As for washing, i was pleased to unexpectedly recieve instructions on how to wash this particular brush and how it can be used...</li>
            <li>And while that is true to some degree, you don&#x27;t have to spend $40+ on high end foundation.</li>
            <li>It applies makeup so nicely and gives an air brushed look I HIGHLY recommend the Sigma f80.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s not crazy high, I&#x27;m just frugal), but it&#x27;s definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>but the first time I used it the bristles started falling out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a novice, just watched my first tutorial and decided to try this brush with my mac prolong wear foundation.</li>
            <li>I watched my favorite YouTubers use this brush and finally, after all 3 of my ladies said yeah to this, to get.</li>
            <li>When I first received it I couldn&#x27;t help but keep running it along my face.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>ok so im starting to do makeup</li>
            <li>the brush was not expensive at all.</li>
            <li>So glad I only purchased one!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not fake the seller is listed on sigma website as amazon aouthoriser.</li>
            <li>Im mostly using the beauty blender for simple looks.</li>
            <li>I had been wanting this for quite some time, and am so glad I finally have it!</li>
            <li>This was my first high-quality makeup brush purchase</li>
            <li>I thought that by buying a expensive brush like Mac I would have the best quality.</li>
            <li>I actually can&#x27;t describe my love of this brush.</li>
            <li>Thanks Sigma!</li>
            <li>anything really!</li>
            <li>and i tried it out for the first time</li>
            <li>THIS WAS MY FIRST SIGMA PURCHASE</li>
            <li>AND I WILL BE SHOPPING WITH THEM AGAIN VERY SOON!</li>
            <li>I purchased the F82 last week and fell in love and had to get this one</li>
            <li>This was my first experience using a brush for foundation</li>
            <li>My Brush shipped SO FAST!</li>
            <li>I tried this for the first time today....</li>
            <li>For the first six months.</li>
            <li>Once again, Sigma has not upset me yet with their products, thanks Sigma!</li>
            <li>Would recommend for anyone interested in buying this brush.</li>
            <li>This is my first sigma brush purchase</li>
            <li>Oh and they ship fast!</li>
            <li>This is my first Sigma brush, and I can&#x27;t wait to buy more!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really like this brush!</li>
            <li>This is the first brush I&#x27;ve ever used for foundation</li>
            <li>and the brush came well protected in a cute red bag</li>
            <li>This is the first time I used a sigma brush</li>
            <li>This brush arrived on time and is exactly as pictured.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was also pretty faster than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>It shipped so fast too!</li>
            <li>I love how the brush has just enough dense to it.</li>
            <li>I USED THIS BRUSH FOR THE FIRST TIME TODAY.</li>
            <li>First time I have ever used a foundation brush.</li>
            <li>The shipping was exact</li>
            <li>It really makes a difference!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s started losing bristles and then when I went to wash it today, the whole head of bristles pulled out of the handle!  </li>
            <li>It absolutely did!</li>
            <li>I love it and will definitely be recommending it to my friends...</li>
            <li>I will definitely repurchase more Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li>I used this brush Saturday for the first time</li>
            <li>This brush blends liquid makeup so naturally and smoothly.</li>
            <li>You will definately see the difference the first time you use it.</li>
            <li>but my problem is that I tend to use more product to achieve a medium coverage with the beauty blender because the damp sponge sheer the foundation</li>
            <li>I hope to purchase more in the future!</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell which is which, so my guess is that this is authentic since they&#x27;re exactly the same.</li>
            <li>This was the first Sigma brush I purchased.</li>
            <li>The shipping is SOO fast too!</li>
            <li>I got butterflies in my stomach when I first used it</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, one of the bristles popped out as longer than the others, and I can&#x27;t even pull it out.</li>
            <li>So ridiculously soft and glides on smooth.</li>
            <li>better than any traditional foundation brushes!easy,fast to apply.get</li>
            <li>It works perfect for my liquid foundation and powder, It glides on my foundation and doesn&#x27;t make my foundation look weird after wards.</li>
            <li>I love this brush, it only problem i had with it was that when I got it in the mail, some of the Brussels were sticking out.</li>
            <li>I really like this brush!</li>
            <li>This is my first time doing my foundation with this brush instead of my hands or sponge, and I have to say it does make a difference.</li>
            <li>This was the first brush i have purchased from Sigma</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using this brush so far.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I just used this brush for the first time today</li>
            <li>I didnt know a brush could help my makeup so much!</li>
            <li>I am pleased that I ordered it outside the set.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>so I believe it&#x27;s not a fake one.</li>
            <li>The packaging was also sketchy with just a piece of plastic that appears pretty cheap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My first time to buy Sigma brush</li>
            <li>, that is exactly why I had bought it.</li>
            <li>I use it all the time and it makes my makeup come out exactly how I want.</li>
            <li>This is my first foundation brush, so it may be that brushes are not for me.</li>
            <li>So sad that Sigma is not like amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon you are all doing a wonderful job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but this actually works way better.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!  </li>
            <li>From now on only going to buy thus brand :)</li>
            <li>I really like the quality of this brush!</li>
            <li>I have never been interested in using makeup brushes before I bought this one.</li>
            <li>Will look at more sigma brushes in the future.</li>
            <li>All joking aside, I love this brush, would recommend this brush to anyone and have on several occasions.</li>
            <li>I received this order exactly on time, no issues.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and your foundation goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t be more specific as I am not the one who uses it, but my friend recommends it fully.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve used a brush to apply my makeup.  </li>
            <li>First of all, I purchased it from Etailz, one of the Sigma approved Amazon retailers.  </li>
            <li>but I most definitely noticed a difference between the application with the E.L.F brush and this one -</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I have been wanting in a foundation brush.</li>
            <li>It drops the hair since the first time I used it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Now I expect this from $3 elf brushes, but Sigma isn&#x27;t exactly that cheap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only difference I saw was that this one was more dense.  </li>
            <li>Now when I do my makeup, I feel like it isn&#x27;t complete until I use this to smooth it out.</li>
            <li>I am looking forward to replace most of my Mac brushed with Sigmas!!!</li>
            <li>When purchasing a product from a reputable site like amazon, I would expect they hold their sellers to a higher standard.</li>
            <li>It is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>and I recommend it to anybody interested in buying it.</li>
            <li>The shipping was so fast too!</li>
            <li>Thanks Sigma!</li>
            <li>Oh, but I intend to get the travel set next time, :-).</li>
            <li>brush is REALLY dense though!</li>
            <li>Extremely fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>Makes for much easier application!</li>
            <li>I did not return it simply because I LOVE this brush</li>
            <li>I had been wanting to try Sigma brushes for a while, so I figured that this one was affordable, especially since I use my stippling brush the most.</li>
            <li>Next time I want to try a more &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; makeup brush</li>
            <li>Works pretty well.</li>
            <li>(I seen alot of reviews that said it brakes.&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li>I have several Sigma brushes that have lasted for a couple of years after many washings.</li>
            <li>this is my first brush from sigma.</li>
            <li>i will be trying more sigma brushes in the future.</li>
            <li>I look forward to puchasing more brushes in the future.  </li>
            <li>I first saw reviews about it on YouTube</li>
            <li>This is my first Sigma brush ever.</li>
            <li>Another thing i love about this brush is that it doesnt leave any lines on your face so you don&#x27;t have to do extra blending.</li>
            <li>I love this brush and at this price will only purchase Sigma brushes from now on.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am satisfied and I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more Sigma brushes in the future!</li>
            <li>The brush is so soft and it distributes the makeup so smoothly and even.</li>
            <li>This was the first brush I have purchased from Sigma.</li>
            <li>I love this brush and use it daily to apply my foundation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the first one I&#x27;ve had of this type, but I&#x27;ve had it for what feels like a year now or so</li>
            <li>fast delivery!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>When I went to wash my brush for the first time all the hairs came out of the brush.</li>
            <li>This is my first makeup brush to use for the stippling technique.  </li>
            <li>This definitely blends and feels better.</li>
            <li>I will probably use the brush for most of my face and use the beauty blender for under the eye area to apply concealer or if I am using two different foundation colors I may use one with the brush and one with the blender.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more brushes from sigma.</li>
            <li>I definitely will be buying more.</li>
            <li>The lenght of the handle is perfect and it comes with a protective plastic sleeve so that it doesn&#x27;t get weird</li>
            <li>The metal and wood parts came unglued and fell apart within the first three weeks of use.</li>
            <li>These is not the first time i pay it i like it</li>
            <li>Very pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll be looking at more from this brand in the future.</li>
            <li>how much difference it makes!</li>
            <li>Gives a smooth finish to your liquid foundation, and SOFT.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more brushes from Sigma in the future.</li>
            <li>Most big time makeup artists on youtube have this reaction as well (see video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;jltoL58UlE8).</li>
            <li>This is really what I was looking for!  </li>
            <li>I just want to first say when I apply my foundation I just use my fingers</li>
            <li>First let me just say this, once you have used the Sigma F80 you will never want to use anything else to put your foundation on.</li>
            <li>And I should mention that it is real!</li>
            <li>This was my first purchase from Sigma, let me tell you...</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to buy more sigma brushes in the future.</li>
            <li>I bought this brush thru the actual Sigma site, and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I also use it to pat in concealer for blemishes and under eye highlight ;)  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ever used a brush for applying foundation</li>
            <li>I first heard about it on YouTube and saw tons</li>
            <li>Several members in my favorite make-up forum raved about this brush and assured me I would have zero complaints.  </li>
            <li>It holds up to some of the higher end brushes I have.</li>
            <li>I feel like others similar are better</li>
            <li>So glad I finally bought a Sigma brush!</li>
            <li>This brush is my first sigma brush I purchased.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the only way you&#x27;ll know you&#x27;re buying an authentic product.</li>
            <li>The brush really makes a difference  in how your makeup looks!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what everyone says.  </li>
            <li>It is my first sigma brush</li>
            <li>short, love Sigma brushes ,but I wouldn&#x27;t order from this seller.</li>
            <li>This is my first foundation brush, I used to apply my foundation with my fingers but decided to give the brush a go.</li>
            <li>This is way better than the one I bought from MAC that is similar !  </li>
            <li>I have to say I love both brushes equally.</li>
            <li>A smooth brush that blends the foundation and keep it natural on your face.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll always re-order this in the future :)</li>
            <li>recommend using a Moisturizer or Primer before you begin with your makeup with this brush, I feel like it gives it a bit more of a glow in your face, especially if you wanna seem Tan in the summer!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was my first try with a brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll most definitely purchase Sigma brushes again.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t washed it yet  though.</li>
            <li>but it is pretty legit</li>
            <li>The brush is just okay, definitely wouldn&#x27;t pay another $20 for this.</li>
            <li>I knew exactly what brush I wanted</li>
            <li>This is my first one.</li>
            <li>This was my first Sigma brush</li>
            <li>This brush really lives up to its hype!</li>
            <li>It is my first one</li>
            <li>Nice, just as expected.</li>
            <li>This is my first brush</li>
            <li>so I finally decided to purchase one myself and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>Thanks Sigma!</li>
            <li>I will recommend to everyone and will order more similar products immediately!</li>
            <li>I washed it the first day I got it</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more Sigma brushes as the quality is just unparalleled.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not nearly as expensive as department store brushes...</li>
            <li>This is my first time buying a Sigma makeup brush</li>
            <li>ANYMORE FIRST</li>
            <li>They are in good condition after 2 years of everyday wear.  </li>
            <li>Kinda heavy which for me means good quality.</li>
            <li>Not only does the brush make applying foundation easier and faster, it is also really soft, durable and easy to clean!  </li>
            <li>brush is super soft, yet firm enough for perfect application.</li>
            <li>i love my f80 flat top kabuki brush, is amazingly soft and very well made the shipping was fast</li>
            <li>At first I was thinking to buy the Everyday Minerals flat top brush, but after I saw tons of good reviews of this Sigma F80 on Youtube.</li>
            <li>Definitely better than my previous cheap brushes.</li>
            <li>Was really amazing at first, and then after only three washes the bristles fell out and was COMPLETELY beyond ruined!</li>
            <li>I have read great reviews on this product so I am anxious to see if I like it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a Sephora #55 airbrush, until I recently ordered the Sigma F80 after reading so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li>It really does apply foundation smoothly and it&#x27;s so soft!</li>
            <li>This is my first time using a flat top kabuki</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s cross our fingers and hope it&#x27;s true because I swear that it will make us gern-o-phobes excited to see our brushes will be drying  a lot faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This  is a great flat kabuki brush and has lasted a long time.  </li>
            <li>Sigma F80 Flat Top Synthetic Kabuki- Brush was shipped super fast, delivered before estimated date and very well packaged.</li>
            <li>Great brush to finish makeup, either foundation or loose powder, also works well with solid mineral foundation powder, quality product</li>
            <li>This brush is just as good as many of the more expensive brushed from Bobbi Brown, Lancôme etc.</li>
            <li>I would certainly come back to Sigma when I need more makeup brushes.</li>

            <li>B003UH0528 Sigma Beauty Flat Top Synthetic Kabuki - F80]]</li>
            <li>I purchased this brush after searching reviews for a flat top applicator for foundations and blushes.</li>
            <li>First, the shipping was fast and the brush came well protected and in a cute red bag.  </li>
            <li>and I was so excited I tore off the package like a wild woman.</li>
            <li>B003UH0528 Sigma Beauty Flat Top Synthetic Kabuki - F80]]</li>
            <li>My Sigma F80 Flat Top Kabuki arrived within a week of ordering on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t have any other use for this brush besides buffing in my foundation.</li>

            <li>B003UH0528 Sigma Beauty Flat Top Synthetic Kabuki - F80]]</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t even compare to the other foundation brushes I own.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the Sigma F80 Flat Top Kabuki brush from the Sigmax collection.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Sigma Beauty Flat Top F80 brush for about a week to apply foundation on my face.  </li>
            <li>this is a really nice brush with long lasting smooth finish.easy to blend and doesn&#x27;t take a lot of foundation</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this flat kabuki brush for about three years (maybe more) now and it still works well.</li>
            <li>The flat top makes all the difference when blending liquid foundation</li>
            <li>I like other sigma brushes I own</li>
            <li>I just received my Sigma F80 Flat Top Kabuki brush in the mail.  </li>
            <li>Before receiving this brush I used a flat top powder brush from e.l.f.</li>
            <li>B003UH0528 Sigma Beauty Flat Top Synthetic Kabuki - F80]]</li>
            <li>I first loved this brush but after the second time I washed it, the entire brush head came out.  </li>
            <li>I decided to purchase the Flat top kabuki.....</li>
            <li>B003UH0528 Sigma Beauty Flat Top Synthetic Kabuki - F80]]</li>
            <li>I love the flat kabuki.</li>
            <li>I read about using the Sigma Flat Top Kabuki makeup brush to apply liquid makeup and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I have held it up and compared the flat top with others like it I owned and there is no comparison.  </li>
            <li>but the sigma flat kabuki is so much better for my foundation..</li>
            <li>This review is for the Sigma Beauty Flat Top Synthetic Kabuki - F80 makeup brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I also use Sonia Kashuk Synthetic Flat Brush and also love it for foundation application.</li>
            <li>This flat top kabuki brush works so well with liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently fallen in love with sigma brushes in general; they are great quality at like half the cost of MAC brushes.</li>
            <li>I love this brush, it is the best out of all brushes, it is very dense and flat, and you can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
            <li>The brush did a great job, but breaking like that is ridiculous.</li>
            <li>Gives a clean natural finish to your liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>They do not come clean completely.</li>
            <li>I love how my base looks like it has been airbrushed on, a really great brush!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love Sigma brushes, they are of the highest quality, for such a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;they are so dense that they don&#x27;t waste product and the fibers are shorter to get a more precise application.</li>
            <li>AI understand that the products may cost more in the stores, but at least you get a better guarantee.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a good quality brush that should last a while if you take care of it.</li>
            <li>The handle of the brush is very sturdy and because its thick, you get great control during use.</li>
            <li>and i love the whole entire kit and one thing about washing the brush</li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t really satisfied with the results since I have a sensitive skin and the brush bristles wasn&#x27;t that soft on my skin.</li>
            <li>Cleaning the brush is very easy too, and it dries faster than I expected</li>
            <li>I have had the Sigma Flat Top Kabuki brush for a few months now and I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>But other than the cleaning problem the F80 brush is totally worth it!!!</li>
            <li>Does not shed very much, and it applies my foundation very evenly.</li>
            <li>They cost less and are better quality!</li>
            <li>The brush doesnt shed one bit and it is super soft!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a super soft brush!</li>
            <li>The brush is super soft!</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and it was so soft!</li>
            <li>It can be somewhat difficult to get completely clean using regular brush cleaner or baby shampoo, I&#x27;ve been using Dawn dish detergent to clean it and it works great (and quickly).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super soft and it doesn&#x27;t shed, which is why I bought it in the first place.</li>
            <li>This brush is everything that the positive reviews said it was.</li>
            <li>After reading the positive reviews on Amazon, I decided to try this for myself.</li>
            <li>This brush is literally the best foundation brush I have ever used, it has a sleek black handle with Sigma&#x27;s logo and a description of the brush name going down the side.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>As soon as I gave this a few test runs, I ordered the round top kabuki, that&#x27;s how great it is.  </li>
            <li>I use it pretty much every day and don&#x27;t regret my purchase.</li>
            <li>everyday I get more surprised and satisfied with SIGMA&#x27;s brushes.</li>
            <li>My first high end make up brush!</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first because of how much the shipping cost</li>
            <li>From now on Sigma&#x27;s brushes are pretty much all I will ever need.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t take long to get my order and so far I love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found and the hairs stay in place for a long time through many washes.</li>
            <li>I thought that was pretty reasonable</li>
            <li>You can use it to do pretty much anything that you want in the face</li>
            <li>Hope to have it for a long time, will be buying more from Sigma and Amazon</li>
            <li>and I love the long handle.</li>
            <li>Before I used it I made sure to wash the brush and when I did so, some minor shedding occurred.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t really see the hype, but then again I&#x27;d never used a brush to apply foundation before</li>
            <li>I never realized brushes really do much that much of a difference!</li>
            <li>I have been using it with the bare minerals foundation and it does a fantastic job applying it.</li>
            <li>No fallout yet which is awesome as I have used it a lot and with cheap brushes it would all ready be bad.</li>
            <li>I can literally put a pea size amount on this brush and it covers my whole face with product, thanks to the brush!</li>
            <li>I have used a few different foundation brushes but this brush by far is the best.</li>
            <li>The quality is as good if not better than my $40 MAC brushes.</li>
            <li>Its so soft and dense and gives me full coverage with my liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>It makes my foundation look more natural and even and is soft and gentle on my face.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how I felt about Sigma as a brand after I had reviewed their RIDICULOUSLY PRICED &amp;#34;brush cleaning mit.&amp;#34; However, this had been recommended by so many, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li>This brush is exactly what I was looking for, super soft and really dense.</li>
            <li>If you want high quality brushes that are comparable or better than MAC brushes, definitely go with Sigma!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Anyone who is nervous about trying a brush for the first time or just interested in purchasing this, I highly, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have other high end brushes but this one is my favorite!</li>
            <li>I have read so many reviews of sigma brushes, and everyone raves about the high quality and lasting power of this brush.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely go back to Sigma for more high quality brushes.</li>
            <li>I love this brush and wish I discovered it a long time ago!</li>
            <li>super soft brush that holds together</li>
            <li>The short and dense bristles make it so easy to buff your liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>THE BRUSH ITSELF IS SUPER SOFT</li>
            <li>The brush is super soft and dense.</li>
            <li>The brush is super soft and I have not had any problems with shedding.  </li>
            <li>It is super dense yet so soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>Also, the color of my foundation came off easily and the brush looked white on the tips again.</li>
            <li>The short and dense bristles make it easy to buff your liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to everyone looking for an easy way to apply and blend their foundation.</li>
            <li>I love the brush, but I&#x27;m deducting a star simply because it&#x27;s such a pain to clean.</li>
            <li>The brush is super soft.</li>
            <li>It does not leave streaks, it spreads the product evenly, and the bristles are super soft.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s super soft.</li>
            <li>It is super soft and leaves an airbrushed effect to my foundation when done applying..</li>
            <li>It takes 24 hours to fully dry, and I make sure to stand it up ON</li>
            <li>My daughter ordered this first and raved about it so after a few months I bought my own</li>
            <li>After watching lots of video reviews for it on youtube and reading all the great reviews on Makeupalley, I finally broke down and bought it.</li>
            <li>It certainly gives you an airbrush finish</li>
            <li>I do believe I will certainly be sticking to your sigma products and want to try your collections.  </li>
            <li>reference, I have comination skin with large pores which I think is why the brush just doesn&#x27;t work for me...</li>
            <li>Received this brush yesterday along with the F30 large powder brush, E40 tapered blending brush and E20 beauty blending brush.</li>
            <li>I certainly don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>If you have large pores, this may not be what you want.  </li>
            <li>so I can be positive that it&#x27;s the real thing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and gentle with the skin, and it&#x27;s the first one I felt like it was worth bying.</li>
            <li>I love the flat top vs the round top personally.</li>
            <li>The shipping was so fast, and I was so excited that I took off my make up just to try this brush, and I have no regrets!</li>
            <li>The Sigma F80  Flat top brush  is better than any other makeup brush out there.</li>
            <li>The bristles are so soft and full and really blend makeup very well.</li>
            <li>Recently, I&#x27;ve begun using a new make-up (Jane Iredale) and in doing some pre-purchase research, I read so many glowing reviews of this brush that I decided to try it myself.  </li>
            <li>This brush is great for applying foundation, wet or dry.  </li>
            <li>This brush provides really good coverage, lets you use less of your foundation, and is really amazingly soft.  </li>
            <li>It is super soft, but very dense.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;I live in Brazil and my brush arrived at the right time.</li>
            <li>This was my first Sigma brush and well, they have a new follower!</li>
            <li>Overall I highly recommend this brush, If I I could only buy one sigma brush this would be the one.&lt;br /&gt;In comparison to the beauty blender I feel this brush leave a more &amp;#34;full coverage look&amp;#34;  whereas the beauty blender is more natural.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting such a great quality brush for the price since I have paid more for a lesser quality in the past.</li>
            <li>The brush is dense enough so that stippling is a breeze, so much better than the Mac stippling brush which is very soft for that purpose.</li>
            <li>No bristles lost (by the way, this is usually the case for most synthetic brushes so this isn&#x27;t something unique about this brush...</li>
            <li>This is the first sigma brush I ever ordered but wish I had waited until I got this one and used it more before purchasing the other Sigma brushes that I did.</li>
            <li>I looked at this brush for months before getting it because it is more than I usually spend on brushes, but it is sooooooo worth it!</li>
            <li>and it pushes the product into the skin so it doesn&#x27;t sit on the surface further accentuating fine lines.</li>
            <li>First try with this particular brush.</li>
            <li>My wife speaks very highly of this brush.</li>
            <li>I find it very high end</li>
            <li>Very soft and just the right size.</li>
            <li>It also comes with a handy cover and little mesh carrying case.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s retained its shape but beware its pretty densely packed (hence good coverage) making it a bit difficult to clean.</li>
            <li>and I thought this would be a good brush, but when I got it, it was hard to take the plastic off</li>
            <li>I love my new Sigma Flat kabuki brush-F80.</li>
            <li>This brush had a dink on the handle due to super light packaging.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this brush got it last year for christmas and used it everyday til this day blends foundation beautifully.</li>
            <li>This brush feels amazing, applies foundation evenly and the hairs shed very little( just 3 or 4 the first time I used it).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small enough to offer great control of foundation application and is super soft with no fall out!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s reasonable for an upset customer wonder where those amazing compliments on Sigma Brushes came from; the answer possibly was related to a note in my package - it said that I will get a free gift if I left feedback on Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just started getting into this whole make-up thing with baby steps and just using light foundation, this is definitely a brush I would recommend again.</li>
            <li>So after trying a few I finally tried MAC studio fix which works great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it with a few different consistencies of foundation and they all have come out great with this brush.</li>
            <li>I expected this to be top quality because I paid 24 bucks for it</li>
            <li>Really Bummed</li>
            <li>Came fast in the mail also.</li>
            <li>works well for buffing in my foundation since it is a really dense.</li>
            <li>I heard about this brush so much that I had to get my hands on it</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing from the real Sigma beauty website  and make a comparison.</li>
            <li>Always wondered is they really worked.</li>
            <li>I really like this brush.</li>
            <li>and i HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the brush!</li>
            <li>Also the price is really affordable.</li>
            <li>I had an event to go to and were getting ready at her house.</li>
            <li>you can really tell the difference in my makeup.</li>
            <li>Is this a real sigma brush?</li>
            <li>Delivery was very prompt, as well.</li>
            <li>I use it on days when I don&#x27;t feel like using my real techniques brush.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li>Thanks Sigma I will be buying again</li>
            <li>It drys really fast for me.</li>
            <li>Very dense&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not very big&lt;br /&gt;Great for buffing&lt;br /&gt;Hard</li>
            <li>and I absolutely had to have this brush.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing again very soon.</li>
            <li>so much becuase</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very synthetic and compact.</li>
            <li>and I really like the results.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>This doesnt eat ALL your foundation as fast as a sponge would.</li>
            <li>I expected a much better product from sigma.</li>
            <li>I would wash it by putting some of my face cleanser and gently swishing it in my palm.</li>
            <li>I like it so much that I ordered the F84 and F82.</li>
            <li>it real?</li>
            <li>Bought 2 Sigma F80 brushes and they really deliver.</li>
            <li>Very dense and allows it to apply foundation</li>
            <li>but with this brush I apply as much product and avoid looking cakey.</li>
            <li>she does makeup vids and is real unlike a lot of sponsored people on there.</li>
            <li>very velvety feeling.</li>
            <li>I have tried several brushes before and none of them have given me this fabulous air-brushed look.</li>
            <li>The price is really reasonable</li>
            <li>I used this brush to apply my liquid foundation, powder foundation, my blush or even bronzer, its very versatile.</li>
            <li>and I find it is so much quicker to apply my foundation with the sigma F80.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really dense and boy</li>
            <li>I did this part way through the day at work to freshen up and was very</li>
            <li>My girlfriends, my fiance and even my very \\&quot;man&#x27;s man\\</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very dense, which applies a very even layer of foundation.</li>
            <li>The look is very buffed in, rather than cakey or streaked.</li>
            <li>In which I realized how wonderful job my Chanel brush did - it gently breezed on your face and makeup was evenly and looked so natural (my friends were confused whether I wore makeup or not)!</li>
            <li>I was worried about paying so much for a brush</li>
            <li>The price is worth it by far.</li>
            <li>It goes on evenly without using too much product and looks like it&#x27;s been airbrushed.  </li>
            <li>The sponge soaks up too much foundation that the brush keeps on my face.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very dense, which then creates that airbrushed look that we all want to achieve.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Sigma.</li>
            <li>Makes the makeup much prettier.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, too.</li>
            <li>(But really 14 for a shipment which really is contradictory)but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really just the 14 for the shipment.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>The whole Sigma thing is just a hype.</li>
            <li>I highly highly highly recommend this product !</li>
            <li>Not only did my face looked smooth</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>The brush is very dense.</li>
            <li>It blends foundation like a dream and doesn&#x27;t absorb foundation much at all.</li>
            <li>its not the real product</li>
            <li>Changes my makeup routine so much</li>
            <li>About absorbing a lot of product I don&#x27;t think this brush does that.</li>
            <li>Thanks to this brush</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>yet it&#x27;s very dense.</li>
            <li>It buffs foundation or cream blushes really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It blends my foundation really well</li>
            <li>Absolutely adore it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but really, they weren&#x27;t even an option.</li>
            <li>I want to rub this over my face all the time haha.</li>
            <li>Fast shippment.</li>
            <li>For the price, I had expected more.</li>
            <li>I also got the brush fast.</li>
            <li>There are no lines it blends the cream very evenly</li>
            <li>use this with Makeup Forever HD Foundation and it goes on really well, no shedding at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very grateful about the quality of this brush.</li>
            <li>Wash it before you use it really well and also wash the plastic cover it comes with if you plan on keeping</li>
            <li>/&gt;You really need to try it for yourself.</li>
            <li>They are so gentle on my skin, not scratchy at all.</li>
            <li>The hairs being so dense but not too dense is absolute perfection.</li>
            <li>This is my absolute GO-TO foundation brush now.  </li>
            <li>are wavy instead of perfectly straight.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am glad I spent the money on this brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very dense</li>
            <li>I have heard much raves about this brush, I use it with my MAC foundation.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy brush for applying liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>I bought this brush straight from sigma</li>
            <li>so i know its real.</li>
            <li>no matter how much i try to blend it just collects on the sides of my nose.</li>
            <li>Appears to be the real thing and not a knock off.</li>
            <li>Blends like a dream and doesn&#x27;t absorb much of the make up.</li>
            <li>Had it fast.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I am also looking into trying the whole set now.</li>
            <li>I do not believe this was a real Sigma brush, even though the seller, Instyle Products, is an authorized dealer according to the manufacturers website.</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>The brush works very well though.</li>
            <li>It really buffs my tinted moisturizer into my skin evenly.</li>
            <li>so I could never justify spending so much for a make-up application brush.)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li>and I feel like there is so much coverage</li>
            <li>I always use Real Techniques&#x27; stipple brush.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know if this item is the real thing from sigma.  </li>
            <li>so I dont think this is the real brush they sell in sigmabeauty.com&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>She puts this on her face and applies makeup, that&#x27;s really all I know about makeup.  </li>
            <li>People recommend these two products very often on makeup forum</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>this distributes product very evenly...great for foundation coverage...</li>
            <li>I enjoy following make-up bloggers and Sigma brushes kept coming up time and time again.  </li>
            <li>I got it in the mail today...very fast shipping indeed.</li>
            <li>The product came very well packed.</li>
            <li>This brush applies foundation very well and it hasn&#x27;t shed at all.</li>
            <li>This is straight from Sigma.</li>
            <li>As expected, I LOVE the Sigma F80.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been hearing SO MUCH about it</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I dont really use makeup</li>
            <li>I want the whole sigma brush set</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I have never raved about a brush as much as this one.</li>
            <li>I received item really fast</li>
            <li>They are so gentle on my skin, not scratchy at all.</li>
            <li>The hairs being so dense but not too dense is absolute perfection.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been lasting AND without any shedding, which is incredibly important.</li>
            <li>Once I got the hang of it, I really see the difference.</li>
            <li>One day I tried pulling and the whole chunk of them came out.  </li>
            <li>Foundation goes on much easier with this</li>
            <li>Totally worth spending a little more on a brush than normal!</li>
            <li>It covers so much area without using a lot of product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never seen a real sigma brush</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know if this is the real deal.</li>
            <li>, the whole bundle of hairs eventually fell of from the brush handle itself.</li>
            <li>The Gloss on the brush is coming off and I&#x27;m really hating it</li>
            <li>But I really dont understand why its started to get Matte on me.</li>
            <li>This brush is very well made.</li>
            <li>it really is the sigma brand</li>
            <li>it shipped fast &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>I was ready to try the F80</li>
            <li>but after hearing so much hype about this brush</li>
            <li>Very upset.</li>
            <li>Might as well go buy the real one from the website.</li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>High quality as well!</li>
            <li>I like it, and if I could afford to have a whole set of Sigma brushes</li>
            <li>I really recommend this brush to anyone looking for a brush to apply their foundation.</li>
            <li>Get the real thing off Sigma.com</li>
            <li>I use it every day and it makes the make up look very well blended.</li>
            <li>It works the foundation into the skin really well.  </li>
            <li>My foundation goes on very well</li>
            <li>The brush works really well</li>
            <li>She wants to get one for her sister now.</li>
            <li>that one made applying foundation cream much easier.</li>
            <li>It presses the product into the skin rather than absorbing product into the brush.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Bought it used it for 2 months washed it twice and the whole brush fell apart LITERALLY, overpriced for the quality</li>
            <li>Everything I expected from this brush and more.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Really like this brush</li>
            <li>Fast shipping....</li>
            <li>It applies the powder foundation very evenly</li>
            <li>I use it to blend in oily looking foundations and it also works very well with cream blushes.</li>
            <li>someone said real techniques brushes are &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; than Sigma?</li>
            <li>I recommend it to anybody who loves makeup and wants an effortless airbrushed look.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this brush</li>
            <li>Highly recommended and it earns my 5 stars !</li>
            <li>This is the absolute holy grail of brushes.</li>
            <li>, I also bought the eye kit brushes and Im very sold, Im</li>
            <li>SO MUCH</li>
            <li>And Amazon is very dependable</li>
            <li>Blends really well, but I do go over it with a beauty blender for that added smoothness.</li>
            <li>It is very well made.</li>
            <li>It gives the skin a very airbrushed look.</li>
            <li>Not too much, mind you.</li>
            <li>It really is a quality brush for the price.</li>

            <li>I gives you a smooth airbrushed finish, I woud definitely recommend this brush.</li>
            <li>and I ordered the real one</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft and does its job, worth the money.</li>
            <li>It will blend it into your skin very well.</li>
            <li>This one was well reviewed and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t shed and very well made</li>
            <li>Came in the mail fast..</li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I suggest going onto the Sigma website, because you&#x27;re not going to get the real thing here.</li>
            <li>I will definately be buying more products from them in the near future.</li>
            <li>nice firm brush.</li>
            <li>Tried different ones but this is by far my all time favorite.</li>
            <li>Looking to buy more Sigma products in the near future.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, personal experience so far... i love this brush</li>
            <li>Thinking of returning and paying the couple extra bucks to know it is authentic from Sigma directly.</li>
            <li>There are no streaks left behind, making my foundation look flawless.  </li>
            <li>The brush does an excellent job of blending the foundation along the jaw line and applies thin layers to prevent lines forming later in the day under the eyes or at the crows feet.  </li>
            <li>I only bought the Sigma F80 because I love all sigma brushes so far.</li>
            <li>It stipples your foundation to a flawless finish, so no unsitely swipes of makeup left behind</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about purchasing it at first because I don&#x27;t typically spend so much on a makeup brush.</li>
            <li>However, I did not find it to be any better or any worse than generic flat top kabuki brushes I own.</li>
            <li>Unbelievably SOFT!!!</li>
            <li>so you use less foundation and get a smooth, full coverage application.</li>
            <li>I was a complete skeptic at first, but with all of the positive online reviews, I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I have a lot of flat top brushes I use to apply my mineral powder foundation, since I like to switch to using a clean brush every couple of days, and I&#x27;m too lazy to clean them a couple of times a week.</li>
            <li>So I decided to give the flat kabuki from sigma a try and actually the results were AMAZING.</li>
            <li>This does give me better coverage than any other application method I&#x27;ve tried and it makes my foundation stay on my face so much longer.</li>
            <li>It really makes my makeup blend better than any other brush I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Then when it was completely damaged I read reviews about the Sigma Flat Top Kabuki...took a shot...</li>
            <li>Flat with soft, extremely dense bristles, gives great, very even coverage.</li>
            <li>The synthetic bristles aren&#x27;t irritating to the skin and it stipples very nicely.  </li>
            <li>When I first opened the cute red pouch/bag/thing that it came in, I was completely taken aback by how soft and dense this brush is.</li>
            <li>the brush is SO soft that it actually makes it fun!!  </li>
            <li>The brush applies makeup quite quick and easy, and doesn&#x27;t waste product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning the brush has been very easy, just a little liquid soap and water to rinse out any built up product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smaller than I expected, but it&#x27;s really soft and the quality is amazing!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so unique becuase sigma is the only place where they had this brush.</li>
            <li>This brush is even better than what I expected!</li>
            <li>Better than my other 3 foundation brushes, probably because of the shape and density of the bristles.  </li>
            <li>I also ordered it after reading the many favorable reviews on Amazon &amp; other cosmetic websites.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never use any other brush for applying my foundation :)</li>
            <li>After the fourth time I washed this brush a significant amount of bristles began falling out.</li>
            <li>I chose this rating because I have found that the sigma F80 Flat Kabuki brush has worked fantastic for me.</li>
            <li>I was Incredibly excited to finally purchase my Sigma F80 brush!</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way which is great considering</li>
            <li>The actual brush itself is authentic and blends like no other.</li>
            <li>I will be investing in more brushes over time to replace my other subpar brushes.</li>
            <li>but other then that the brush is ok..</li>
            <li>My one criticism would be that this brush tends to use up more products than other brushes, just a warning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different foundation brushes by MAC, Bare Minerals, etc.</li>
            <li>It was such a great decision because I reach for this brush everyday now!</li>
            <li>I swirl it in a teeny tiny drop of olive oil before cleaning with baby shampoo which makes it a bit easier to clean.</li>
            <li>However, I did noticed that your skin needs to be really clean and exfoliated or it might make your pores larger..</li>
            <li>Im amazed in how this brush leaves my foundation,  it gives it such a clean buff look...</li>
            <li>The only thing I am worried about is how it will work once I clean it.</li>
            <li>It is easy to wash (I just use shampoo and conditioner and let it dry overnight).</li>
            <li>The only qualm I have is that you have to keep it absolutley clean for it to work</li>
            <li>My only concern is in keeping it clean.</li>
            <li>But the bristles of Shiseido 113 seem to be a tiny little bit more fine than SigmaF80</li>
            <li>My new Flat Kabuki brush Easy to apply liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>I have stopped using my flat foundation brush for full face and only use it for light BB cream application.  </li>
            <li>A friend recommended this brush to me and I would highly recommend this brush to other people that are looking for a better way to apply their liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>The bristles are densely packed and super soft, ensuring that a buffing motion is just that, leaving me with a natural airbrushed look.</li>
            <li>BECAUSE THEY ARE SUPER EXPENSIVE AND THE BRUSHES ARE NOT THAT GOOD</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super soft and the bristles don&#x27;t fall out like other cheap brushes.</li>
            <li>It is very soft and dense and is working really well for both my powder foundation and blush application, really helps me to blend it in so that it looks natural and pretty.  </li>
            <li>If you are not careful, you will no longer have a flat top brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to get the full Sigma brush set as soon as possible.</li>
            <li>This brush is such a dream come true.</li>
            <li>I really liked the feel of this brush but after a few months of using it the bristle on one side all started to come out!</li>
            <li>It is soft and pretty dense, but it just doesn&#x27;t work for me I guess.</li>
            <li>the bristles weren&#x27;t as soft as when I first bought them.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and most importantly generously thick and sturdy.</li>
            <li>First impression was that this brush is SO soft, I&#x27;ve been using it for years</li>
            <li>sent it back for a full refund.</li>
            <li>I originally had been using a coastal scents flat top brush for foundation (Im not trying to run down coastal scents)</li>
            <li>LOVE this brush &amp; will buy again if anything ever happens to my other one!</li>
            <li>Over all im so pleased with this brush its very dense so a little product goes along way.</li>
            <li>and they sent me out a new brush!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a new brush, give this one a try!</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll purchase a new one soon!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sigma is my new fav!</li>
            <li>This has become my new must have in my makeup/foundation routine!</li>
            <li>It blends out each foundation so smoothly, easily shearing it down for minimal coverage or adding more for a fuller coverage.  </li>
            <li>This particular brush was recomennded to me and now i CANT LIVE WITHOUT IT!</li>
            <li>Absolutely cannot live without.</li>
            <li>and I really needed a new foundation brush.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, product received was new.</li>
            <li>I chose this rating because there are more good things than bad things to say about this brush.</li>
            <li>It smooths my foundation on evenly, it doesn&#x27;t shed, and I&#x27;m able to use less product.</li>
            <li>I spent easily $20 on a brush for it to break after using it once.</li>
            <li>There may be slightly better brushes out there, but for less than $20, who cares?  </li>
            <li>half the price that is better.</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved how they packaged the brush and the shipping only took a few days.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more Sigma brushes in the future.</li>
            <li>,I will definitely be purchasing more Sigma brushes in the future.</li>
            <li>I also love how I got this product two days after I ordered it even though I only had standard shipping.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this brush and plan on buy more brushes in the future.</li>
            <li>Purchasing this brush through Amazon was the same price as buying it directly through Sigma, except I also got free shipping with Amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s firm but soft and does a nice job of blending my foundation.</li>
            <li>I use it mainly just to buff my foundation after I apply it</li>
            <li>Definitely want more Sigma brushes in the future.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely going to order more of this brush as I do multiple faces at a time...</li>
            <li>I recommend it to anyone and everyone, as the only thing better that I&#x27;ve found is actual airbrushing!</li>
            <li>I also had to start using a different makeup because I was using Clinique acne solutions which has salicitic acid, and you can&#x27;t use that when pregnant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;d be a decent brush for $6 but not</li>
            <li>The brushed didn&#x27;t fluff up after drying, but I noticed the outer bristles were kind of way</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried sigma brushes before, but my friend recommended this particular brush because I&#x27;m a foundation junkie.</li>
            <li>I honestly wish I wouldve just gone to the sigma website and spent money on a brush that would last longer then a couple uses.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s on the larger size, more the size of a blush brush, but I find the bristles are flexible enough to get reach all the areas of my face.  </li>
            <li>I feel in love instantly, so I immediately got back on amazon, and ordered the angled Sigma kabuki brush for the us of blush and contouring.</li>
            <li>I purchased mine from the Sigma website, I&#x27;ve seen tons of youtube beauty guru&#x27;s raving about this brand of brushes, and this one in particular to apply liquid foundations.</li>
            <li>I have used it mainly with Lancome Teint Idole foundation and the Tarte Amazonian Clay foundation.</li>
            <li>have this problem, just the F80, my main foundation brush.</li>
            <li>I would definitely buy more brushes in the future</li>
            <li>Decent brush.</li>
            <li>This brush is very soft with really dense bristles, I expected it to be bigger but it blends really nicely</li>
            <li>The brush really distributes the product evenly and it is very soft, so it doesn&#x27;t hurt your skin.</li>
            <li>Applies liquid foundation evenly without having to do much work and is very soft with your face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft and seems very durable</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft and VERY dense.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve searched long and hard and finally found the perfect foundation brush!</li>
            <li>I clean the brush pretty regularly but it can be somewhat difficult to clean, otherwise I&#x27;m quite satisfied.</li>
            <li>Doesnt Shed, it&#x27;s Very soft!</li>
            <li>I like it sooo much better than my old Bare Minerals brush that shed constantly.</li>
            <li>Have tried the Real Techniques stippling brush and it didn&#x27;t apply nearly as well as this!</li>
            <li>I like this brush because it is very soft!</li>
            <li>Very soft bristles!</li>
            <li>Very soft!</li>
            <li>I used to buy cheap brushes from department stores and complain about the loose bristles that would end up all over my face.</li>
            <li>I love that the bristles are tightly packed and sturdy.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product</li>

            <li>I would highly recommend any of Sigma&#x27;s brushes.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li>Bought this because I watched a lot of Makeup videos and this was a highly suggested brush.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I heard about this brush from a friend and I highly recommend it as well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Essential tool only reason it doesn&#x27;t rinse easily because it&#x27;s such a good quality the bristles are tightly packed together as they should be for this type of brush.</li>
            <li>Additionally, most makeup brushes, no matter how soft, tend to cause too much flaking and exfoliation on my skin, so buffing in any sort of foundation with any brush is typically out of the question.</li>
            <li>I had a MAC brush and it left black brisles on my faces and didnt really apply my fountation correctly, this brush is amazing</li>
            <li>Just got this F80 Flat Top Kabuki brush on the 2nd..</li>
            <li>I have the ELF flat top which is larger and covers a wider surface.</li>
            <li>I am exceptionally satisfied with my purchase and recommend this specific brush (F80 Flat Kabuki) to EVERYONE that wears foundation.</li>
            <li>I own other Sigma brushes but this size is just to massive.  </li>
            <li>FINALLY, I found my holy grail, liquid foundation brush in the Sigma F80 flat top kabuki.</li>
            <li>My next flat top brush will be coming from Makeup Geek.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the beauty blender and other brushes, but I like this far better.  </li>
            <li>Made my foundation very easy to apply and looked much more natural than any other brush I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>on one brush I did not expect for it to totally come apart on the FIRST washing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using mineral makeup for years now and decided to I needed a little more coverage.</li>
            <li>I have several Kabuki brushes some of which are higher on price than this one - but after getting this I think I am going to through away all the others!</li>
            <li>so so soft !!.</li>
            <li>I am slowly replacing my makeup brushes with Sigma brushes and this one so far is my absolute favorite!</li>
            <li>but I feel I use a little more foundation when I apply it with the brush than if I apply it with my finger.  </li>
            <li>The brush itself is SO SOFT!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommend especially with the UD Surreal Skin foundation!</li>
            <li>The feel of the brush on my face was so soft!!</li>
            <li>my foundation was applied, I was so pleased that this required so little effort.</li>
            <li>And so soft!!</li>
            <li>I normally use my flat foundation brush purchased from my local drugstore, however this brush has def changed my foundation routine, the flatness of the brush allows for my foundation to be applied much more easier as well as blending it.</li>
            <li>So soft!!</li>
            <li>and wow!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is dense, soft, so simple to clean, and it doesn&#x27;t shed like some brushes do at this</li>
            <li>forgot to add my skin is dry combination and with the brush I can see dry patches, the beauty blender leaves my skin feeling moisturize and looks really nice not</li>
            <li>I only clean this with professional brush cleaner</li>
            <li>have very oily Tzone and eyelids, super dry chin and cheeks...</li>
            <li>I washed it as soon as it arrived, and it returned to its original shape once dry, and I did not see any shedding.</li>
            <li>- I have other make-up brushes that cost in the neighborhood of $40 and this easily compares or even surpasses them.</li>
            <li>but I can tell it is very high quality and is soooo soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve also found it really nice for applying blush and liquid highlighters such as benefit&#x27;s high beam or nars&#x27; orgasm illuminating fluid, achieving a sheer result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft and really helps to minimize pores.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and very dense.</li>
            <li>This brush is amazingly soft and very well made.</li>
            <li>It seems to be a real Sigma - has it on the handle and on the metal near the handle.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much buffing into my skin, and it leaves a natural finish.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, even came early.</li>
            <li>The bristles are SO soft and very densely packed.</li>
            <li>Very dense bristles that are SO soft.</li>
            <li>It is very dense, but still soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft and has really changed the way my foundation is applied.</li>
            <li>She says the brush is soft and spreads the foundation really well.</li>
            <li>so soft and it smoothes out foundation really well</li>
            <li>so when you clean it, it will take a day or two to dry before you can use it again</li>
            <li>Bristles are soft and very dense.</li>
            <li>Feels like a professional did your makeup and is much quicker.  </li>
            <li>I will get the complete set of brushes thanks again</li>
            <li>For how much this brush costs, I&#x27;m honestly really surprised.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so soft and works really well.</li>
            <li>It is very sturdy while still being soft and pliable.</li>
            <li>Brush is very dense and soft and can be used with liquid or powder mineral foundation.</li>
            <li>I use it every day with minimal care and get a smooth, even amount of coverage.</li>
            <li>It gave me an airbrushed look and natural, which I like since I don&#x27;t wear foundation very often.</li>
            <li>I personally think the quality of these brushes is just as good, if not better, than M.A.C&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i love it use it everyday</li>
            <li>Normally I like to keep those, to help the brushes keep their shape.</li>
            <li>I have tried using my fingers to blend, a traditional foundation brush and several different types of sponges, but nothing made my skin look as nice as the Sigma F80.</li>
            <li>I have washed this brush many times and I have had a few bristles lost.</li>
            <li>My favorite part is that you can use the brush lightly damp or with facial mist and blend out any areas that are too thick or need blending.  </li>
            <li>The shape makes it more complementary for the face and it takes a few seconds to apply all over it.</li>
            <li>brush is well worth the amount of money I paid for my #55, but the actual cost is no where close.</li>
            <li>The look was pretty much the same as my MAC foundation brush.</li>
            <li>If you have the extra money and are into makeup brushes then it&#x27;s worth checking out.</li>
            <li>It takes a couple of washes to get all the gunk out, but I would imagine it&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li>I plan to use it a few more times to see if the shedding subsides.</li>
            <li>It is so worth spending the money that I bought a second one!</li>
            <li>most cost just a few dollars from E.L.F.</li>
            <li>I love my kabuki brush....use it everyday.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so worth it, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I hope sigma keeps making the brush as I want to give some away as gifts and also buy and few more for myself.</li>
            <li>This brush is definitely well worth the hype because it does what it claims.</li>
            <li>I normally use my fingers to apply my foundation.</li>
            <li>I have the round top version as well</li>
            <li>but it definitely does the job I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on cheap brushes that the bristles fall out!</li>
            <li>I love this one and the round top.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, but not great.</li>
            <li>I will most certainly be purchasing other brushes in the future!</li>
            <li>I get much more even coverage with less product!</li>
            <li>what I noticed about this brush is that I use less foundation and my coverage is more natural on my face.  </li>
            <li>More natural and less cakey.</li>
            <li>I bought this after a few recommendations on youtube , it came very quickly and packaged well and works very well</li>
            <li>Super easy and much faster application than the standard foundation brushes I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>After two days of use, I washed it again (with Dr. Bonner&#x27;s Peppermint liquid soap, a little drop in warm soapy water, just swishing brush into a cup of the soapy water, rinse the cup, add just warm water and dip the brush in and swishing until all traces of makeup was gone, then using my fingers to push off excess water and allow to air dry), absolutely no fall out, the brush was still soft and ready to use the next day.</li>
            <li>Actually you should add it to your cart right now....</li>
            <li>It takes up the right amount if make-up, I only have to shale the tip of the brush.</li>
            <li>If I ever need another brush, I&#x27;m definitely skipping the MAC counter and heading right for a Sigma.</li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t wait to buy more of the Sigma line to replace my cheaper Sonia Kashuk brushes from Target, that are stiff and prickly in comparison.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and right next to my lip from the brush.</li>
            <li>It is extremely high quality and is sooooo soft!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I never knew about this brush and why it was so important to use rather than your fingers, sponge or other makeup brush.</li>
            <li>First, the shipping was super fast and arrived a day or two earlier than I expected.</li>
            <li>The Stigma brush requires about 3 pumps of foundation and my MAC brush only with a pump or a pump and a half is more than enough to give me full coverage</li>
            <li>I am fairly new to using a brush to apply my foundation.</li>
            <li>Would buy from this seller again when need a new brush/additional brush.</li>
            <li>and it still looks brand new.</li>
            <li>you are looking for a new foundation brush or if you want just try this out, don&#x27;t hesitate!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this and my new foundation</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this brush, it blends my foundation so well and everything</li>
            <li>Also, no funky smells from the new brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still continue to learn new things.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve read on here that this is a new legislation on all Sigma products, while others say this is a telltale sign of a dupe.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this brush.</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
            <li>brush is my new go to</li>
            <li>i get my items on time and it is new</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this brush anymore.  </li>
            <li>Sigma brushes have become my new go to.  </li>
            <li>and I live in Puerto Rico</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t live up to all the hype.</li>
            <li>I have found my new brush and can&#x27;t be without it.  </li>
            <li>I am new to applying foundation with a brush.</li>
            <li>Sigma is now my go-to company for new makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>It makes my foundation look airbrushed (I use Revlon&#x27;s new whipped colorstay.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Always buy two is my new theory to life and ordering brushes.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it now</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m all about spending $, but the quality needs to live up to the name and price and M.A.C.</li>
            <li>My new hole grail foundation bgrush...... Will be switching all my brushes to sigma brushes</li>
            <li>I had use other brushes for my face (real techniques bold metal foundation brush, Eco Tools foam applicator)</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this brush, as well as many of the other high quality Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more even, smooth and less heavy.</li>
            <li>Great price and crazy fast shipping too.</li>
            <li>The overall end result was smooth foundation on my face, a second skin.</li>
            <li>The Revlon CS usually feels slightly heavy when I wear it, and this buffs it out so beautifully and makes it feel so lightweight.</li>
            <li>I received my sigma brush today in the mail, and not only was it fast shipping, it was packaged very well.</li>
            <li>really didn&#x27;t have to use much wrist movement to glide the brush back and forth to create that airbrushed look.</li>
            <li>If you want professional results for a decent price, go with Sigma.</li>
            <li>Brush head could be much bigger as it doesn&#x27;t cover as much of my face as fast when applying foundation.</li>
            <li>Finally, because it is very smooth and nothing comes off, as happens with other brushes that I bought before.</li>
            <li>Very very pleased and definitely will be buying other products like it in the future.</li>

            <li>Not only is it the density i want, it is also a very versatile brush that i can basically use for almost anything!</li>
            <li>Finally it came today and the first thing I did was take off all my makeup and put on foundation.</li>
            <li>Ive had no problems so far!</li>
            <li>It was my first sigma brush, and will not be my last!  </li>
            <li>The bristles are extremely soft, and have not shed at all!  </li>
            <li>I bought my first F80 for personal use over a year ago.</li>
            <li>This is my first sigma brush, and I am definitely going to purchase some others.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it when I first got it, and it definitely didn&#x27;t disappoint!</li>
            <li>but wow!</li>
            <li>it is so soft and dense!</li>
            <li>Let me start out by saying This sigma brush is so soft!</li>
            <li>fibers/hairs are EXTREMELY soft!</li>
            <li>The same thing happened to my first brush (which made it about a year), but I thought it was a fluke</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to complete my collection of sigma brushes!</li>
            <li>but i end it paying the exact same amount that they sell it for..</li>
            <li>I contacted Sigma and since I didn&#x27;t buy the brush directly from them they wouldn&#x27;t do anything for me!</li>
            <li>and I am by no means a professional makeup artist!</li>
            <li>I just got the Sigma F80 brush and I am so surprised because it came in five days!</li>
            <li>I learned about this brush online from a YouTube video by Ms Beauty B*tch (substituted the \\&quot;i\\&quot; with a \\&quot;*\\&quot;) whereby she demos the Urban Decay Surreal Cream to Powder foundation.</li>
            <li>It is spool soft, it applies my foundation like a dream!</li>
            <li>First off, I will say that overall, I like this brush.</li>
            <li>fibers/hairs are EXTREMELY soft!</li>
            <li>It completely exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li>Completely sold on sigma brushes and can&#x27;t wait to buy the set!</li>
            <li>and I have more to cover than usual.  </li>
            <li>Its so soft and works so well with foundation!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft!</li>
            <li>, the only downside in this is that a couple brissles were all bent and stuff which was upsetting cuz this is a pricey product but other than that love this and would buy again.</li>
            <li>Sooo soft!</li>
            <li>The F80 is definitely worth the extra cash compared to the Real Techniques brush for tougher to blend foundations like Estee Lauder Double Wear or Tarte Amazonian Clay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However I still think my foundation brush from the drug store just does the same exact thing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure however if this is authentic  </li>
            <li>but I will definitely be putting in an order soon for other brushes :)</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend it, can&#x27;t wait to build up my whole collection of them!</li>
            <li>And its so soft!</li>
            <li>All I can say is WOW!</li>
            <li>The last time of washing this brush I noticed the handle becoming loose</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for several reasons, the first one is the price, which is not excessive when considering the quality of this item, second, because you will spend less foundation and the results of a better application make all the difference.</li>
            <li>At first a bit skeptical with between positive reviews and of course the ones that say the company encourages you to leave positive feedback to get a free gift.</li>
            <li>It does take at least a full day to dry though, so I always have two available!</li>
            <li>This is my first flat top kabuki brush, so I don&#x27;t have any other similar brush to compare it to.</li>
            <li>I always wash my new brushes before using them and always lay them flat to dry, so I&#x27;m pretty sure it was loose beforehand.  </li>
            <li>I knew I would because I have several other Sigma brushes that are amazing I have decited to only purchase Sigma brushes from now on.</li>
            <li>OMG, I cannot say enough great things about the Sigma F80 Flat Kabuki, I&#x27;m a sucker for Sigma brushes anyway</li>
            <li>I also use the blank canvas cosmetics kabuki flat top brush and this Sigma one is very similar.  </li>
            <li>WOW how did I live with out it.</li>
            <li>you very much Sigma F80 - Flat Kabuki TM</li>
            <li>I have been wanting this brush for so long, and have always been somewhat hesitant to buy for the cost, and the shipping cost on the sigma website, i finally decided to go for it when i found it on here for free</li>
            <li>but I knew my review would not be credible without having used it and washed it at least once first.</li>
            <li>I use this brush as a foundation applicator and it gets on so smooth with out any lines and lets you use less product.</li>
            <li>She says the brush is firm and it gave no streaks with full coverage and it was shipped really fast.</li>
            <li>I love this brush if had several that shed this one does not totally worth every penny.</li>
            <li>This really makes it easy to skip the priming step in my opinion (although priming is essential for long lasting coverage).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It buffs product into your skin seamlessly and gives a very natural result.</li>
            <li>I love this for my foundation, the only problem is it sucks up so much product!</li>
            <li>flat brush first and saved a ton of money.</li>
            <li>This was my first flat foundation brush.  </li>
            <li>and I have found that if i wait too long inbetweeen cleanings, it gets kind of gross, and harder to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Unlike other brushes, this brush gives full coverage.</li>
            <li>have only washed it for 3 times, when it is wet, you can even easily push or pull the hair in or out from the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have previously used several sigma brushes and I absolutely love all of them, except for this one.</li>
            <li>However, the next day I turned on my blow dryer on low and it finished drying it quickly.</li>
            <li>I AM EXCITED TO TRY THEIR OTHER BRUSHES SOON!</li>
            <li>Also,the quality of this brush is unique, I haven&#x27;t found any other brush like this is!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, big enough, works quick in my every morning makeup routine.</li>
            <li>I need 3 more to have around though because it gets dirty super fast.</li>
            <li>I love how thick and soft this brush is!</li>
            <li>The material is perfect to pass my base makeup and is so soft!</li>
            <li>I am new into using the higher quality brushes and products and I am wondering why I went so long without trying this brush!</li>
            <li>It certainly exceeded my expectations and I will definitely repurchase it if I have to!</li>
            <li>so you know you&#x27;re getting a real Sigma brush (another reviewer listed them in a previous review) or go right through Sigma.  </li>
            <li>It is worth every single cent!</li>
            <li>Worth every single dollar!</li>
            <li>brush is OK, i have a hard time blending product evenly and without streaks.</li>
            <li>It is super soft but not at all flimsy like other brushes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>FAKE BRUSH i thought it would be a good idea to order the brush on Amazon to save a couple of dollars I received the brush in the mail and was sooo excited I looked at the brush and thought this looks odd</li>
            <li>, I am going to say that I am a firm believer that the foundation you use makes a huge difference as well</li>
            <li>It really makes a difference as far as application of the foundation and overall appearance.</li>
            <li>(I deep clean all my brushes weekly) and it takes forever to dry.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the only brush that gives you natural look even if you apply too much foundation.</li>
            <li>Its difficult to clean product buildup from the brush since the bristles twist out of place easy</li>
            <li>I always do: pumped some product onto the back of my hand, dipped my brush in, and started at the center of my face, working my way out and up with smooth, circular strokes.  </li>
            <li>clearly states on Sigma&#x27;s website that Etailz is an authorized retailer on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It is very dence and sturdt yet soft at the same time.</li>
            <li>So far there&#x27;s been no shedding, and I like the weight of it in my hand - not too heavy or too light.</li>
            <li>It even has a clear sleeve when not in use.  </li>
            <li>Im ready for the next day.</li>
            <li>This brush is soft and blends well.</li>
            <li>It is so soft.</li>
            <li>I love it to say the least.</li>

            <li>I wish I knew how much I would have like this brush, as I would have likely bought the synthetic collection.</li>
            <li>This brush is so soft.  </li>
            <li>The bristle is so soft and dense.</li>
            <li>There is no fall out so far</li>
            <li>I also was surprised to find a travel size blending brush with my order.  </li>
            <li>the brush is so soft and the hairs stay intact.</li>
            <li>(I wash it with water and shampoo in the evening, and it&#x27;s ready to be used the following day).</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding so far.</li>
            <li>I really didnt think a makeup brush could make such a difference, but it did!</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft to the touch</li>
            <li>and it was ready to go at 730am the next day, and its not even summer.</li>
            <li>No shedding of the hairs, and so, so soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that i finally purchased this brush and spent the extra money.</li>
            <li>This brush does not shed and is suuper soft on your skin.</li>
            <li>The brush is really soft and dense, and made my face look like it was airbrushed after blending my foundation.</li>
            <li>It is so dense and soft.</li>
            <li>It is so dense and so soft.</li>
            <li>I am 47 years old and have used a makeup sponge all my life.  </li>
            <li>My makeup looks smooth and is no longer heavy.  </li>
            <li>I really like it, and would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m going to buy me the whole brush set next time !!!!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so soft</li>
            <li>It is also incredibly soft, and not at all abrasive in its use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush itself is very solid and the bristles very dense.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredibly soft;</li>
            <li>The brush feel so soft on my skin</li>
            <li>IT FEELS.SO SOFT.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft but dense so the foundation doesn&#x27;t get soaked up by the brush.</li>
            <li>Plus the bristles were so soft.</li>
            <li>Soft and applies evenly...</li>
            <li>For starters this brush is sooo soft, like baby butt soft.</li>
            <li>Plus shipping was fast ( only 5 days)</li>
            <li>For liquids, I think I would only use this with thicker foundations like Mac since it really buffs the makeup into the skin.</li>
            <li>You really get what you pay for and this brush has made such a difference in the application of my makeup.</li>
            <li>BUT I do clense it regularly because it is a very dense brush</li>
            <li>I bought this brush directly from the Sigma website where it is cheaper with their discount code ($17).  </li>
            <li>It is so dense and soft.  </li>
            <li>This brush was soft and dense.</li>
            <li>So far, i thought the brush helped me give an airbrush look and the person making these brushes knew what a foundation brush needed.</li>
            <li>The bristles are extremely soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>The bristles are dense and soft.</li>
            <li>So soft and looks so professional.  </li>
            <li>After you use it, your skin looks even and natural, you don&#x27;t look painted at all.</li>
            <li>It is SUPPPPPPPPPPER soft as well.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;d recommend that you purchase directly from Sigma website because shipping charge is cheaper there, and check out some of the youtube channels for 10% off coupon.  </li>
            <li>SOOO soft.</li>

            <li>This bristles are incredibly soft and it applies my foundation seamlessly.</li>
            <li>I saw a review on this brush on Youtube by a professional make up artist</li>

            <li>Its so soft and always gives a even coverage.</li>
            <li>but this is definitely not the real thing or something</li>
            <li>It needs frequent cleaning, but not an issue for me.</li>
            <li>I suppose at 38 yrs old</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft.</li>
            <li>I have all kinds of brushes but this is the most delicate.</li>

            <li>No problems with it falling apart so far though, crossing my fingers.</li>
            <li>one I received is definitely the real thing.</li>
            <li>brush fibers are fantastically soft.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a soft blur effect and this is the brush that delivers.</li>
            <li>the bristles are sxtra soft.  </li>
            <li>I only really put foundation on parts of my face that need cover.  </li>
            <li>I felt like a 2 year old in an old woman&#x27;s skin, holding on to something that may give me some semblance of a youthful flair for maybe another year or so if I use it.  </li>
            <li>I am returning to amazon and will instead buy this directly from Sigma</li>
            <li>I read the reviews for this item and decided to go directly to Sigma&#x27;s website.</li>

            <li>So soft when you use it on your face.</li>
            <li>The brissles are amazingly soft and worka like a gem.</li>
            <li>It completely fell apart and I had to throw it out.</li>
            <li>but Sigma really needs to go back to making their brushes in the USA.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I would apply it directly to the brush.</li>
            <li>But so far I like it and would buy again.</li>
            <li>The foundation appears alot smoother and natural with this brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wanting to try a Sigma brush forever and finally bought this one thanks to tons of hype on YouTube</li>
            <li>it is made so well and its so soft.</li>
            <li>The hair was extremely soft and bushy.</li>
            <li>I finally gave into the hype about this brush because i was having some real deal problems when applying my foundation.</li>
            <li>I was looking to replace my old Shu Uemura angled brush with a dense kabuki-type brush.  </li>
            <li>It applies product seamlessly.</li>
            <li>This brush is so soft.</li>
            <li>I have two Sigma brushes that I bought directly from Sigma&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li>Also I can definitely smell paint on the brush, the Sigma logo is painted on and the whole brush reeks of paint.</li>
            <li>So far, I like the coverage and the ability to &amp;#34;stipple&amp;#34; rather than &amp;#34;paint&amp;#34; the foundation.</li>
            <li>Much smaller then a real Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li>The bristles on this brush are really soft and dense.</li>
            <li>Seamless foundation everytime.</li>
            <li>The shedding was minor at first on my face.  </li>
            <li>It is sooo soft, but your foundation does not get lost in the brush.</li>
            <li>It does not have the USA marked on the brush</li>
            <li>Ive had it for over a month and so far hairs aren&#x27;t falling off.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft, so they don&#x27;t scratch the eyelid</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for two months so far</li>
            <li>It does allow for complete coverage of foundation and blending out of concealer.</li>
            <li>dense and soft.</li>
            <li>No shedding so far, either.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft on the face and doesn&#x27;t allow for cakey buildup.</li>
            <li>It is so soft and leaves my face looking airbrushed.</li>
            <li>It has synthetic fibers, so it won&#x27;t eat up your foundation like natural haired brushes will.</li>
            <li>The bristles on the brush are soft.</li>
            <li>I am a professional MUA</li>
            <li>My face looks very unnatural and I&#x27;m left with tons of streaks after using this to apply my liquid foundations.</li>
            <li>I really want the Mrs. Bunny essential or travel brushes.  </li>
            <li>Save your money and buy directly from the retailers.</li>
            <li>While this one isn&#x27;t as fragile, as a whole the Sigma brushes are prone to lose their shape after cleaning them.  </li>
            <li>I currently use a Real Techniques buffing brush for foundation application.  </li>
            <li>The brush picks up enough product for coverage and not so much that you&#x27;re wasting a lot of product.</li>
            <li>The bristles have remained soft and have not clumped throughout my use of the brush.</li>
            <li>Next time I&#x27;ll just buy from the real website.</li>
            <li>It is soft but still has hold.</li>
            <li>The bristles do not feel as soft as the ones I ordered directly from the Sigma website.  </li>
            <li>surprised her with this gift and Sigma beauty</li>
            <li>surprised her with the additional gift that they sent to her</li>
            <li>I bought this brush to replace an old elf brush I was using for my face</li>
            <li>This brush is so dense and soft</li>
            <li>Since a make up brush is an essential product that really needs to work well, I would recommend paying the price for this.</li>
            <li>Also because it&#x27;s not goat hairs, it doesn&#x27;t take in a lot of my foundation on the brush, so there is no waste of product.</li>
            <li>But the key is to Buff it and Blend it really well into your skin or else, you&#x27;ll have chalky, cakey</li>
            <li>, I tried to gently pull what looked to be a flyaway bristle out of the brush and literally the entire brush head/bundle of bristles came out of the silver handle on the brush.</li>
            <li>I have had a set of Eco Tools brushes for over a year now and have never had anything near as catastrophic as what happened this morning.</li>
            <li>no shedding and beautifully soft.</li>
            <li>The bristles are so soft and they don&#x27;t break off on your face.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so dense and soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft and goes on evenly.</li>
            <li>The bristles feel soft on my face and are densely packed.</li>
            <li>Excellently soft.</li>
            <li>the bressels are extremely soft ...</li>
            <li>It is really soft on the skin.  </li>
            <li>I tried the sigma brush on my forehead and so far no breakouts.</li>
            <li>It is so soft and dense</li>
            <li>Soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll defer to her as the professional in all matters makeup</li>
            <li>I HAVE A LOT OF BRUSHES BY MAC, THIS SIGMA BRUSH IS BY FAR</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny, the only word left to say about this brush is perfection.</li>
            <li>I always saw patches or streaks and for me it was a hassle because i felt i had to keep on passing the brush more times on the same area even after the foundation dried</li>
            <li>The brush arrived with in only a few days and came in a really cute draw string bag.</li>
            <li>The brush is sturdy and well worth the money spent.</li>
            <li>Honestly, its quality is such that you&#x27;d expect it to be twice the price - at least.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the 20 dollars spent on this product.</li>
            <li>a more airbrush look instead of a thick mask of foundation that I get from using my fingers.</li>
            <li>I like the weight of the brush in my hand, and I feel like the thick base helps me get a good grip on the brush for more precise handling, if that makes sense.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a good (albeit expensive) foundation brush that will leave you looking like you don&#x27;t even have any foundation on then</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s on okay brush, but not amazing.</li>
            <li>Definitely don&#x27;t invest in a MAC brush when Sigma brushes do it better - for less!</li>
            <li>I highly advise washing them after using liquid foundation so that your foundation does not dry on the brush.</li>
            <li>Nice brush for foundation, although it is a little large for small faces.</li>
            <li>This new brush actually made my foundation seem less obvious, my skin was more finished.  </li>
            <li>My other brushes are a bit scratchy and lose their bristles on my face  - after trying my first Sigma brush I will now be looking to replace my entire economy set of brushes with these much higher quality brushes.  </li>
            <li>This brush made my face powder look so much better than usual!</li>
            <li>My next purchase will be the Essential Brush Kit which contains all the other brushes I want as well :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve washed the brush several times and use it pretty much every day and haven&#x27;t noticed loose hairs falling out.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S BRISTLES to dry to make sure no water gets down into the glue of the brush.</li>
            <li>The brush head is dense and soft yet small enough to be very precise in the application.</li>
            <li>I am not a brush user, I usually would use my fingers but this makes it so easy.</li>
            <li>so I clean my brush every other night and not exactly the gentle cleaning either and to my surprise, not a hair was ever shed!</li>
            <li>Other than that, if you like flawless-looking skin and smooth, even coverage/application, I would definitely recommend this brush!</li>
            <li>Nicest flat foundation brush I had tried and seemed very high quality...</li>
            <li>This brush gives a completely airbrushed finish that no other brush I have does! .</li>
            <li>only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the brush does take a while to dry (given the fact that the bristles are super dense)...</li>
            <li>extra soft, dense and very professional at look!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased a makeup brush as I do not normally wear foundation.</li>
            <li>I have used other amazon dupes to avoid paying 24$ for this brush, but after trying the Bestope dupe, coastal scents, and countless others, I caved and purchased the sigma flat top kabuki.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it is the brush or foundation, but so far i&#x27;m only somewhat satisfied.</li>
            <li>First off the ferrule was loose.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are tightly packed together and are super soft on the skin.</li>
            <li>They are the perfect size; big enough for all over your face and small enough to get into the small places like around your nose for example.</li>
            <li>I recently found out about this line of brushes and the F80 in particular from Alexandrea Garza&#x27;s YouTube channel.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re deciding whether or not to order this brush, I think you should definitely get it, because at first I thought this brush was just a rave, but then I actually tried it</li>
            <li>The bristles on the outside are higher than the middle causing a bowl-like shape.</li>
            <li>I searched for so long for a kabuki brush, but every time I bought one, it was all messy because most brushes fell apart.</li>
            <li>I just received this brush, and it is full, firm yet soft, and luxurious feeling.</li>
            <li>This was my first Sigma brush and it&#x27;s likely going to be my last.</li>
            <li>I recommend this brush to anyone especially those first starting out with make up.</li>
            <li>This purchase was my first time \\&quot;stepping up\\&quot; and buying a more expensive brush.</li>
            <li>The difference is night and day - no loose bristles, the brush was SO soft I just wanted to keep using it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, evenly distributes liquid foundation as well as powder, and buffs the product into the skin like no other.</li>
            <li>Overall, I would highly recommend trying this brush.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend you do the same.</li>
            <li>Such high quality brush.</li>
            <li>came highly recommended from multiple makeup artists and beauty bloggers!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend his brush and will be buying all my brushes from this brand in the future!</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for this brush, I would not recommend.</li>
            <li>it took only 10 days although i live far away in KSA.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super soft (which I love)and not to heavy.</li>
            <li>, for such a small price, I think you get a high quality brush that will become indispensable.</li>
            <li>The brush is exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>What I expected, but it&#x27;s my first sigma brush</li>
            <li>This is a well made brush and more importantly it does not shed like other much more expensive brushes from different brands I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li>So I decided to wait a month before I reviewed the flat top kabuki, to get a decent all round idea of how good / bad this brush</li>
            <li>saves my life for when i&#x27;m running late, the weight of the handle is beautiful, seriously, if you&#x27;re going to splurge on a makeup brush, try this one</li>
            <li>This is an amazing tool to apply even makeup and less mess!</li>
            <li>had to buy a new one again that same week.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll order it from the actual website or send me a new one.</li>
            <li>The only downfall is that I live in Canada so it takes longer for the delivery to arrive</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend the Flat Kabuki for foundation application.</li>
            <li>After washing, it took less than a day to dry, however it was pretty hot</li>
            <li>The brushes were totally dry and ready to use this morning.</li>
            <li>This was my first Sigma Beauty purchase but it will not be the last; I have a long wish list.  </li>
            <li>The minor shedding continued when I actually used the brush for the first time.</li>
            <li>It is firm and smooth at the same time.</li>
            <li>Obviously the most commonly recommended brush when applying liquid foundation.  </li>
            <li>They replied quickly and said that they would contact the seller and tell them about my trouble.</li>
            <li>I used the regular drug store foundation brushes and although there was nothing wrong with using the drug store foundation brushes, I took it upon myself to see if this product was really as good as people claim it to be.</li>
            <li>excellent, the size is necessary to place the base in the face.</li>
            <li>If I add a small amount of facial lotion to my coverage, one layer is enough for a very clean and natural look.</li>
            <li>No other company has a brush like this</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first, seeing as the brush is only available online, however it lived up to expectations!</li>
            <li>This brush barely lasted 2 months!</li>
            <li>it is exactly like my other ones.</li>
            <li>I am willing now to try some other brushes from Sigma</li>
            <li>It offers a little more coverage than the domed kabuki brushes that are typically recommended.</li>
            <li>I was afraid to clean it the first time,  because the brushes I had before were never as soft once it was washed, but the sigma was exactly the same as when I received it!!!</li>
            <li>Just FYI, if you have dry skin or excessive flaking, this brush will enhance, so make sure you exfoliate before use.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so suprised how fast it is, even though I live on the other side of the world!</li>
            <li>probably need two or more foundation brushes to rotate anyway if you clean the foundation brush everyday because it takes at least a day for them to completely dry)</li>
            <li>The quality of Sigma brushes are unlike any other - very dense and soft.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s soooooo soft, but it is hard to clean.</li>
            <li>I prefer Real Techniques, good quality and less expensive.</li>
            <li>Although I was skeptical at first, the Sigma brush lived up to the reviews and provides a nice coat while using less powder compared to my old brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I will repurchase this item, I prefer to use my ELF flat top powder brush, only costs $3 and never had a problem of it shedding.</li>
            <li>This was my favorite brush until I ordered again on Amazon and recieved a fake one which broke right away, the first one lasted like a yr, washed it almost everyday, this one soon as I open bristles fall off</li>
            <li>This new flat kabuki brush came from heaven.</li>
            <li>brush is well-built; the bristles are tight and the length is just right.</li>
            <li>I will never go back to my old ways</li>
            <li>It works well with my Smashbox Halo powder and my Bare Minerals foundation.  </li>
            <li>This sigma flat kabuki brush is amazingly soft!</li>
            <li>This brush is so dense and sturdy, yet at the same time extremely soft.</li>
            <li>It is so soft yet sturdy enough to do the job.  </li>
            <li>It gives such an even application and it is so soft.  </li>
            <li>It is of the same quality as the brushes I purchased directly from Sigma and the seller is an authorized Amazon retailer according to the Sigma Beauty</li>
            <li>The bristles are amazingly soft, densely packed and the handle is solid.  </li>
            <li>I also find it looks natural when I want to put multiple layers of foundation on.  </li>
            <li>I apply with a liquid foundation and it leaves such a natural finish.</li>
            <li>I use a mixture between Bare Minerals Brush Shampoo &amp; the BeautyBlender Liquid Cleanser.</li>
            <li>I thought NG Inc stood for NutraGroup Inc, an approved Amazon Sigma reseller, but apparently it does not.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Brush arrived fast and was just as expected.</li>
            <li>I have always applied my foundation using either my hands or a makeup sponge but after using this brush, I&#x27;ll never go back to my old ways.</li>
            <li>I have found cheaper dupes almost as soft as this Sigma, but none of them have come close to the same density, and because of that Sigma always provides a smoother quicker application.</li>
            <li>So pissed I barely had it a month</li>
            <li>So far I have only used this brush once</li>
            <li>I used a kabuki brush to apply my Bare Minerals.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Kabuki brushes from Bare Minerals that have been shedding all over my face when I apply the product.</li>
            <li>and I have no regrets...</li>
            <li>and I get barely any on my face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft and it feels like it will last.</li>
            <li>but I needed one that could apply liquid and possibly my Bare minerals foundation.</li>
            <li>Almost twenty dollars for a brush is a lot, especially when I got a similar brush from the Real Techniques line that came in a set of FIVE brushes for the same price as this one brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So soft and distributes the product equally over the face.</li>
            <li>I do not feel that I have been rough with this brush at all and am always gentle when cleaning it.</li>
            <li>an MD who barely has time to apply all the steps to my makeup routine because</li>
            <li>Not only are the bristles soft</li>
            <li>It is incredibly soft yet sturdy &amp; dense enough to get an even application.</li>
            <li>The only reason I give this a 3/5 is because after a couple a months (2-3) it completely came apart.</li>
            <li>I was careful to never get water in the ferrule and cleaned it just like the rest of my brushes (which are fine), but the bristles came unglued in less than five months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is so dense and when I use it I feel like have to pat the foundation in and it kind of feels uncomfortable, because the bristles don&#x27;t move well.</li>
            <li>Love this brush, however when I received it, the metal was dented and the brush was poorly packaged.</li>
            <li>It was also kind of expensive in my opinion for a make up brush..</li>
            <li>It is a little hard to clean but well worth it.</li>
            <li>I am only giving it four stars though because I keep experiencing a bit of shed, and because when it arrived it had tiny singular black hairs sticking out from the smooth white finish that needed to be trimmed.</li>
            <li>Really upsetting that it didn&#x27;t last that long!</li>
            <li>Other than that the brush was really soft and looked high quality.</li>
            <li>I also looked at some of other flat top kabuki brushes around this price, and this brush beats other ones if the price is similar.  </li>
            <li>I have never had an issue with this one, not a single bristle lost!</li>
            <li>I waste way less product and get a better finish.</li>
            <li>Before getting this brush, I tried a lot of other ways to apply liquid foundation (with a traditional foundation brush, sponges, fingers, etc) but nothing worked to really blend my foundation and make it look somewhat natural.</li>
            <li>or i got a defective one, because there is no way that in less than a year a whole chunk of it can fall off!</li>
            <li>I first purchased this brush in January, but after almost a year my brush broke in half.</li>
            <li>I normally wash it once a week with Dawn dish soap and let it dry overnight.</li>
            <li>I used this with my foundation and the foundation didn&#x27;t sink into the brush half as much!</li>
            <li>My other brush would just pick up too much product and leave me looking cakey.</li>
            <li>Hard to clean</li>
            <li>soft flat brush&lt;br /&gt;applies</li>
            <li>brush is well built, black wooden handle and metallic ferrule, the bristles are very dense and reaaaaaaaally soft.</li>
            <li>After purchasing this brush I actually purchased the entire professional set.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently purchased several brushes and this brush is by far one of favorites.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ll definitely order from them again hopefully in the near future.</li>
            <li>I should have just spent the extra money and got the real deal</li>
            <li>This brush as received a lot of hype from online and social media gurus.</li>
            <li>it came earlier than expected very grateful of that.</li>
            <li>None of my older brushes could survive my rough handling and cleaning</li>
            <li>As I use it to smooth out the foundation the thick bristles pressed the cream deep into the pores and therefore show up unflatteringly.  </li>
            <li>The brush was in good condition upon opening, and unfortunately broke after minimal use.</li>
            <li>I usually pat it down for more coverage .</li>
            <li>Even cheapy brushes don&#x27;t usually have loose ferrules, and considering how much this cost, it doesn&#x27;t exactly fall under the cheapy category.  </li>
            <li>good brush, but unfortunately the stick part came loose and now i only use the bristle part of it.</li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s important that you know that it has only been in the past year that I&#x27;ve been buying more expensive make-up vs. drugstore stuff</li>
            <li>All I used to wash it, was a little olive oil, soap and water, which works wonders on my other, cheap brushes, from target.</li>
            <li>When I finally started to use it, however, I found that it was absorbing more of my liquid foundation than my ELF Powder brush (which I won&#x27;t tolerate, seeing that right now, I&#x27;m using Make Up For Ever&#x27;s HD Foundation, which is too expensive to be wasted!!)</li>
            <li>It is a long lasting brush and you won&#x27;t have to worry about having to get a new one anytime soon</li>
            <li>I did wash it right away and it only shed a few hairs.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I am paranoid about being out and having a stubble show through late in the day, and this brush combined with the right foundation (and stippling!) buys me a lot of time.  </li>
            <li>The one drawback is that it is very dense, and takes a long time to dry.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that can really be considered a con since ALL synthetic fiber brushes take long to dry</li>
            <li>I had previously purchased the &amp;#34;Sephora&amp;#34; version of this brush, and all it did from the first day was shed...everywhere and constantly.  </li>
            <li>I have used MUG&#x27;s stippling brush in the past, and to me this one is better and slightly cheaper.</li>
            <li>Every time I use it, I always use more foundation than if I use my other brush, it also highlights my dry spots on my forehead making an uneven and spotty finish.</li>
            <li>Lately I&#x27;ve been on the fence about buying super expensive foundation and instead opted for this brush after seeing it used in many makeup tutorials online in the hopes that having a &#x27;professional&#x27; tool would help me out with what I already have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My combination skin is mostly in great shape, but I&#x27;v been disappointed with cakey or too watery foundations.  </li>
            <li>I was a bit disappointed about the shedding given the great reviews.</li>
            <li>have to confess that I have a facial hair problem due to very aggravating disorder that drives me nuts.  </li>
            <li>The only thing is it is a bit hard to clean.</li>
            <li>This brush is really hard to completely clean back to</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft they do not loosen or break even after a long time of use.</li>
            <li>(especially the bare minerals buki brushes which shed at an obnoxious rate).</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t waste product and it doesn&#x27;t shed, even straight out of the box!</li>
            <li>I love that this buffs product into the skin and disperses any extra that you might not want left behind.  </li>
            <li>but I had no idea what I was missing until I tried my first Sigma brush.  </li>
            <li>So first time I discover this brush was watching a few tutorials on You Tube.</li>
            <li>Price is absolutely affordable and way cheaper than what you find on ebay and by any other carries of these sigma brushes!</li>
            <li>I am very careful with the way I wash my brushes however this particular brush did not hold up to the sigma quality.</li>
            <li>I was not willing to pay $30 &amp; up for a high end brush that might work, so I stuck with my fingers.</li>
            <li>Yes I will purchase other one and highly recommend to family and friends.</li>
            <li>, I really do, but I thought it was going to make my foundation look AMAZING, so I was a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li>It is also incredibly soft to the touch but sturdy enough to not completely give way while you are applying foundation.</li>
            <li>The next day after my first use, I washed the brush and there was little fallout, only about 1 or 2 bristles.</li>
            <li>The bristle began to push down and honestly it became unusable after approximately 8 washes.</li>
            <li>It is totally worth the $23 I spent, I can&#x27;t wait to the other brushes in the line!</li>
            <li>The brush is super soft and very thick.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and dense and I haven&#x27;t shed a single fiber yet</li>
            <li>Now I think I want one that&#x27;s not flat though.</li>
            <li>Also the brush is not easy to clean, takes a long time to dry.</li>
            <li>brush is very durable as well, I&#x27;ve had it a little over a year now</li>
            <li>The bristles didnt come off at all, which is a problem ive had with other new brushes.  </li>
            <li>The brush absorbs too much foundation and little is actually left to apply on the skin.</li>
            <li>I typically use ELF studio line brushes which are extremely affordable but also durable and useful.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the money, also Sigma has way better brushes than Mac and other expensive brands for almost half the price.</li>
            <li>have been reading good and bad reviews on this brush.</li>
            <li>Anyway, basically this product loses stars because it took forever to get here (Canada) and the brush requires A LOT of wrist action so that can lead to a lot of fatigue (and my mom won&#x27;t use it for that reason) and if you are doing make up for a while, it gets to be way too much.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This was bought for a gift and the recipient loved it.</li>

            <li> so I couldn&#x27;t take a look at it in person but figured it must be as good as they say.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t figured out a good use for this brush yet since I don&#x27;t like using it for what I bought it for.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;ve read good reviews about this so idecided to buy it</li>

            <li> I loved it for two months.</li>
            <li> But I did not have a good experience.</li>
            <li> Every says my makeup looks so good since I started using sigma.</li>
            <li> I never had a good foundation brush until i came across this one.</li>
            <li> and I loved it....</li>
            <li> Good deal</li>
            <li> It makes your foundation go on ultra smooth and makes your skin look flawless.</li>
            <li> It leaves an airbrushed look which is really good when using liquid foundations.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t express how good of a brush this is.</li>
            <li> Good quality brush for an affordable price.</li>
            <li> Loved it to death for two years.</li>
            <li> Not all brushes from Sigma are that good though...</li>
            <li> I do like the buffing brush with BB creams, but if I want to wear a foundation that is tougher to blend, the F80 is superior.  </li>
            <li> I LOVED it.</li>
            <li> It came within the suggested time and in good condition as well.</li>

            <li> It is the softest brush I own.</li>
            <li> Idk if it&#x27;s just because I&#x27;m using the &amp;#34;wrong&amp;#34; kind of liquid foundation with it, but it&#x27;s a pain to get it to blend well with the brush.</li>
            <li> It came in fast time, excellent packaging and pricing.</li>

            <li> and it holds it own.</li>
            <li> Flawless and fast foundation application with this brush.</li>
            <li> I knew from the reviews that this was a popular brush, but I had no idea</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s kind of pricey for a stick that puts on makeup, it smooths it out</li>
            <li> Applies liquid foundation evenly and nicely.</li>
            <li> Nice effect w translucent powder</li>
            <li> NICE PROTECTIVE PACKAGING.  </li>

            <li> ABSOLUTELY the Best for putting on Foundation!!</li>
            <li> it gives my face a nice coverage byt after i can completly just wipe it off.</li>
            <li> Wonderful Brush that is very inexpensive compared to known name brands.</li>
            <li> MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE FOUNDATION BRUSH!!!!!  </li>
            <li> This brush gives it a nice finish and the makeup looks natural.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Every woman should own this brush.</li>
            <li> and it is just spectacular.</li>
            <li> I worked it all in and was thrilled at the the end</li>
            <li> Heard many good things about this brush.</li>
            <li> I use this for my foundation and it works really nicely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments about having &amp;#34;flawless skin.&amp;#34; I do think that it soaks up a lot of product (good for me as a noob since i probably over apply).</li>
            <li> I would inshallah continue buying it because it is what I&#x27;ve been looking for to have an air-brushed kind of finishing for my foundation.</li>
            <li> Do explain why you liked this product.its</li>
            <li> My clients look flawless and airbrushed because the f80 really blends the foundation into the skin.</li>
            <li> It distributes the makeup evenly and really helps it to blend into your face perfectly.  </li>
            <li> and it is SO NICE.</li>
            <li> I can truly say that this brush gave a nice finish with my liquid foundation application.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice brush, but now I realize it&#x27;s a bit overhyped.  </li>
            <li> This is where I kind of had a problem.</li>
            <li> I am loving this brush.</li>
            <li> After reading so many good reviews on this brush, I just couldn&#x27;t wait to try it</li>
            <li> Perfect for applying foundation and an absolute beauty must have.</li>

            <li> I kind of regret not purchasing it from the Sigma site ..</li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t really say I take the best care of brushes either</li>
            <li> It makes putting foundation on much easier and makes my face look flawless!</li>

            <li> Sigma is my favorite brush brand.however this brush after one use began to fall apart</li>
            <li> This was definitely an authentic Sigma brush.</li>
            <li> Be sure to look under &amp;#34;In Stock&amp;#34; and see who the brush is sold by.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure some customers are being sold counterfeit merchandise, without realizing who is fulfilling the order.</li>
            <li> I washed it before using it and it turns ok then 1st time using it ...</li>
            <li> After watching many you tube videos of this, I decided to purchase.</li>

            <li> I use with my GA Luminous Silk foundation and like way better than the GA brush (more than twice the cost) that GA recommends you use.</li>

            <li> The Sigma F80, however, is phenomenal at getting you as close to an airbrushed perfect application, without any streaking, flaking, or patchiness that I&#x27;ve had with any other foundation brushes.</li>

            <li> Overall very good quality and will def.</li>

            <li> It is perfect, with high quality material and a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Perfect size and flat top shape that allows the brush to adequately grip the dimensions of anyones face</li>
            <li> I have to concur with the reviewers - it is comfortable to hold, easy to clean (using either a cosmetic brush cleaner or baby shampoo), super-soft, and effective for either powder or liquid foundation.  </li>
            <li> Love the smooth blending of my foundation.</li>
            <li> so I felt confident that I would get a genuine brush.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the fast shipping!</li>
            <li> It applies foundation so smoothly and evenly, way better than stippling brushes, which is what I have used before.  </li>

            <li> I am truly happy with my purchase and will definitely be purchasing more Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> Best Brush I have ever used, it is definitely worth the extra cost</li>
            <li> Amazing brush, love it so much,</li>
            <li> This brush is great for blending in foundation, however it does absorb a lot of the makeup thereby wasting product and necessitating deep cleaning more often.</li>
            <li> This brush makes my makeup application very quick process in the mornings.</li>
            <li> Great at first but way too much fallout!</li>
            <li> Be sure to clean it on a weekly basis.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to buff and blend into my skin.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best foundation brush I have purchased, and a heck of a lot cheaper than my MAC brush which I don&#x27;t like as much.</li>
            <li> It distributes foundation evenly and is easy to work with.  </li>
            <li> Easy to grip as you apply foundation</li>
            <li> This is an amazing brush I love it sooooo much</li>
            <li> Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend buying from Sigma.</li>
            <li> So far so good, pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> A strong chemical smell</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd time when I purchase this brush because my mom snuck my first brush :) We love it!!!</li>
            <li> Initially this brush was great worked wonderfully but after continued use the brush bristles came loose and started coming out.  </li>
            <li> Love the sigma brush  love love love and it came in pretty quick..</li>
            <li> I love the brush specially when putting liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> It is soft and large and it works great applying any kind of mineral foundation.</li>
            <li> I like the brush but only gave it 4 stars because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the greatest foundation brush ever made, but maybe I&#x27;m not using it the right way?</li>
            <li> Super soft and beautiful bristles.</li>
            <li> Very full coverage, but smooth.</li>
            <li> This is one amazing brush, and also my first Sigma purchase.</li>
            <li> Its an amazing brush , it was my first one from Sigma</li>
            <li> But I really have no reason to try another brand since I am very satisfied with this brush.</li>
            <li> It is an amazing brush when you first start using it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for powder, blush, and foundation since it is a flat top.</li>
            <li> but so far, I am really loving it!  </li>
            <li> It is amazingly soft, but with the bristles so compact it stipples nicely!</li>
            <li> The bristles are dense, and I haven&#x27;t experienced much shedding, but the brush isn&#x27;t very sturdy, and some bristles stick up much more than others.</li>
            <li> I watched many sigma review videos on youtube before purchasing this brush and the reviews have been true to fact.</li>
            <li> Its absolutely perfect in its application, incomparable to other brands in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Applies the makeup beautifully and no stray hairs even after multiple washes.</li>
            <li> Hands down best foundation brush for your money!</li>
            <li> I keep clean after ever use with makeup clothes then spray it good with a gentle cleaner once a week.</li>
            <li> HANDS DOWN THE BEST BRUSH EVER !!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Best makeup foundation brush on the market-- hands down.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know if I would be anymore impressed with Sigma brushes than the other brushes I already have, but I am!  </li>
            <li> Super soft, sturdy and dense bristles which allow for a wonderful application and buffs any liquid into the skin really well!</li>
            <li> Good make up brush, worth the price, very dense brush and good size for whole face application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved it so much, i&#x27;ve purchased this for family and friends and am glad to say they love it as much as I do.  </li>
            <li> I have read and seen several great reviews about this brush being able to give a flawless finish using liquid foundation, however after a few washes the hairs started shedding.</li>
            <li> The Sigma F80 Flat Top Synthetic Kabuki arrived in perfect condition and very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This islands down the best foundation brush on earth, you really can&#x27;t find a better one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used plenty of brushes in the past for my foundation but this brush leaves the most perfect air-brush-like finish.</li>

            <li> Thank you for making such a great brush.</li>

            <li> I ordered and revived my f80 brush fast and with nice packaging.</li>
            <li> just do it cause it&#x27;s worth every penny :)</li>
            <li> The makeup just slides on and it feels so smooth.</li>
            <li> It applies any type of foundation smoothly, streak free.  </li>
            <li> This is fabulous for foundation.  </li>
            <li> The quality is fantastic.</li>
            <li> i liked using the brush to apply liquid foundation and it made distributing the foundation so much easier.</li>
            <li> I use it to buff in my foundation, and it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I found a two-in-one brush from Sigma.</li>
            <li> Ordered the F80 after seeing countless great reviews.</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this brush....</li>
            <li> This is just a flat-out fantastic foundation brush.</li>
            <li> I have been watching Samantha Schuerman on Youtube for a while, and she is always talking about how fabulous this brush is.</li>
            <li> so it was a genuine brush.</li>
            <li> It applies smoothly and does not shed at all.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday, magnificent investment, airbrush finish, buy it.</li>
            <li> Distributes foundation smoothly with no streaks whatsoever.</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome for applying foundation, however , mine had uneven hairs .</li>
            <li> Great size for getting all over and in smaller parts of your face.</li>
            <li> I bought this from Amazon.com for $24 with free prime shipping.</li>
            <li> Leaves a smooth foundation application, whether it&#x27;s liquid, cream or powder.</li>
            <li> Overall great purchase.</li>
            <li> this is a genuine Sigma brush.  </li>
            <li> This brush is fantastic.</li>
            <li> But after about 6 months, the bristles began falling out after fairly light use, about 2 uses a week.</li>
            <li> Ferule is not attached to the handle securely- the parts move, and I&#x27;m wondering if this construction is going to fall apart at some point.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for liquid and cream foundations, but I personally use it for mineral foundation.</li>
            <li> This works great in the same way my BCC brush does.  </li>
            <li> I like using it with liquid foundation and to smooth out my  concealer.</li>
            <li> Makeup goes on smooth and even.</li>
            <li> so makeup doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> It was suppose to come about five days later, so the shipping was great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth and the brush tip is flexible.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Girls, don&#x27;t buy cheap cheap brushes.</li>
            <li> Great brush, and received only 3 days  after placing order.</li>
            <li> only thing is that after a while it got kinda wobbly, but it applies the make up great</li>
            <li> Applies my make-up on effortlessly, flawlessly and doesn&#x27;t waste any product.</li>
            <li> Great overall brush!</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and wash it every month, its working great for me!!</li>
            <li> I received a free E05 eyeliner brush with my F80.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Application is smooth and even.</li>
            <li> Its a great brush, you should definitely buy it.</li>
            <li> It applies foundation smooth.</li>
            <li> for 1 its cheap , cheaper then the brushes at sophora.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really shed either, which is nice compared to the powder kabuki brush I purchased.  </li>
            <li> Makeup goes on perfectly smooth and even.</li>
            <li> It was a nice brush but it wasn&#x27;t a real Sigma brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to clean as well</li>
            <li> They feel smooth - like suede -  when you apply your foundation on in a circular motion.</li>
            <li> Heard so many great things about this from different makeup gurus on YouTube, totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Applies make up even and smooth.</li>
            <li> Applies Smooth makeup.</li>
            <li> I use it with the Dr. Jarts BB cream and my face looks fantastic.</li>
            <li> it gives the face smooth look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a genuine sigma brush.</li>
            <li> I usually quickly smooth my foundation on with my fingers  </li>
            <li> I use this brush to apply and to buff out the product with light circular motions.</li>
            <li> and you a get a free eyeliner brush with this purchase from the sigma website.</li>
            <li> Brush is easy to clean.  </li>

            <li> It is so light weight but applies foundation smoothly.</li>
            <li> This is a very dense brush, applies my liquid foundation amazingly.</li>
            <li> I own the Real Techniques Brushes as well</li>
            <li> My makeup glides on soooo smoothly every time.</li>
            <li> This brush isn&#x27;t a cheap brush</li>
            <li> Foundation goes on smoothly and does not cake up.</li>
            <li> Blends everything smoothly and its just perfection</li>
            <li> It helps it to go on smooth and streak free without looking cakey.</li>
            <li> Before I made the purchase, I called Sigma to make sure FRESH BOTANICA is an authorized reseller</li>
            <li> When you purchase from Amazon make sure the reseller is FRESH BOTANICA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This brush gives such a flawless, amazing finish - plus there&#x27;s no wetting a sponge and it will last you way longer than a beauty blender.</li>
            <li> Quite indispensable, I&#x27;d say.</li>
            <li> Fantastic feel and quality.</li>
            <li> , I use it everyday and it leaves my foundation looking flawless.</li>
            <li> The real Sigma F80 brush is amazing.</li>
            <li> Its already shedding after only two washes tho and just doesn&#x27;t feel like great quality.</li>
            <li> BUT THE SIGMA BRUSHES DON&#x27;T LEAVE ANY HAIRS ON ME, THE PRODUCT GOES ON MY FACE SMOOTHLY  </li>
            <li> This is the fourth brush I have tried and it is absolutely the best.</li>
            <li> this brush is also very versatile, you can use it for many many things, i just prefer to use it for my liquid foundation.  </li>
            <li> The F80 is also very dense and very big, this makes it perfect for foundation.</li>
            <li> When applying my foundation the brush left my face flawless, it really hid my imperfections, redness, and no problems with dryness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still experimenting with his brush and so far so good.</li>
            <li> I Loved this brush, It is so soft on the skin.</li>

            <li> Using this brush instead of my fingers for application, I have reduced my acne to little to none.. Love, love, love it!!</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft on your face, but not so much that they aren&#x27;t providing you the right amount of pressure to apply perfectly.</li>
            <li> I just cleaned mine for the first time and it was easy!</li>
            <li> Not only is it completely awesome, but I got it super fast!</li>
            <li> but my first one I bought a year agonies still going strong!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super soft and amazing for buffing in foundation!</li>

            <li> Super soft, doesnt absorb too much product, super dense and buffs out foundation flawlessly!</li>
            <li> The price is right and the quality is astonishing.</li>
            <li> I have been using my fingers until now,  because I have never been able to find the right tool for the job.  </li>

            <li> It picks up a bit too much of my BB cream, but that may just be me, and the application is pretty good.</li>
            <li> Overall, it is an AMAZING brush and worth more than what it costs!  </li>
            <li> It is everything i ever wanted in a foundation brush -- good quality (not flimsy or loose handle like the ELF powder brush), it has dense synthetic fibers, and most importantly, it applies all of my liquid foundations like a dream (MAC studiofix, Revlon Colorstay-- you name it).</li>
            <li> My new every day brush for sure!</li>
            <li> i love it very much 😍</li>
            <li> I am very happy with their service overall as well as my new make up brush.</li>
            <li> I use this to apply foundation, it provides flawless coverage with very little blending, and it does not cake the make up to your face.  </li>
            <li> Best 15 bucks i spent!!!!</li>
            <li> The bristles are super soft and my makeup always looks so good after the application.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super fluffy and the bristles are perfect coverage for my face !</li>
            <li> It blends incredibly good and the bristles are super soft on your face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I loved my brush and a took a very good care of it, making sure the metal part would not get any water, I would also dry it bristles down on a towel.</li>
            <li> Though the quality of the brush is great, it&#x27;s very soft, etc; it does not apply products very well.</li>
            <li> The quality is amazing, no shedding, very soft bristles, dense, even application, blends smoothly, doesn&#x27;t make foundation look</li>
            <li> Definitely multifunctional &amp; applying make up is just amazingly effortless using this brush!</li>
            <li> Not only did this brush come BEFORE the estimated delivery date; it&#x27;s AMAZING!  </li>
            <li> though it was normal because a lot of brushes shed, I have always heard amazing reviews of the sigma brushes and I never heard of anyone&#x27;s kabuki brush shedding.</li>
            <li> but it just doesn&#x27;t have the following and amazing praise that this one does!  </li>
            <li> I originally heard about these brushes online from beauty gurus.</li>
            <li> So excited I ran inside and tried it out.  </li>
            <li> This brush is perfect in my small girly hand.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when i ordered this product.</li>
            <li> The brush has a pretty fat handle and I like it because it gives you more control.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this brush so much!</li>
            <li> Well worth the investment in my opinion!</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s worth the wait!</li>
            <li> I would compare these brushes to more higher end brushes for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> so I was so excited to use it.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this brush because I watched some makeup clips that were reviewing it on YouTube.</li>
            <li> So excited to receive this brush.</li>
            <li> Well, let me tell you, this brush is definitely worth the hype!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the 17 dollars!</li>
            <li> and I must say that I am not disappointed at all.  </li>
            <li> This is my first sigma brush and I&#x27;m looking forward to purchasing more.</li>
            <li> Sigma brushes have never disappointed me.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money!</li>
            <li> but I dont mind really- its still a great brush and its very well worth the money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to repurchase when I lost my original, and would purchase again if anything happened to the one I have now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was the first \\&quot;expensive\\&quot; brush that I have purchased, i.e. more than $5.  </li>
            <li> this is worth having in your makeup collection!</li>
            <li> This product is totally worth it!</li>
            <li> Worth the $24!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s original while color.</li>
            <li> Love sigma brushes so much!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best brushes I have used, not only is it soft but it blends and applies smoothly and airbrushed.</li>
            <li> When I recieved this brush I was so excited to try it</li>
            <li> I am so excited to use this brush.  </li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this brush out because of its rave reviews.  </li>
            <li> I decided to take a chance, and was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> At first, I was weary of buying this product because I didn&#x27;t know if it was authentic.</li>
            <li> My first sigma brush and I absolutely love it..</li>
            <li> I love this brush sooo much!</li>
            <li> This is my first sigma brush and I love it.</li>
            <li> So far I am very pleased with this brush.</li>
            <li> Love the coverage it provides with my liquid foundation, and will definitely be buying more Sigma brushes!</li>
            <li> This was the first time I tried the sigma beauty line brushes and I love it.</li>
            <li> totally worth the buy!</li>
            <li> I was much more impressed with this brush than all the other ones I looked at and tested out in Sephora, and it is pretty much two-thirds of the price of those brushes!  </li>
            <li> Any Sigma brush is worth the investment!</li>
            <li> First of all, I absolutely love the Sigma F80.</li>
            <li> I love this brush so much!</li>
            <li> I would say it is worth the money, just make sure you are really taking the time to blend your foundation with the brush to get the best airbrush effect, and take extra time blending when the brush isn&#x27;t the cleanest ;)</li>
            <li> Is this the original sigma brush ?</li>
            <li> and I must say it was worth the hype!</li>
            <li> I love this brush soo much!</li>
            <li> SO worth the money!</li>
            <li> It was worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Love it, works exactly what I need it for.</li>
            <li> Applies a flawless finish to the face with small circular outward</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> It is soft, easy to clean, and cost effective.  </li>
            <li> Hesitant on paying 20 dollars for one brush, but so worth the money!</li>
            <li> Get a better application if you spray a mist on it first.</li>
            <li> fibers are soooooo soft and it applies my favorite foundation very smoothly.</li>
            <li> The packaging was cute because you get a nice sheer bag, instructions on how to clean the brush and a free gift.</li>
            <li> its really good quality i imagined it to be bigger but its still fine</li>
            <li> I recently purchased a  flat top synthetic kabuki - f80.&lt;br /&gt;The best foundation brush.</li>
            <li> My new make-up hasn&#x27;t arrived yet, and I&#x27;m waiting until it does to try out the brush, but it is exceptionally soft, has a great usable handle, and overall looks great.  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love this flat kabuki brush!</li>
            <li> (I use baby shampoo to clean my makeup brushes).</li>
            <li> Purchased the Sigma F80 flat top synthetic kabuki and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great quality, for not too bad a price, and am I am so happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I keep mine clean</li>
            <li> The product itself is a great size, really sturdy, and really soft on the face.</li>
            <li> it is such an amazing brush, i am going to purchase a backup :)...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned makeup brushes before and know how to adequately clean them.</li>
            <li> I am currently using the Sigma F80 for my Make Up For Ever duo mat, and it allows me to obtain a flawless and natural looking finish from my foundation.  </li>
            <li> I have used many brushes for foundation and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> I clean my brushes about once a week (sometimes 2 weeks, depending on my hectic schedule).</li>
            <li> I clean this with baby shampoo and it does the job.</li>
            <li> Essential for a flawless and natural skin look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a clean freak</li>
            <li> fit as expected , they are great</li>
            <li> I believe it&#x27;s how you clean your brushes.</li>
            <li> I have heard so many amazing things especially from beauty gurus on YouTube</li>
            <li> Used it with Revlon Colorstay liquid foundation and it blended it smoothly and quickly.</li>
            <li> It does take some effort to clean though</li>
            <li> As a professional makeup artist I use many many brushes.</li>
            <li> I cannot imagine how much money I have spent trying to find brushes that blend perfectly and do not shed.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing facial makeup brush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> The brush itself is super smooth and doesn&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> It really does give a flawless airbrush-type finish with minimal foundation usage.  </li>
            <li> The good thing is Simone the owner of SIgma tweeted a photo of this brush saying it had dried in four hours using some kind of drying product she was developing.</li>
            <li> I use F80 for applying liquid foundation, which is very easy and super fast when working with the brush.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft and feels nice on the skin.</li>
            <li> In any case noticed more positive reviews for this on Amazon and decided to get these for my wife.</li>
            <li> and it is amazing and so soft!</li>
            <li> I have many MAC makeup brushes, but I am becoming a huge fan of Sigma because this brand is comparable and perhaps far exceeds MAC brushes in quality, cost, and performance.</li>
            <li> As far as I can see in this brush, Sigma&#x27;s brushes are top quality!</li>
            <li> and it gives you complete full coverage and a perfect air brushed look</li>
            <li> brush is fairly easy to wash, though the Tarte Amazonian Clay is a bear to clean if I don&#x27;t wash it right away (an issue with that foundation for ALL brushes).</li>
            <li> A little pricy but very good quality.</li>
            <li> The bristles is very smooth, and very dense.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very dense and applies liquid foundation very smoothly.</li>
            <li> The bristles are so nice and soft and thick, the makeup goes on smooth and flawless.</li>
            <li> its very smooth on my skin and doesn&#x27;t absorb too much product.</li>
            <li> This new brush has been great with no shedding at all and seems better put together than the last one.</li>
            <li> I liked the flat top because it helped me concentrate the powder for days</li>
            <li> This brush was shipped very quickly and came with a nice pouch which will come in handy to store quite a few brushes.  </li>
            <li> I had used the Mac version of this brush while playing with a friends brushes,and decided to go with sigma instead due to reviews and how much I had heard about them,and I&#x27;m happy I did!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen a good quality product like this, better than MAC and other brushes I used before, I&#x27;ll purchase again</li>
            <li> I have another flat kabuki brush that I thought did a good job but after using this I realize it didn&#x27;t apply as smooth and evenly as this Sigma brush does.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t regret your purchase, I promise!  :)nt with Amazon b/c of the super fast, free shipping from Prime.  </li>
            <li> With the size of the brush, I was able to blend in my foundation in literally seconds since it covers a large portion of my face.</li>
            <li> Nothing special about it at all, however I don&#x27;t mind contouring with a darker foundation around my temples and cheekbones with it.</li>
            <li> and so I did right away!</li>
            <li> And oh was I RIGHT!</li>
            <li> She was right!  </li>
            <li> This brush is super soft, super effective, and super easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite foundation brush and just favorite brush in general!</li>
            <li> It arrived so quickly, in like 3 days, and it feels so soft as if im touching a chinchilla!</li>
            <li> The brush is soft, very dense, and works amazing!</li>
            <li> It Was more than what i expected, Couldn&#x27;t be more happy, would love to order more in the near future.</li>
            <li> the hairs don&#x27;t come off like I expected, and it works great.</li>
            <li> For anyone who desires a flawless finish to their makeup application, then this brush is definitely worth the small investment.</li>
            <li> relatively easy to clean and exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing it is soft and dense.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing, it is recommended by professional make up artists</li>
            <li> I love this brush so much</li>
            <li> i cant say good enough things about this.</li>
            <li> I love this brush so much.</li>
            <li> Not always true.</li>
            <li> and I love it so much.</li>
            <li> oh and by the way I was expecting the shipment to take a full 7-10 days</li>
            <li> I really recommend Sigma brushes &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I find that I have to apply the foundation twice to get full coverage with this brush</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft and nicely packed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been one to use much make-up, so have not used many brushes.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to keep putting more foundation on, and it really buffs the product onto my skin so it doesn&#x27;t look cakey/uneven.</li>
            <li> Put a nickel sized blob on the back of my hand, dabbed the brush on it, and when I applied it to my face, DANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNG.This spreads stuff around GOOD.</li>
            <li> It is 100 times better, and sooo much cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredibly good at applying liquid foundation but also mineral foundation, double usage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely going to be buying more Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> It really is one of my favorite brushes.</li>
            <li> The brush itself is very durable and has held its shape through many washes.</li>
            <li> I do absolutely love it, but if you want to save a buck, buy the eco tools one, or really any one that looks dense.</li>
            <li> I have been using it to apply my foundation and it gives me a nice and natural finish.</li>
            <li> I love it so much.</li>
            <li> Give it a try, it blends my blush nicely into my powder so there are no harsh lines</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this Sigma brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love it this much.</li>
            <li> It works so good with my liquid foundation that I bought a back up.</li>
            <li> I love it so much.</li>
            <li> Using this brush to apply full coverage foundation.</li>
            <li> the full review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> very good!better than sonia kashuk ,and price is somewhat okay for $21,not</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would really like this or</li>
            <li> I really want to love this brush.</li>
            <li> love it so much....</li>
            <li> It also gives me full coverage, and I have acne scars on my cheeks and chin.</li>
            <li> like a toddler had attacked me with fingers full of foundation.  </li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t have to pay full price to Sigma alway.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s my absolute favorite now</li>
            <li> I use it with my Mac Full Coverage foundation.</li>
            <li> For the price, I don&#x27;t think there is a true comparison.</li>
            <li> I love this brush, it works really well with creamy/ liquid foundations.</li>
            <li> Love it so much.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it took me this long to own one of these!</li>
            <li> and I could not say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;And thank as well for the fast shipment &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Sigma for everyone! :)</li>
            <li> and I needed something with full coverage...</li>
            <li> Application is smooth and uniform - worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Gives me a full coverage but without looking cakey.</li>
            <li> the price is not my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li> I like it better then the Beauty Blender and the Real Techniques Expert Face Brush.</li>
            <li> Brush is nice and dense and soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve needed a good brush for a while and after watching several video&#x27;s on youtube..</li>
            <li> are top high quality brushes!</li>
            <li> blends much easier and better with this brush too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but his brush gives full coverage no matter the foundation .</li>
            <li> It really makes the liquid foundation look a lot better on your skin.</li>
            <li> I love it so much.</li>
            <li> She later wrote me and said that she loved it and it blended like a dream.</li>
            <li> I like it so much that I ordered two more....</li>
            <li> If you want a heavier/ full coverage foundation brush this is for you.</li>
            <li> I love that one just as much.</li>
            <li> I use it with a full coverage liquid foundation, dab it around and then go in circles to finish it off</li>
            <li> I will be ordering the full set soon.</li>
            <li> I was planning on getting the urban Decay Good Karma brush</li>
            <li> I was using the Real Techniques Sigma brush, but this brush is 100X better.</li>
            <li> I can not say enough good things about this brush.</li>
            <li> I wash it at least once a week for best results.</li>
            <li> gives you a Full Coverage</li>
            <li> It really does look more silky, well blended - no streaking.</li>
            <li> I like this brush - nice and soft and substantial.</li>
            <li> I am quite pleased with this brush &amp; I highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I really want to love this brush.</li>
            <li> This brush will turn whatever product youre using (foundation, concealer etc) into a full coverage product.</li>
            <li> It is extremely soft and blends nicely.</li>
            <li> I prefer this much type much more.  </li>
            <li> I am not even sure if its the real one.</li>
            <li> I am really upset with the way this brush has held up and neither sigma or amazon will give me a refund since it&#x27;s more then 30 days</li>
            <li> It was good and now the hair is falling out in big chunks.</li>
            <li> Not a bad price either.  </li>
            <li> Not a bad brush at all.</li>
            <li> love this brush so much so soft and dense!!!</li>
            <li> It cleans up very easy and the brush is very soft on your skin.  </li>
            <li> super soft an work amazing with liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> Very dense but smooth and cleans easily.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was super fast :)</li>
            <li> and it really looks flawless whereas my previous brush required a lot of</li>
            <li> It gives me an airbrushed look every time, and I&#x27;m able to use foundations that I&#x27;d previously written off because I couldn&#x27;t get them to look good after application.</li>
            <li> the brush is super soft and nicely constructed.</li>
            <li> It is super soft and works well leaving your skin tone looking even and nicely blended.</li>
            <li> Item arrived faster than expected, very soft and applies make up flawlessly.</li>
            <li> Works wonderful haven&#x27;t had literally one single hair fall out so soft</li>
            <li> I did notice a pretty strong chemical smell when I opened the package</li>
            <li> real hair brushes is where most of the shedding occurs, as I learnt from experience trying many different companies:)).</li>
            <li> For years I applied my foundation with sponges and while it always came out fine, it didn&#x27;t have that seamless, airbrushed quality that I saw on so many and always wanted.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s great for applying foundation and any other face product.</li>
            <li> but other then that i&#x27;m happy with it</li>
            <li> While I have experienced some shedding, it seemed to mostly be in the first few applications.  </li>
            <li> Its extremely high quality, super soft and dense to help the application of makeup go on amazingly!</li>
            <li> Love my new Signma Brush!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this brush to anyone looking for a new foundation brush!  :)</li>
            <li> The brush is incredible soft, does not shed (like other brushes I have) and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> This is seriously the best foundation brush i&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> I buffed out my foundation until it looked airbrushed and flawless, and it seriously took no time at all compared to trying to blend in foundation with my fingers.</li>
            <li> I cannot wait to receive my additional brushes and will most likely order more as I identify holes in my brush collection.</li>
            <li> Everybody should have this brush and should order it through amazon if you want it as quickly as I did.</li>
            <li> so there was a bit of a learning curve, but I quickly got the hang of it.</li>
            <li> It works super well stippling on liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> Super</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shed and blebds super well.</li>
            <li> I use this with my Mac studio fix fluid and it is amazing it makes my skin look so smooth.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different products and brushes but i LOVE this one.</li>
            <li> so glad I didnt buy the MAC brush which was more than double the price.  </li>
            <li> I love it for putting on my powder foundation, and to put on blush :) totally recommend it</li>
            <li> However, as much as I love my regular set, the Sigmax brushes are my favorite.  </li>
            <li> shipping was ridiculously quick.</li>
            <li> I love how it also included the monthly free gift brush that sigma provides from their direct</li>
            <li> Referring to the image above, it was such a perfect application of foundation!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this brush I can get enough of it...:-)  </li>
            <li> Just love it, only drawback is that I noticed a bristle or two popping out of the top when I received it.</li>
            <li> It is super dense, doesn&#x27;t absorb product and distributes evenly.</li>
            <li> It has quickly become a go to for me.</li>
            <li> This brush blends like magic, my foundation has never before blended so smoothly, I am so glad I finally made this purchase</li>
            <li> This brush is super dense.</li>
            <li> Luckily the Amazon store I bought it from offered me a refund, not a replacement because they don&#x27;t carry Sigma anymore</li>
            <li> and I am loyal to my state businesses.</li>
            <li> It looks smooth and more professional.</li>
            <li> It does put foundation on super even and smooth!&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> Loved this brush but within a few months the top seperate from the bottom.</li>
            <li> Sigma F80 isn&#x27;t just a brush, it&#x27;s a magic wand that erases all your facial imperfections :).</li>
            <li> and since I have Amazon Prime, I figured I would get the brush quickly if I ordered from here(and</li>
            <li> However, It did apply quickly without streaks.</li>
            <li> This foundation really gives great coverage and for just a short amount of swipes around the face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Rec&#x27;d this brush super quick and as described from Etailz.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve found that I can quickly build coverage in spots that need</li>
            <li> ordered my package on 11/17 and it arrived quickly on 11/20.</li>
            <li> Glad I did because I love it and don&#x27;t think I could ever go back to anything else!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying a lot more Sigma brushes in the future :)</li>
            <li> Quick shipment as well ...  </li>
            <li> Application is professional grade and is very easy.</li>
            <li> First, the Sigma Flat Top Kabuki brush is amazing as a foundation brush.  </li>
            <li> I bought this as it was highly recommended by most makeup artists.</li>
            <li> This brush was highly recommended in many YouTube videos.</li>
            <li> Ok I purchased this brush with high hope&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> (PS, I am a licensed cosmetologist &amp; I&#x27;ve used many brushes both high end &amp; lower end</li>
            <li> I started to notice that whenever I used it started to shed hairs, when I lightly picked at it the hairs would easily come right off, eventually the whole brush head came off.</li>
            <li> right away I loovee how my skin felt so clean</li>
            <li> After researching so many others I was impressed by the comments left by other customers!!  </li>
            <li> Overall I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>

            <li> I believe that this brush is the very reason my foundation is blending better, looking more natural.  </li>
            <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently purchased sigma kabuki brush #F80, F82 &amp; F84 - and so excited to make a this comment for these brushes, that are so amazing brushes</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft yet dense enough to really blend in the foundation flawlessly.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be bigger but very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought the Flat Top Kabuki brush and the angled blush brush and love both of them.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>

            <li> The fabulous ratings are absolutely correct!</li>
            <li> My very first pricey make up brush</li>
            <li> The shipping on this was super fast!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and cleans up very well with mild soap.</li>
            <li> This is a decent brush, its soft and dense and good for buffing in foundation, but the e.l.f powder brush is too and it&#x27;s 3 bucks...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so soft and makes my foundation glide on so easily!</li>
            <li> Sent this brush as a gift and not only did it arrive super fast, but the brush itself is amazing!</li>
            <li> Foundation looks natural and aplly easily!</li>
            <li> I have several high end brushes that I thought were great brushes until I tried this one -</li>
            <li> The brush hairs are so soft and make for such a smooth and damn near flawless application of foundation.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this Sigma flat top kabuki brush and it is a great brush to blend my foundation with.</li>
            <li> It deserves every single word of all the positive reviews , I&#x27;m over happy with this brush</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new foundation brush to cover better, so</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my new brush.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love my new Sigma Kabuki brush.</li>
            <li> My favorite new brush</li>
            <li> New favorite foundation blush.</li>
            <li> I live in Australia so the shipping arrived two days before the latest date</li>
            <li> It leaves a great airbrushed look and uses less foundation</li>
            <li> Another great thing about using this brush is that you use less product because of the even application.</li>
            <li> I use less makeup and gives me great coverage.</li>
            <li> had previously heard it was great for liquid foundation application and even saw makeup artists on YouTube using</li>
            <li> I find you get GREAT coverage with LESS product being used.</li>
            <li> First of all, I was pleased with how fast the product arrived.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very dense and makes application of foundation easy.</li>
            <li> Nice to the sight and to the touch, this is actually a professional brush, and that&#x27;s exactly the feel it</li>
            <li> Fast and easy transaction.  </li>
            <li> I will update my review and would love to give full stars if this gets fixed.</li>
            <li> Purchased many MAC brushes and these are just as good if not better.</li>
            <li> My next purchase will probably be the brush cleaning kit, so I make sure I don&#x27;t damage my new favorite brush!</li>
            <li> This brush feels incredibly soft on the skin, blends foundation beautifully, and does a good job getting around tough places (e.g., the nose).  </li>
            <li> It is very soft and my foundation looks so much better when applied by this brush.</li>
            <li> I have to say this was my favorite brush because it helped me achieved a very natural finish.</li>
            <li> Super soft and very dense, LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> The bursh comes with a card from the seller stating that if you write a review and follow their instructions (they did not say the review had to be positive), they would send you a free gift.</li>
            <li> Using the exact same foundation and only changing the brush, my makeup looks nearly flawless and using circular blending motions with the brush while applying the foundation gives you almost a photoshopped look.</li>
            <li> As a first timer this brush lets me feel that I&#x27;m a pro!</li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase more!</li>
            <li> I ordered my brush on Tuesday and Friday it was sitting pretty in my mailbox!</li>
            <li> I am definitely going to be purchasing more Sigma brushes!</li>

            <li> so make sure you have another brush to use while waiting for the Sigma F80 to dry :-)</li>
            <li> I went with Amazon b/c of the super fast, free shipping from Prime.  </li>
            <li> I also made sure to dry them the appropriate way</li>

            <li> Even if you are new to make up this will be super easy to use.</li>
            <li> As a Prime member, I received my brush in two days in perfect condition and I am positive it is a real Sigma product as it has all the markers other reviewers said a real brush should have.  </li>
            <li> I actually used this sort of like a stippling brush and the effect was AMAZING.  </li>

            <li> Have lost a few bristles, but it&#x27;s still in great condition.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a makeup guru but the final finish was amazing compared to the foundation brush from Clinique.</li>

            <li> Fabulous high quality brush!</li>

            <li> I really like the smooth finish</li>
            <li> Great brush for everyday use.</li>
            <li> It seemed to be glued together (cheaply made) for paying this price, i am very disatisfied.</li>
            <li> There are simply not  enough words to describe how amazing this brush is.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the money and</li>
            <li> This was worth the money.</li>

            <li> Not absolutely crazy about this product.</li>
            <li> This brush was 16$ compared to a 40$ brush from Mac and it is well worth  it.</li>

            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t say enough about this brush.</li>

            <li> I loved it so much and will use as soon as possible.</li>
            <li> I ordered F82 and F80 because of their incredible Amazon reviews; however, I must say the reviews were exaggerated - they&#x27;re just okay, not even close to my expectation.</li>
            <li> After using my fingers to apply foundation for many years, I was told to start using brushes in order to clear up my skin.  </li>
            <li> for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still very satisfied with this brush, I&#x27;ve been using it for a really long time almost every day to apply liquid foundation.</li>

            <li> I think but worth trying I guess</li>
            <li> I purchased my brush on Amazon from FRESH BOTANICA about 1 year ago.</li>
            <li> Anyone wondering if it&#x27;s worth the buy, I would buy it 10x&#x27;s over.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> you cannot tell the difference and for what I paid for it is so worth it.</li>
            <li> Well worth it and would buy again.</li>
            <li> Worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I use special solution for washing it and the brush dries super fast.</li>
            <li> The top part of the brush is very soft and goes on very gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li> It gives me a natural flawless finish on my foundation, causes me to use significantly less foundation, and gives me exactly the coverage I want and need.</li>
            <li> Excellent brush, just ordered the whole kit that includes the round kabuki, this flat top kabuki and angled kabuki.</li>
            <li> (I shape it and lay it on a sunny windowsill to dry) but it looks as good as new - the white tips are still perfect white.</li>
            <li> Love the Kabuki--is much softer than my BE flat top brush.</li>
            <li> I have used several flat top kabuki brushes that I loved and I heard about this one and figured I would give it a whirl.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever gotten such a flawless finish before, using other brushes or sponges.</li>
            <li> best brush to use to get the airbrush effect on my face, tried other brush and never get the same result!</li>
            <li> Best purchase seriously!</li>
            <li> The flat kabuki is soft and work great.</li>
            <li> plus I got it super fast!</li>
            <li> Plus super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> It came super fast when I ordered it!</li>
            <li> I lost my first one while traveling and quickly ordered another one.</li>
            <li> I get full coverage with only a little bit of foundation and it blends everything perfectly!</li>
            <li> With good care, I am confident it will last me for a long time and be well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It cleans up nicely and seems to dry quickly.  </li>
            <li> I clean with face cleanser (to remove the make up) or light shampoo (to keep the fibers conditioned and not dried out).</li>
            <li> Amazing flat kabuki brush.</li>
            <li> first was delivery 10 day earlier than the one expected, its a excellent merchandise.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d heard many people raving about this brush on youtube makeup channels and on the web in general, so I finally decided to purchase one of my own.</li>
            <li> really want people to know they are a friendly, helpful company until you have problems.</li>
            <li> waiting a long time to invest in this brush but love it!</li>
            <li> no stray bristles, was unfamiliar with the brand as all my other brushes are MAC,am delighted that it is so well made.</li>
            <li> you want to feel good about yourself for having all Mac brushes, or some other snooty brand, go for it.  </li>
            <li> The handle is a nice weight, the brush stays intact after washing with every single use, and the ends are super soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> wow this brush is my new favorite tool!</li>
            <li> I am very please with this brush and it has high quality written all over it from top to bottom - the handle, the silver ferrule and of course, the hair filaments.</li>
            <li> I am very please with this brush and it has high quality written all over it from top to bottom - the handle, the silver ferrule and of course, the hair filaments.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a high quality product at a good price considering it will last forever instead of having to repurchase $10 brushes that do have the job.</li>
            <li> The reviews were right.</li>
            <li> The price is RIGHT</li>
            <li> It is just the right size.</li>
            <li> It blends, and smoothes my skin just right.</li>
            <li> I had to try it right away.</li>
            <li> , I could never figure out why it never looked right...</li>
            <li> I use MAC Selectint right now and feel with this brush</li>
            <li> and even then it still wouldn&#x27;t look right.</li>
            <li> I had this brush for 6 months and it fell apart and with the amazon receipt they replaced it right away</li>
            <li> So the packaging on this was just right.</li>
            <li> really right...</li>
            <li> When I had received my sigma F80, the handle came off right away.</li>
            <li> just right.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even get to try mine out because it was shedding bristles everywhere right out of the package.</li>
            <li> They were right.</li>
            <li> I bought this one right after I got my Shiseido 113 foundation brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The bristles don&#x27;t fall out and it picks up the right amount of product</li>
            <li> and I wanted to review it right away,</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this one, and my decision was right.</li>
            <li> Right off d bat</li>
            <li> This leaves just the right amount of foundation on to leave you looking polished.</li>
            <li> The brushes handle is just right.</li>
            <li> The bristles and ferrule remained in the plastic sleeve, but the handle just came right off while I was trying to take the brush out of the sleeve.</li>
            <li> turns out all I needed was the right tool.</li>
            <li> hence I got to have the right tools</li>
            <li> Right after I use it I find bristles on my face and even looking at the brush</li>
            <li> and everyone was absolutly right about this product.</li>
            <li> It holds just the right about of product and distributes it evenly.</li>
            <li> I had a few bristles come out the first time I used it, but after a cleaning it was great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for light application of powders, but for any sort of MATTE look, the 187 is not a good choice.</li>
            <li> No matter how much baby shampoo I use to clean it, the stain is still there.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is NOW and will be forever my favorite foundation brush, the bristles are super duper soft and dense, can be used to apply primer, foundation (liquid or powder), tinted moisturizer or anything you want to put on your face really.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super soft and super dense!</li>
            <li> When this product first arrived I couldn&#x27;t stop touching the bristles - they are so incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> It is very soft to the skin and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is very soft and the handle seems strong.</li>
            <li> but finaly I broke down and got one now for sure I&#x27;m going to be buying the rest of the brushes:)</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush for several weeks and it is the best brush for foundation, hands down.  </li>
            <li> My foundation lays down better and looks more natural...even application.</li>
            <li> The synthetic hairs in this brush are extremely packed, dense, soft, and full which are all great things about this brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying a new one because I love it so much.</li>
            <li> I love my new brush, it arrived fast.  </li>
            <li> I really recommend this brush to anyone, specially if your looking for that airbrush</li>
            <li> First of all, shipping was super fast!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft, yet dense enough for good application.</li>
            <li> First of all I got it shipped super fast before the expected delivery date, so that was good.</li>
            <li> I like this brush better than any of my MAC of Bare Escentuals brushes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also incredibly affordable in terms of quality, especially when living in Australia, where I often find difficult to get a hold of good quality brushes which are not exorbitant in cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is my first Sigma brush and it was definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best brush i have used even better than they department stores expensive ones.</li>
            <li> It is so dense and fluffy and amazing!  </li>
            <li> I am a fan of a matte, full coverage finish, which is why the F80 really appealed to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is so soft and smooth, and produce such a nice finish.</li>
            <li> I Use this with MAC BB cream, which can be quite thick, after stippling and blending with this brush it finishes to a beautiful skin-like texture</li>
            <li> Soft, nice and professional brush!</li>
            <li> Traditional Kabuki F80 had tightly bound bristles for flawless finish.</li>
            <li> This is primarily because I suffer from severely sensitive, dry, dehydrated skin, and eczema, which is easily irritated by most all makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> Hugs &amp; xxx to My little sister from hawaii who recommended this fantastic brush to me!  :-)</li>
            <li> High quality brush bought it as a backup for the one on the full kit for my makeup artist friend and she says that it is worth the price</li>
            <li> to blend better than other sigma brushes its just easy to use</li>
            <li> Overall the brush is great and it doesnt fall apart like other cheap brushes.</li>
            <li> Easy to hold handle is not too long, just right to fit in your hand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super happy with it, and expect it to last a very long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping is super fast and the brush is well packaged.</li>
            <li> I only wished that the shipping was free or there was an offer to have free shipping since the cost for shipping for a product that is $16 was $6.</li>
            <li> THE SHIPPING WAS SUPER FAST</li>
            <li> It came super fast also.</li>
            <li> All brushes that I Oder are soft, easily can take your eye-shadow or any pigment.</li>
            <li> :) it was a great buy and if your hesitant on buying it cause it&#x27;s a bit expensive</li>
            <li> is so soft, dense and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It covers up the scars and blemishes easily and leaves my face looking clear and gives it an airbrushed effect.</li>
            <li> Good brush, but the handle broke in less than a year</li>
            <li> I have owned many different types of makeup brushes and Sigma wins out of all of them.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping was super fast, too.</li>
            <li> I am Sigma and Morphe brush loyal thanks to these products.</li>
            <li> but overall great brush and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> it is soo soft and makes application of liquid foundation soo easy.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite foundation brush... it blends very well.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this brush directly from Sigma several months ago and absolutely loved it</li>
            <li> but in my opinion if you want great quality brushes that&#x27;ll last you for quiet some time than sigma is the way to go.</li>
            <li> Fantastic brush and makes coverage application smooth, especially stipling.</li>
            <li> The hairs are so soft and delicate and hold up wonderfully during washes!</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and dense, so your makeup goes on easily.</li>
            <li> I also started recently using an amazing skin vitamin serum that really make my complexion glow: I have found that combining this mask with [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It gives me good coverage yet goes on lightly enough so that my face looks natural.</li>
            <li> Very soft, and smooth against the skin.</li>
            <li> They are very soft, making makeup application smooth.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27; am very surprised about the quality of these brushes in a very reasonable price &amp; yet its so smooth in the skin while applying it plus NO shredding.  </li>
            <li> the brush came in a beautiful red sheer bag, very well packed with brush protector and a guide on what the name of the brush is and what it is used for.  </li>
            <li> it gives such you such a flawless look, I have no regrets about buying it.</li>
            <li> It cuts application time in half, leaves a beautiful, natural look</li>
            <li> Shipped super fast and exactly like the picture</li>
            <li> Once you use this it&#x27;s easy to tell that this brush was beautifully made, unfortunately now I want all the sigma brushes and</li>
            <li> Very smooth, with no left over streaks.</li>
            <li> They came in very fast.</li>
            <li> Also the shipping for this product was very fast.</li>
            <li> I am very much a bargain hunter</li>
            <li> i like it very much</li>
            <li> I received my brush today- shipping was very fast.  </li>
            <li> The brush is so fine and so soft that you end up with an air-brushed look.</li>
            <li> All my other cheap brushes are better quality.</li>
            <li> I have used foundation brushes before and found that the traditional ones leave streaks &amp; other kabukis use too make foundation but with this brush I can blend brilliantly.</li>
            <li> Originally this brush had such a smooth application, but now I get a bristle or two each time I apply my foundation on.</li>
            <li> I am so excited with my new brush.</li>
            <li> As for washing, i was pleased to unexpectedly recieve instructions on how to wash this particular brush and how it can be used...</li>
            <li> And while that is true to some degree, you don&#x27;t have to spend $40+ on high end foundation.</li>
            <li> It applies makeup so nicely and gives an air brushed look I HIGHLY recommend the Sigma f80.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s not crazy high, I&#x27;m just frugal), but it&#x27;s definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> but the first time I used it the bristles started falling out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a novice, just watched my first tutorial and decided to try this brush with my mac prolong wear foundation.</li>
            <li> I watched my favorite YouTubers use this brush and finally, after all 3 of my ladies said yeah to this, to get.</li>
            <li> When I first received it I couldn&#x27;t help but keep running it along my face.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> ok so im starting to do makeup</li>
            <li> the brush was not expensive at all.</li>
            <li> So glad I only purchased one!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not fake the seller is listed on sigma website as amazon aouthoriser.</li>
            <li> Im mostly using the beauty blender for simple looks.</li>
            <li> I had been wanting this for quite some time, and am so glad I finally have it!</li>
            <li> This was my first high-quality makeup brush purchase</li>
            <li> I thought that by buying a expensive brush like Mac I would have the best quality.</li>
            <li> I actually can&#x27;t describe my love of this brush.</li>
            <li> Thanks Sigma!</li>
            <li> anything really!</li>
            <li> and i tried it out for the first time</li>
            <li> THIS WAS MY FIRST SIGMA PURCHASE</li>
            <li> AND I WILL BE SHOPPING WITH THEM AGAIN VERY SOON!</li>
            <li> I purchased the F82 last week and fell in love and had to get this one</li>
            <li> This was my first experience using a brush for foundation</li>
            <li> My Brush shipped SO FAST!</li>
            <li> I tried this for the first time today....</li>
            <li> For the first six months.</li>
            <li> Once again, Sigma has not upset me yet with their products, thanks Sigma!</li>
            <li> Would recommend for anyone interested in buying this brush.</li>
            <li> This is my first sigma brush purchase</li>
            <li> Oh and they ship fast!</li>
            <li> This is my first Sigma brush, and I can&#x27;t wait to buy more!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really like this brush!</li>
            <li> This is the first brush I&#x27;ve ever used for foundation</li>
            <li> and the brush came well protected in a cute red bag</li>
            <li> This is the first time I used a sigma brush</li>
            <li> This brush arrived on time and is exactly as pictured.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was also pretty faster than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> It shipped so fast too!</li>
            <li> I love how the brush has just enough dense to it.</li>
            <li> I USED THIS BRUSH FOR THE FIRST TIME TODAY.</li>
            <li> First time I have ever used a foundation brush.</li>
            <li> The shipping was exact</li>
            <li> It really makes a difference!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s started losing bristles and then when I went to wash it today, the whole head of bristles pulled out of the handle!  </li>
            <li> It absolutely did!</li>
            <li> I love it and will definitely be recommending it to my friends...</li>
            <li> I will definitely repurchase more Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> I used this brush Saturday for the first time</li>
            <li> This brush blends liquid makeup so naturally and smoothly.</li>
            <li> You will definately see the difference the first time you use it.</li>
            <li> but my problem is that I tend to use more product to achieve a medium coverage with the beauty blender because the damp sponge sheer the foundation</li>
            <li> I hope to purchase more in the future!</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell which is which, so my guess is that this is authentic since they&#x27;re exactly the same.</li>
            <li> This was the first Sigma brush I purchased.</li>
            <li> The shipping is SOO fast too!</li>
            <li> I got butterflies in my stomach when I first used it</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, one of the bristles popped out as longer than the others, and I can&#x27;t even pull it out.</li>
            <li> So ridiculously soft and glides on smooth.</li>
            <li> better than any traditional foundation brushes!easy,fast to apply.get</li>
            <li> It works perfect for my liquid foundation and powder, It glides on my foundation and doesn&#x27;t make my foundation look weird after wards.</li>
            <li> I love this brush, it only problem i had with it was that when I got it in the mail, some of the Brussels were sticking out.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush!</li>
            <li> This is my first time doing my foundation with this brush instead of my hands or sponge, and I have to say it does make a difference.</li>
            <li> This was the first brush i have purchased from Sigma</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this brush so far.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I just used this brush for the first time today</li>
            <li> I didnt know a brush could help my makeup so much!</li>
            <li> I am pleased that I ordered it outside the set.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> so I believe it&#x27;s not a fake one.</li>
            <li> The packaging was also sketchy with just a piece of plastic that appears pretty cheap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My first time to buy Sigma brush</li>
            <li> , that is exactly why I had bought it.</li>
            <li> I use it all the time and it makes my makeup come out exactly how I want.</li>
            <li> This is my first foundation brush, so it may be that brushes are not for me.</li>
            <li> So sad that Sigma is not like amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon you are all doing a wonderful job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but this actually works way better.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!  </li>
            <li> From now on only going to buy thus brand :)</li>
            <li> I really like the quality of this brush!</li>
            <li> I have never been interested in using makeup brushes before I bought this one.</li>
            <li> Will look at more sigma brushes in the future.</li>
            <li> All joking aside, I love this brush, would recommend this brush to anyone and have on several occasions.</li>
            <li> I received this order exactly on time, no issues.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and your foundation goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t be more specific as I am not the one who uses it, but my friend recommends it fully.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve used a brush to apply my makeup.  </li>
            <li> First of all, I purchased it from Etailz, one of the Sigma approved Amazon retailers.  </li>
            <li> but I most definitely noticed a difference between the application with the E.L.F brush and this one -</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I have been wanting in a foundation brush.</li>
            <li> It drops the hair since the first time I used it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Now I expect this from $3 elf brushes, but Sigma isn&#x27;t exactly that cheap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only difference I saw was that this one was more dense.  </li>
            <li> Now when I do my makeup, I feel like it isn&#x27;t complete until I use this to smooth it out.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to replace most of my Mac brushed with Sigmas!!!</li>
            <li> When purchasing a product from a reputable site like amazon, I would expect they hold their sellers to a higher standard.</li>
            <li> It is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> and I recommend it to anybody interested in buying it.</li>
            <li> The shipping was so fast too!</li>
            <li> Thanks Sigma!</li>
            <li> Oh, but I intend to get the travel set next time, :-).</li>
            <li> brush is REALLY dense though!</li>
            <li> Extremely fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Makes for much easier application!</li>
            <li> I did not return it simply because I LOVE this brush</li>
            <li> I had been wanting to try Sigma brushes for a while, so I figured that this one was affordable, especially since I use my stippling brush the most.</li>
            <li> Next time I want to try a more &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; makeup brush</li>
            <li> Works pretty well.</li>
            <li> (I seen alot of reviews that said it brakes.&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li> I have several Sigma brushes that have lasted for a couple of years after many washings.</li>
            <li> this is my first brush from sigma.</li>
            <li> i will be trying more sigma brushes in the future.</li>
            <li> I look forward to puchasing more brushes in the future.  </li>
            <li> I first saw reviews about it on YouTube</li>
            <li> This is my first Sigma brush ever.</li>
            <li> Another thing i love about this brush is that it doesnt leave any lines on your face so you don&#x27;t have to do extra blending.</li>
            <li> I love this brush and at this price will only purchase Sigma brushes from now on.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am satisfied and I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more Sigma brushes in the future!</li>
            <li> The brush is so soft and it distributes the makeup so smoothly and even.</li>
            <li> This was the first brush I have purchased from Sigma.</li>
            <li> I love this brush and use it daily to apply my foundation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the first one I&#x27;ve had of this type, but I&#x27;ve had it for what feels like a year now or so</li>
            <li> fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> When I went to wash my brush for the first time all the hairs came out of the brush.</li>
            <li> This is my first makeup brush to use for the stippling technique.  </li>
            <li> This definitely blends and feels better.</li>
            <li> I will probably use the brush for most of my face and use the beauty blender for under the eye area to apply concealer or if I am using two different foundation colors I may use one with the brush and one with the blender.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more brushes from sigma.</li>
            <li> I definitely will be buying more.</li>
            <li> The lenght of the handle is perfect and it comes with a protective plastic sleeve so that it doesn&#x27;t get weird</li>
            <li> The metal and wood parts came unglued and fell apart within the first three weeks of use.</li>
            <li> These is not the first time i pay it i like it</li>
            <li> Very pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll be looking at more from this brand in the future.</li>
            <li> how much difference it makes!</li>
            <li> Gives a smooth finish to your liquid foundation, and SOFT.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more brushes from Sigma in the future.</li>
            <li> Most big time makeup artists on youtube have this reaction as well (see video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;jltoL58UlE8).</li>
            <li> This is really what I was looking for!  </li>
            <li> I just want to first say when I apply my foundation I just use my fingers</li>
            <li> First let me just say this, once you have used the Sigma F80 you will never want to use anything else to put your foundation on.</li>
            <li> And I should mention that it is real!</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase from Sigma, let me tell you...</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to buy more sigma brushes in the future.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush thru the actual Sigma site, and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I also use it to pat in concealer for blemishes and under eye highlight ;)  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever used a brush for applying foundation</li>
            <li> I first heard about it on YouTube and saw tons</li>
            <li> Several members in my favorite make-up forum raved about this brush and assured me I would have zero complaints.  </li>
            <li> It holds up to some of the higher end brushes I have.</li>
            <li> I feel like others similar are better</li>
            <li> So glad I finally bought a Sigma brush!</li>
            <li> This brush is my first sigma brush I purchased.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the only way you&#x27;ll know you&#x27;re buying an authentic product.</li>
            <li> The brush really makes a difference  in how your makeup looks!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what everyone says.  </li>
            <li> It is my first sigma brush</li>
            <li> short, love Sigma brushes ,but I wouldn&#x27;t order from this seller.</li>
            <li> This is my first foundation brush, I used to apply my foundation with my fingers but decided to give the brush a go.</li>
            <li> This is way better than the one I bought from MAC that is similar !  </li>
            <li> I have to say I love both brushes equally.</li>
            <li> A smooth brush that blends the foundation and keep it natural on your face.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll always re-order this in the future :)</li>
            <li> recommend using a Moisturizer or Primer before you begin with your makeup with this brush, I feel like it gives it a bit more of a glow in your face, especially if you wanna seem Tan in the summer!&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was my first try with a brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll most definitely purchase Sigma brushes again.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t washed it yet  though.</li>
            <li> but it is pretty legit</li>
            <li> The brush is just okay, definitely wouldn&#x27;t pay another $20 for this.</li>
            <li> I knew exactly what brush I wanted</li>
            <li> This is my first one.</li>
            <li> This was my first Sigma brush</li>
            <li> This brush really lives up to its hype!</li>
            <li> It is my first one</li>
            <li> Nice, just as expected.</li>
            <li> This is my first brush</li>
            <li> so I finally decided to purchase one myself and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> Thanks Sigma!</li>
            <li> I will recommend to everyone and will order more similar products immediately!</li>
            <li> I washed it the first day I got it</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more Sigma brushes as the quality is just unparalleled.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not nearly as expensive as department store brushes...</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying a Sigma makeup brush</li>
            <li> ANYMORE FIRST</li>
            <li> They are in good condition after 2 years of everyday wear.  </li>
            <li> Kinda heavy which for me means good quality.</li>
            <li> Not only does the brush make applying foundation easier and faster, it is also really soft, durable and easy to clean!  </li>
            <li> brush is super soft, yet firm enough for perfect application.</li>
            <li> i love my f80 flat top kabuki brush, is amazingly soft and very well made the shipping was fast</li>
            <li> At first I was thinking to buy the Everyday Minerals flat top brush, but after I saw tons of good reviews of this Sigma F80 on Youtube.</li>
            <li> Definitely better than my previous cheap brushes.</li>
            <li> Was really amazing at first, and then after only three washes the bristles fell out and was COMPLETELY beyond ruined!</li>
            <li> I have read great reviews on this product so I am anxious to see if I like it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Sephora #55 airbrush, until I recently ordered the Sigma F80 after reading so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li> It really does apply foundation smoothly and it&#x27;s so soft!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a flat top kabuki</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s cross our fingers and hope it&#x27;s true because I swear that it will make us gern-o-phobes excited to see our brushes will be drying  a lot faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This  is a great flat kabuki brush and has lasted a long time.  </li>
            <li> Sigma F80 Flat Top Synthetic Kabuki- Brush was shipped super fast, delivered before estimated date and very well packaged.</li>
            <li> Great brush to finish makeup, either foundation or loose powder, also works well with solid mineral foundation powder, quality product</li>
            <li> This brush is just as good as many of the more expensive brushed from Bobbi Brown, Lancôme etc.</li>
            <li> I would certainly come back to Sigma when I need more makeup brushes.</li>

            <li> B003UH0528 Sigma Beauty Flat Top Synthetic Kabuki - F80]]</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush after searching reviews for a flat top applicator for foundations and blushes.</li>
            <li> First, the shipping was fast and the brush came well protected and in a cute red bag.  </li>
            <li> and I was so excited I tore off the package like a wild woman.</li>

            <li> My Sigma F80 Flat Top Kabuki arrived within a week of ordering on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t have any other use for this brush besides buffing in my foundation.</li>

            <li> B003UH0528 Sigma Beauty Flat Top Synthetic Kabuki - F80]]</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even compare to the other foundation brushes I own.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the Sigma F80 Flat Top Kabuki brush from the Sigmax collection.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Sigma Beauty Flat Top F80 brush for about a week to apply foundation on my face.  </li>
            <li> this is a really nice brush with long lasting smooth finish.easy to blend and doesn&#x27;t take a lot of foundation</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this flat kabuki brush for about three years (maybe more) now and it still works well.</li>
            <li> The flat top makes all the difference when blending liquid foundation</li>
            <li> I like other sigma brushes I own</li>
            <li> I just received my Sigma F80 Flat Top Kabuki brush in the mail.  </li>
            <li> Before receiving this brush I used a flat top powder brush from e.l.f.</li>
            <li> B003UH0528 Sigma Beauty Flat Top Synthetic Kabuki - F80]]</li>
            <li> I first loved this brush but after the second time I washed it, the entire brush head came out.  </li>
            <li> I decided to purchase the Flat top kabuki.....</li>
            <li> B003UH0528 Sigma Beauty Flat Top Synthetic Kabuki - F80]]</li>
            <li> I love the flat kabuki.</li>
            <li> I read about using the Sigma Flat Top Kabuki makeup brush to apply liquid makeup and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I have held it up and compared the flat top with others like it I owned and there is no comparison.  </li>
            <li> but the sigma flat kabuki is so much better for my foundation..</li>
            <li> This review is for the Sigma Beauty Flat Top Synthetic Kabuki - F80 makeup brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I also use Sonia Kashuk Synthetic Flat Brush and also love it for foundation application.</li>
            <li> This flat top kabuki brush works so well with liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently fallen in love with sigma brushes in general; they are great quality at like half the cost of MAC brushes.</li>
            <li> I love this brush, it is the best out of all brushes, it is very dense and flat, and you can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> The brush did a great job, but breaking like that is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Gives a clean natural finish to your liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> They do not come clean completely.</li>
            <li> I love how my base looks like it has been airbrushed on, a really great brush!  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love Sigma brushes, they are of the highest quality, for such a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;they are so dense that they don&#x27;t waste product and the fibers are shorter to get a more precise application.</li>
            <li> AI understand that the products may cost more in the stores, but at least you get a better guarantee.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a good quality brush that should last a while if you take care of it.</li>
            <li> The handle of the brush is very sturdy and because its thick, you get great control during use.</li>
            <li> and i love the whole entire kit and one thing about washing the brush</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t really satisfied with the results since I have a sensitive skin and the brush bristles wasn&#x27;t that soft on my skin.</li>
            <li> Cleaning the brush is very easy too, and it dries faster than I expected</li>
            <li> I have had the Sigma Flat Top Kabuki brush for a few months now and I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> But other than the cleaning problem the F80 brush is totally worth it!!!</li>
            <li> Does not shed very much, and it applies my foundation very evenly.</li>
            <li> They cost less and are better quality!</li>
            <li> The brush doesnt shed one bit and it is super soft!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a super soft brush!</li>
            <li> The brush is super soft!</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and it was so soft!</li>
            <li> It can be somewhat difficult to get completely clean using regular brush cleaner or baby shampoo, I&#x27;ve been using Dawn dish detergent to clean it and it works great (and quickly).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super soft and it doesn&#x27;t shed, which is why I bought it in the first place.</li>
            <li> This brush is everything that the positive reviews said it was.</li>
            <li> After reading the positive reviews on Amazon, I decided to try this for myself.</li>
            <li> This brush is literally the best foundation brush I have ever used, it has a sleek black handle with Sigma&#x27;s logo and a description of the brush name going down the side.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> As soon as I gave this a few test runs, I ordered the round top kabuki, that&#x27;s how great it is.  </li>
            <li> I use it pretty much every day and don&#x27;t regret my purchase.</li>
            <li> everyday I get more surprised and satisfied with SIGMA&#x27;s brushes.</li>
            <li> My first high end make up brush!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first because of how much the shipping cost</li>
            <li> From now on Sigma&#x27;s brushes are pretty much all I will ever need.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take long to get my order and so far I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found and the hairs stay in place for a long time through many washes.</li>
            <li> I thought that was pretty reasonable</li>
            <li> You can use it to do pretty much anything that you want in the face</li>
            <li> Hope to have it for a long time, will be buying more from Sigma and Amazon</li>
            <li> and I love the long handle.</li>
            <li> Before I used it I made sure to wash the brush and when I did so, some minor shedding occurred.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t really see the hype, but then again I&#x27;d never used a brush to apply foundation before</li>
            <li> I never realized brushes really do much that much of a difference!</li>
            <li> I have been using it with the bare minerals foundation and it does a fantastic job applying it.</li>
            <li> No fallout yet which is awesome as I have used it a lot and with cheap brushes it would all ready be bad.</li>
            <li> I can literally put a pea size amount on this brush and it covers my whole face with product, thanks to the brush!</li>
            <li> I have used a few different foundation brushes but this brush by far is the best.</li>
            <li> The quality is as good if not better than my $40 MAC brushes.</li>
            <li> Its so soft and dense and gives me full coverage with my liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> It makes my foundation look more natural and even and is soft and gentle on my face.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how I felt about Sigma as a brand after I had reviewed their RIDICULOUSLY PRICED &amp;#34;brush cleaning mit.&amp;#34; However, this had been recommended by so many, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li> This brush is exactly what I was looking for, super soft and really dense.</li>
            <li> If you want high quality brushes that are comparable or better than MAC brushes, definitely go with Sigma!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Anyone who is nervous about trying a brush for the first time or just interested in purchasing this, I highly, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have other high end brushes but this one is my favorite!</li>
            <li> I have read so many reviews of sigma brushes, and everyone raves about the high quality and lasting power of this brush.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely go back to Sigma for more high quality brushes.</li>
            <li> I love this brush and wish I discovered it a long time ago!</li>
            <li> super soft brush that holds together</li>
            <li> The short and dense bristles make it so easy to buff your liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> THE BRUSH ITSELF IS SUPER SOFT</li>
            <li> The brush is super soft and dense.</li>
            <li> The brush is super soft and I have not had any problems with shedding.  </li>
            <li> It is super dense yet so soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> Also, the color of my foundation came off easily and the brush looked white on the tips again.</li>
            <li> The short and dense bristles make it easy to buff your liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to everyone looking for an easy way to apply and blend their foundation.</li>
            <li> I love the brush, but I&#x27;m deducting a star simply because it&#x27;s such a pain to clean.</li>
            <li> The brush is super soft.</li>
            <li> It does not leave streaks, it spreads the product evenly, and the bristles are super soft.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s super soft.</li>
            <li> It is super soft and leaves an airbrushed effect to my foundation when done applying..</li>
            <li> It takes 24 hours to fully dry, and I make sure to stand it up ON</li>
            <li> My daughter ordered this first and raved about it so after a few months I bought my own</li>
            <li> After watching lots of video reviews for it on youtube and reading all the great reviews on Makeupalley, I finally broke down and bought it.</li>
            <li> It certainly gives you an airbrush finish</li>
            <li> I do believe I will certainly be sticking to your sigma products and want to try your collections.  </li>
            <li> reference, I have comination skin with large pores which I think is why the brush just doesn&#x27;t work for me...</li>
            <li> Received this brush yesterday along with the F30 large powder brush, E40 tapered blending brush and E20 beauty blending brush.</li>
            <li> I certainly don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> If you have large pores, this may not be what you want.  </li>
            <li> so I can be positive that it&#x27;s the real thing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and gentle with the skin, and it&#x27;s the first one I felt like it was worth bying.</li>
            <li> I love the flat top vs the round top personally.</li>
            <li> The shipping was so fast, and I was so excited that I took off my make up just to try this brush, and I have no regrets!</li>
            <li> The Sigma F80  Flat top brush  is better than any other makeup brush out there.</li>
            <li> The bristles are so soft and full and really blend makeup very well.</li>
            <li> Recently, I&#x27;ve begun using a new make-up (Jane Iredale) and in doing some pre-purchase research, I read so many glowing reviews of this brush that I decided to try it myself.  </li>
            <li> This brush is great for applying foundation, wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> This brush provides really good coverage, lets you use less of your foundation, and is really amazingly soft.  </li>
            <li> It is super soft, but very dense.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I live in Brazil and my brush arrived at the right time.</li>
            <li> This was my first Sigma brush and well, they have a new follower!</li>
            <li> Overall I highly recommend this brush, If I I could only buy one sigma brush this would be the one.&lt;br /&gt;In comparison to the beauty blender I feel this brush leave a more &amp;#34;full coverage look&amp;#34;  whereas the beauty blender is more natural.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting such a great quality brush for the price since I have paid more for a lesser quality in the past.</li>
            <li> The brush is dense enough so that stippling is a breeze, so much better than the Mac stippling brush which is very soft for that purpose.</li>
            <li> No bristles lost (by the way, this is usually the case for most synthetic brushes so this isn&#x27;t something unique about this brush...</li>
            <li> This is the first sigma brush I ever ordered but wish I had waited until I got this one and used it more before purchasing the other Sigma brushes that I did.</li>
            <li> I looked at this brush for months before getting it because it is more than I usually spend on brushes, but it is sooooooo worth it!</li>
            <li> and it pushes the product into the skin so it doesn&#x27;t sit on the surface further accentuating fine lines.</li>
            <li> First try with this particular brush.</li>
            <li> My wife speaks very highly of this brush.</li>
            <li> I find it very high end</li>
            <li> Very soft and just the right size.</li>
            <li> It also comes with a handy cover and little mesh carrying case.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s retained its shape but beware its pretty densely packed (hence good coverage) making it a bit difficult to clean.</li>
            <li> and I thought this would be a good brush, but when I got it, it was hard to take the plastic off</li>
            <li> I love my new Sigma Flat kabuki brush-F80.</li>
            <li> This brush had a dink on the handle due to super light packaging.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this brush got it last year for christmas and used it everyday til this day blends foundation beautifully.</li>
            <li> This brush feels amazing, applies foundation evenly and the hairs shed very little( just 3 or 4 the first time I used it).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small enough to offer great control of foundation application and is super soft with no fall out!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s reasonable for an upset customer wonder where those amazing compliments on Sigma Brushes came from; the answer possibly was related to a note in my package - it said that I will get a free gift if I left feedback on Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just started getting into this whole make-up thing with baby steps and just using light foundation, this is definitely a brush I would recommend again.</li>
            <li> So after trying a few I finally tried MAC studio fix which works great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it with a few different consistencies of foundation and they all have come out great with this brush.</li>
            <li> I expected this to be top quality because I paid 24 bucks for it</li>
            <li> Really Bummed</li>
            <li> Came fast in the mail also.</li>
            <li> works well for buffing in my foundation since it is a really dense.</li>
            <li> I heard about this brush so much that I had to get my hands on it</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing from the real Sigma beauty website  and make a comparison.</li>
            <li> Always wondered is they really worked.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush.</li>
            <li> and i HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the brush!</li>
            <li> Also the price is really affordable.</li>
            <li> I had an event to go to and were getting ready at her house.</li>
            <li> you can really tell the difference in my makeup.</li>
            <li> Is this a real sigma brush?</li>
            <li> Delivery was very prompt, as well.</li>
            <li> I use it on days when I don&#x27;t feel like using my real techniques brush.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> Thanks Sigma I will be buying again</li>
            <li> It drys really fast for me.</li>
            <li> Very dense&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not very big&lt;br /&gt;Great for buffing&lt;br /&gt;Hard</li>
            <li> and I absolutely had to have this brush.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing again very soon.</li>
            <li> so much becuase</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very synthetic and compact.</li>
            <li> and I really like the results.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> This doesnt eat ALL your foundation as fast as a sponge would.</li>
            <li> I expected a much better product from sigma.</li>
            <li> I would wash it by putting some of my face cleanser and gently swishing it in my palm.</li>
            <li> I like it so much that I ordered the F84 and F82.</li>
            <li> it real?</li>
            <li> Bought 2 Sigma F80 brushes and they really deliver.</li>
            <li> Very dense and allows it to apply foundation</li>
            <li> but with this brush I apply as much product and avoid looking cakey.</li>
            <li> she does makeup vids and is real unlike a lot of sponsored people on there.</li>
            <li> very velvety feeling.</li>
            <li> I have tried several brushes before and none of them have given me this fabulous air-brushed look.</li>
            <li> The price is really reasonable</li>
            <li> I used this brush to apply my liquid foundation, powder foundation, my blush or even bronzer, its very versatile.</li>
            <li> and I find it is so much quicker to apply my foundation with the sigma F80.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really dense and boy</li>
            <li> I did this part way through the day at work to freshen up and was very</li>
            <li> My girlfriends, my fiance and even my very \\&quot;man&#x27;s man\\</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very dense, which applies a very even layer of foundation.</li>
            <li> The look is very buffed in, rather than cakey or streaked.</li>
            <li> In which I realized how wonderful job my Chanel brush did - it gently breezed on your face and makeup was evenly and looked so natural (my friends were confused whether I wore makeup or not)!</li>
            <li> I was worried about paying so much for a brush</li>
            <li> The price is worth it by far.</li>
            <li> It goes on evenly without using too much product and looks like it&#x27;s been airbrushed.  </li>
            <li> The sponge soaks up too much foundation that the brush keeps on my face.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very dense, which then creates that airbrushed look that we all want to achieve.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Sigma.</li>
            <li> Makes the makeup much prettier.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, too.</li>
            <li> (But really 14 for a shipment which really is contradictory)but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really just the 14 for the shipment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> The whole Sigma thing is just a hype.</li>
            <li> I highly highly highly recommend this product !</li>
            <li> Not only did my face looked smooth</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> The brush is very dense.</li>
            <li> It blends foundation like a dream and doesn&#x27;t absorb foundation much at all.</li>
            <li> its not the real product</li>
            <li> Changes my makeup routine so much</li>
            <li> About absorbing a lot of product I don&#x27;t think this brush does that.</li>
            <li> Thanks to this brush</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> yet it&#x27;s very dense.</li>
            <li> It buffs foundation or cream blushes really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It blends my foundation really well</li>
            <li> Absolutely adore it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but really, they weren&#x27;t even an option.</li>
            <li> I want to rub this over my face all the time haha.</li>
            <li> Fast shippment.</li>
            <li> For the price, I had expected more.</li>
            <li> I also got the brush fast.</li>
            <li> There are no lines it blends the cream very evenly</li>
            <li> use this with Makeup Forever HD Foundation and it goes on really well, no shedding at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very grateful about the quality of this brush.</li>
            <li> Wash it before you use it really well and also wash the plastic cover it comes with if you plan on keeping</li>
            <li> /&gt;You really need to try it for yourself.</li>
            <li> They are so gentle on my skin, not scratchy at all.</li>
            <li> The hairs being so dense but not too dense is absolute perfection.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute GO-TO foundation brush now.  </li>
            <li> are wavy instead of perfectly straight.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am glad I spent the money on this brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very dense</li>
            <li> I have heard much raves about this brush, I use it with my MAC foundation.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy brush for applying liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush straight from sigma</li>
            <li> so i know its real.</li>
            <li> no matter how much i try to blend it just collects on the sides of my nose.</li>
            <li> Appears to be the real thing and not a knock off.</li>
            <li> Blends like a dream and doesn&#x27;t absorb much of the make up.</li>
            <li> Had it fast.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I am also looking into trying the whole set now.</li>
            <li> I do not believe this was a real Sigma brush, even though the seller, Instyle Products, is an authorized dealer according to the manufacturers website.</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> The brush works very well though.</li>
            <li> It really buffs my tinted moisturizer into my skin evenly.</li>
            <li> so I could never justify spending so much for a make-up application brush.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> and I feel like there is so much coverage</li>
            <li> I always use Real Techniques&#x27; stipple brush.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know if this item is the real thing from sigma.  </li>
            <li> so I dont think this is the real brush they sell in sigmabeauty.com&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> She puts this on her face and applies makeup, that&#x27;s really all I know about makeup.  </li>
            <li> People recommend these two products very often on makeup forum</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> this distributes product very evenly...great for foundation coverage...</li>
            <li> I enjoy following make-up bloggers and Sigma brushes kept coming up time and time again.  </li>
            <li> I got it in the mail today...very fast shipping indeed.</li>
            <li> The product came very well packed.</li>
            <li> This brush applies foundation very well and it hasn&#x27;t shed at all.</li>
            <li> This is straight from Sigma.</li>
            <li> As expected, I LOVE the Sigma F80.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been hearing SO MUCH about it</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> I dont really use makeup</li>
            <li> I want the whole sigma brush set</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have never raved about a brush as much as this one.</li>
            <li> I received item really fast</li>
            <li> They are so gentle on my skin, not scratchy at all.</li>
            <li> The hairs being so dense but not too dense is absolute perfection.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been lasting AND without any shedding, which is incredibly important.</li>
            <li> Once I got the hang of it, I really see the difference.</li>
            <li> One day I tried pulling and the whole chunk of them came out.  </li>
            <li> Foundation goes on much easier with this</li>
            <li> Totally worth spending a little more on a brush than normal!</li>
            <li> It covers so much area without using a lot of product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen a real sigma brush</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know if this is the real deal.</li>
            <li> , the whole bundle of hairs eventually fell of from the brush handle itself.</li>
            <li> The Gloss on the brush is coming off and I&#x27;m really hating it</li>
            <li> But I really dont understand why its started to get Matte on me.</li>
            <li> This brush is very well made.</li>
            <li> it really is the sigma brand</li>
            <li> it shipped fast &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I was ready to try the F80</li>
            <li> but after hearing so much hype about this brush</li>
            <li> Very upset.</li>
            <li> Might as well go buy the real one from the website.</li>
            <li> fast shipping.</li>
            <li> High quality as well!</li>
            <li> I like it, and if I could afford to have a whole set of Sigma brushes</li>
            <li> I really recommend this brush to anyone looking for a brush to apply their foundation.</li>
            <li> Get the real thing off Sigma.com</li>
            <li> I use it every day and it makes the make up look very well blended.</li>
            <li> It works the foundation into the skin really well.  </li>
            <li> My foundation goes on very well</li>
            <li> The brush works really well</li>
            <li> She wants to get one for her sister now.</li>
            <li> that one made applying foundation cream much easier.</li>
            <li> It presses the product into the skin rather than absorbing product into the brush.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Bought it used it for 2 months washed it twice and the whole brush fell apart LITERALLY, overpriced for the quality</li>

            <li> Fast shipping....</li>
            <li> It applies the powder foundation very evenly</li>
            <li> I use it to blend in oily looking foundations and it also works very well with cream blushes.</li>
            <li> someone said real techniques brushes are &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; than Sigma?</li>
            <li> I recommend it to anybody who loves makeup and wants an effortless airbrushed look.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this brush</li>
            <li> Highly recommended and it earns my 5 stars !</li>
            <li> This is the absolute holy grail of brushes.</li>
            <li> , I also bought the eye kit brushes and Im very sold, Im</li>
            <li> SO MUCH</li>
            <li> And Amazon is very dependable</li>
            <li> Blends really well, but I do go over it with a beauty blender for that added smoothness.</li>
            <li> It is very well made.</li>
            <li> It gives the skin a very airbrushed look.</li>
            <li> Not too much, mind you.</li>
            <li> It really is a quality brush for the price.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, too.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Very dense brush.</li>
            <li> It shipped really fast to.</li>
            <li> I gives you a smooth airbrushed finish, I woud definitely recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> and I ordered the real one</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft and does its job, worth the money.</li>
            <li> It will blend it into your skin very well.</li>
            <li> This one was well reviewed and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shed and very well made</li>
            <li> Came in the mail fast..</li>
            <li> fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I suggest going onto the Sigma website, because you&#x27;re not going to get the real thing here.</li>
            <li> I will definately be buying more products from them in the near future.</li>
            <li> nice firm brush.</li>
            <li> Tried different ones but this is by far my all time favorite.</li>
            <li> Looking to buy more Sigma products in the near future.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, personal experience so far... i love this brush</li>
            <li> Thinking of returning and paying the couple extra bucks to know it is authentic from Sigma directly.</li>
            <li> There are no streaks left behind, making my foundation look flawless.  </li>
            <li> The brush does an excellent job of blending the foundation along the jaw line and applies thin layers to prevent lines forming later in the day under the eyes or at the crows feet.  </li>
            <li> I only bought the Sigma F80 because I love all sigma brushes so far.</li>
            <li> It stipples your foundation to a flawless finish, so no unsitely swipes of makeup left behind</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about purchasing it at first because I don&#x27;t typically spend so much on a makeup brush.</li>
            <li> However, I did not find it to be any better or any worse than generic flat top kabuki brushes I own.</li>
            <li> Unbelievably SOFT!!!</li>
            <li> so you use less foundation and get a smooth, full coverage application.</li>
            <li> I was a complete skeptic at first, but with all of the positive online reviews, I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of flat top brushes I use to apply my mineral powder foundation, since I like to switch to using a clean brush every couple of days, and I&#x27;m too lazy to clean them a couple of times a week.</li>
            <li> So I decided to give the flat kabuki from sigma a try and actually the results were AMAZING.</li>
            <li> This does give me better coverage than any other application method I&#x27;ve tried and it makes my foundation stay on my face so much longer.</li>
            <li> It really makes my makeup blend better than any other brush I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Then when it was completely damaged I read reviews about the Sigma Flat Top Kabuki...took a shot...</li>
            <li> Flat with soft, extremely dense bristles, gives great, very even coverage.</li>
            <li> The synthetic bristles aren&#x27;t irritating to the skin and it stipples very nicely.  </li>
            <li> When I first opened the cute red pouch/bag/thing that it came in, I was completely taken aback by how soft and dense this brush is.</li>
            <li> the brush is SO soft that it actually makes it fun!!  </li>
            <li> The brush applies makeup quite quick and easy, and doesn&#x27;t waste product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning the brush has been very easy, just a little liquid soap and water to rinse out any built up product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller than I expected, but it&#x27;s really soft and the quality is amazing!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so unique becuase sigma is the only place where they had this brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is even better than what I expected!</li>
            <li> Better than my other 3 foundation brushes, probably because of the shape and density of the bristles.  </li>
            <li> I also ordered it after reading the many favorable reviews on Amazon &amp; other cosmetic websites.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never use any other brush for applying my foundation :)</li>
            <li> After the fourth time I washed this brush a significant amount of bristles began falling out.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because I have found that the sigma F80 Flat Kabuki brush has worked fantastic for me.</li>
            <li> I was Incredibly excited to finally purchase my Sigma F80 brush!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way which is great considering</li>
            <li> The actual brush itself is authentic and blends like no other.</li>
            <li> I will be investing in more brushes over time to replace my other subpar brushes.</li>
            <li> but other then that the brush is ok..</li>
            <li> My one criticism would be that this brush tends to use up more products than other brushes, just a warning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different foundation brushes by MAC, Bare Minerals, etc.</li>
            <li> It was such a great decision because I reach for this brush everyday now!</li>
            <li> I swirl it in a teeny tiny drop of olive oil before cleaning with baby shampoo which makes it a bit easier to clean.</li>
            <li> However, I did noticed that your skin needs to be really clean and exfoliated or it might make your pores larger..</li>
            <li> Im amazed in how this brush leaves my foundation,  it gives it such a clean buff look...</li>
            <li> The only thing I am worried about is how it will work once I clean it.</li>
            <li> It is easy to wash (I just use shampoo and conditioner and let it dry overnight).</li>
            <li> The only qualm I have is that you have to keep it absolutley clean for it to work</li>
            <li> My only concern is in keeping it clean.</li>
            <li> But the bristles of Shiseido 113 seem to be a tiny little bit more fine than SigmaF80</li>
            <li> My new Flat Kabuki brush Easy to apply liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> I have stopped using my flat foundation brush for full face and only use it for light BB cream application.  </li>
            <li> A friend recommended this brush to me and I would highly recommend this brush to other people that are looking for a better way to apply their liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> The bristles are densely packed and super soft, ensuring that a buffing motion is just that, leaving me with a natural airbrushed look.</li>
            <li> BECAUSE THEY ARE SUPER EXPENSIVE AND THE BRUSHES ARE NOT THAT GOOD</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super soft and the bristles don&#x27;t fall out like other cheap brushes.</li>
            <li> It is very soft and dense and is working really well for both my powder foundation and blush application, really helps me to blend it in so that it looks natural and pretty.  </li>
            <li> If you are not careful, you will no longer have a flat top brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to get the full Sigma brush set as soon as possible.</li>
            <li> This brush is such a dream come true.</li>
            <li> I really liked the feel of this brush but after a few months of using it the bristle on one side all started to come out!</li>
            <li> It is soft and pretty dense, but it just doesn&#x27;t work for me I guess.</li>
            <li> the bristles weren&#x27;t as soft as when I first bought them.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and most importantly generously thick and sturdy.</li>
            <li> First impression was that this brush is SO soft, I&#x27;ve been using it for years</li>
            <li> sent it back for a full refund.</li>
            <li> I originally had been using a coastal scents flat top brush for foundation (Im not trying to run down coastal scents)</li>
            <li> LOVE this brush &amp; will buy again if anything ever happens to my other one!</li>
            <li> Over all im so pleased with this brush its very dense so a little product goes along way.</li>
            <li> and they sent me out a new brush!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a new brush, give this one a try!</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ll purchase a new one soon!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sigma is my new fav!</li>
            <li> This has become my new must have in my makeup/foundation routine!</li>
            <li> It blends out each foundation so smoothly, easily shearing it down for minimal coverage or adding more for a fuller coverage.  </li>
            <li> This particular brush was recomennded to me and now i CANT LIVE WITHOUT IT!</li>
            <li> Absolutely cannot live without.</li>
            <li> and I really needed a new foundation brush.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, product received was new.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because there are more good things than bad things to say about this brush.</li>
            <li> It smooths my foundation on evenly, it doesn&#x27;t shed, and I&#x27;m able to use less product.</li>
            <li> I spent easily $20 on a brush for it to break after using it once.</li>
            <li> There may be slightly better brushes out there, but for less than $20, who cares?  </li>
            <li> half the price that is better.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved how they packaged the brush and the shipping only took a few days.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more Sigma brushes in the future.</li>
            <li> ,I will definitely be purchasing more Sigma brushes in the future.</li>
            <li> I also love how I got this product two days after I ordered it even though I only had standard shipping.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this brush and plan on buy more brushes in the future.</li>
            <li> Purchasing this brush through Amazon was the same price as buying it directly through Sigma, except I also got free shipping with Amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s firm but soft and does a nice job of blending my foundation.</li>
            <li> I use it mainly just to buff my foundation after I apply it</li>
            <li> Definitely want more Sigma brushes in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely going to order more of this brush as I do multiple faces at a time...</li>
            <li> I recommend it to anyone and everyone, as the only thing better that I&#x27;ve found is actual airbrushing!</li>
            <li> I also had to start using a different makeup because I was using Clinique acne solutions which has salicitic acid, and you can&#x27;t use that when pregnant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it&#x27;d be a decent brush for $6 but not</li>
            <li> The brushed didn&#x27;t fluff up after drying, but I noticed the outer bristles were kind of way</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried sigma brushes before, but my friend recommended this particular brush because I&#x27;m a foundation junkie.</li>
            <li> I honestly wish I wouldve just gone to the sigma website and spent money on a brush that would last longer then a couple uses.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s on the larger size, more the size of a blush brush, but I find the bristles are flexible enough to get reach all the areas of my face.  </li>
            <li> I feel in love instantly, so I immediately got back on amazon, and ordered the angled Sigma kabuki brush for the us of blush and contouring.</li>
            <li> I purchased mine from the Sigma website, I&#x27;ve seen tons of youtube beauty guru&#x27;s raving about this brand of brushes, and this one in particular to apply liquid foundations.</li>
            <li> I have used it mainly with Lancome Teint Idole foundation and the Tarte Amazonian Clay foundation.</li>
            <li> have this problem, just the F80, my main foundation brush.</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy more brushes in the future</li>
            <li> Decent brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is very soft with really dense bristles, I expected it to be bigger but it blends really nicely</li>
            <li> The brush really distributes the product evenly and it is very soft, so it doesn&#x27;t hurt your skin.</li>
            <li> Applies liquid foundation evenly without having to do much work and is very soft with your face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft and seems very durable</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft and VERY dense.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched long and hard and finally found the perfect foundation brush!</li>
            <li> I clean the brush pretty regularly but it can be somewhat difficult to clean, otherwise I&#x27;m quite satisfied.</li>
            <li> Doesnt Shed, it&#x27;s Very soft!</li>
            <li> I like it sooo much better than my old Bare Minerals brush that shed constantly.</li>
            <li> Have tried the Real Techniques stippling brush and it didn&#x27;t apply nearly as well as this!</li>
            <li> I like this brush because it is very soft!</li>
            <li> Very soft bristles!</li>
            <li> Very soft!</li>
            <li> I used to buy cheap brushes from department stores and complain about the loose bristles that would end up all over my face.</li>
            <li> I love that the bristles are tightly packed and sturdy.  </li>

            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I heard about this brush from a friend and I highly recommend it as well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Essential tool only reason it doesn&#x27;t rinse easily because it&#x27;s such a good quality the bristles are tightly packed together as they should be for this type of brush.</li>
            <li> Additionally, most makeup brushes, no matter how soft, tend to cause too much flaking and exfoliation on my skin, so buffing in any sort of foundation with any brush is typically out of the question.</li>
            <li> I had a MAC brush and it left black brisles on my faces and didnt really apply my fountation correctly, this brush is amazing</li>
            <li> Just got this F80 Flat Top Kabuki brush on the 2nd..</li>
            <li> I have the ELF flat top which is larger and covers a wider surface.</li>
            <li> I am exceptionally satisfied with my purchase and recommend this specific brush (F80 Flat Kabuki) to EVERYONE that wears foundation.</li>
            <li> I own other Sigma brushes but this size is just to massive.  </li>
            <li> FINALLY, I found my holy grail, liquid foundation brush in the Sigma F80 flat top kabuki.</li>
            <li> My next flat top brush will be coming from Makeup Geek.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the beauty blender and other brushes, but I like this far better.  </li>
            <li> Made my foundation very easy to apply and looked much more natural than any other brush I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> on one brush I did not expect for it to totally come apart on the FIRST washing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using mineral makeup for years now and decided to I needed a little more coverage.</li>
            <li> I have several Kabuki brushes some of which are higher on price than this one - but after getting this I think I am going to through away all the others!</li>
            <li> so so soft !!.</li>
            <li> I am slowly replacing my makeup brushes with Sigma brushes and this one so far is my absolute favorite!</li>
            <li> but I feel I use a little more foundation when I apply it with the brush than if I apply it with my finger.  </li>
            <li> The brush itself is SO SOFT!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommend especially with the UD Surreal Skin foundation!</li>
            <li> The feel of the brush on my face was so soft!!</li>
            <li> my foundation was applied, I was so pleased that this required so little effort.</li>
            <li> And so soft!!</li>
            <li> I normally use my flat foundation brush purchased from my local drugstore, however this brush has def changed my foundation routine, the flatness of the brush allows for my foundation to be applied much more easier as well as blending it.</li>
            <li> So soft!!</li>
            <li> and wow!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is dense, soft, so simple to clean, and it doesn&#x27;t shed like some brushes do at this</li>
            <li> forgot to add my skin is dry combination and with the brush I can see dry patches, the beauty blender leaves my skin feeling moisturize and looks really nice not</li>
            <li> I only clean this with professional brush cleaner</li>
            <li> have very oily Tzone and eyelids, super dry chin and cheeks...</li>
            <li> I washed it as soon as it arrived, and it returned to its original shape once dry, and I did not see any shedding.</li>
            <li> - I have other make-up brushes that cost in the neighborhood of $40 and this easily compares or even surpasses them.</li>
            <li> but I can tell it is very high quality and is soooo soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also found it really nice for applying blush and liquid highlighters such as benefit&#x27;s high beam or nars&#x27; orgasm illuminating fluid, achieving a sheer result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft and really helps to minimize pores.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and very dense.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazingly soft and very well made.</li>
            <li> It seems to be a real Sigma - has it on the handle and on the metal near the handle.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much buffing into my skin, and it leaves a natural finish.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, even came early.</li>
            <li> The bristles are SO soft and very densely packed.</li>
            <li> Very dense bristles that are SO soft.</li>
            <li> It is very dense, but still soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft and has really changed the way my foundation is applied.</li>
            <li> She says the brush is soft and spreads the foundation really well.</li>
            <li> so soft and it smoothes out foundation really well</li>
            <li> so when you clean it, it will take a day or two to dry before you can use it again</li>
            <li> Bristles are soft and very dense.</li>
            <li> Feels like a professional did your makeup and is much quicker.  </li>
            <li> I will get the complete set of brushes thanks again</li>
            <li> For how much this brush costs, I&#x27;m honestly really surprised.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so soft and works really well.</li>
            <li> It is very sturdy while still being soft and pliable.</li>
            <li> Brush is very dense and soft and can be used with liquid or powder mineral foundation.</li>
            <li> I use it every day with minimal care and get a smooth, even amount of coverage.</li>
            <li> It gave me an airbrushed look and natural, which I like since I don&#x27;t wear foundation very often.</li>
            <li> I personally think the quality of these brushes is just as good, if not better, than M.A.C&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i love it use it everyday</li>
            <li> Normally I like to keep those, to help the brushes keep their shape.</li>
            <li> I have tried using my fingers to blend, a traditional foundation brush and several different types of sponges, but nothing made my skin look as nice as the Sigma F80.</li>
            <li> I have washed this brush many times and I have had a few bristles lost.</li>
            <li> My favorite part is that you can use the brush lightly damp or with facial mist and blend out any areas that are too thick or need blending.  </li>
            <li> The shape makes it more complementary for the face and it takes a few seconds to apply all over it.</li>
            <li> brush is well worth the amount of money I paid for my #55, but the actual cost is no where close.</li>
            <li> The look was pretty much the same as my MAC foundation brush.</li>
            <li> If you have the extra money and are into makeup brushes then it&#x27;s worth checking out.</li>
            <li> It takes a couple of washes to get all the gunk out, but I would imagine it&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li> I plan to use it a few more times to see if the shedding subsides.</li>
            <li> It is so worth spending the money that I bought a second one!</li>
            <li> most cost just a few dollars from E.L.F.</li>
            <li> I love my kabuki brush....use it everyday.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so worth it, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I hope sigma keeps making the brush as I want to give some away as gifts and also buy and few more for myself.</li>
            <li> This brush is definitely well worth the hype because it does what it claims.</li>
            <li> I normally use my fingers to apply my foundation.</li>
            <li> I have the round top version as well</li>
            <li> but it definitely does the job I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on cheap brushes that the bristles fall out!</li>
            <li> I love this one and the round top.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, but not great.</li>
            <li> I will most certainly be purchasing other brushes in the future!</li>
            <li> I get much more even coverage with less product!</li>
            <li> what I noticed about this brush is that I use less foundation and my coverage is more natural on my face.  </li>
            <li> More natural and less cakey.</li>
            <li> I bought this after a few recommendations on youtube , it came very quickly and packaged well and works very well</li>
            <li> Super easy and much faster application than the standard foundation brushes I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> After two days of use, I washed it again (with Dr. Bonner&#x27;s Peppermint liquid soap, a little drop in warm soapy water, just swishing brush into a cup of the soapy water, rinse the cup, add just warm water and dip the brush in and swishing until all traces of makeup was gone, then using my fingers to push off excess water and allow to air dry), absolutely no fall out, the brush was still soft and ready to use the next day.</li>
            <li> Actually you should add it to your cart right now....</li>
            <li> It takes up the right amount if make-up, I only have to shale the tip of the brush.</li>
            <li> If I ever need another brush, I&#x27;m definitely skipping the MAC counter and heading right for a Sigma.</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t wait to buy more of the Sigma line to replace my cheaper Sonia Kashuk brushes from Target, that are stiff and prickly in comparison.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and right next to my lip from the brush.</li>
            <li> It is extremely high quality and is sooooo soft!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I never knew about this brush and why it was so important to use rather than your fingers, sponge or other makeup brush.</li>
            <li> First, the shipping was super fast and arrived a day or two earlier than I expected.</li>
            <li> The Stigma brush requires about 3 pumps of foundation and my MAC brush only with a pump or a pump and a half is more than enough to give me full coverage</li>
            <li> I am fairly new to using a brush to apply my foundation.</li>
            <li> Would buy from this seller again when need a new brush/additional brush.</li>
            <li> and it still looks brand new.</li>
            <li> you are looking for a new foundation brush or if you want just try this out, don&#x27;t hesitate!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this and my new foundation</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this brush, it blends my foundation so well and everything</li>
            <li> Also, no funky smells from the new brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still continue to learn new things.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve read on here that this is a new legislation on all Sigma products, while others say this is a telltale sign of a dupe.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this brush.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
            <li> brush is my new go to</li>
            <li> i get my items on time and it is new</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this brush anymore.  </li>
            <li> Sigma brushes have become my new go to.  </li>
            <li> and I live in Puerto Rico</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t live up to all the hype.</li>
            <li> I have found my new brush and can&#x27;t be without it.  </li>
            <li> I am new to applying foundation with a brush.</li>
            <li> Sigma is now my go-to company for new makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> It makes my foundation look airbrushed (I use Revlon&#x27;s new whipped colorstay.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Always buy two is my new theory to life and ordering brushes.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all about spending $, but the quality needs to live up to the name and price and M.A.C.</li>
            <li> My new hole grail foundation bgrush...... Will be switching all my brushes to sigma brushes</li>
            <li> I had use other brushes for my face (real techniques bold metal foundation brush, Eco Tools foam applicator)</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this brush, as well as many of the other high quality Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more even, smooth and less heavy.</li>
            <li> Great price and crazy fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> The overall end result was smooth foundation on my face, a second skin.</li>
            <li> The Revlon CS usually feels slightly heavy when I wear it, and this buffs it out so beautifully and makes it feel so lightweight.</li>
            <li> I received my sigma brush today in the mail, and not only was it fast shipping, it was packaged very well.</li>
            <li> really didn&#x27;t have to use much wrist movement to glide the brush back and forth to create that airbrushed look.</li>
            <li> If you want professional results for a decent price, go with Sigma.</li>
            <li> Brush head could be much bigger as it doesn&#x27;t cover as much of my face as fast when applying foundation.</li>
            <li> Finally, because it is very smooth and nothing comes off, as happens with other brushes that I bought before.</li>
            <li> Very very pleased and definitely will be buying other products like it in the future.</li>
            <li> This brush is very soft</li>

            <li> Not only is it the density i want, it is also a very versatile brush that i can basically use for almost anything!</li>
            <li> Finally it came today and the first thing I did was take off all my makeup and put on foundation.</li>
            <li> Ive had no problems so far!</li>
            <li> It was my first sigma brush, and will not be my last!  </li>
            <li> The bristles are extremely soft, and have not shed at all!  </li>
            <li> I bought my first F80 for personal use over a year ago.</li>
            <li> This is my first sigma brush, and I am definitely going to purchase some others.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it when I first got it, and it definitely didn&#x27;t disappoint!</li>
            <li> but wow!</li>
            <li> it is so soft and dense!</li>
            <li> Let me start out by saying This sigma brush is so soft!</li>
            <li> fibers/hairs are EXTREMELY soft!</li>
            <li> The same thing happened to my first brush (which made it about a year), but I thought it was a fluke</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to complete my collection of sigma brushes!</li>
            <li> but i end it paying the exact same amount that they sell it for..</li>
            <li> I contacted Sigma and since I didn&#x27;t buy the brush directly from them they wouldn&#x27;t do anything for me!</li>
            <li> and I am by no means a professional makeup artist!</li>
            <li> I just got the Sigma F80 brush and I am so surprised because it came in five days!</li>
            <li> I learned about this brush online from a YouTube video by Ms Beauty B*tch (substituted the \\&quot;i\\&quot; with a \\&quot;*\\&quot;) whereby she demos the Urban Decay Surreal Cream to Powder foundation.</li>
            <li> It is spool soft, it applies my foundation like a dream!</li>
            <li> First off, I will say that overall, I like this brush.</li>
            <li> fibers/hairs are EXTREMELY soft!</li>
            <li> It completely exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li> Completely sold on sigma brushes and can&#x27;t wait to buy the set!</li>
            <li> and I have more to cover than usual.  </li>
            <li> Its so soft and works so well with foundation!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft!</li>
            <li> , the only downside in this is that a couple brissles were all bent and stuff which was upsetting cuz this is a pricey product but other than that love this and would buy again.</li>
            <li> Sooo soft!</li>
            <li> The F80 is definitely worth the extra cash compared to the Real Techniques brush for tougher to blend foundations like Estee Lauder Double Wear or Tarte Amazonian Clay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However I still think my foundation brush from the drug store just does the same exact thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure however if this is authentic  </li>
            <li> but I will definitely be putting in an order soon for other brushes :)</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend it, can&#x27;t wait to build up my whole collection of them!</li>
            <li> And its so soft!</li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW!</li>
            <li> The last time of washing this brush I noticed the handle becoming loose</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for several reasons, the first one is the price, which is not excessive when considering the quality of this item, second, because you will spend less foundation and the results of a better application make all the difference.</li>
            <li> At first a bit skeptical with between positive reviews and of course the ones that say the company encourages you to leave positive feedback to get a free gift.</li>
            <li> It does take at least a full day to dry though, so I always have two available!</li>
            <li> This is my first flat top kabuki brush, so I don&#x27;t have any other similar brush to compare it to.</li>
            <li> I always wash my new brushes before using them and always lay them flat to dry, so I&#x27;m pretty sure it was loose beforehand.  </li>
            <li> I knew I would because I have several other Sigma brushes that are amazing I have decited to only purchase Sigma brushes from now on.</li>
            <li> OMG, I cannot say enough great things about the Sigma F80 Flat Kabuki, I&#x27;m a sucker for Sigma brushes anyway</li>
            <li> I also use the blank canvas cosmetics kabuki flat top brush and this Sigma one is very similar.  </li>
            <li> WOW how did I live with out it.</li>
            <li> you very much Sigma F80 - Flat Kabuki TM</li>
            <li> I have been wanting this brush for so long, and have always been somewhat hesitant to buy for the cost, and the shipping cost on the sigma website, i finally decided to go for it when i found it on here for free</li>
            <li> but I knew my review would not be credible without having used it and washed it at least once first.</li>
            <li> I use this brush as a foundation applicator and it gets on so smooth with out any lines and lets you use less product.</li>
            <li> She says the brush is firm and it gave no streaks with full coverage and it was shipped really fast.</li>
            <li> I love this brush if had several that shed this one does not totally worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This really makes it easy to skip the priming step in my opinion (although priming is essential for long lasting coverage).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It buffs product into your skin seamlessly and gives a very natural result.</li>
            <li> I love this for my foundation, the only problem is it sucks up so much product!</li>
            <li> flat brush first and saved a ton of money.</li>
            <li> This was my first flat foundation brush.  </li>
            <li> and I have found that if i wait too long inbetweeen cleanings, it gets kind of gross, and harder to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unlike other brushes, this brush gives full coverage.</li>
            <li> have only washed it for 3 times, when it is wet, you can even easily push or pull the hair in or out from the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have previously used several sigma brushes and I absolutely love all of them, except for this one.</li>
            <li> However, the next day I turned on my blow dryer on low and it finished drying it quickly.</li>
            <li> I AM EXCITED TO TRY THEIR OTHER BRUSHES SOON!</li>
            <li> Also,the quality of this brush is unique, I haven&#x27;t found any other brush like this is!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, big enough, works quick in my every morning makeup routine.</li>
            <li> I need 3 more to have around though because it gets dirty super fast.</li>
            <li> I love how thick and soft this brush is!</li>
            <li> The material is perfect to pass my base makeup and is so soft!</li>
            <li> I am new into using the higher quality brushes and products and I am wondering why I went so long without trying this brush!</li>
            <li> It certainly exceeded my expectations and I will definitely repurchase it if I have to!</li>
            <li> so you know you&#x27;re getting a real Sigma brush (another reviewer listed them in a previous review) or go right through Sigma.  </li>
            <li> It is worth every single cent!</li>
            <li> Worth every single dollar!</li>
            <li> brush is OK, i have a hard time blending product evenly and without streaks.</li>
            <li> It is super soft but not at all flimsy like other brushes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> FAKE BRUSH i thought it would be a good idea to order the brush on Amazon to save a couple of dollars I received the brush in the mail and was sooo excited I looked at the brush and thought this looks odd</li>
            <li> , I am going to say that I am a firm believer that the foundation you use makes a huge difference as well</li>
            <li> It really makes a difference as far as application of the foundation and overall appearance.</li>
            <li> (I deep clean all my brushes weekly) and it takes forever to dry.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the only brush that gives you natural look even if you apply too much foundation.</li>
            <li> Its difficult to clean product buildup from the brush since the bristles twist out of place easy</li>
            <li> I always do: pumped some product onto the back of my hand, dipped my brush in, and started at the center of my face, working my way out and up with smooth, circular strokes.  </li>
            <li> clearly states on Sigma&#x27;s website that Etailz is an authorized retailer on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It is very dence and sturdt yet soft at the same time.</li>
            <li> So far there&#x27;s been no shedding, and I like the weight of it in my hand - not too heavy or too light.</li>
            <li> It even has a clear sleeve when not in use.  </li>
            <li> Im ready for the next day.</li>
            <li> This brush is soft and blends well.</li>
            <li> It is so soft.</li>
            <li> I love it to say the least.</li>
            <li> it is unbelievably soft.</li>
            <li> I wish I knew how much I would have like this brush, as I would have likely bought the synthetic collection.</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft.  </li>
            <li> The bristle is so soft and dense.</li>
            <li> There is no fall out so far</li>
            <li> I also was surprised to find a travel size blending brush with my order.  </li>
            <li> the brush is so soft and the hairs stay intact.</li>
            <li> (I wash it with water and shampoo in the evening, and it&#x27;s ready to be used the following day).</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding so far.</li>
            <li> I really didnt think a makeup brush could make such a difference, but it did!</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft to the touch</li>
            <li> and it was ready to go at 730am the next day, and its not even summer.</li>
            <li> No shedding of the hairs, and so, so soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that i finally purchased this brush and spent the extra money.</li>
            <li> This brush does not shed and is suuper soft on your skin.</li>
            <li> The brush is really soft and dense, and made my face look like it was airbrushed after blending my foundation.</li>
            <li> It is so dense and soft.</li>
            <li> It is so dense and so soft.</li>
            <li> I am 47 years old and have used a makeup sponge all my life.  </li>
            <li> My makeup looks smooth and is no longer heavy.  </li>
            <li> I really like it, and would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m going to buy me the whole brush set next time !!!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so soft</li>
            <li> It is also incredibly soft, and not at all abrasive in its use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush itself is very solid and the bristles very dense.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredibly soft;</li>
            <li> The brush feel so soft on my skin</li>
            <li> IT FEELS.SO SOFT.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft but dense so the foundation doesn&#x27;t get soaked up by the brush.</li>
            <li> Plus the bristles were so soft.</li>
            <li> Soft and applies evenly...</li>
            <li> For starters this brush is sooo soft, like baby butt soft.</li>
            <li> Plus shipping was fast ( only 5 days)</li>
            <li> For liquids, I think I would only use this with thicker foundations like Mac since it really buffs the makeup into the skin.</li>
            <li> You really get what you pay for and this brush has made such a difference in the application of my makeup.</li>
            <li> BUT I do clense it regularly because it is a very dense brush</li>
            <li> I bought this brush directly from the Sigma website where it is cheaper with their discount code ($17).  </li>
            <li> It is so dense and soft.  </li>
            <li> This brush was soft and dense.</li>
            <li> So far, i thought the brush helped me give an airbrush look and the person making these brushes knew what a foundation brush needed.</li>
            <li> The bristles are extremely soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> The bristles are dense and soft.</li>
            <li> So soft and looks so professional.  </li>
            <li> After you use it, your skin looks even and natural, you don&#x27;t look painted at all.</li>
            <li> It is SUPPPPPPPPPPER soft as well.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;d recommend that you purchase directly from Sigma website because shipping charge is cheaper there, and check out some of the youtube channels for 10% off coupon.  </li>
            <li> SOOO soft.</li>

            <li> The bristles are really soft.</li>
            <li> I used to use Chanel brushes that are made with natural hair.</li>
            <li> This bristles are incredibly soft and it applies my foundation seamlessly.</li>
            <li> I saw a review on this brush on Youtube by a professional make up artist</li>
            <li> I saw a youtube video from a person who does make-up professionally.  </li>
            <li> It is so soft and blends foundation</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft</li>
            <li> also, one thing i liked about this order that it arrived earlier than what is expected, actually it arrived 5 days earlier.</li>
            <li> I ORDERED THIS BURSH ALONG WITH THE SIGMA PROFESSIONAL PREMIUM KIT</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely soft and dense.</li>
            <li> brush is reallyyyyy soft</li>
            <li> I ordered directly from sigma</li>
            <li> This brush has completely revolutionized my foundation routine.</li>
            <li> Its so soft and always gives a even coverage.</li>
            <li> but this is definitely not the real thing or something</li>
            <li> It needs frequent cleaning, but not an issue for me.</li>
            <li> I suppose at 38 yrs old</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft.</li>
            <li> I have all kinds of brushes but this is the most delicate.</li>
            <li> Save your money and buy directly from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> It washes well, hairs stay soft, holds product well, and doesn&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> now i am planning to buy a complete set.</li>
            <li> Really soft and doesn&#x27;t leave streaks</li>
            <li> No problems with it falling apart so far though, crossing my fingers.</li>
            <li> one I received is definitely the real thing.</li>
            <li> brush fibers are fantastically soft.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a soft blur effect and this is the brush that delivers.</li>
            <li> the bristles are sxtra soft.  </li>
            <li> I only really put foundation on parts of my face that need cover.  </li>
            <li> I felt like a 2 year old in an old woman&#x27;s skin, holding on to something that may give me some semblance of a youthful flair for maybe another year or so if I use it.  </li>
            <li> I am returning to amazon and will instead buy this directly from Sigma</li>
            <li> I read the reviews for this item and decided to go directly to Sigma&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li> The finish is much smoother and air brushed looking.</li>
            <li> The brush is soft and everything came on time.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and the handle well made.</li>
            <li> After seeing Jaclyn  Hill&#x27;s review for this brush and reading the reviews I decided to invest and WOW has it changed my makeup routine forever.  </li>
            <li> The brush head is so so soft.  </li>
            <li> The brush is so dense and soft.</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> too just made my brush collection complete.  </li>
            <li> nothing like the F82 I ordered directly from Sigma.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft and it doesn&#x27;t use a lot of foundation.</li>
            <li> This brush is SO soft, so dense and it doesn&#x27;t shed.  </li>
            <li> It blends everything so seamlessly that it looks as if I don&#x27;t have foundation on.</li>
            <li> Bristles are so soft.</li>
            <li> I really like this and will be purchasing another one in the future.</li>
            <li> I never had this problem with brushes I ordered directly from Sigma.</li>
            <li> i have gone back and forth on wether or not i wanted to spend that much on a brush.</li>
            <li> Dense but soft</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be buying my brushes directly from Sigma site store moving forward.</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft that allows you to build up layers until you get the desired coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This brush gives a natural but airbrushed look that I do not get if I use my fingers to apply instead.  </li>
            <li> The hair is soft and dense with NO shed.</li>
            <li> As soon as i received this brush in the mail i was amazed of how soft it is and couldn&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
            <li> The bristles are so densely packed and incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> Soft, dense, durable, no fall out.</li>
            <li> Bristles were soft, covered face well, then 1 month after using all the hairs started to fall out.  </li>
            <li> So soft when you use it on your face.</li>
            <li> The brissles are amazingly soft and worka like a gem.</li>
            <li> It completely fell apart and I had to throw it out.</li>
            <li> but Sigma really needs to go back to making their brushes in the USA.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I would apply it directly to the brush.</li>
            <li> But so far I like it and would buy again.</li>
            <li> The foundation appears alot smoother and natural with this brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try a Sigma brush forever and finally bought this one thanks to tons of hype on YouTube</li>
            <li> it is made so well and its so soft.</li>
            <li> The hair was extremely soft and bushy.</li>
            <li> I finally gave into the hype about this brush because i was having some real deal problems when applying my foundation.</li>
            <li> I was looking to replace my old Shu Uemura angled brush with a dense kabuki-type brush.  </li>
            <li> It applies product seamlessly.</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft.</li>
            <li> I have two Sigma brushes that I bought directly from Sigma&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li> Also I can definitely smell paint on the brush, the Sigma logo is painted on and the whole brush reeks of paint.</li>
            <li> So far, I like the coverage and the ability to &amp;#34;stipple&amp;#34; rather than &amp;#34;paint&amp;#34; the foundation.</li>
            <li> Much smaller then a real Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> The bristles on this brush are really soft and dense.</li>
            <li> Seamless foundation everytime.</li>
            <li> The shedding was minor at first on my face.  </li>
            <li> It is sooo soft, but your foundation does not get lost in the brush.</li>
            <li> It does not have the USA marked on the brush</li>
            <li> Ive had it for over a month and so far hairs aren&#x27;t falling off.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft, so they don&#x27;t scratch the eyelid</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for two months so far</li>
            <li> It does allow for complete coverage of foundation and blending out of concealer.</li>
            <li> dense and soft.</li>
            <li> No shedding so far, either.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft on the face and doesn&#x27;t allow for cakey buildup.</li>
            <li> It is so soft and leaves my face looking airbrushed.</li>
            <li> It has synthetic fibers, so it won&#x27;t eat up your foundation like natural haired brushes will.</li>
            <li> The bristles on the brush are soft.</li>
            <li> I am a professional MUA</li>
            <li> My face looks very unnatural and I&#x27;m left with tons of streaks after using this to apply my liquid foundations.</li>
            <li> I really want the Mrs. Bunny essential or travel brushes.  </li>
            <li> Save your money and buy directly from the retailers.</li>
            <li> While this one isn&#x27;t as fragile, as a whole the Sigma brushes are prone to lose their shape after cleaning them.  </li>
            <li> I currently use a Real Techniques buffing brush for foundation application.  </li>
            <li> The brush picks up enough product for coverage and not so much that you&#x27;re wasting a lot of product.</li>
            <li> The bristles have remained soft and have not clumped throughout my use of the brush.</li>
            <li> Next time I&#x27;ll just buy from the real website.</li>
            <li> It is soft but still has hold.</li>
            <li> The bristles do not feel as soft as the ones I ordered directly from the Sigma website.  </li>
            <li> surprised her with this gift and Sigma beauty</li>
            <li> surprised her with the additional gift that they sent to her</li>
            <li> I bought this brush to replace an old elf brush I was using for my face</li>
            <li> This brush is so dense and soft</li>
            <li> Since a make up brush is an essential product that really needs to work well, I would recommend paying the price for this.</li>
            <li> Also because it&#x27;s not goat hairs, it doesn&#x27;t take in a lot of my foundation on the brush, so there is no waste of product.</li>
            <li> But the key is to Buff it and Blend it really well into your skin or else, you&#x27;ll have chalky, cakey</li>
            <li> , I tried to gently pull what looked to be a flyaway bristle out of the brush and literally the entire brush head/bundle of bristles came out of the silver handle on the brush.</li>
            <li> I have had a set of Eco Tools brushes for over a year now and have never had anything near as catastrophic as what happened this morning.</li>
            <li> no shedding and beautifully soft.</li>
            <li> The bristles are so soft and they don&#x27;t break off on your face.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so dense and soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft and goes on evenly.</li>
            <li> The bristles feel soft on my face and are densely packed.</li>
            <li> Excellently soft.</li>
            <li> the bressels are extremely soft ...</li>
            <li> It is really soft on the skin.  </li>
            <li> I tried the sigma brush on my forehead and so far no breakouts.</li>
            <li> It is so soft and dense</li>
            <li> Soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll defer to her as the professional in all matters makeup</li>
            <li> I HAVE A LOT OF BRUSHES BY MAC, THIS SIGMA BRUSH IS BY FAR</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny, the only word left to say about this brush is perfection.</li>
            <li> I always saw patches or streaks and for me it was a hassle because i felt i had to keep on passing the brush more times on the same area even after the foundation dried</li>
            <li> The brush arrived with in only a few days and came in a really cute draw string bag.</li>
            <li> The brush is sturdy and well worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> Honestly, its quality is such that you&#x27;d expect it to be twice the price - at least.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the 20 dollars spent on this product.</li>
            <li> a more airbrush look instead of a thick mask of foundation that I get from using my fingers.</li>
            <li> I like the weight of the brush in my hand, and I feel like the thick base helps me get a good grip on the brush for more precise handling, if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a good (albeit expensive) foundation brush that will leave you looking like you don&#x27;t even have any foundation on then</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s on okay brush, but not amazing.</li>
            <li> Definitely don&#x27;t invest in a MAC brush when Sigma brushes do it better - for less!</li>
            <li> I highly advise washing them after using liquid foundation so that your foundation does not dry on the brush.</li>
            <li> Nice brush for foundation, although it is a little large for small faces.</li>
            <li> This new brush actually made my foundation seem less obvious, my skin was more finished.  </li>
            <li> My other brushes are a bit scratchy and lose their bristles on my face  - after trying my first Sigma brush I will now be looking to replace my entire economy set of brushes with these much higher quality brushes.  </li>
            <li> This brush made my face powder look so much better than usual!</li>
            <li> My next purchase will be the Essential Brush Kit which contains all the other brushes I want as well :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve washed the brush several times and use it pretty much every day and haven&#x27;t noticed loose hairs falling out.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S BRISTLES to dry to make sure no water gets down into the glue of the brush.</li>
            <li> The brush head is dense and soft yet small enough to be very precise in the application.</li>
            <li> I am not a brush user, I usually would use my fingers but this makes it so easy.</li>
            <li> so I clean my brush every other night and not exactly the gentle cleaning either and to my surprise, not a hair was ever shed!</li>
            <li> Other than that, if you like flawless-looking skin and smooth, even coverage/application, I would definitely recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> Nicest flat foundation brush I had tried and seemed very high quality...</li>
            <li> This brush gives a completely airbrushed finish that no other brush I have does! .</li>
            <li> only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the brush does take a while to dry (given the fact that the bristles are super dense)...</li>
            <li> extra soft, dense and very professional at look!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased a makeup brush as I do not normally wear foundation.</li>
            <li> I have used other amazon dupes to avoid paying 24$ for this brush, but after trying the Bestope dupe, coastal scents, and countless others, I caved and purchased the sigma flat top kabuki.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is the brush or foundation, but so far i&#x27;m only somewhat satisfied.</li>
            <li> First off the ferrule was loose.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are tightly packed together and are super soft on the skin.</li>
            <li> They are the perfect size; big enough for all over your face and small enough to get into the small places like around your nose for example.</li>
            <li> I recently found out about this line of brushes and the F80 in particular from Alexandrea Garza&#x27;s YouTube channel.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re deciding whether or not to order this brush, I think you should definitely get it, because at first I thought this brush was just a rave, but then I actually tried it</li>
            <li> The bristles on the outside are higher than the middle causing a bowl-like shape.</li>
            <li> I searched for so long for a kabuki brush, but every time I bought one, it was all messy because most brushes fell apart.</li>
            <li> I just received this brush, and it is full, firm yet soft, and luxurious feeling.</li>
            <li> This was my first Sigma brush and it&#x27;s likely going to be my last.</li>
            <li> I recommend this brush to anyone especially those first starting out with make up.</li>
            <li> This purchase was my first time \\&quot;stepping up\\&quot; and buying a more expensive brush.</li>
            <li> The difference is night and day - no loose bristles, the brush was SO soft I just wanted to keep using it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, evenly distributes liquid foundation as well as powder, and buffs the product into the skin like no other.</li>
            <li> Overall, I would highly recommend trying this brush.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend you do the same.</li>
            <li> Such high quality brush.</li>
            <li> came highly recommended from multiple makeup artists and beauty bloggers!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend his brush and will be buying all my brushes from this brand in the future!</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this brush, I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> it took only 10 days although i live far away in KSA.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super soft (which I love)and not to heavy.</li>
            <li> , for such a small price, I think you get a high quality brush that will become indispensable.</li>
            <li> The brush is exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> What I expected, but it&#x27;s my first sigma brush</li>
            <li> This is a well made brush and more importantly it does not shed like other much more expensive brushes from different brands I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> So I decided to wait a month before I reviewed the flat top kabuki, to get a decent all round idea of how good / bad this brush</li>
            <li> saves my life for when i&#x27;m running late, the weight of the handle is beautiful, seriously, if you&#x27;re going to splurge on a makeup brush, try this one</li>
            <li> This is an amazing tool to apply even makeup and less mess!</li>
            <li> had to buy a new one again that same week.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll order it from the actual website or send me a new one.</li>
            <li> The only downfall is that I live in Canada so it takes longer for the delivery to arrive</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend the Flat Kabuki for foundation application.</li>
            <li> After washing, it took less than a day to dry, however it was pretty hot</li>
            <li> The brushes were totally dry and ready to use this morning.</li>
            <li> This was my first Sigma Beauty purchase but it will not be the last; I have a long wish list.  </li>
            <li> The minor shedding continued when I actually used the brush for the first time.</li>
            <li> It is firm and smooth at the same time.</li>
            <li> Obviously the most commonly recommended brush when applying liquid foundation.  </li>
            <li> They replied quickly and said that they would contact the seller and tell them about my trouble.</li>
            <li> I used the regular drug store foundation brushes and although there was nothing wrong with using the drug store foundation brushes, I took it upon myself to see if this product was really as good as people claim it to be.</li>
            <li> excellent, the size is necessary to place the base in the face.</li>
            <li> If I add a small amount of facial lotion to my coverage, one layer is enough for a very clean and natural look.</li>
            <li> No other company has a brush like this</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, seeing as the brush is only available online, however it lived up to expectations!</li>
            <li> This brush barely lasted 2 months!</li>
            <li> it is exactly like my other ones.</li>
            <li> I am willing now to try some other brushes from Sigma</li>
            <li> It offers a little more coverage than the domed kabuki brushes that are typically recommended.</li>
            <li> I was afraid to clean it the first time,  because the brushes I had before were never as soft once it was washed, but the sigma was exactly the same as when I received it!!!</li>
            <li> Just FYI, if you have dry skin or excessive flaking, this brush will enhance, so make sure you exfoliate before use.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so suprised how fast it is, even though I live on the other side of the world!</li>
            <li> probably need two or more foundation brushes to rotate anyway if you clean the foundation brush everyday because it takes at least a day for them to completely dry)</li>
            <li> The quality of Sigma brushes are unlike any other - very dense and soft.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s soooooo soft, but it is hard to clean.</li>
            <li> I prefer Real Techniques, good quality and less expensive.</li>
            <li> Although I was skeptical at first, the Sigma brush lived up to the reviews and provides a nice coat while using less powder compared to my old brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I will repurchase this item, I prefer to use my ELF flat top powder brush, only costs $3 and never had a problem of it shedding.</li>
            <li> This was my favorite brush until I ordered again on Amazon and recieved a fake one which broke right away, the first one lasted like a yr, washed it almost everyday, this one soon as I open bristles fall off</li>
            <li> This new flat kabuki brush came from heaven.</li>
            <li> brush is well-built; the bristles are tight and the length is just right.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to my old ways</li>
            <li> It works well with my Smashbox Halo powder and my Bare Minerals foundation.  </li>
            <li> This sigma flat kabuki brush is amazingly soft!</li>
            <li> This brush is so dense and sturdy, yet at the same time extremely soft.</li>
            <li> It is so soft yet sturdy enough to do the job.  </li>
            <li> It gives such an even application and it is so soft.  </li>
            <li> It is of the same quality as the brushes I purchased directly from Sigma and the seller is an authorized Amazon retailer according to the Sigma Beauty</li>
            <li> The bristles are amazingly soft, densely packed and the handle is solid.  </li>
            <li> I also find it looks natural when I want to put multiple layers of foundation on.  </li>
            <li> I apply with a liquid foundation and it leaves such a natural finish.</li>
            <li> I use a mixture between Bare Minerals Brush Shampoo &amp; the BeautyBlender Liquid Cleanser.</li>
            <li> I thought NG Inc stood for NutraGroup Inc, an approved Amazon Sigma reseller, but apparently it does not.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Brush arrived fast and was just as expected.</li>
            <li> I have always applied my foundation using either my hands or a makeup sponge but after using this brush, I&#x27;ll never go back to my old ways.</li>
            <li> I have found cheaper dupes almost as soft as this Sigma, but none of them have come close to the same density, and because of that Sigma always provides a smoother quicker application.</li>
            <li> So pissed I barely had it a month</li>
            <li> So far I have only used this brush once</li>
            <li> I used a kabuki brush to apply my Bare Minerals.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Kabuki brushes from Bare Minerals that have been shedding all over my face when I apply the product.</li>
            <li> and I have no regrets...</li>
            <li> and I get barely any on my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft and it feels like it will last.</li>
            <li> but I needed one that could apply liquid and possibly my Bare minerals foundation.</li>
            <li> Almost twenty dollars for a brush is a lot, especially when I got a similar brush from the Real Techniques line that came in a set of FIVE brushes for the same price as this one brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So soft and distributes the product equally over the face.</li>
            <li> I do not feel that I have been rough with this brush at all and am always gentle when cleaning it.</li>
            <li> an MD who barely has time to apply all the steps to my makeup routine because</li>
            <li> Not only are the bristles soft</li>
            <li> It is incredibly soft yet sturdy &amp; dense enough to get an even application.</li>
            <li> The only reason I give this a 3/5 is because after a couple a months (2-3) it completely came apart.</li>
            <li> I was careful to never get water in the ferrule and cleaned it just like the rest of my brushes (which are fine), but the bristles came unglued in less than five months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is so dense and when I use it I feel like have to pat the foundation in and it kind of feels uncomfortable, because the bristles don&#x27;t move well.</li>
            <li> Love this brush, however when I received it, the metal was dented and the brush was poorly packaged.</li>
            <li> It was also kind of expensive in my opinion for a make up brush..</li>
            <li> It is a little hard to clean but well worth it.</li>
            <li> I am only giving it four stars though because I keep experiencing a bit of shed, and because when it arrived it had tiny singular black hairs sticking out from the smooth white finish that needed to be trimmed.</li>
            <li> Really upsetting that it didn&#x27;t last that long!</li>
            <li> Other than that the brush was really soft and looked high quality.</li>
            <li> I also looked at some of other flat top kabuki brushes around this price, and this brush beats other ones if the price is similar.  </li>
            <li> I have never had an issue with this one, not a single bristle lost!</li>
            <li> I waste way less product and get a better finish.</li>
            <li> Before getting this brush, I tried a lot of other ways to apply liquid foundation (with a traditional foundation brush, sponges, fingers, etc) but nothing worked to really blend my foundation and make it look somewhat natural.</li>
            <li> or i got a defective one, because there is no way that in less than a year a whole chunk of it can fall off!</li>
            <li> I first purchased this brush in January, but after almost a year my brush broke in half.</li>
            <li> I normally wash it once a week with Dawn dish soap and let it dry overnight.</li>
            <li> I used this with my foundation and the foundation didn&#x27;t sink into the brush half as much!</li>
            <li> My other brush would just pick up too much product and leave me looking cakey.</li>
            <li> Hard to clean</li>
            <li> soft flat brush&lt;br /&gt;applies</li>
            <li> brush is well built, black wooden handle and metallic ferrule, the bristles are very dense and reaaaaaaaally soft.</li>
            <li> After purchasing this brush I actually purchased the entire professional set.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently purchased several brushes and this brush is by far one of favorites.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ll definitely order from them again hopefully in the near future.</li>
            <li> I should have just spent the extra money and got the real deal</li>
            <li> This brush as received a lot of hype from online and social media gurus.</li>
            <li> it came earlier than expected very grateful of that.</li>
            <li> None of my older brushes could survive my rough handling and cleaning</li>
            <li> As I use it to smooth out the foundation the thick bristles pressed the cream deep into the pores and therefore show up unflatteringly.  </li>
            <li> The brush was in good condition upon opening, and unfortunately broke after minimal use.</li>
            <li> I usually pat it down for more coverage .</li>
            <li> Even cheapy brushes don&#x27;t usually have loose ferrules, and considering how much this cost, it doesn&#x27;t exactly fall under the cheapy category.  </li>
            <li> good brush, but unfortunately the stick part came loose and now i only use the bristle part of it.</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s important that you know that it has only been in the past year that I&#x27;ve been buying more expensive make-up vs. drugstore stuff</li>
            <li> All I used to wash it, was a little olive oil, soap and water, which works wonders on my other, cheap brushes, from target.</li>
            <li> When I finally started to use it, however, I found that it was absorbing more of my liquid foundation than my ELF Powder brush (which I won&#x27;t tolerate, seeing that right now, I&#x27;m using Make Up For Ever&#x27;s HD Foundation, which is too expensive to be wasted!!)</li>
            <li> It is a long lasting brush and you won&#x27;t have to worry about having to get a new one anytime soon</li>
            <li> I did wash it right away and it only shed a few hairs.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I am paranoid about being out and having a stubble show through late in the day, and this brush combined with the right foundation (and stippling!) buys me a lot of time.  </li>
            <li> The one drawback is that it is very dense, and takes a long time to dry.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that can really be considered a con since ALL synthetic fiber brushes take long to dry</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased the &amp;#34;Sephora&amp;#34; version of this brush, and all it did from the first day was shed...everywhere and constantly.  </li>
            <li> I have used MUG&#x27;s stippling brush in the past, and to me this one is better and slightly cheaper.</li>
            <li> Every time I use it, I always use more foundation than if I use my other brush, it also highlights my dry spots on my forehead making an uneven and spotty finish.</li>
            <li> Lately I&#x27;ve been on the fence about buying super expensive foundation and instead opted for this brush after seeing it used in many makeup tutorials online in the hopes that having a &#x27;professional&#x27; tool would help me out with what I already have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My combination skin is mostly in great shape, but I&#x27;v been disappointed with cakey or too watery foundations.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed about the shedding given the great reviews.</li>
            <li> have to confess that I have a facial hair problem due to very aggravating disorder that drives me nuts.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is it is a bit hard to clean.</li>
            <li> This brush is really hard to completely clean back to</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft they do not loosen or break even after a long time of use.</li>
            <li> (especially the bare minerals buki brushes which shed at an obnoxious rate).</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t waste product and it doesn&#x27;t shed, even straight out of the box!</li>
            <li> I love that this buffs product into the skin and disperses any extra that you might not want left behind.  </li>
            <li> but I had no idea what I was missing until I tried my first Sigma brush.  </li>
            <li> So first time I discover this brush was watching a few tutorials on You Tube.</li>
            <li> Price is absolutely affordable and way cheaper than what you find on ebay and by any other carries of these sigma brushes!</li>
            <li> I am very careful with the way I wash my brushes however this particular brush did not hold up to the sigma quality.</li>
            <li> I was not willing to pay $30 &amp; up for a high end brush that might work, so I stuck with my fingers.</li>
            <li> Yes I will purchase other one and highly recommend to family and friends.</li>
            <li> , I really do, but I thought it was going to make my foundation look AMAZING, so I was a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> It is also incredibly soft to the touch but sturdy enough to not completely give way while you are applying foundation.</li>
            <li> The next day after my first use, I washed the brush and there was little fallout, only about 1 or 2 bristles.</li>
            <li> The bristle began to push down and honestly it became unusable after approximately 8 washes.</li>
            <li> It is totally worth the $23 I spent, I can&#x27;t wait to the other brushes in the line!</li>
            <li> The brush is super soft and very thick.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and dense and I haven&#x27;t shed a single fiber yet</li>
            <li> Now I think I want one that&#x27;s not flat though.</li>
            <li> Also the brush is not easy to clean, takes a long time to dry.</li>
            <li> brush is very durable as well, I&#x27;ve had it a little over a year now</li>
            <li> The bristles didnt come off at all, which is a problem ive had with other new brushes.  </li>
            <li> The brush absorbs too much foundation and little is actually left to apply on the skin.</li>
            <li> I typically use ELF studio line brushes which are extremely affordable but also durable and useful.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the money, also Sigma has way better brushes than Mac and other expensive brands for almost half the price.</li>
            <li> have been reading good and bad reviews on this brush.</li>
            <li> Anyway, basically this product loses stars because it took forever to get here (Canada) and the brush requires A LOT of wrist action so that can lead to a lot of fatigue (and my mom won&#x27;t use it for that reason) and if you are doing make up for a while, it gets to be way too much.</li>
            <li> Not doing a good job of applying foundation, the brush lost its shape, this is my second bad experience with flat kabuki brush.</li>
            <li> and I barely have to use any because this brush makes the product go a long way!</li>
            <li> Before, I used my fingers and a regular traditional flat sided foundation brush.</li>
            <li> So, I decided I needed a new brush I figured instead of buying another three dollar brush that would break down in another couple of months</li>
            <li> /&gt;Comparing to my old Chanel powder brush, I was disappointed that F80 used 3x more mineral powder, but provided much more poor result.</li>
            <li> I also use it to put a little concealer on after when I have a particular break out.</li>
            <li> SO PLEASE, save yourself from the mistake I did, and do not buy this brush.... or at the very least, don&#x27;t clean it...</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft but dense and gives the airbrushed appearance that other reviewers talk about.</li>
            <li> Other than those two things, I found the brush to be incredibly soft and dense.</li>
            <li> She says it blends so well that she forgets she has makeup on, and it doesn&#x27;t make her foundation streaky like a traditional flat foundation brush.</li>
            <li> If only they made the flat kabuki in copper too):</li>
            <li> For some reason I kept skipping over sigma brushes and have some Sephora brand - and for my foundation I purchased the foundation flat stippling brush that was the same brand as the foundation.</li>
            <li> After my Elf flat powder brush started shedding, especially while washing, I decided to look for an alternative.</li>
            <li> I own Sigma brushes and got this one but let me tell you it&#x27;s definitely a FAKE!</li>
            <li> The bristles are very tightly compacted so when you buff it on your skin, it leaves a very airbrushed effect on your make up.</li>
            <li> It buffs on foundation like no other and leaves absolutely no streaks or lines.  </li>
            <li> less than 4 months super disappointed :)</li>
            <li> Well, the 5th time I washed it, less than one week after I got it, the bristles completely fell out of the handle in a big clump!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice, but does nothing a less expensive brush can&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li> I doubt it will last a quarter of what my old one lasted, which was a year and a half.</li>
            <li> gently washed this brush so no water got in the ferrule and used the Dry&#x27;N Shape to dry the brushes upside down.</li>
            <li> My only issue is it&#x27;s a little hard to deep clean...</li>
            <li> I usually use a combination of stippling and swirling liquid foundation onto my skin, then tap gently all over my face to blend.</li>
            <li> One small pump on the wrist will do my whole face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a real sigma brush though.</li>
            <li> Not sure if these brushes use real hair or synthetic.  </li>
            <li> I have used several other manufacturers brushes before, Benefit, Sephora, Bare Minerals, and Sigma puts them all to shame</li>
            <li> Sometimes they call it precision cheek, sometimes flat kabuki</li>
            <li> Its gonna last u forever as long as u take care of them ...</li>
            <li> I used a flat foundation brush from MAC for about 8 years and decided to try this brush based on Carli Bybel recommending it.</li>
            <li> I heard it will last as long as you take care of it.</li>
            <li> I have had flat foundation brushes for years.</li>
            <li> But I finally purchased my long awaited Sigma Beauty Kabuki Brush.</li>
            <li> I would pick this brush over any flat foundation brush any day since the flat brushes tend to leave streaks.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that I have noticed some minor shedding when I received the item</li>
            <li> One kept shedding so I emailed them..but long story short got no</li>
            <li> There is no professional generic brand brush equivalent for this.</li>
            <li> I ordered the flat kabuki brush to apply foundation</li>
            <li> but I do regret it because it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Dont know how long these brushes would last</li>
            <li> Forever&#x27;s foundation Flat foundation blush.</li>
            <li> I bought three Sigma brushes for my wife (DUO FIBRE F80, DUO FIBRE F50, PRECISION FLAT P80)</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t expect it to last too long.</li>
            <li> My fav flat kabuki from Coastal Scents, didn&#x27;t make its way home from a trip.</li>
            <li> but nothing compares to the Sigma F80 Flat Kabuki.</li>
            <li> In my case, one full pump of foundation mixed with a small amount of Smashbox&#x27;s green foundation primer, along with this brush</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unbelievable how dense and soft this brush is!!!</li>
            <li> The glue that held the bristles together broke down, causing it to shed until it came off completely.</li>
            <li> Just as good as MAC and a much less expensive venture!</li>
            <li> my sigma flat kabuki f-80  !</li>
            <li> I saw the Sigma F80 flat kabuki brush on a you tube video and had to buy it and try it!</li>
            <li> ( I mean is really not expensive at all)</li>
            <li> A couple of sprays on a paper towel swipe brush back and forth then let brush dry.  </li>
            <li> It picks up less product and gives my skin an airbrushed natural finish.</li>
            <li> I use far less of the product with this brush than if I used a sponge or a fingertip.  </li>
            <li> plus I realize it was fake because with the Sigma Brushes I bought in the real website this brush that I bought had been painted shiny while the real brushes weren&#x27;t painted like that and didn&#x27;t have that smell.</li>
            <li> The black part and the silver part of the brush were completely disconnected</li>
            <li> I went the actual sigma website but the shipping said that it would take quite a long time to get to me, and I couldn&#x27;t wait that long.</li>
            <li> only thing is that its smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> its dense and firm enough for my foundation but soft on the face.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft but firm enough not to bend.</li>
            <li> I sometimes get tired of hearing about sigma products on youtube, but I totally have to admit that this brush is worth the price.  </li>
            <li> I am getting a little worried because the brush is starting to shed pretty badly already not sure yet if good for long term use.</li>
            <li> Very soft, but also dense and firm</li>
            <li> Very soft to the touch, but firm</li>
            <li> Definitely my go to every single day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update 2/2015: Still using this same brush - bristles STILL do not shed, and I use it every single day to apply liquid and powder foundation.</li>
            <li> and i been using the regular flat foundation brush everyone uses, and i have very dry skin</li>
            <li> A little hard to clean</li>
            <li> While applying, I didn&#x27;t have to use much of the foundation, which mean my foundation will last longer</li>
            <li> After using the brush twice the handle started to come loose by the third use the handle came off.</li>
            <li> I have washed this brush several times with no shedding and the ferrule has not came loose.</li>
            <li> But as long as I wash it immediately after use, it has plenty of time to dry before I need it the following day.</li>
            <li> Soft, tightly packed bristles.</li>
            <li> It definitely takes 24 hours-ish to dry because of the density of the brush, but I&#x27;ll take it!</li>
            <li> only reason i ordered off of here rather than Sigma itself was due to my Prime account and instant shipping.</li>
            <li> Other brushes I have used (real hair and synthetic)tend to make my face itch and turn red (so not cute).  </li>
            <li> I have had little to no fall out on this brush and it is by far the softest brush I have ever put on my face.</li>
            <li> 4 stars because I have acne prone skin which means I have sensitive skin, and this brush is a little to dense for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> They last as long as you keep the ferrule dry, DO NOT SOAK THE BRUSH!</li>
            <li> I must have been using it too much or too hard because the ferrule came off the handle, and the bristles went all over the place!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This well made flat topped brush ensures even foundation coverage!!!</li>
            <li> However, keep in mind that this brush does soak up a lot of foundation and cleaning it and then drying it takes at least 1 whole day.</li>
            <li> I have other professional brush and the quality surpasses my other brushes cant wait to get another brush.</li>
            <li> I washed it multiple times and there is still traces of foundation in the center.</li>
            <li> When I received the brush, there was some minor shedding, but it has stopped.</li>
            <li> im a long time</li>
            <li> The brush is firm but soft</li>
            <li> I expected to receive the brush in a week, but I actually got it in 2 days!  </li>
            <li> a long while too.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s MINOR and does NOT diminish the effectiveness of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> they left streaks or were too rough on my face.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to purchase this brush.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this brush long</li>
            <li> That is a minor issue however.</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;ve been wanting sigma brushes for a long time...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional...</li>
            <li> so you have to be careful to reshape it properly.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t take long at all to get the hang of it.  </li>
            <li> so I was using it for a long while as I debated this brush.  </li>
            <li> I had been wanting to try this product for a long time</li>
            <li> But now, every time I try to apply foundation, I end up with a bunch of short hairs stuck to my wet face.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it took me this long to find this brush.</li>
            <li> The long handle adds comfort to your makeup application.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m wondering why it&#x27;s taken so long.  </li>
            <li> so you can only imagine the amount of money spent there every weekend.</li>
            <li> It came earlier than i expected.</li>
            <li> The application was soft but firm.</li>
            <li> Not too long to hold on to.</li>
            <li> I will be using this brush for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I do use it, I am extra careful.</li>
            <li> Within a few months all of the bristles completely broke off and I ended up just trashing the thing all together.</li>
            <li> After listening to Jaclyn hill on you tube for way too long about this damn brush, I had to give in.  </li>
            <li> Long story- Sigma F80 is a joke.</li>
            <li> soft and applies makeup evenly, also doesn&#x27;t waste it</li>
            <li> Brush completely came apart after a few months.</li>
            <li> The shipping chart they had at Checkout was not clear..</li>
            <li> It took me a few times to get the technique down and how much pressure to apply</li>
            <li> It delivers professional results in half the time!</li>
            <li> I previously was using a standard foundation brush but found that it left streaks and made me look somewhat cakey.</li>
            <li> I actually use less makeup now because it&#x27;s actually brushing it on my face rather than soaking it up.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t even have to use that much product too, the bristles somehow just distribute it all over the skin without half of it getting wasted in the brush.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that since it&#x27;s so dense it can be hard to clean</li>
            <li> When I say the brush shed, I mean to say it shed a lot and in chunks so much so that it has lost its shape.</li>
            <li> However after last wash I noticed the brush becoming loose and it started shedding like crazy.</li>
            <li> so my expectations were not very high.</li>
            <li> The next morning I used my other brush because I forgot about this one drying, but day 2 I grabbed this.</li>
            <li> But I have since ordered several other brushes from Sigmabeauty.com -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely going to be purchasing their other brushes as well.</li>
            <li> I have seen this brush on so many youtube makeup video tutorials and I was a little skeptical</li>
            <li> Definitely tops the list of other face brushes.</li>
            <li> I would definitely want to try their other brushes.</li>
            <li> , i will definitely be purchasing my other sigma brushes from this retailer!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The handle seems different than my other Sigma brushes (cheaper).</li>
            <li> I am going to use this vertical style foundation brush instead of a flat, wide brush-- stippling instead of painting.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a bit wary and skeptical of face/foundation brushes, due to the fact I&#x27;ve had little luck with them when it comes to achieving as flawless an application as something like a dampened sponge applicator or beauty wedge.</li>
            <li> When I am done buffing I will go back over any areas that need a little extra attention.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely look into other techniques with various other brushes.</li>
            <li> I have only ever owned one other Kabuki brush</li>
            <li> Sadly, there are better brushes out there for not much more money (even the Dior)...that will last decades.</li>
            <li> I have several other Sigma brushes and none of them</li>
            <li> And my foundation is pretty thick!</li>
            <li> I have been waiting to buy this item for a very long time</li>
            <li> My friend has a more expensive brush from Mac that does the same thing as this one for a lot less!!</li>
            <li> The only flaw is the handle, the metal part is starting to twist on the handle and feels a little loose.</li>
            <li> Washed it and let it air dry (overnight).</li>
            <li> My brushes always dry a lot faster in the summer.  </li>
            <li> I dry them in my Sigma Dry N Shape.</li>
            <li> For me it took 3 days to dry</li>
            <li> It takes about 12 hours to dry, but I found leaving it to dry in front of a fan will do the trick in about 4-5 hours.</li>
            <li> Then I set it out to dry.</li>
            <li> it was dry.</li>
            <li> I washed the brushes and allowed them to dry overnight.</li>
            <li> When cleaning this brush, allow ample time to let it dry.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t loosen the handle from the bush head and let it dry overnight.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> I did my makeup in different lighting with different brushes, and I used alot of heavy foundation.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s soft and easy to use, and if you wash it in a regular base it won&#x27;t change shape</li>
            <li> when I received this item seeing as it is a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; in the beauty world, it did not live up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> forgot it at my sister&#x27;s house and could not live without it for a month...</li>
            <li> I bought two of these brushes and one was fine and the other one arrived flawed.  </li>
            <li> Its a thick dense brush, and its made of a of a high quality material.</li>
            <li> I now do my makeup every single day.</li>
            <li> NONE of the bristles have shed, and I use it every single day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little late in writing this review, but better late than never.  </li>
            <li> You have to be very careful with them or they get a little wild.</li>
            <li> I have tried several brushes that were so hard and rough on the skin, but this sigma F80, is so soft.</li>
            <li> She said: It&#x27;s unbelievable how dense and soft</li>
            <li> I would normally not be as upset</li>
            <li> Im normally not a stickler for packaging</li>
            <li> I bought several sigma brushes and they are not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Took a chance and order the Sigma F80 flat kabuki a few days later the brush came.</li>
            <li> I bought a higher priced version of this brush and it is not nearly as great.</li>
            <li> first I thought this brush was unnecessary</li>
            <li> but the ferrel was getting loose and</li>
            <li> but the part where the handle connects to the metal part is really loose.</li>
            <li> and everyone seems to complain that it takes along time to dry and mine took roughly 12-15 hours to dry.  </li>
            <li> The brush is so soft and dense,  I realized I needed to use less foundation with this brush than my previous one.</li>
            <li> I finally broke down and purchased this brush and have been blown away.  </li>
            <li> That being said, I finally broke down to get a Sigma brush because I had heard wondful things about them.</li>
            <li> I finally broke down and got this brush.</li>
            <li> I just started wearing liquid foundation and have found that a traditional flat brush left me with hard to blend streaks.</li>
            <li> The sigma brushes are ALL very soft, hardly ever shed.</li>
            <li> The bristles are shorter than other flat tops I have tried and they are sooo dense!!  </li>
            <li> is you want to buy there sigma beauty dry&#x27;n shape system!</li>
            <li> It also has expedited my foundation application process; previously I was always fighting with cheaper brushes until resorting back to my hands.</li>
            <li> I had previously used a Sonia Kushik foundation brush and various sponge applicators for my liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> I have previously tried sponges and simply my fingers for liquid foundation application.</li>
            <li> it cuts the blending time in half for traditional foundation brushes.</li>
            <li> My children thought it was funny, but I just thought it was sad that I could be reduced to such a state at my age.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are of low quality, with shiney, plasticky black strands.  </li>
            <li> The brush arrived less than 3 days later in the mail!</li>
            <li> (Some have said that the brushes have fallen apart, the bristles are less dense and/or are longer than the \\&quot;real\\&quot; brushes, and that the Sigma signature on the handle is different)</li>
            <li> so I am not super picky or technical with my brushes.</li>
            <li> Anyways all of the sudden after I used for more days it shed like crazy!</li>
            <li> In the past, I would only purchase MAC products (especially brushes) because that is all I knew.  </li>
            <li> Very soft and thick.</li>
            <li> I have used some cheaper brushes before for my base but it didn&#x27;t  work like this one, that  is for sure!</li>
            <li> A common complaint about this brush is cleaning, but a quick Google search will bring up tons of beauty blogs with cleaning techniques.</li>
            <li> Not even a single bristle!</li>
            <li> I use it every single day!</li>
            <li> I use this brush every single day!</li>
            <li> I use it every single day!</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush because I usually use stippling brushes to apply my foundation and I was needing a new one due to my other one falling apart.</li>
            <li> It is probably just not a good combination with my particular skin characteristics.  </li>
            <li> ordered this brush as well as the small angle and flat kabuki and Sigma threw in an extra blending brush as a gift.</li>
            <li> (a little goes a longer way) than if I were to use my regular foundation brush from MAC.</li>
            <li> Would like if the surface area of the brush were a little smaller.</li>
            <li> wish it was a little smaller in size</li>
            <li> Just wish it was a little bigger.</li>
            <li> a little extra foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I took proper care of it, but noticed even in the beginning after just one wash that it began to shed a little...</li>
            <li> a brush would hold up for around a year or more, very disappointed to have spent so much on an overrated brush.</li>
            <li> The flawed one arrived with uneven bristles that i assumed would be fine if I trimmed them because it didnt bother me.  </li>
            <li> Previously, I used a flat foundation brush, but read about this one online.  </li>
            <li> Not too soft or too hard.</li>
            <li> But while I was using the brush, the handle was loose then decided to come off!</li>
            <li> I wish I would&#x27;ve bought this brush sooner, instead of wasting my time with the more expensive MAC brushes, since this brush is the same if not better!!</li>
            <li> only negative comment I have is that you cannot get into smaller areas of your face with it, but no biggie for me.</li>
            <li> Some people complain that flat brushes make a mess, but not this one.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t rough on this brush.</li>
            <li> That is to say, I spent $16 for a one-time trial.</li>
            <li> I have spent tons of money on foundation</li>
            <li> No free sample with it...which sucked, especially because I&#x27;m used to getting those when I order with online sellers and</li>
            <li> I just ordered a few of the bushes last week.</li>
            <li> I really do not expect to hear from them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It does start shedding eventually but it hasn&#x27;t affected applying wet foundation, powder, bronzer, and blush by any means.</li>
            <li> So I gave it a try, but did not do what I expected or do what everyone said it should do.</li>
            <li> there was absolutely no</li>
            <li> Second, a few of the hairs on the brush are longer than others.  </li>
            <li> For powder foundation sigma recommends the Round Kabuki which I hope is my next brush.  </li>
            <li> they offered to replace it or give me a partial refund if I preferred to keep my brush.</li>
            <li> They emailed me back with in a few hours if me contacting them about my brush.</li>
            <li> so it was expected.</li>
            <li> im really not</li>
            <li> and it has shed so much to the point where it&#x27;s so thin, its not usable anymore.</li>
            <li> Ive been searching for a foundation brush for sometime now, since the ones Ive come across are rough that it hurt my face.</li>
            <li> but that is to be expected given the density of the brush.</li>
            <li> If you want this brush, I would suggest you get it from the Sigma site and pay the few extra dollars.</li>
            <li> I am so upset that I spent $15</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cleaned it without issue and it continues to perform as expected.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not really that upset about it</li>
            <li> Shedding is so minimal it seems like it doesn&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> Minimal to no shedding.</li>
            <li> and I received it before the expected delivery date.</li>
            <li> I was carefully washing and all bristles came off in</li>
            <li> Let it be known I have absolutely no idea</li>
            <li> still prefer the wet sponge not the beauty blender the cheapest dupe  in applying my foundation</li>
            <li> If the shipping and arrival of this Sigma brush was not fast, this would be a one star product.</li>
            <li> I spent years perfecting how to put liquid foundation on my face.</li>
            <li> Cleans easily, solid handle (not too heavy, not flimsy).  </li>
            <li> so they wouldn&#x27;t get wet on and inside the handle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft and thick.</li>
            <li> The bristles feel soft and thick.</li>
            <li> I could not live without this brush!!</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be a lot bigger other than that it smooths your foundation extremely well!!</li>
            <li> Then I would hang the brush upside down to dry.</li>
            <li> I dry my brushes head down</li>
            <li> TO BEAT MY FACE EVERYDAY WITH THE FLAT KABUKI BRUSH.</li>
            <li> 187, my wrist was a little bit tired after the first couple of uses</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m bringing this down to 4 stars only because after a few months the bristles start to fall out.</li>
            <li> I am a major makeup fanatic.</li>
            <li> It takes a little product a long way, preventing cakey-ness.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t really use it anymore because it isn&#x27;t worth the little black hairs all over my face :(</li>
            <li> I asked for refund and then sadly learned that they only accept F82 (new, un-used brush) for return.</li>
            <li> Very soft and thick!</li>
            <li> I had very high expectations for this brush prior to use which wasn&#x27;t a bad thing because the brush actually did meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> cant believe I ever used any other brush before this one.</li>
            <li> My other brushes just didn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> This brush is unlike any other that I have tried.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know the drying time in other climates.  </li>
            <li> I usually use drugstore brushes, or the tiny ones that come with the makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Quality is equal to if not greater then mac.</li>
            <li> I am a former \\&quot;finger\\&quot; foundation applier because no sponge or brush worked for me in the past.</li>
            <li> It does not shed unlike other brushes I have purchased from companies.</li>
            <li> It blends so well and is not streaky like other brushes.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t absorb a lot of the foundation like sponges or other brushes</li>
            <li> Recommend it with my eyes closed!</li>
            <li> It came with a brochure and pictures of all the other brushes they have.</li>
            <li> i also like using it to contour (using the edge of the brush), apply powder, apply highlight, and other types of foundation (creme, powder,...).  </li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that before i started using this brush, i was never satisfied with how other foundation brushes left my skin looking.</li>
            <li> I will never use any other brush.</li>
            <li> most of the sigma brushes that i&#x27;ve ordered shed on me like crazy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never bought a Sigma product before, so I&#x27;m not sure what to look for, but the reviews online seem to be mixed.  </li>
            <li> I have other comparable brushes that are cheaper, but I don&#x27;t regret this one at all.</li>
            <li> Will purchase other types of brushes.</li>
            <li> I plan on ordering another couple f80&#x27;s for backup and trying out some other face &amp; eye brushes from sigma.</li>
            <li> All my other brushes are from MAC, but this one outshines all of them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will have to try other Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> It arrived in a small white box with sigma tape on it.</li>
            <li> I usually apply foundation with a sponge but was thinking about trying something different.</li>
            <li> I am now looking at other brushes from sigma.  </li>
            <li> There was a pamphlet inside with information on the brush as well as other brushes in the collection.</li>
            <li> My Sigma F80 got here way quicker than expected!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unlike some other reviews, I&#x27;ve had no problems with brush shedding.</li>
            <li> I prefer this brush to any other I&#x27;ve tried for liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> Other than it falling apart</li>
            <li> Extremely staisfied.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and hassle free, however I am very disappointed with the quality of this brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to look into Sigma&#x27;s other products.</li>
            <li> On my other brushes the logo isn&#x27;t engraved on and with this one it is.</li>
            <li> This brush doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;eat&amp;#34; my foundation or leave streaks like my other ones do.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush because I had purchased four other brands, and was dissatisfied with their performance.</li>
            <li> I am looking into the Sigma line for replacements of my other brushes.  </li>
            <li> Makes me look forward to purchasing other brushes from Sigma.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to experiment with other uses for this brush.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll EVER use any other foundation brush again.</li>
            <li> I usually stick to Ecotools or cheaper drugstore brushes so this was actually a splurge for me.</li>
            <li> but I suppose that is to be expected!).</li>
            <li> so I can keep the other at home.</li>
            <li> I threw out all of my other foundation brushes because they don&#x27;t even compare to this one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any other foundation brush anymore.</li>
            <li> Product performs as expected!</li>
            <li> I had been using the other type of foundation brush.</li>
            <li> Will order other brushes from them.</li>
            <li> I finally got to try it out this past weekend for a night out</li>
            <li> I have also notice this shedding and also bleeding from other sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> It lives up to the hype from all of the other reviews.</li>
            <li> do, however, need to be very careful when washing it.</li>
            <li> and it did not have a strong smell or any sort of bad smell to it at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve washed it a few times and only a few hairs shed.</li>
            <li> The brush hair is extremely soft and can therefore reach difficult areas such as the corner of the eyes.</li>
            <li> ( I never like leaving this brush dirty after i use it, the bristles are super soft)&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday single day and it just works like you want it to.</li>
            <li> The handle became loose after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I have washed it a few times already with little shedding, but I&#x27;ve only had it for less than a month.</li>
            <li> I also have found that I use less product with this brush, this is probably due to the fact that the brush is made with the synthetic Sigmax fibers and is extremely dense.</li>
            <li> When you wash this brush it will take a little longer to dry then a typical makeup brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still small enough to get around your eyes and mouth without making a mess.</li>
            <li> Delivery also took 3 weeks so that was a bit annoying but overall worth the wait!</li>
            <li> The brush is incredibly soft and very thick and sturdy.</li>
            <li> Uses much less product than other kabuki&#x27;s that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Hardly any bristles fell out during my initial use.</li>
            <li> I have always bought MAC brushes but was disappointed with my last MAC brush because it shed so much!!</li>
            <li> I tried hard to think about what are the cons of the brush and the only one I could think of is the drying time.</li>
            <li> I had never used Sigma brushes before, and was equally concerned about this one, but since I&#x27;ve had it, it&#x27;s hardly shed at all.  </li>
            <li> Hard to describe until you actually try it.</li>
            <li> Tiny- Hardly can call it a Face brush.</li>
            <li> And honestly I was sick of it!</li>
            <li> The only problem I had was that there was a barcode sticker on the brush which was a little difficult to get completely off.</li>
            <li> Some people seem to enjoy their brushes, maybe I received a bad one I don&#x27;t know</li>
            <li> only negative was the brush protector.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t have to do any touchups at the end of the day, but if I do it&#x27;s minor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this product for a while now, my only complaint would be the upkeep.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical on buying a brush for stippling in fear that it really wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Not worth</li>
            <li> I have a real and this fake one</li>
            <li> I watch several YT makeup gurus and one thing they all have in common is this brush.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the cost for the quality</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Definitely not worth the hype.</li>
            <li> I looked at the real brush to find out that mine was a fake</li>
            <li> I received an Amazon Gift Card For X-Mas &amp; decided to purchase 2 &amp;#34;Sigma&amp;#34; brushes, I recieved my package within a week and decided to compare the fake &amp; real brushes</li>
            <li> I use it everyday with my wet face makeup.</li>
            <li> Hands down.</li>
            <li> hands down.  </li>
            <li> the keep the water running down</li>
            <li> Hands down this is a must have brush if you want to apply foundation.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to acquire other brushes from Sigma!</li>
            <li> I really mean what I said above in the title....</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try other sigma products!</li>
            <li> The bristles are extremely dense which helps make the application of foundation streak-free!</li>
            <li> I cannot imagining applying foundation any other way!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this brush over ANY other foundation brush on the market!</li>
            <li> I am eager to try the other sigma kabukis now!</li>
            <li> But if you take care of it, I have found absolutely no problems with this brush!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll throw rocks at all other brushes!)</li>
            <li> only reason I did not give this brush 5 stars is because I noticed a small hair left behind on my face on two occasions now.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> After a few weeks using the Sigma F80 brush I prefer this to any other application method.</li>
            <li> If recommended it to anyone who had trouble with other tools they use to apply their foundation.</li>
            <li> Here are my thoughts compared to a few other brushes in my collection:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have Mac brushes, elf, and a few other brands</li>
            <li> It has a few bristles that stick out but other than that</li>
            <li> you can see tons of bristles sticking out past the length of the rest of them and are loose.</li>
            <li> and I use less foundation than when I applied it with my fingers.  </li>
            <li> I received it in less than 5 business days and am once again amazed with Sigma&#x27;s service.  </li>
            <li> even with its slight problems I am ordering another one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for less than a month.</li>
            <li> I use less foundation which helps a lot.</li>
            <li> Maybe used half the year.</li>
            <li> With this brush I noticed I am wasting less foundation.</li>
            <li> guess they took my last email seriously.</li>
            <li> and I use less foundation each time.</li>
            <li> Now I have less break outs because it don&#x27;t put my make up on with my fingers anymore.</li>
            <li> I also think the black coating might chip soon because of the washing.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush less than 4 months ago and it has started shedding and losing its bristles.</li>
            <li> They brush came slightly damaged but still worked well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed that the time putting my foundation on in the morning is much less.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush a year and a half (ordered May 2014).</li>
            <li> I found the shape of this brush to be a tad bit odd</li>
            <li> I also notice that I use a lot less of the makeup when using this brush than I ever used to.</li>
            <li> You can use less makeup Because it spreads and blends it so well.</li>
            <li> The bristles came unglued and fell out during application after owning it less than 9 months.</li>
            <li> I just painted over it with black nail polish.</li>
            <li> downfall is that I have used it maybe for a month and the brush broke into half...</li>
            <li> I literally use half the makeup.  </li>
            <li> and I used less makeup...</li>
            <li> Half the bristles are gone</li>
            <li> You use less product because it blends so well.</li>
            <li> The bristles came unglued and fell out during application after owning it less than 3 months.</li>
            <li> Well this is the second time I ordered this same brush because I thought the 1st one was fake bacause it had SMDH1402 under Patent</li>
            <li> It makes my makeup look much less cakey than the sponges I had been using.</li>
            <li> As a bonus, I use less product.  </li>
            <li> Typically, my go-to&#x27;s are whatever brushes have came with products I have purchased.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for lighter coverage, I would recommend a stippling brush, or something with less dense bristles.</li>
            <li> (and she works for MAC) and they are half the price.</li>
            <li> and I feel I use less makeup with it.  </li>
            <li> It should be $10 or less not $20+.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews on this particular shipper and decided against ordering off amazon for fear of receiving a fake.</li>
            <li> I usually spread out the bristles a little and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, so I&#x27;ll usually use this to pat the product onto my face rather than dragging it around.</li>
            <li> I was highly upset, and it looks like this was a fake because the way the glue was on the handle.</li>
            <li> It takes so long to dry, approximately 2 days.</li>
            <li> I know that after you wash it, its supposed to shed a bit, but this started shedding like crazy, i ignored it and kept using, since then the whole thing has called apart!</li>
            <li> The application is not full coverage and appears streaky.</li>
            <li> So I kept hearing about this brush from you tube gurus, but have never really used a brush for my foundation in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for a little less than a year, and it&#x27;s now garbage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve washed it 3 or 4 times since purchased a little less than a mo ago and not one hair has fallen out.</li>
            <li> It was too tight, so I had to cut it off.</li>
            <li> Came in a plastic bag, no special packaging</li>
            <li> The bristles are packed in tightly so the foundation brushes on where you want it to.</li>
            <li> As a college student (tight budget), I kept on buying the Elf liquid foundation brushes for 1 dollar.</li>
            <li> Always me to use less product than I have used in the past for other brushes.</li>
            <li> When I ordered it, I was shocked that Sigma sent it to me so quickly.</li>
            <li> Did not like the application and could not clean all the makeup out no matter what I used then the texture changed.</li>
            <li> You are going to save money because you will waste less</li>
            <li> At least on their website your purchase is guaranteed with money back if you are not satisfied with your purchase.</li>
            <li> The bristles are so dense, sometimes I&#x27;ll wash it 3-4 times and it&#x27;s still not clean.  </li>
            <li> I had always been disappointed with my foundation (no matter how good or expensive)</li>
            <li> , if it&#x27;s not clean it makes me break out and the foundation looks cakey.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not familiar with Sigma&#x27;s line (as this is my first one) but a lot of people have complained about getting fake brushes from eBay and Amazon retailers.</li>
            <li> found in the past you had to give up one for the other).  </li>
            <li> This is not fun for a woman!  </li>
            <li> I had been wanting to try the mac stippling brush, but was a little on the pricey side</li>
            <li> i could tell.... not the roku box or the TV, this little twenty something dollar brush</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it a little over a month now</li>
            <li> It ways felt a little lose, but I washed it today and as I was drying it, the bristles just came out.</li>
            <li> That is a pet peeve of mine to be applying foundation and have little brush hairs attached to my face.  </li>
            <li> It is a little pricey but</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is now December 5, 2013, so I&#x27;ve had this brush for little over a year.</li>
            <li> I feel like if I pull on it a little, the brush will come apart.</li>
            <li> and so that made up for the price (which is a little pricey).</li>
            <li> /&gt;To provide a little bit of my foundation brush history:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Gives an airbrushed,full coverage look with little foundation.</li>
            <li> I had a MAC 187 dual fiber stiple brush for a little over a year...</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but it does its job well.</li>
            <li> A little pricey</li>
            <li> It is a little on the pricier side</li>
            <li> Just wish they were a little cheaper like Morphe Brushes.</li>
            <li> but maybe order it from the actual sigma sight because this one sucks!</li>
            <li> My face has mild acne, dark circles and scars on it. :(</li>
            <li> when i finally got it and did half my face with this brush and the other half my face with my expensive sophora brush.</li>
            <li> The only negative I can think of is that it is really hard to wash the product out of the brush because the brush is so dense.</li>
            <li> The price was amazing, making the quality of the brush shocking.  </li>
            <li> Oh, shipping cost as much as the brush..which I thought was crazy.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday for applying my makeup.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and even carry it with me touch up or just to blend during the day.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that i use this brush everyday because i don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> No streaks or uneven patches.</li>
            <li> When using this brush my makeup did not feel cakey or uneven.</li>
            <li> have used it quite a few times now</li>
            <li> Since i tried them, i have been using this brush everyday.</li>
            <li> I have been so impatient to get</li>
            <li> A few times I&#x27;ve noticed a bit of streaking.</li>
            <li> It does not streak or leave uneven blotches of foundation.</li>
            <li> The liqued foundation went on evenly on my skin...when i used my hands, the foundation looked uneven here and there.</li>
            <li> I have to say I&#x27;ve had it for 8 days and have used it everyday.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have uneven makeup all over.</li>
            <li> Brush hairs fell out after a few washes.</li>
            <li> I use this brush everyday.</li>
            <li> I got a fake copy , wasn&#x27;t so surprised about that as I read reviews that I should be carful</li>
            <li> I use it everyday now.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Well...my face broke out, and I dont like how heavy the feeling is of having goop on my face.</li>
            <li> still use it everyday and works well.</li>
            <li> considering I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cleaned the brush a few times already--</li>
            <li> Spend your money on quality brushes like this not cheap ones trust me</li>
            <li> It had uneven hairs sticking out of it as well.</li>
            <li> This purchase was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The bristles are firm, but not prickly.</li>
            <li> It also washes well and the shape returns once it&#x27;s dried.</li>
            <li> and i also use it to blend harsh blush edges.</li>
            <li> After use, the brush never feels dried up from the product, it keeps</li>
            <li> I use it everyday</li>
            <li> The combined sets I purchased perfectly round out my brush collection</li>
            <li> and I was too impatient to wait for the arrival of another one.</li>
            <li> If my brush would have been delivered to me damaged this rating would not have a full five stars :(</li>
            <li> I still use it everyday</li>
            <li> No streaks, no bristles left behind....</li>
            <li> Wasted my money which does not sit well.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday</li>
            <li> My face doesn&#x27;t look uneven like it would without this brush.</li>
            <li> I am writing this review because just a few minutes ago I gave this brush another chance by giving it another wash, and to my dismay</li>
            <li> It applies liquid and cream foundations smoothly, no streaks, and no shedding.</li>
            <li> save a few bucks!)I received the \\&quot;Sigma F80\\&quot; brush in the mail today.</li>
            <li> This brush doesn&#x27;t absorb the makeup it just transfers all of the product to your face so that you don&#x27;t waste any.</li>
            <li> and you have uneven skin color or texture, or both (like me)</li>
            <li> cause I though using brushes was just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> until a few weeks ago, when it began to shed.</li>
            <li> i use it everyday for the foundation and for my BB cream.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few years now</li>
            <li> BUT it is not great for getting into crevices and smaller spaces.  </li>
            <li> Now I have to go through the trouble to RETURN and</li>
            <li> She uses it everyday</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;ve wasted your money at all.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday for my liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> I have washed a couple of times and I haven&#x27;t had trouble with shedding.</li>
            <li> I have used it every day for a few weeks and there has been no shedding.</li>
            <li> I look forward to using this brush everyday.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your $</li>
            <li> frustrating experience overall .</li>
            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> As soon as it came in I compared it to my  old brush and it is so obviously fake.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only gotten worse since then.</li>
            <li> I never have to worry about uneven foundation again.</li>
            <li> but I was foolish enough to not return and use for a few weeks, seriously what&#x27;s with Amazon!</li>
            <li> I put a small amount of make up in the palm of my hand (takes less than a sponge or fingers), dab the brush in it (dab a few times to get the makeup well into the brush - not just on the surface), and use a blotting motion to apply.</li>
            <li> but this one takes foundation application to the next level, seriously!  </li>
            <li> and I found that odd, so I dried it off and the handle fell off!</li>
            <li> My foundation just glides on evenly and quickly, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I usually find that when I use other brushes, I still have to go in with something else and blend out some small lines, but not with this brush.</li>
            <li> Love Sigma brushes, but very disappointed with this one, the hairs are falling out within a couple times of using it... not worth it.</li>
            <li> There was a little shedding when I washed it the first time but nothing too bad.</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s very little waste.</li>
            <li> This brush is less expensive than if I got it off the actually sigma website.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve been using it the past few days anyhow.</li>
            <li> No more wasted foundation using cosmetic sponges.  </li>
            <li> and I really hate spending full price on anything.</li>
            <li> The only thing I hate is washing it because they take long to dry.</li>
            <li> I can try a slightly heavier foundation without worrying it could look too thick.</li>
            <li> worth every penny, Covers  like mad!</li>
            <li> I got this with my other brush kit in 2 days!!!</li>
            <li> After using this brush I WILL NEVER use anyone other brush for applying foundation!!!</li>
            <li> The whole bristle head was moving and falling out, maybe I just got a bad one.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> I use this brush for face powders usually to set my liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> Now I could be wrong, I&#x27;ve washed the brush twice and the density and tightness is still the same.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush almost every day for the past two months</li>
            <li> The brush also comes with a small plastic guard that keep the brush shape, which I appreciate.</li>
            <li> I was sorta upset that a brush this expensive just could not last.</li>
            <li> I have used it now over the past week with liquid foundations ( Chanel Pro Lumiere and Aqua Lumiere) and with powders.  </li>
            <li> This is just absolutely ridiculous, less than a month</li>
            <li> but it was to small and flimsy.</li>
            <li> I have used a foundation brush in the past that resembles a paint brush.</li>
            <li> I have no problem blending around my nose either with this brush (not sure why others have said in their reviews they have...?)  </li>
            <li> I usually always use thicker liquid foundations</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I should return and just buy off of Sigma itself.</li>
            <li> This brush was all the rave on every website, I usually use a sponge applicator and wanted to try this bc of the talk.</li>
            <li> only sorry I didnt try them years ago.</li>
            <li> I have had a couple of bristles fall out, but it&#x27;s not many at all</li>
            <li> My first time using this brush, I was already really disappointed with the quality.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why that happens</li>
            <li> and since it is small it handles the nose area</li>
            <li> but when I got the brushes they were not authentic.</li>
            <li> knew immediately the brush was not authentic when feeling the denseness of the bristles...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the set was utter garbage and fell apart almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> I have always used a small kabuki brush</li>
            <li> No more cake face for all of you that have those problems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I got a defective brush or something, but when I use it, I try to use the side without the wavy bristles.</li>
            <li> I usually use three pumps for my face and neck with this brush</li>
            <li> Usually when I put foundation on</li>
            <li> Not sure if I just got a faulty brush or what...</li>
            <li> This brush was a complete disappointment.  </li>
            <li> I usually just buy drugstore foundation cause</li>
            <li> The brush I received was not authentic.</li>
            <li> I had heard they are comparable if not better than my Mac brushes.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday and it has held up!</li>
            <li> I still am not sure that this brush is legit.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday to apply my foundation!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I should buy Sigma brushes from this seller from now on.</li>
            <li> I am sad it is past the point of where I can return or exchange it as I feel totally duped on this product.</li>
            <li> it has definitely stepped up my make up game!</li>
            <li> &amp; I usually use 3-4 pumps with a beauty blender.</li>
            <li> Usually by the time I get home</li>
            <li> I have always used the wedges or pad to apply foundation in the past.</li>
            <li> been using everyday since december and hasnt shed and cleans up like a dream!</li>
            <li> Use it everyday!</li>
            <li> I have trouble getting makeup around my nose and under my eyes and this does it with no issues at all!</li>
            <li> but I just washed the brush to get them back, just a little inconvenient.  </li>
            <li> When I became pregnant my face broke out so bad!</li>
            <li> Sorry I waited so long to purchase.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed of how fast this brush just started to fall apart.</li>
            <li> Just the handle is a little weak</li>
            <li> So now it just sits in my makeup bag because I&#x27;m having a hard time throwing 20 dollars away😕</li>
            <li> but it seems hard to move around my face.</li>
            <li> This brush is hard and smears my makeup.</li>
            <li> This brush is hard to come by because it is always sold out.</li>
            <li> Hardly to none of any fall out.</li>
            <li> Something that&#x27;s hard to come by.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for make up brushes on Amazon and found it really hard to decide if I should choose to go for a make up brush set to \\&quot;save money\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Just have to watch out and not pull too hard on the bristles or the glue that holds it will loosen.</li>
            <li> hard to tell by the picture,</li>
            <li> Working with cream foundation with this brush is hard</li>
            <li> The handle of the brush popped off with hardly any force at all.</li>
            <li> Since the handle is so think, it&#x27;s hard to hang upside when drying,</li>
            <li> Once I received it, I was shocked how soft and dense the brush was.</li>
            <li> Mine however, loses fibers and i find them on my face often</li>
            <li> I went to sigma.com and put in a complaint.</li>
            <li> too high,noot too low that makes you think its a stinks product</li>
            <li> I have never liked wearing foundation bc</li>
            <li> Confusing?</li>
            <li> The package was in an yellow enveloped and the brush was inside a plastic package which disappointment.  </li>
            <li> It sucks up a lot of foundation.</li>
            <li> It needs at least 12 hours from my experience.</li>
            <li> Cheap sponges made my foundation streak horribly and my fingers didn&#x27;t apply as evenly and made me look cakey.</li>
            <li> Also, i&#x27;ve been using the brush with a whipped foundation and as soon as i put some foundation on the brush it seems like it sucks it all up</li>
            <li> Would definitely buy another one as a spare when this one is dirty.</li>
            <li> She is slowly building her makeup collection.</li>
            <li> However, it has shed a few hairs (not happy about that, all I did was touch it).</li>
            <li> Foundation powder was not evenly on my face and some areas had too thick powder.</li>
            <li> I cant wait to try the other brushes from this company!!!!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re avoiding the cakey, blotchy look you should definitely order the Sigma F80 Brush and you wont be sorry!</li>
            <li> Not authentic!</li>
            <li> Not satisfied with my purchase, had to again before getting refund for damaged brush!</li>
            <li> I usually use my hand to apply liquid foundation, never again!</li>
            <li> The brushes feel expensive and they don&#x27;t shed like other types I have tried.  </li>
            <li> and I mean TONS of people talking about it.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have listened to the other reviews that said it was fake and just have bought it off of the sigma website.</li>
            <li> I purchased mine on the Sigma website, due to all the reviews I&#x27;ve read about some of the brushes on here being fake.</li>
            <li> However, the very first time I used it it shed like crazy, like...I&#x27;ve never had a brush shed this bad even my cheaper ones.</li>
            <li> I am appalled that this expensive brush was such low quality.</li>
            <li> I was a little put off by the brush&#x27;s smell, but it&#x27;s really not that bad.  </li>
            <li> Omg this brush seriously does what everyone says it does.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to a standard, boring foundation brush again.</li>
            <li> I have less expensive brushes that don&#x27;t shed like this.</li>
            <li> This always happens to me with less expensive brushes but never with my bobbi browns or even MAC</li>
            <li> You seriously won&#x27;t understand the hype until you get one for yourself.</li>
            <li> so thats a little scary for a pricey brush.</li>
            <li> I used to use the flat foundation brush from Clinique, I mean that brush wasnt bad</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any bad qualities about this brush, such as shedding.  </li>
            <li> and maybe I got a bad one, but the dip came off after the third brush cleaning using the brush cleaner from Bobbi Brown.</li>
            <li> No good, not at all.</li>
            <li> Not to mention the 190 application can be a bit arduous and meticulous.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the packaging was not great because the brush came out and was thrown around the box and the bristles were a mess</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed because it was such an expensive brush and everyone told me to invest in it and that I won&#x27;t regret it,</li>
            <li> I hemmed and hawed over purchasing this brush because I am very skeptical about online reviews since some can be fake or exaggerated, but I finally broke down and bought it after watching a review video on YouTube.  </li>
            <li> Shedding like crazy... pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> , it seriously has changed my makeup game forever.</li>
            <li> So upset and disappointed I&#x27;ve wanted to try these brushes for years finally took the plunge and it falls apart.</li>
            <li> The hairs fall out remaining on my face which is pretty nasty.</li>
            <li> The package is only a plastic bag, it is quite disappointed, because the brush shape might be affected.</li>
            <li> It looks awful no matter how much I try to buff it in!</li>
            <li> The tough thing is cleaning it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick and the bristles don&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> The only con about this brush is that the hairs do stick out a little which do bother me...and the delivery took forever PLUS the packaging was horrible!</li>
            <li> The beauty blender tends to make my hand tired.</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> The seller was NG, which I saw as a verified re-seller on the Sigma website, so I&#x27;m confused.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s the way they are or if this one was poorly manufactured.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over 6 months and have not experienced any shedding.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not getting progressively worse, so</li>
            <li> Yeah, so I&#x27;m not really happy with this purchase and probably won&#x27;t purchase another Sigma brush again.</li>
            <li> the brush hasnt broken off on my skin at ALL</li>
            <li> I did not have the brush for a week and it was broken.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand all the negative reviews about this being a fake brush.</li>
            <li> so now I have a broken brush.</li>
            <li> I am not happy about the construction of this brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost impossible to mess up your foundation when using this brush.</li>
            <li> Brush itself is small and it sheds like crazy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why people are so crazy about this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so dense that I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ll have a hard time cleaning it without ruining the fibers.</li>
            <li> I have tried a million different types of foundation brushes over the years and hated all of them.</li>
            <li> so I am rather disappointed in the cheap workmanship, very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately these brushes didn&#x27;t hold so long, the ferrel fell off just after a week and to say the least both very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The metal part of the metal part of the brush attached to the handle part of the brush arrived slightly lose :(  </li>
            <li> Ether way I was very unhappy with previous four powder brushes.</li>
            <li> I would recommend for everyone to save up (times are tough!)</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, especially for it being so expensive.</li>
            <li> This is a little annoying.</li>
            <li> F80\\&quot; brush is a fake.</li>
            <li> However, I was skeptical because a lot of people get paid a commission every time someone orders.</li>
            <li> I took a chance ordering it from amazon not knowing if I would get a fake brush or not.</li>
            <li> It looks so expensive.</li>
            <li> I was kinda scared to buy from amazon because I saw a lot of reviews about fake brushes.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical, but after reading a bunch of reviews I got it.</li>
            <li> weird...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey for just a mere brush</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> You will not be sorry if you buy it.</li>
            <li> I found this after buying MAC brushes got just too expensive, and I have to say, I can&#x27;t tell the difference.</li>
            <li> Fake brush.</li>
            <li> , you cant go wrong Sigma rules.</li>
            <li> Worst brush ever, used once and returned the next day!  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom because I am obsessed with Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> It was delivered to me on time and was not too expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a bit skeptical.  </li>
            <li> There selling fake brushes if you look on your brush and it says made in Chaina there fake.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t go wrong if you buy this brush</li>
            <li> worst part is that this is the second time this has happened to a Sigma F80 brush.</li>
            <li> However, I feel like this brush could be a fake.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a week and the bristles are dense and are not shedding so even though I feel like it could be fake</li>
            <li> i dont know if im using this wrong</li>
            <li> No matter if they are an authorize store I still think they get some fake ones on the side</li>
            <li> and I suspect its a fake.</li>
            <li> Now for the people who are saying it is fake you can go on the sigma website and see the authorized sellers on amazon if they are not authorized sellers..</li>
            <li> There is a chance your brush might be fake.</li>
            <li> When I received I realized it was fake.</li>
            <li> the brush looks weird</li>
            <li> I think this brush is a fake</li>
            <li> Either this is a fake or SIGMA needs to fire their quality control manager.</li>
            <li> I have to report the brush I received from NG Inc through Amazon as fake.  </li>
            <li> I think I was sold a fake.</li>
            <li> Also...some people on here are claiming this brush is fake when it is NOT.  </li>
            <li> Definitley just buy expensive brushes from now on that can be washed over and over without the glue coming off and ruining the brush.</li>
            <li> , I had some speculation that this seller might be sending out fake brushes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this seller sells fake brushes or I just got a defected one, I have pictures of it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was completely wrong.  </li>
            <li> Pending on the brush, so I guess my brushes aren&#x27;t fake</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with Sigma.</li>
            <li> I have used expensive MAC brushes and this one</li>
            <li> Knowing what works for one doesn&#x27;t always work for another, I was skeptical but purchased this brush anyway.  </li>
            <li> and it is always difficult to blend foundation at my jawline.</li>
            <li> I think this might be a fake.</li>
            <li> I was nervous to order as some people said it was fake.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how wrong I was.</li>
            <li> I gave the fake one to my bff</li>
            <li> I felt the ones on the BB site were too expensive</li>
            <li> I saw some reviews where they said it was fake</li>
            <li> I was unable to touch the brush to my forehead without breaking out.</li>
            <li> and I am obsessed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a really expensive brush before...</li>
            <li> I thought this was a fake brush, but I guess it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> it was a fake.</li>
            <li> and I am seriously thinking about purchasing a spare!!</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin, and the winter time is the worst for me.</li>
            <li> They have a record of my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Finally this weekend I emailed them and told them that I was unhappy about their customer service.</li>
            <li> so it was an awkward process.</li>
            <li> It was really disappointing because I&#x27;ve probably had my ELF brushes longer than this one</li>
            <li> The crazy part is, the brush started like sinking in</li>
            <li> But, the ELF brush shed like crazy (handfuls of taklon fibers fell out--</li>
            <li> and you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> I was wrong!</li>
            <li> … I haven&#x27;t found one thing wrong with this brush!</li>
            <li> I got so mad at myself for not trying this brush before.</li>
            <li> obsessed with using this for my foundation routine!</li>
            <li> The Sigma f80 i received was fake!</li>
            <li> The brush is a fake!</li>
            <li> I can now see why everyone obsessed with this brush!</li>
            <li> This is fake!</li>
            <li> Applying your foundation with anything else will seem so wrong after using this!</li>
            <li> , I was upset I had purchased fake brushes that say made in CHINA :(</li>
            <li> hate when I buy expensive brushes and they shed all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Smells bad</li>
            <li> the hair have been falling off ever since i have it, when i put on foundation some hairs stay in my face, its really bad.</li>
            <li> maybe it was just bad luck</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad</li>
            <li> which was a bad sign</li>
            <li> so I do not understand why it&#x27;s shedding so bad</li>
            <li> Also mine sheds really bad</li>
            <li> Maybe I received part of a bad batch</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is a fake or what, but I am very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This brush is absolutely AMAZING! I&#x27;ve used plenty of brushes in the past for my foundation but this brush leaves the most perfect air-brush-like finish. It certainly exceeded my expectations and I will definitely repurchase it if I have to! I highly recommend this product to any person who is trying to achieve a flawless look!</li>
            <li> Love this brand of brushes and this one is one of my favorites. After purchasing this brush I actually purchased the entire professional set.</li>
            <li> I love it. Its better than mac brushes ♡</li>
            <li> The best powder foundation brush you will ever use. I use this item daily. Has been washed many times and has kept it&#x27;s shape and I have not lost any bristles either.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it! She says it blends so well that she forgets she has makeup on, and it doesn&#x27;t make her foundation streaky like a traditional flat foundation brush.</li>
            <li> Great brush.  Blends so well and is incredible soft.  Arrived very quickly.  Definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li> super soft brush that holds together I haven&#x27;t noticed any bristles coming off.  I would say it just as good of quality as the makeup forever brushes that I have and it was about $10 cheaper.</li>
            <li> I expected this to be top quality because I paid 24 bucks for it but the first time I used it the bristles started falling out. So now it just sits in my makeup bag because I&#x27;m having a hard time throwing 20 dollars away😕</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the quality of this brush - can&#x27;t beat the price too!</li>
            <li> Great foundation brush! It will last forever!</li>
            <li> Love it for application of foundation.  Very soft and makes skin look very good.  Highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Love this brush for buffing in liquid or cream foundation.  Great denisity, no shedding and good balanced handle.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Quick shipping and product was just as described! Love this brush!</li>
            <li> I love this brush! I would recommend it to anyone. I use it with liquid foundation and it spreads perfectly.</li>
            <li> Never Recieved My Package Really Bummed Out I Was Very Excited To Try Out The Sigma Brush. Lets See What Happens Next</li>
            <li> I have used it for liquid and cream foundation and it works perfectly with both. I was using Mac but now i will buy sigma</li>
            <li> Love this brush! Makes my make up looks so good and flawless!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a novice, just watched my first tutorial and decided to try this brush with my mac prolong wear foundation. Love the smooth blending of my foundation. Seconds to get a great blend into my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this for my foundation, the only problem is it sucks up so much product! I&#x27;ve also had mine for a year and it&#x27;s already shedding.</li>
            <li> This brush is AMAZING for applying foundation. It creates such a smooth, flawless finish without even trying. It&#x27;s the best brush I have ever used for foundation application. LOVE it!</li>
            <li> My go to brush!!love!</li>
            <li> Was really amazing at first, and then after only three washes the bristles fell out and was COMPLETELY beyond ruined! Very disappointing since I am a beauty You tube Vlogger and everyone seems to rave about this brush.</li>
            <li> to learn more about this brush and other great makeup tools check out my blog at http://amandagabriella22.blogspot.com this blog is insisted for girls who want to learn more about makeup products</li>
            <li> I love love this sigma brush. I&#x27;ve recently fallen in love with sigma brushes in general; they are great quality at like half the cost of MAC brushes. This is my go to brush for applying foundation. It applies makeup so nicely and gives an air brushed look I HIGHLY recommend the Sigma f80.</li>
            <li> Perfect, apply my makeup flawlessly and dosent leave streaks</li>
            <li> Favorite brush for foundation!! Came fast in the mail also.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for several reasons, the first one is the price, which is not excessive when considering the quality of this item, second, because you will spend less foundation and the results of a better application make all the difference. Finally, because it is very smooth and nothing comes off, as happens with other brushes that I bought before.</li>
            <li> After see the F80 brush on alot of the makeup tutorials I decided to take the plunge and spend more than $5 on a brush and it really is great in applying liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> really great brush! works well for buffing in my foundation since it is a really dense. I have not had any problems with shedding.</li>
            <li> If you are looking at this product and wondering if you should buy it, just do it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is amazing and I am in love! I use this to apply my liquid foundation and it gives me an airbrush finish that is to die for. My makeup has never looked more on point! I even use this to blend out my under eye concealer and it just does wonders. I am so in love with this brush, it&#x27;s just unreal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this brush as well as the small angle and flat kabuki and Sigma threw in an extra blending brush as a gift. I personally think the quality of these brushes is just as good, if not better, than M.A.C&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy my brushes for Sigma forever!</li>
            <li> Amazing brush!!! So smooth!!! Love it!</li>
            <li> I heard about this brush so much that I had to get my hands on it and I&#x27;ve fallen in love with it</li>
            <li> I saw a video of someone using this brush to apply foundation, hers looked flawless so I purchased it. Maybe it&#x27;s my foundation but it seems hard to move around my face. Maybe it&#x27;ll get easier with time. I like it overall.</li>
            <li> I think this \\&quot;Sigma F80\\&quot; brush is a fake. It says made in China on the back of the brush. &amp; I believe sigma brushes are made on the US. :( very disappointed. I will be purchasing from the real Sigma beauty website  and make a comparison. But I will try out this brush and see how well this performs.</li>
            <li> The best foundation brush I&#x27;ve ever tried. It leaves the skin soooo natural looking  even if it has foundation on it! Just great! plus, it takes twice less time to get the nice flawless look. My clients will love it too!</li>
            <li> I originally heard about these brushes online from beauty gurus. I heard nothing but amazing reviews. However, I was skeptical because a lot of people get paid a commission every time someone orders. So I wasn&#x27;t sure how true and genuine everyone opinions were. Well I decided to order &amp; I fell in love with it from the moment I took it out of the package. I get a flawless even finish everytime I use it! I LOVE LOVE LOVE this brush &amp; will buy again if anything ever happens to my other one! Worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li> Strongly recommended. Love it. Very good quality.</li>
            <li> Sephora has a way better foundation brush. This brush is hard and smears my makeup.</li>
            <li> cant believe I ever used any other brush before this one. Works great at putting on foundation.</li>
            <li> I saw these brushes often on YouTube videos. Always wondered is they really worked. They do. Helps foundation look flawless. Easy to use and cleans up very well with mild soap. (I use baby shampoo to clean my makeup brushes).</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I use it everyday for applying my makeup. I would recommend this item to all people.</li>
            <li> Great foundation brush.  I use liquid foundation and I what I noticed about this brush is that I use less foundation and my coverage is more natural on my face.  I use Bobbi Brown brush cleansing spray. A couple of sprays on a paper towel swipe brush back and forth then let brush dry.  Im ready for the next day. Will order this brush again.</li>
            <li> I bought this after seeing countless YouTube beauty gurus recommend this brush over and over again. After seeing this brush recommended so many times I had pretty high expectations. People were claiming it gave you an &amp;#34;airbrushed finish&amp;#34; and saying it was their favorite makeup brush ever. I took a chance ordering it from amazon not knowing if I would get a fake brush or not. After reading through the Sigma website, they state which companies are certified sellers of their brushes. The company that was selling this brush through amazon was one listed on the Sigma website so I felt confident that I would get a genuine brush. Once I received it, I was shocked how soft and dense the brush was. I washed it before I used it and it did not shed any bristles. I use it almost every time I put on foundation and it is now my favorite way to apply foundation. It really does give the most coverage and while I don&#x27;t know how an airbrushed finish looks, it is the best my foundation has ever looked. The only negative I can think of is that it is really hard to wash the product out of the brush because the brush is so dense. I washed it multiple times and there is still traces of foundation in the center. Overall, I would highly recommend trying this brush.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush for blending your finished look together, but I bought it for applying cream/ liquid/ mineral foundation.  THE BEST Flat Kabuki brush for foundation and stippling is the Bdellium #957.  Sometimes they call it precision cheek, sometimes flat kabuki... same brush.  Depends on what you are looking to do!</li>
            <li> THE best foundation brush out there. If you think they are all the same, so did I, until I got this one. The foundation goes on smoothly and perfectly. Never got a perfect finish before and would never think the brush was the problem. Love it!</li>
            <li> 2 days after ordering my brush I was pleased to find it waiting in my mail box! So excited I ran inside and tried it out.  The brush is so soft and gave me the airbrushed look I had been trying to achieve for years!  I cannot wait to buy more sigma brushes!!! THANK YOU SOOOOO MUCH!!!&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li> I love this brush! I watched my favorite YouTubers use this brush and finally, after all 3 of my ladies said yeah to this, to get. I ordered it via prime, got it in 2 days. Washed it and let it air dry (overnight). The next morning I used my other brush because I forgot about this one drying, but day 2 I grabbed this. I will never use another brush again to apply my foundation. This is fantastic! Buffs the foundation in so easily (I use Clinique Even Better Skin foundation). Gets into the crease of my nose, under my eyes, around my hairline all with easy. This brush is perfect in my small girly hand. After two days of use, I washed it again (with Dr. Bonner&#x27;s Peppermint liquid soap, a little drop in warm soapy water, just swishing brush into a cup of the soapy water, rinse the cup, add just warm water and dip the brush in and swishing until all traces of makeup was gone, then using my fingers to push off excess water and allow to air dry), absolutely no fall out, the brush was still soft and ready to use the next day. This is a two thumbs up kind of brush for me.</li>
            <li> Omg I love love love this kabuki brush it&#x27;s wonderful.. I herd so many good things about the sigma line and I always just kept saying I&#x27;ll wait but finaly I broke down and got one now for sure I&#x27;m going to be buying the rest of the brushes:) I highly recomend that people try this product it&#x27;s worth the money and Its gonna last u forever as long as u take care of them ... So people buy sigma:)</li>
            <li> I was so excited when i ordered this product. I have heard so many good things about it. I was very happy when I recieved this product. The packaging was really nice and it did not have a strong smell or any sort of bad smell to it at all. The bristles is very smooth, and very dense. This brush is perfect for applying liquid foundation, cream and powder foundation, but i only use it for liquid foundation. Applying your liquid foundation is heaven.  It so smooth and it doesnt take more than 3 minutes to get that flawless skin. Cleaning the brush is a pain though. It takes so long to dry, approximately 2 days. Also, the liquid foundation that you use leaves stain in the brush.  No matter how much baby shampoo I use to clean it, the stain is still there. But other than the cleaning problem the F80 brush is totally worth it!!!</li>
            <li> This brush is soft and blends well. It has the benefits of both a duo-fibre and a kabuki, which I like. This was worth the money.</li>
            <li> This brush is super soft, super effective, and super easy to maintain. Thanks so much! Makes liquid foundation a breeze.</li>
            <li> My sister that lives in Spain, told me about this makeup brush. I was a bit reluctant to order a brush to put on liquid makeup, but after having for several day WOW how did I live with out it. It provides great coverage for liquid makeup. It is very soft and the handle seems strong. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love love love this brush! It is so soft. It blends out my foundation to an airbrush finish. The brush has a pretty fat handle and I like it because it gives you more control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sigma Makeup is a great company!</li>
            <li> I really like this brush. I recently started wearing foundation but I didn&#x27;t have a proper brush to apply it with. My other brushes just didn&#x27;t cut it. My stippling brush wouldn&#x27;t blend well, it would leave me looking blotchy and streaky where the foundation just sat on my skin. My other brush would just pick up too much product and leave me looking cakey. I finally decided to try this one based on much research and good reviews. I love it to say the least. It picks up less product and gives my skin an airbrushed natural finish. Best of all it applies foundation so quickly because of it&#x27;s size. I can&#x27;t recommend this brush enough. I plan to order two more when I can. It didn&#x27;t shed one bit and best of all it is unbelievably soft. When I first received it I couldn&#x27;t help but keep running it along my face.</li>
            <li> This is the best Kabuki brush that I have ever used!</li>
            <li> I would normally use a sponge for foundation but this brush works great. It&#x27;s so soft and really helps to minimize pores. Gives the skin a more airbrushed look. Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I just recently purchased my mac foundation and this brush worked wonders for my skin. It&#x27;s very easy to apply and it gives a very smooth a flawless finish.</li>
            <li> Love this brush for liquid foundation!</li>
            <li> I like the feel of this brush, however, I did not see a difference in how my make-up looked. It appears to be a good quality brush.</li>
            <li> Happy customer. Item arrived faster than expected, very soft and applies make up flawlessly.</li>
            <li> Love this brush! I am fairly new to using a brush to apply my foundation. It just seemed so time consuming, but it is definitely worth the effort. This is the fourth brush I have tried and it is absolutely the best. This brush feels amazing, applies foundation evenly and the hairs shed very little( just 3 or 4 the first time I used it). The finish to my foundation is great with this brush and the blending capabilities are fantastic. Can&#x27;t recommend this brush enough![[ASIN:B003UH0528 Sigma Beauty Flat Top Synthetic Kabuki - F80]]</li>
            <li> Now that i have this brush, i use it every day. It is a beyond amazing foundation brush that you have to have! It blends my foundation so well and gives me the perfect flawless but natural look that i want! I love this brush so much and i dont regret my purchase at all. I defenitly am planning on buying more sigma brushes!</li>
            <li> This brush is everything that the positive reviews said it was. The bristle are great for applying foundation and the handle is nice and sturdy. The quality is as good if not better than my $40 MAC brushes. Hardly any bristles fell out during my initial use. Currently looking for my next Sigma brush to add to my collection!</li>
            <li> ok so im starting to do makeup and i been using the regular flat foundation brush everyone uses, and i have very dry skin, the brush would make my face look cakey and streaky. so i started searching for a good brush to give me a flawless kinda airbrushed look. i got on youtube i seen like hundreds of videos and alot of ppl were raving about the sigma synthetic kabuki brush so im like im soo getting thisss, it seems like its worth the $16, i ordered it the shipping was awesome it arrived like 3 days later i think or 2 days later, i tried it with my revlon photoready foundation and omggggg i looked like i was photoshopped i looked so flawless and natural i loveee it!!! i cant say good enough things about this. u guys should get this brush it works wonders.</li>
            <li> This brush is AMAZING! it makes my foundation go on so easily and creates an airbrushed finish. I previously was using a standard foundation brush but found that it left streaks and made me look somewhat cakey. this brush changed the way i do makeup and i HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
            <li> I ordered the f80 a couple of weeks ago and I was surprised that I got my brush in 2 days, so i was very happy with the shipping. I was expecting to get it in a week or so. I am absolutely in love with this brush, I love how flawlessly I can apply my foundation. I&#x27;ve always used a sponge to apply my foundation but it always left streaks and I felt the sponge was eating up my foundation. But I am so happy I finally decided to get this brush. I think this is a must have and is a basic essential for a stater. I&#x27;m in love with this product. No streaks with this one.</li>
            <li> Initially this brush was great worked wonderfully but after continued use the brush bristles came loose and started coming out.  The whole bristle head was moving and falling out, maybe I just got a bad one.</li>
            <li> First of all, I must say that I&#x27;m impressed about how fast it was delivered and how beautiful the packaging was.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is everything it promisses and more. The best foundation brush I ever had.</li>
            <li> The Sigma Flat Top Kabuki Brush is just wonderful!  It is very soft to the skin and easy to use. Makeup goes on evenly and smoothly. I am so glad I decided to purchase this brush.  I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read a lot about the Sigma brushes and seen several videos on Youtube.com reviewing and recommending them. And I&#x27;m not at all disappointed with my purchase! It&#x27;s really great brush and it&#x27;s incredibly inexpensive! This brush is just as good as many of the more expensive brushed from Bobbi Brown, Lancôme etc. It works great with liquid foundation and creates a smooth and streak free surface on the skin. I use it everyday and even carry it with me touch up or just to blend during the day. It&#x27;s also a great blush for simply blending foundation + bronzer + blush together so that the result is natural and flawless. I highly recommend this brush and I plan on trying more Sigma brushes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nanna Rose (Denmark)</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this Sigma flat top kabuki brush and it is a great brush to blend my foundation with. I use it to stipple my foundation on and then i buff it out. It is great! The brush doesnt shed one bit and it is super soft! If you dont have this brush you need to buy one asap.</li>
            <li> I bought a MAC 187 for $45 a month ago and I absolutely hated the quality. In order to get an airbrushed effect I went ahead and bought this Sigma brush for $16. Not only did it do the job right, but it was also incredibly soft and dense. Definitely don&#x27;t invest in a MAC brush when Sigma brushes do it better - for less!</li>
            <li> i love it use it everyday and i am going to order many more sigma brushes because of this brush!</li>
            <li> I order a Kabuki F 80. first was delivery 10 day earlier than the one expected, its a excellent merchandise. i recommend for all apprentice or profecional in the beauty business..[[ASIN:B003UH0528 Sigma Beauty Flat Top Synthetic Kabuki - F80]]</li>
            <li> I used this brush to apply my liquid foundation. because it is so dense, it makes it easier to apply foundation evenly and blend out. also it gives more coverage than applying by hand. I highly recommend the brush! but I haven&#x27;t tried applying any cream or powder foundation..</li>
            <li> OMG I absolutely love this brush , It&#x27;s so soft &amp; perfect for applying your foundation &amp; powder. Also the price is really affordable. Everyone should really buy sigma products there the best :)</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B003UH0528 Sigma Beauty Flat Top Synthetic Kabuki - F80]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! I got this brush last week and I fell in love with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is NOW and will be forever my favorite foundation brush, the bristles are super duper soft and dense, can be used to apply primer, foundation (liquid or powder), tinted moisturizer or anything you want to put on your face really. They are the perfect size; big enough for all over your face and small enough to get into the small places like around your nose for example. It required no pressure, all I had to do was work in circular movements making sure the brush had contact with my skin. Basically, the brush did all the work. The overall end result was smooth foundation on my face, a second skin. They give the most flawless look, I looked airbrushed and no shedding at all &#x3D;) I just love the finish it gives my skin. I recommend this to everyone and I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> My foundation looks so much better since purchasing this brush. Love!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent brush.  I use it to buff out my cream foundation.  The bristles are soft and very dense.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine and I had an event to go to and were getting ready at her house. She has this foundation brush, therefore I had the chance to try it out. It is truly amazing! Your foundation goes on flawless and even. I ordered one for myself the next day. Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> i absoultely love this brush. It is the softest brush i have ever used to do my makeup. I use this brush for face powders usually to set my liquid foundation. you can really tell the difference in my makeup. i would definitly recommend this brush. I plan on buying many more brushes from Sigma, they will most likely be the only brushes that I will use for my makeup. the brush was not expensive at all. It is worth the money. i did not expect the quality to be so good, because this was the first brush i had purchased from them, but it is amazing. i love it.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing! I used a flat foundation brush from MAC for about 8 years and decided to try this brush based on Carli Bybel recommending it. I am so happy I did!! Using the exact same foundation and only changing the brush, my makeup looks nearly flawless and using circular blending motions with the brush while applying the foundation gives you almost a photoshopped look. I am truly impressed with what a difference this brush makes. It is also incredibly soft to the touch but sturdy enough to not completely give way while you are applying foundation. This brush is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Best makeup brush for liquid foundation. I get flawless results using this brush.</li>
            <li> The brush is worth the hype. Mine however, loses fibers and i find them on my face often</li>
            <li> The item came to me 4 days after ordering it! Very pleased with the fast shipping! So happy i ordered this brush, it was worth the money! My foundation applies on flawlessly and makes me skin look amazing. If you&#x27;re avoiding the cakey, blotchy look you should definitely order the Sigma F80 Brush and you wont be sorry! [[ASIN:B003UH0528 Sigma Beauty Flat Top Synthetic Kabuki - F80]]</li>
            <li> This is without doubt, the most amazing brush for applying liquid foundation, leaving an airbrushed finish! I love these synthetic brushes, Sigma has the best brushes I&#x27;ve ever used. It cuts application time in half, leaves a beautiful, natural look and they are so easy to clean. Thank you, Sigma for the wonderful products!!</li>
            <li> The brush is soft, very dense, and works amazing! I will definitely be ordering from Sigma in the future. This brush is unlike any other that I have tried. I will use it to put on my liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> I originally was looking for the M.A.C. 180 brush after watching a couple of makeup artists&#x27; videos and recommendations for the best brush for applying foundation, however, I was dissapointed to found out that M.A.C. has since discontinued that brush. I then began searching for a brush comparable to the M.A.C. 180 and continued to find high praises for the Sigma F80 brush. After reading great review after great review, I decided to purchase it, and boy am I glad I did. This brush give a flawless application ( I prefer to stipple it over the face for an airbrushed look, as opposed to swirling it on). I wish I knew how much I would have like this brush, as I would have likely bought the synthetic collection. My next purchase will probably be the brush cleaning kit, so I make sure I don&#x27;t damage my new favorite brush!</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft.  I love that the bristles are tightly packed and sturdy.  It does a great job of getting foundation into the skin rather that just sitting on top of it.  The size of the brush is also perfect.  I have washed it and it seems to be holding up well.  Great brush!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush! Before I got it I would apply my foundation with my fingers. It would look ok, but sometimes my face seemed cakey. After I started using this brush my face looks like I am not wearing any makeup and my skin looks flawless. The brush really distributes the product evenly and it is very soft, so it doesn&#x27;t hurt your skin. I&#x27;m super happy that I got it! &amp;lt;3</li>
            <li> Is this a real sigma brush? So disappointed after paying $20+ on one brush I did not expect for it to totally come apart on the FIRST washing! So upset and disappointed I&#x27;ve wanted to try these brushes for years finally took the plunge and it falls apart. So glad I only purchased one!</li>
            <li> Love the brush. Seller is good with confirmation and shipping time. Got my order on time as promised. Would buy from this seller again when need a new brush/additional brush.</li>
            <li> Loved this brush so much I bought one for my cousin we both use it on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a brush hoarder. I admit it. I recently found out about this line of brushes and the F80 in particular from Alexandrea Garza&#x27;s YouTube channel. She has awesome vlogs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is FABULOUS for applying foundation! It spreads product evenly without streaking and buffs it to a fabulous finish. It doesn&#x27;t waste product and it doesn&#x27;t shed, even straight out of the box! Definitely LOVE it!</li>
            <li> September 5, 2010:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping is super fast and the brush is well packaged. It comes in a cute red bag with a free gift, the travel size blending brush E25. Even get happier after using the brush. It works effectively with liquid foundation. I end up looking flawless when applying my foundation in a stippling motion. The bristle is so soft and dense. Most importantly, it didn&#x27;t shed! Not even a single bristle! The best part is, I bought TWO!! Sigma F80 is definitely the best foundation brush ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated review (Oct 24, 2011):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this brush in September, 2010. Now, after a year, i have no choice but to throw both brushes away....why?...coz after using it for a couple of months, it sheds horribly...it just won&#x27;t stop. Finally, the remaining bristles just pop out from the ferule...eeeew[...] this brush is my biggest regret!</li>
            <li> Purchased the Sigma F80 flat top synthetic kabuki and I absolutely love it! It&#x27;s perfect for your final dusting of mineral veil or loose powder. The brush is so fine and so soft that you end up with an air-brushed look. Awesome! It definitely is a must have.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing brush, know i can apply my favorite drugstore foundation and have an airbrush look. This brush is amazing, my foundation looks great on my skin with this brush! This is the best brush for have an airbrush finish!</li>
            <li> Love the brush. Bought it because of the hype built around it. Smaller than my elf brush but I think it&#x27;ll get the job done</li>
            <li> Beautiful for smooth airbrushed looking and it&#x27;s not fake the seller is listed on sigma website as amazon aouthoriser.</li>
            <li> I had heard great things about this brush and finally decided to cave in, buy it, and give it a try. So glad I did...it is GREAT. I have applied mineral and liquid makeup with this brush and they both look absolutely wonderful when applied with this brush. The brush just makes your foundation look so much better and smoother than if you applied your foundation with your fingers or a sponge. Since the bristles are so dense the coverage is great and you get a flawless &#x27;airbrushed&#x27; effect. I like this brush better than any of my MAC of Bare Escentuals brushes. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I had read a lot about this brush. The reviews were right. This a marvellous brush for mineral makeup application. I used it this morning and my makeup blended like a charm. Thanks Sigma for another great product!</li>
            <li> I use this with my mineral foundation and I love it. There is no fall out so far and I just saw Sigma coming out with two more brushes! LOVE</li>
            <li> I ordered this item in March for this year. I know that after you wash it, its supposed to shed a bit, but this started shedding like crazy, i ignored it and kept using, since then the whole thing has called apart! I can&#x27;t say that i use this brush everyday because i don&#x27;t, i alternate between a beauty blender and the F80. Im mostly using the beauty blender for simple looks. This seller is either selling knock offs or i got a defective one, because there is no way that in less than a year a whole chunk of it can fall off! I know how to wash them too, I&#x27;ve been working with make-up and makeup brushes professionally for quite some time!</li>
            <li> The shipping on this was super fast!! This brush is really soft and fat, which means better stippling.  I also was surprised to find a travel size blending brush with my order.  I will definitely be ordering from Sigma again!</li>
            <li> This is the best Kabuki brush i have ever owned!  I have bought a couple kabuki brushes to get a flawless application and this one is my FAVOURITE! The short and dense bristles make it so easy to buff your liquid foundation. Its easy to clean and I can&#x27;t be more happy with all the sigma brushes i recently bought!  If your thinking about buying good quality brushes then you should order the Sigma line!!</li>
            <li> I love this brush. It is perfect for mineral makeup and creates a flawless finish. I could not live without this brush!!</li>
            <li> I love the product...the brush is so soft and the hairs stay intact. Delivery was very prompt, as well. I highly recommend...</li>
            <li> Love this brush! Great quality!</li>
            <li> Not absolutely crazy about this product. I use it on days when I don&#x27;t feel like using my real techniques brush. Others seem to love it. I just don&#x27;t have the same opinion.</li>
            <li> Sigma F80 is a great brush, well worth its excellent reviews all over the web! It is dense but soft, and feels very nice when touching the skin. I use F80 for applying liquid foundation, which is very easy and super fast when working with the brush. What&#x27;s even more important, the finish is perfectly even and smooth (much more so than when applying the foundation with my fingers). Cleaning the brush is very easy too, and it dries faster than I expected (I wash it with water and shampoo in the evening, and it&#x27;s ready to be used the following day). I haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding so far. All in all, a great purchase!</li>
            <li> This is a great brush for foundation. I love it. My friend suggested this brush to me. And I&#x27;m happy I bought it.</li>
            <li> I really didnt think a makeup brush could make such a difference, but it did! I wont use anything else to put my foundation on. This is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush after searching reviews for a flat top applicator for foundations and blushes. I love that this buffs product into the skin and disperses any extra that you might not want left behind.  I also LOVE that it can be used with both foundation and blushes.  When I received the brush, there was some minor shedding, but it has stopped. At the time of this purchase, I bought only this brush - I wanted to test the quality of this line.  But I have since ordered several other brushes from Sigmabeauty.com - I bought another F80 (from this page), the F50 (duo fiber brush similar, but longer looser fibers), F40 (angled contour/blush brush), and the E25 (for eyes - cream shadows, shading, blending - a workhorse).  I cannot wait to receive my additional brushes and will most likely order more as I identify holes in my brush collection.</li>
            <li> It is so dense and when I use it I feel like have to pat the foundation in and it kind of feels uncomfortable, because the bristles don&#x27;t move well. The application is not full coverage and appears streaky. I was disappointed when I received this item seeing as it is a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; in the beauty world, it did not live up to my expectations. Now I could be wrong, I&#x27;ve washed the brush twice and the density and tightness is still the same. I was hoping it would become wider and easier to swift around but it has not. Can anyone let me know if this brush is the kind you have to break in and use a lot.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with how fast this product reached me! I received it a few days after ordering it and was very excited!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this brush! It is SOOO soft! And it is a great quality brush too! I had been wanting this for quite some time, and am so glad I finally have it! It is great for applying powder, and also liquid foundation. Now I want 2, one for each purpose!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only negative was the brush protector. That plastic thing that covers the brush so the bristles stay intact. It wouldn&#x27;t come off! It was too tight, so I had to cut it off. Normally I like to keep those, to help the brushes keep their shape. It&#x27;s not that big a deal though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this brush! It&#x27;s great quality, for not too bad a price, and am I am so happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> This brush was too cute and I had to buy it.  Uses much less product than other kabuki&#x27;s that I&#x27;ve tried.  As soon as I gave this a few test runs, I ordered the round top kabuki, that&#x27;s how great it is.  After washing, it took less than a day to dry, however it was pretty hot so I don&#x27;t know the drying time in other climates.  I actually used this sort of like a stippling brush and the effect was AMAZING.  Excellent coverage inclusive of the &#x27;airbrushed&#x27; look(I found in the past you had to give up one for the other).  Very very pleased and definitely will be buying other products like it in the future.</li>
            <li> I got my sigma synthetic kabuki in the mail today. When I opened it, I was surprise on how gorgeous it looks! It looks so expensive. Definitely going to buy my brushes here at sigma.</li>
            <li> I heard about this brush from a YouTube makeup tutorial and I am glad I took her advice and bought it.  It gives an even airbrushed look!  It also came in nice packaging.  I would highly recommend trying this brush.</li>
            <li> I love this brush so much. This was my first high-quality makeup brush purchase and I love it. I just started getting into makeup like foundation and powder and it was recommended that I get a brush. I thought that by buying a expensive brush like Mac I would have the best quality. Not always true. This brush was 16$ compared to a 40$ brush from Mac and it is well worth  it. The bristles are soft to the touch and I love it so much. It&#x27;s great for powder, blush, and foundation since it is a flat top. It&#x27;s affordable and high quality and I would recommend this to friend.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush!  It&#x27;s great for applying my liquid foundation (estee lauder double wear).  I have not noticed any bad qualities about this brush, such as shedding.  Overall I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I had heard so many wonderful reviews on the sigma brushes and was so excited to receive My sigma kabuki.I absolutely loved how they packaged the brush and the shipping only took a few days.This brush is perfect for applying foundation and giving that all over coverage without being cakey.I will definately be buying more products from them in the near future.So happy with this product I am going to go do my makeup and have a blast showing off how good it looks around town,lol.Thank you Sigma for creating such great products:)</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush after seeing it mentioned on a makeup forum.  First, the shipping was fast and the brush came well protected and in a cute red bag.  The brush does a fantastic job in applying liquid foundation to create an \\&quot;airbrushed\\&quot; look.  The brush is incredible soft, does not shed (like other brushes I have) and is easy to clean.  I will definitely be purchasing more Sigma brushes in the future.</li>
            <li> Fav brush!! Omg I love this for my liquid foundation!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this Brush, this brush is not apart of the kit but I figured that I must have it! This brush is excellent for applying mineral foundations and blush! I will order another one for myself since I purchased this one and the 12 piece set for my kit. i also tested this brush out on liquid foundation and it gives a nice airbrushed look. Thanks Sigma I will be buying again oh and by the way I was expecting the shipment to take a full 7-10 days I got this with my other brush kit in 2 days!!!</li>
            <li> I love this brush for applying my liquid foundation. Its super soft and really gives an amazing finish.  I use it everyday.  It drys really fast for me. I have read reviews and watched videos about it and everyone seems to complain that it takes along time to dry and mine took roughly 12-15 hours to dry.  I washed it at around 5 or 6pm and it was ready to go at 730am the next day, and its not even summer. My brushes always dry a lot faster in the summer.  Amazing brush I&#x27;m even thinking of getting a second one as a backup just in case.</li>
            <li> Very dense&lt;br /&gt;Not very big&lt;br /&gt;Great for buffing&lt;br /&gt;Hard to clean&lt;br /&gt;Tips of brush get stained&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a brush guard&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t shed&lt;br /&gt;Soft&lt;br /&gt;Smells bad&lt;br /&gt;The end</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the E.L.F. Powder brush for awhile and loved it. Not to discredit their brushes but after repeated usage and washing,they do not feel the same after awhile. I&#x27;ve had to replace them often because I couldn&#x27;t find anything comparable.&lt;br /&gt;I heard about this brush from youtube and got it.For the cost of replacing my former brushes, I bought one Sigma brush. It is unbelievably soft and dense! I heard it will last as long as you take care of it. I&#x27;m definitely going to be purchasing their other brushes as well. I&#x27;m hooked!!!!!</li>
            <li> I had heard about this brush through YouTube read great&lt;br /&gt;reviews about it through makeupalley.com. I recently started to get into make up and I absolutely had to have this brush. I am so happy with the quickness of the shipment because I ordered it on Sunday and received it on Wednesday, just like my confirmation email had said. I am very happy with the efficiency and promptness of the seller and all the reviews I&#x27;ve read cannot do justice to my exceeded satisfaction with this product. Everybody should have this brush and should order it through amazon if you want it as quickly as I did.</li>
            <li> the best  foundation brush ever</li>
            <li> I have never owned a good makeup brush. I usually use drugstore brushes, or the tiny ones that come with the makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I read so many great reviews about the Sigma brushes, that I had to try it. I actually can&#x27;t describe my love of this brush. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now, and I don&#x27;t know how I ever did my makeup without it. Such an airbrushed look to my foundation. Perfect for foundation and powders, as well as buffing out harsh blush lines. No shedding of the hairs, and so, so soft. My makeup looks smooth and beautiful. Thanks!!!!!</li>
            <li> As a first timer this brush lets me feel that I&#x27;m a pro! I love the brush specially when putting liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush because I usually use stippling brushes to apply my foundation and I was needing a new one due to my other one falling apart. I must say this brush is awesome and gives me a good airbrushed look with my MAC foundation. Highly recommended. Quality is equal to if not greater then mac. So far no bristles have fallen out! Thanks Sigma!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know if I would be anymore impressed with Sigma brushes than the other brushes I already have, but I am!  This brush is the softest, most dense and well made brush that I own.  I love how my base looks like it has been airbrushed on, a really great brush!  I will definitely purchase more!</li>
            <li> I got this brush after seeing numerous utube videos. im a long time mac user and as soon as i used this to apply my liquid foundation my makeup was flawless, like I had been literally photoshopped! I&#x27;m definately now a SIGMA brush user alllll the way, i just bought two more foundation brushes and have the eyeshadow brush collection too. LOVEEE sigma now!!</li>
            <li> I have used every type of makeup (liquid, mousse, cream, powder, mineral, etc.) and have never achieved that flawless look I wanted. I have used Revlon CS since it has worked best for me for about a year, but it wasn&#x27;t 100% flawless... I read a ton of reviews on this brush and saw a lot of youtube makeup guru&#x27;s use it, so I figured why not...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEST. DECISION. EVER! This brush is AMMAZZZING!!!! It gives me that 100% flawless, airbrushed look! The Revlon CS usually feels slightly heavy when I wear it, and this buffs it out so beautifully and makes it feel so lightweight. I used it with mineral powder foundation, and it worked wonders with it as well.&lt;br /&gt;It can be used for foundation, blush, bronzer, finisher, anything really! it is so versatile! I will never go back to my old ways, I am using this brush FOREVER! beautiful, dense, wonderful brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE get this brush, you will not regret it at all! It is worth every single cent!</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I bought it because of a makeup tutorial I found online that used it and said it was just  as good it&#x27;s MAC equivalent. I put my foundation on with my fingers and then use this to lightly blend it. It looks amazing. More natural and less cakey. No streaks or uneven patches.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that i finally purchased this brush and spent the extra money. Sigma really is a great brand! I use this when I apply my foundation in the morning and the coverage is great and the brush is so smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this brush! I am a former \\&quot;finger\\&quot; foundation applier because no sponge or brush worked for me in the past. I was not willing to pay $30 &amp; up for a high end brush that might work, so I stuck with my fingers. This brush applies foundation just as smooth as my fingers. You get no streaks with this brush, and it does not shed on me. The handle is a nice weight, the brush stays intact after washing with every single use, and the ends are super soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am really pleased with this brand. The packaging alone is amazing because it comes with tons of cards and information on their products. You get a draw string satchel, your brush comes with a plastic guard inside of another plastic guard, and I got a free product! Just beautiful all the way around, with super fast shipping. I highly recommend. I use this brush to apply liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> I love it! It is a great quality brush! Wish I learnd about Sigma earlier, would&#x27;ve saved lots of money.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazingly soft and very well made. It does not shed unlike other brushes I have purchased from companies. I will be purchasing again very soon.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush. It is a great quality. It&#x27;s soft and dense and allows me to put on my foundation effortlessly and flawlessly. It is worth the price. Application is professional grade and is very easy.</li>
            <li> I love this brush so much! I use it every single day! It&#x27;s my favorite foundation brush and just favorite brush in general! It&#x27;s totally worth the $16 for sure! It&#x27;s a super soft brush! I love it so much becuase it&#x27;s so unique becuase sigma is the only place where they had this brush. No other company has a brush like this so I was so excited! I totally recommend this brush it&#x27;s a 5 star for sure! :)</li>
            <li> This is a great foundation brush, ive tried many brushes but this one seems to be the best. It doesnt shed it gives great coverage and its a great price.this one is definately a keeper. I even told my mom about it and she tried it and loved it and she was not even use to using brushes to apply foundation but now in going to buy her one and my sister one they fell in love with it when they tried it. Great job on this brush sigma and on all the others too, I heard those were great as well.</li>
            <li> Not authentic! This brush should have came in a Sigma box and stamped with a hand Chechen by sigma beauty. I got my brush in a over larged Manila envelope with nothing protecting my brush not even plastic! The bristles on the brush were damaged! Something from sigma that is authentic would not come this way! I ordered from a different buyer the b05 body brush and caned boxed! Disappointed! Order from Sigma!</li>
            <li> I have tried a million different types of foundation brushes over the years and hated all of them. This particular brush was recomennded to me and now i CANT LIVE WITHOUT IT! Your liquid foundation goes on flawlessly and quik! This brush does not shed and is suuper soft on your skin. Everyone needs this brush!</li>
            <li> I doubt if it is an authentic one. My brush is starting to come apart. I got to use this brush only a week or so.</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering from Sigma, and I love them!!! This brush is super soft and great to apply liquid foundation...plus I got it super fast! I really recommend Sigma brushes &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I just got this in mail today and i tried it out for the first time and I absolutely love it!  The bristles are very tightly compacted so when you buff it on your skin, it leaves a very airbrushed effect on your make up. I like using this with my channel bronze universal cause it&#x27;s very synthetic and compact. It works well with creams and liquids.</li>
            <li> its okay. tried it since its a cult favorite but I don&#x27;t love it.  Product quality is fine tho.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  It works like magic, great feel and results.  It is a great product.  It applies the foundation even and perfect and it feels great on my skin.  the brush came in a beautiful red sheer bag, very well packed with brush protector and a guide on what the name of the brush is and what it is used for.  I only wished that the shipping was free or there was an offer to have free shipping since the cost for shipping for a product that is $16 was $6.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re deciding whether or not to order this brush, I think you should definitely get it, because at first I thought this brush was just a rave, but then I actually tried it and I think it&#x27;s just amazing! I&#x27;m going to get the full Sigma brush set as soon as possible. As far as I can see in this brush, Sigma&#x27;s brushes are top quality! Make sure to wash your brushes before use though. I love this brush :)</li>
            <li> I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS BRUSH, IT MAKES MY LIQUID FOUNDATION GO ON FLAWLESSLY! THIS WAS MY FIRST SIGMA PURCHASE AND I WILL BE SHOPPING WITH THEM AGAIN VERY SOON! THE SHIPPING WAS SUPER FAST AND THE PACKAGING WAS VERY NICE. THE BRUSH ITSELF IS SUPER SOFT AND I HAVENT HAD ANY SHEDDING AS OF YET. I AM EXCITED TO TRY THEIR OTHER BRUSHES SOON!</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t say enough about this brush. I&#x27;ve told all of my friends. All sigma brushes are so soft and beautiful with no fallout what so ever. My skin and makeup looks significantly better since having received them! I purchased this along with the brush roll set and I highly recommend you do the same. You will not regret it. The price is right and the quality is astonishing. Never again will I use my MAC brushes. Sigma brushes are number one. Give them a shot!</li>
            <li> I really am in love with this brush. I use it to apply my BB cream for better coverage and it does its job.  I have had mine for around 6 months now and it&#x27;s still in great condition.  It is one of the best brushes I have tried. The thing to remember about brushes is they only last as well as you take care of them.  I keep mine clean and I keep them protected. I plan to buy more sigma brushes and this one again if anything happens to the one I have now.</li>
            <li> I like the concept of this brush, the reviews are amazing - however - it doesn&#x27;t compare to my MAC 187 duo fiber brush for liquid foundation application.  I find that I have to apply the foundation twice to get full coverage with this brush.. maybe i&#x27;m doing something wrong?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does look great when I use 2 coats of make up but i don&#x27;t have to do that when I use the mac brush.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with my liquid foundation and I really like the results. I&#x27;ve been using mineral makeup for years now and decided to I needed a little more coverage. So, I bought Revlon color stay and I like applying it with this brush for a more airbrush look instead of a thick mask of foundation that I get from using my fingers. The brush is firm but soft so it isn&#x27;t scratchy on your face! I&#x27;ve washed the brush several times and use it pretty much every day and haven&#x27;t noticed loose hairs falling out. All in all, I&#x27;m very happy with this brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush almost every day for the past two months and I can honestly say that it&#x27;s a great brush. Blends the foundation flawlessly and gives the skin an airbrushed finish. The brush itself is very soft and dense, so it feels great on the skin. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great foundation brush!</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this brush and it doesn&#x27;t disappoint. The brush helps give great coverage and really evens out the product. Feels great and the makeup looks great! Love it, love it!</li>
            <li> I have seen this brush on so many youtube makeup video tutorials and I was a little skeptical but it actually works wonderfully! I&#x27;m so excited! It blends so well and is not streaky like other brushes. My makeup finally looks flawless :)</li>
            <li> First of all, shipping was super fast!  I expected to receive the brush in a week, but I actually got it in 2 days!  This is my first sigma brush and I will be purchasing more for sure!  Great price, great quality!</li>
            <li> wow this brush is my new favorite tool! i used it to blend my foundation and i love the finished look!i would definitely recommend this brush to you...get it!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brush of all the brushes I own. I knew it from the very first use--I literally gasped when I saw what it did with my makeup!  It applies foundation so smoothly and evenly, way better than stippling brushes, which is what I have used before.  The brush head is dense and soft yet small enough to be very precise in the application. It&#x27;s easy to clean and I haven&#x27;t seen any hairs shed yet. The main thing is I get an extremely smooth beautiful finish, which is the goal when applying foundation in my opinion. Two really huge thumbs up for this great brush!</li>
            <li> This brush feels so soft on my skin! And it&#x27;s the perfect size. I think it&#x27;s going to last a long while too. Go buy it! :-)</li>
            <li> I received this brush today and had to try it and once again I LOVE IT!!! I purchased the F82 last week and fell in love and had to get this one and it&#x27;s great for applying foundation and any other face product. Now buying the brush set is a most.</li>
            <li> I love this brush! It&#x27;s so soft and nicely packed. It&#x27;s great for foundation and It gives me a nice finish. This is my go to foundation brush and I love it!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best foundation brush I&#x27;ve ever used! It certainly gives you an airbrush finish and it is amazing and so soft! I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I have been getting by with an economy set of brushes I got for cheap.  They worked ok - did the job but I had no idea what I was missing until I tried my first Sigma brush.  The difference is night and day - no loose bristles, the brush was SO soft I just wanted to keep using it! The F80 I purchased I used as a foundation brush and the coverage was amazing.  This was my first experience using a brush for foundation and I love the way this brush felt and made my foundation look.  My other brushes are a bit scratchy and lose their bristles on my face  - after trying my first Sigma brush I will now be looking to replace my entire economy set of brushes with these much higher quality brushes.  Well worth the investment in my opinion!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been one to use much make-up, so have not used many brushes.  Recently, I&#x27;ve begun using a new make-up (Jane Iredale) and in doing some pre-purchase research, I read so many glowing reviews of this brush that I decided to try it myself.  My new make-up hasn&#x27;t arrived yet, and I&#x27;m waiting until it does to try out the brush, but it is exceptionally soft, has a great usable handle, and overall looks great.  I&#x27;ll try to update later as to my views of its actual use.</li>
            <li> I love this brush! It makes my cream foundation (Bobbi Brown foundation stick) look simply amazing once it&#x27;s buffed into my skin. I have tried using my fingers to blend, a traditional foundation brush and several different types of sponges, but nothing made my skin look as nice as the Sigma F80. I will probably be purchasing a second one as a back up!</li>
            <li> Authentic! This brush gives you a flawless foundation look. I&#x27;m in love with this brush.</li>
            <li> Sigma is an Excellent Seller. My Brush shipped SO FAST! I ordered my brush on Tuesday and Friday it was sitting pretty in my mailbox! After many many GREAT reviews on youtube, I had to buy this brush. I am a newbie to make up foundation and THIS brush makes me feel like a pro with foundation application. It gives me a well blended airbrushed look. The price is RIGHT and I am a happy customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Sigma for this amazing brush and I can&#x27;t wait to try more!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I used it to apply my foundation and it was flawless! I love it more than my Mac brushes, which are about triple the price! The sigma brushes are also SO soft, and dense! Absolutely fabulous! Couldn&#x27;t be happier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Sigma and Amazon for the amazing product!&lt;br /&gt;Clarissa</li>
            <li> Before getting this brush, I tried a lot of other ways to apply liquid foundation (with a traditional foundation brush, sponges, fingers, etc) but nothing worked to really blend my foundation and make it look somewhat natural. I decided to try this brush after seeing it used in a tutorial on Youtube, and I&#x27;m really glad I did. The brush is really soft and dense, and made my face look like it was airbrushed after blending my foundation. It doesn&#x27;t absorb a lot of the foundation like sponges or other brushes so I don&#x27;t have to keep putting more foundation on, and it really buffs the product onto my skin so it doesn&#x27;t look cakey/uneven. It has even saved me time on applying my foundation, since it blends it so quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is very durable as well, I&#x27;ve had it a little over a year now and it still looks brand new. I haven&#x27;t had shedding issues with it either. It can be somewhat difficult to get completely clean using regular brush cleaner or baby shampoo, I&#x27;ve been using Dawn dish detergent to clean it and it works great (and quickly). I would definitely recommend this brush, as well as many of the other high quality Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this sigma F80 kabuki brush! It took almost a month of waiting .... But it&#x27;s worth the wait! Definitely multifunctional &amp; applying make up is just amazingly effortless using this brush! Hugs &amp; xxx to My little sister from hawaii who recommended this fantastic brush to me!  :-)</li>
            <li> Awesome for foundation</li>
            <li> I tried this for the first time today.... yeah. Awesome. Just amazing. Orgasmic. MAC can go home. I tried this with Maybelline&#x27;s SuperStay 24hr liquid foundation. Put a nickel sized blob on the back of my hand, dabbed the brush on it, and when I applied it to my face, DANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNG.This spreads stuff around GOOD. I&#x27;m quietly in shock, not trying to yell how awesome this is since its 5 am and everyone was still asleep. Easily put foundation all over my face. This doesnt eat ALL your foundation as fast as a sponge would. Sponges, go home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were you, BUY THIS. I dont care if you dont have the money. Do whatever. This is worth whatever endeavor you take to buy this. I&#x27;d do a Harold and Kumar type of journey just to get this brush if I had to. Stop reading and buy this. Dont come back until you do so.</li>
            <li> Unbelievably SOFT!!! I don&#x27;t think I have ever used something so soft and have it be so effective!! I absolutely LOVE this brush!</li>
            <li> It Was more than what i expected, Couldn&#x27;t be more happy, would love to order more in the near future.</li>
            <li> This brush was awesome. Just phenomenal!!! For the first six months. Now it looks like a bowl and the hairs are falling out all over the place. I&#x27;m so disappointed. I expected a much better product from sigma. I wasn&#x27;t rough on this brush. I used it about 3-4 times a week and then I washed it twice a week. I would wash it by putting some of my face cleanser and gently swishing it in my palm. Then I would hang the brush upside down to dry. One day after washing it I noticed some hair falling out by the chunks. It was very sudden. The bristles on the outside are higher than the middle causing a bowl-like shape.</li>
            <li> This brush is hard to come by because it is always sold out. After reading massive reviews I decided to order it myself. The brush literally came in two days and I was so excited I tore off the package like a wild woman. THIS BRUSH IS SIMPLY AMAZING. I used it with liquid foundation and stippled the product on my face with this brush and it went on flawless. This brush is very soft I could not stop touching it. When using this brush my makeup did not feel cakey or uneven. Defiantly a five star brush and I would recommend for everyone to save up (times are tough!) and invest in this brush.</li>
            <li> I have heard amazing reviews about this brush and it did not disappoint. It is so dense and soft. And the best part for me is that it&#x27;s synthetic.I am an animal lover and I would never use a brush with animal hair. The shipping was super fast :)</li>
            <li> This brush is absolutely amazing. It is so dense and so soft. I can tell this brush is going to be great for applying/buffing foundation. It hasn&#x27;t shed at all either. Sigma brushes are the best!</li>
            <li> I received my brush today and it&#x27;s AWESOME! This brush is super soft and dense, making it perfect to apply my mineral foundation. My face looks airbrushed and flawless. The brush&#x27;s quality is amazing for such an affordable price! I would compare these brushes to more higher end brushes for a fraction of the cost. The brush also comes with a small plastic guard that keep the brush shape, which I appreciate. This will keep it from getting smushed in my makeup bag. I haven&#x27;t washed it yet, so I can&#x27;t comment on any shedding issues, but so far I&#x27;m really happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I bought this brush and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I have a lot of brushes from MAC, Chanel, Smashbox, Urban Decay, Sephora and Studio Gear.  I think this is the best foundation brush I own.  I haven&#x27;t had problems with shedding as I&#x27;ve had with the Sephora one, it is so soft and smooth on my skin and it creates a flawless finish.  Definitely a great value for the price.  I like it so much that I ordered the F84 and F82.</li>
            <li> I am 47 years old and have used a makeup sponge all my life.  I recently watched a video on applying makeup and the girl used this brush so I thought, why not try this technique.  I love it.  My makeup looks smooth and is no longer heavy.  When applying foundation with a brush it&#x27;s more even, smooth and less heavy. I will never use anything else again.</li>
            <li> I was kinda scared to buy from amazon because I saw a lot of reviews about fake brushes. I bought from the seller Etailz because it says they are an authorized seller of Sigma products on Sigma&#x27;s website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is very good quality. I use it for most liquid makeups.I have washed this brush many times and I have had a few bristles lost. This brush blends my makeup beautifully. I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:::::::::::::::&lt;br /&gt;Is it real? Yes i am confident it is. About 6 months into use the brush started to shed terribly and then it just got to the point that I could no longer use it. I went to sigma.com and put in a complaint. I told them I bought it on amazon. I gave my order number and told them the sellers name. I was sorta upset that a brush this expensive just could not last. They replied quickly and said that they would contact the seller and tell them about my trouble. I got an email the next day from the amazon seller etailz and they sent me out a new brush! This new brush has been great with no shedding at all and seems better put together than the last one. I think the one I had gotten before must have been a dud.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this brush it gives such you such a flawless look, I have no regrets about buying it. not one bad thing to say!!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this brush!  It is super soft and works great!  I use it for applying foundation and it gives me an airbrushed looked and I use less foundation than when I applied it with my fingers.  Great great product!!  I just ordered more sigma brushes and can&#x27;t wait to get them!  Plus super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Would purchase again and again</li>
            <li> I just received this brush, and love it.  The bristles are good quality and do not feel cheap.  I also really liked that it was an inexpensive brush for the quality.  I have been looking for a brush like this for a while, and saw the good reviews on this brush.  I really like it, and would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> So I decided to wait a month before I reviewed the flat top kabuki, to get a decent all round idea of how good / bad this brush is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fantastic!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a brush that gives flawless application of liquid foundation then this is the brush for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a huge difference between foundation application with Bobbi Brown foundation brush and this brush. It is 100 times better, and sooo much cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are no cons about it what so ever so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is dense, soft, so simple to clean, and it doesn&#x27;t shed like some brushes do at this price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its simply fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a new foundation brush or if you want just try this out, don&#x27;t hesitate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maximum coverage with flawless finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it! :)</li>
            <li> I was trying to find a brush that will allow me to have an airbrush look when I put on my foundation. This product description said that it does it, but you are never too sure. Well, I am proud to say that I am a new own of this brush, and it does exactly as it says! My foundation look FLAWLESS!!! It has never looked like this! Change to this brush, and your hunt for a nice foundation might be over! I am definitely going to be purchasing more Sigma brushes!</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I purchased this brush.  I am using it to apply liquid foundation, and I absolutely love it.  I have been using my fingers until now,  because I have never been able to find the right tool for the job.  This is one amazing brush, and also my first Sigma purchase.</li>
            <li> I never used this product before but I heard a lot of great things about it and how good it worked, so I though that I&#x27;d give it a try.  I&#x27;ve used it a lot! It is great! I would recomend it to any body that wears makeup.  Its good for liquid and powder foundation and great for blending.  Definitely get this product.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love I go back and fourth between this and the beauty blender. Hardly to none of any fall out. Sigma brushes never disappoint.</li>
            <li> I received this product in 3 days of ordering which is amazing! The product itself is a great size, really sturdy, and really soft on the face. With the size of the brush, I was able to blend in my foundation in literally seconds since it covers a large portion of my face. Once again, Sigma has not upset me yet with their products, thanks Sigma!</li>
            <li> Bought 2 Sigma F80 brushes and they really deliver. Great coverage for your foundation. Would recommend for anyone interested in buying this brush.</li>
            <li> i love it the brush is great ..i&#x27;m going to buy me the whole brush set next time !!!!it&#x27;s so soft it&#x27;s really good for buffing in the foundation and leaves it looking air brushed ...great</li>
            <li> Softest brush i own! Very dense and allows it to apply foundation evenly.&lt;br /&gt;A must have in any brush kit of yours!</li>
            <li> This brush applies foundation flawlessly and is super soft! What else could you ask for? It came super fast also.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to see the box in my mailbox when I got home today, I just bout screamed! I just did the first clean as instructed on the sigma beauty card that came along with my F80, and I cannot wait for the first application in the morning! Im am very pleased with the presentation and am already planning on purchasing the 12 essential brushes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently purchased several brushes and this brush is by far one of favorites. Great quality and works like a dream.</li>
            <li> I just got this brush in the mail today. This is my first sigma brush purchase so I was so excited to use it. This brush is amazing. I used it for my liquid foundation. It buffs and blends product onto my face flawlessly. I hate having my make-up look packed on and cakey but with this brush I apply as much product and avoid looking cakey. I&#x27;m very glad that I bought this brush. I&#x27;ll be buying more sigma products for sure.</li>
            <li> This brush is wonderful! It is the softest brush I own. I bought a higher priced version of this brush and it is not nearly as great. This brush is dense so the coverage is amazing! Also, the handle is sturdy and fits perfectly in my hand. I will definitely buy more Sigma brushes! Oh and they ship fast! Got mine within 2 days :0)!</li>
            <li> This brush is even better than what I expected! it soooo soft and does an amazing job of blending my foundation to create a flawless look. This is my first Sigma brush, and I can&#x27;t wait to buy more!&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Bristles have had no fall out so far, and the brush help apply my foundation quickly and flawlessly. Recommened for the price.</li>
            <li> The product is perfect. Recommend it with my eyes closed! It&#x27;s better than I had imagined! Can&#x27;t wait to acquire other brushes from Sigma!</li>
            <li> An absolutely amazing foundation brush. The hype is definitely well deserved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is great quality, and the perfect brush for buffing in makeup and making it in synergy with the skin. It is also incredibly soft, and not at all abrasive in its use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also incredibly affordable in terms of quality, especially when living in Australia, where I often find difficult to get a hold of good quality brushes which are not exorbitant in cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also ordered the F35, which is also brilliant, and I will definitely be ordering others brushes in the future.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Sigma!</li>
            <li> works great. Wife enjoys it. She is slowly building her makeup collection. Follow her on youtube she does makeup vids and is real unlike a lot of sponsored people on there. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwEsYszmxkMrQ3V9EvOiu3w</li>
            <li> It seems to be a real Sigma - has it on the handle and on the metal near the handle. However, it has shed a few hairs (not happy about that, all I did was touch it). I&#x27;ve used it twice and went back to my beautyblender. Idk if it&#x27;s just because I&#x27;m using the &amp;#34;wrong&amp;#34; kind of liquid foundation with it, but it&#x27;s a pain to get it to blend well with the brush. I have no problem with the beautyblender.</li>
            <li> This brush its so good i apply my mineral foundation with it and it looks so good and antural and it gives a good coverage all over the face its amaizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a most have in every girl make up bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loved it.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush! This is the first brush I&#x27;ve ever used for foundation so there was a bit of a learning curve, but I quickly got the hang of it. This does give me better coverage than any other application method I&#x27;ve tried and it makes my foundation stay on my face so much longer. I usually don&#x27;t have to do any touchups at the end of the day, but if I do it&#x27;s minor. The brush itself is very solid and the bristles very dense. It&#x27;s incredibly soft; very velvety feeling. I like the pretty bag that came with the brush, and hope to add more brushes to my collection soon!</li>
            <li> I bought this brush after seeing a girl with amazing makeup use it on youtube!  I must say that it is worth the price.  It works flawlessly and blends perfectly.  I would recommend this to others!</li>
            <li> This brush is simply AWESOME.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it quite a few times now and I am very happy with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;USE:&lt;br /&gt;After applying some concealer I use this brush to \\&quot;stipple on\\&quot; and then \\&quot;buff\\&quot; my tinted BB cream.&lt;br /&gt;My complexion looks radiant and natural, SO much better than when I applied makeup with my fingertips. I highly recommend \\&quot;stippling\\&quot; with this wonderful brush! It does not even look like I&#x27;m wearing makeup - just a flawless, natural complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I did not give this brush 5 stars is because I noticed a small hair left behind on my face on two occasions now.&lt;br /&gt;At this point it&#x27;s MINOR and does NOT diminish the effectiveness of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep you informed and post an update on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****UPDATE 4/6/12*****&lt;br /&gt;I am upgrading this brush to FIVE STARS because it has not lost any more hairs and in addition, it is remarkably easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Once a week I apply a brush cleaning spray, then I rinse it. Not only does it retain it&#x27;s shape (I shape it and lay it on a sunny windowsill to dry) but it looks as good as new - the white tips are still perfect white. I LOVE THIS BRUSH and I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy and God bless :)</li>
            <li> i love my f80 flat top kabuki brush, is amazingly soft and very well made the shipping was fast and the brush came well protected in a cute red bag ,I will definitely be purchasing more Sigma brushes in the future.</li>
            <li> This brush has the most softest bristles ever! It obsorbs liquid foundation exellent. They are easy to clean and is a perfect size with a perfect grip. It doesn&#x27;t streak make-up when it&#x27;s applied. It&#x27;s just over all and great brush!</li>
            <li> The Sigma Flat Top brush is the best liquid foundation brush I have ever used! I have tried several brushes before and none of them have given me this fabulous air-brushed look. I originally bought this brush because I watched some makeup clips that were reviewing it on YouTube.The reviews were all great. I decided to then purchase it and I am glad I did! It&#x27;s super soft (which I love)and not to heavy. It helps me apply just the right amount of foundation and the finished look is beautiful! I love it!</li>
            <li> I had done a lot of research on what brushes to have in a collection and this was one of the ones that showed up the most.  And I see why! Its an amazing brush, applies liquid and powder foundation sooo well and I just started wearing makeup about a month ago.  I received it in less than 5 business days and am once again amazed with Sigma&#x27;s service.  Def a great buy :)</li>
            <li> This brush is a must have for your makeup tool collection. This is the 3rd Kabuki I have purchased from Sigma. I also have the angled and rounded top brushes. I used them for applying liquid foundations. They distribute the product evenly and provide a smooth finish. The bristles are soft and the brushes are easy to clean. I highly advise washing them after using liquid foundation so that your foundation does not dry on the brush. I dry them in my Sigma Dry N Shape. I enjoy these brushes and will continue to purchase from Sigma. I def. recommend this product to others. The shipping was also timely. Give this Kabuki a try... I think you will love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different foundation brushes by MAC, Bare Minerals, etc. but this one surpasses them all! From the first time I used it, my foundation went on flawlessly and the brush felt really good on my face!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of flat top brushes I use to apply my mineral powder foundation, since I like to switch to using a clean brush every couple of days, and I&#x27;m too lazy to clean them a couple of times a week. This is the first time I used a sigma brush but I have been hearing about them for quite some time now. The price is really reasonable so I decided to give it a try. I washed it as soon as it arrived, and it returned to its original shape once dry, and I did not see any shedding. The brush is very dense and really soft, perfect for my Mineral make-up application. Good size, perfect length. I will definitely be considering buying sigma brushes if I want to add to my brush collection in the future. I think it&#x27;s an excellent deal.</li>
            <li> This brush meets my expectations. It&#x27;s very soft, yet dense enough for good application. Highly recommend. Great price as well</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing!! It has changed the way I do my makeup! My makeup looks absolutely amazing using this brush!!</li>
            <li> Sigma F80 is one of the best kabuki brush that I had ever used. I used this brush to apply my liquid foundation, powder foundation, my blush or even bronzer, its very versatile. The brush feel so soft on my skin and I find it is so much quicker to apply my foundation with the sigma F80.</li>
            <li> I love this brush; it&#x27;s very dense and great for applying foundation. I also love how I got this product two days after I ordered it even though I only had standard shipping. And the brush was packed well too!</li>
            <li> My favorite brush. It&#x27;s the perfect size and shape for liquid foundation. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for the eye area because of the size, though. Try one of Sigma&#x27;s smaller brushes.</li>
            <li> I got several brushes from Sigma. F80 is my favorite. I heard about sigma brushes from youtube. I could not believe that quality is amazing. I have different brushes from different countries. But now I recommend only sigma for all my friends. All brushes that I Oder are soft, easily can take your eye-shadow or any pigment. Before F80 I used my fingers to put foundation to my face, because I could not find good brush for it. My skin is very sensitive. Now I am very happy!!</li>
            <li> Did not like the application and could not clean all the makeup out no matter what I used then the texture changed. Prefer a beauty blender all the way !</li>
            <li> So excited to receive this brush. Heard such amazing things about it. It came in fast time, excellent packaging and pricing. Very happy with my order! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Best powder brush I&#x27;ve ever owned. Flat with soft, extremely dense bristles, gives great, very even coverage.</li>
            <li> If u want a best foundation brush go for it</li>
            <li> Just got this F80 Flat Top Kabuki brush on the 2nd.. Since i tried them, i have been using this brush everyday. It&#x27;s [erfect for applying and blending Liquid,cream,and powder and im so glad i bought one. i would definitely recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> I can not rave enough about this brush! I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for the perfect size flat top kabuki for some time now, and this one is everything that I was looking for! It&#x27;s small enough to offer great control of foundation application and is super soft with no fall out! This is a great addition to my Sigma 12 pc professional set. I will be reviewing all of my Sigma brushes as soon as I get my vlog channel up and running over the next [...]</li>
            <li> This is the very First Sigma Brush i have ordered...! and i&#x27;m VERY Impressed. Doesnt Shed, it&#x27;s Very soft! It slides my makeup on so nicely! Love it!I&#x27;m planning on Ordering alot more Sigma Brusha</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft and is perfect for applying foundation! It applies evenly and is great at covering my flaws. LOVE!</li>
            <li> This has to be the best brush ever. Not only is it the density i want, it is also a very versatile brush that i can basically use for almost anything! I would definitely recommend this brush to anyone who is looking for a basic brush that does almost everything!</li>
            <li> I have had the Sigma Flat Top Kabuki brush for a few months now and I am very pleased with it. It is a great brush for putting on foundation especially when using a stippling method to create an airbrushed finish. I have washed this brush and there was no shedding. I would definitely recommend this brush and plan on buy more brushes in the future.</li>
            <li> It feels great and applies great. It&#x27;s really dense and boy it&#x27;s soft lol. It&#x27;s the only brush I&#x27;ll ever use.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush to my girlfriend, who is very interested in make up. She loved it and she wants to buy another ones from Sigma&#x27;s line products because it provides a very good application and a natural effect.</li>
            <li> This brush arrived on time and is exactly as pictured.  It also comes with a handy cover and little mesh carrying case.  Been using it for 2 weeks, no hairs have fallen out yet.</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome!  This was my first Sigma Beauty purchase but it will not be the last; I have a long wish list.  I&#x27;ve already ordered another brush and can&#x27;t wait to get it.  My makeup looks as though it&#x27;s been airbrushed on; truly happy that I&#x27;ve found this line.</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTLY LOVE THIS BRUSH, ITS GREAT FOR BLENDING FOUNDATION AND GIVES YOU A FLAWLESS BUFFING. I CATN&#x27;T WAIT TO BEAT MY FACE EVERYDAY WITH THE FLAT KABUKI BRUSH. I ALSO LOVE THE WAY IT FEELS.SO SOFT.</li>
            <li> This brush is such a dream come true. I love it. It blends so effortlessly and is quick and easy to use. I love the flat top vs the round top personally. It&#x27;s great and if you&#x27;re thinking about buying this...do it.</li>
            <li> I use this brush to blend liquid foundation every day. I haven&#x27;t experienced any shedding and the brush works great!</li>
            <li> Wonderful brush! Very soft and thick! Provides excellent coverage when used with my Bare Minerals foundation. I like it sooo much better than my old Bare Minerals brush that shed constantly.</li>
            <li> I just received this in the mail and it works perfectly. It doesn&#x27;t take much buffing into my skin, and it leaves a natural finish.</li>
            <li> I too heard about this brush from youtube video reviews of foundation, and I&#x27;m in love. I&#x27;m mostly a MAC snob and had been using their brushes, face and body foundation and primer but still wasn&#x27;t happy. My combination skin is mostly in great shape, but I&#x27;v been disappointed with cakey or too watery foundations.  I bought this and my new foundation (Laura Mercier silk creme foundation) and VOILA - flawless face!  I then went back and tried this with my MAC as well as several wal-mart brands (cover girl, revlon, etc.) and they look great.  Using a stippling effect achieves a great, semi-airbrushed look.  Blends concealer and creme blushes/highlighters/contours amazingly.  My favorite part is that you can use the brush lightly damp or with facial mist and blend out any areas that are too thick or need blending.  I did this part way through the day at work to freshen up and was very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to confess that I have a facial hair problem due to very aggravating disorder that drives me nuts.  So nuts that I have to shave every day before I leave the house.  This is not fun for a woman!  Anyway, I am paranoid about being out and having a stubble show through late in the day, and this brush combined with the right foundation (and stippling!) buys me a lot of time.  My girlfriends, my fiance and even my very \\&quot;man&#x27;s man\\&quot; brother commented on how great and model-ish my face looked just last night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you have perfect skin I recommend this brush.  Better than my other 3 foundation brushes, probably because of the shape and density of the bristles.  Not a bad price either.  I have used this on friends as well, equally amazing response.</li>
            <li> the hairs don&#x27;t come off like I expected, and it works great. Now I think I want one that&#x27;s not flat though.</li>
            <li> This is a really soft, dense  brush and it is a great value!!  It applies both my liquid and powder foundations very smoothly and evenly.  It is easy to wash and doesn&#x27;t shed,</li>
            <li> Love this brush! It is so perfect for my liquid foundation. Definitely my go to every single day. The bristles are soft but dense so the foundation doesn&#x27;t get soaked up by the brush. Love it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Sigma brushes, they are of the highest quality, for such a reasonable price.  I totally recommend you try them, if you haven&#x27;t already!</li>
            <li> So I ordered this brush after viewing several videos about it, and it works just as great as how i saw it. THis brush is the softest brush I have to date. It&#x27;s incredibly good at applying liquid foundation but also mineral foundation, double usage. I use it pretty much every day and don&#x27;t regret my purchase. Shipping was also pretty faster than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush for putting on powder foundation. I liked the flat top because it helped me concentrate the powder for days I wanted more coverage. Plus the bristles were so soft. Some brushes I have had shed bristles, but this brush was great! It shipped so fast too! Really pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> I am in love w/ this brush, no other foundation brush gives such a flawless finish,  it is such an amazing brush, i am going to purchase a backup :)...applying foundation is so simple w/ this brush, no need to keep trying to blend.  This is definitely a must have brush!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this along with my Sigma brush set, and I am in love with it as well! It is perfect for foundation application or for buffing out harsh edges to blushes or bronzers. Washing it out for the first time, no shedding! Very soft, and smooth against the skin. Sturdy handle. I love how the brush has just enough dense to it. I would recommend this brush to anyone and I promise you, you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> For the price it is awesome. Well worth the money because you will end up using it over and over again. I use it to apply makeup forever foundation and it ends up looking flawless.</li>
            <li> I love this brush! It came super fast when I ordered it! It came with a brochure and pictures of all the other brushes they have. The brush is super soft! I really like how the handle isn&#x27;t cheap and flimsy. It works super well stippling on liquid foundation. Great product!</li>
            <li> I have had flat foundation brushes for years. With it you always has to use sponge to get rid of streaks. This new flat kabuki brush came from heaven. I enjoy it soooo much I wish I could use it twice a day.</li>
            <li> Everyone needs one. Super soft.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for buffing out concealer. Makes liquid foundation look airbrushed.&lt;br /&gt;(Personally, I prefer to use this brush with liquid foundation than with powder)&lt;br /&gt;I have experienced no shedding thus far.&lt;br /&gt;I have already purchased a second brush to use on clients.</li>
            <li> I USED THIS BRUSH FOR THE FIRST TIME TODAY. Let my foundation looking flawless and natural. I LOVE THIS BRUSH. CANT WAIT TO BUY AGAIN!</li>
            <li> This is a great brush for liquid foundation! It is just the right size. I would never go back to a sponge again!</li>
            <li> Many people were raving about this brush to apply foundation, so I decided to buy it. It arrived quickly, and I am very happy with the brush. It does make applying foundation a lot easier, and the finish look is great too. It&#x27;s the best tool I&#x27;ve ever used for foundation so far. I&#x27;ve never tried the beauty blender to compare, but I&#x27;m so happy with this brush, that I might not even try it.</li>
            <li> just received this from amazon today and i definitely love this brush i use it for buffing super soft and is great for full coverage!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful brush.  Sigma line is the lead er in make up brushes!</li>
            <li> Best foundation brush ever.  I used to just use my hand or one of those sponge things to apply foundation until I tried this brush.  Absolutely love it.  Soft and applies evenly...easy to clean as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because i had been looking for a brush like it.  i use it to apply my liquid foundation.  i can honestly say that i have never used a brush like it before!  i have tryed my share of brushes to apply my foundatio, but nothing has ever given such a flawless, easy, and honestly, fun application.  the brush is SO soft that it actually makes it fun!!  this brush is also very versatile, you can use it for many many things, i just prefer to use it for my liquid foundation.  i also like using it to contour (using the edge of the brush), apply powder, apply highlight, and other types of foundation (creme, powder,...).  i would suggest that EVERYONE goes out and buy&#x27;s this brush, it will change the way you apply your makeup!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;v heard a lot of really good things about this brush so i couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. For starters this brush is sooo soft, like baby butt soft. The F80 is also very dense and very big, this makes it perfect for foundation. Over all i absolutly love this brush, i would recomend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> The quality of Sigma brushes are unlike any other - very dense and soft. I strongly recommend buying from Sigma.</li>
            <li> I love the full coverage of this brush!!</li>
            <li> This brush is the best! It doesn&#x27;t shed and blebds super well. The finish is flawless. I use this with my Mac studio fix fluid and it is amazing it makes my skin look so smooth. And the brush is easy to clean</li>
            <li> I use this burch for foundation and I really like it. This brush makes my application look like I have airbrush foundation. Purchasing this brush through Amazon was the same price as buying it directly through Sigma, except I also got free shipping with Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have been so impatient to get my sigma flat kabuki f-80  ! Finally it came today and the first thing I did was take off all my makeup and put on foundation. Omg this brush seriously does what everyone says it does. Sam Schuerman first got me interested when her foundation looked flawless and she said it was the brush. I was a bit skeptical, but after reading a bunch of reviews I got it. I&#x27;m so glad  did</li>
            <li> This is my first Sigma brush and it was definitely worth the money. Made my foundation very easy to apply and looked much more natural than any other brush I have used in the past. I&#x27;m absolutely going to be buying more Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this item recently and I am so impressed with this brush. I had been wanting to try the mac stippling brush, but was a little on the pricey side so I was on utube and saw a review which changed my life. I have really dry skin, and the winter time is the worst for me. I decided to try this brush which had more than 1 great reviews and was sold. I ordered my own and tried it. I have decided on purchasing more sigma products. When applying my foundation the brush left my face flawless, it really hid my imperfections, redness, and no problems with dryness. It blends, and smoothes my skin just right. Thank you for making such a great brush. I just can&#x27;t wait to try more. I do believe I will certainly be sticking to your sigma products and want to try your collections.  THANK YOU AGAIN PIXIEGIRL</li>
            <li> I have several Kabuki brushes some of which are higher on price than this one - but after getting this I think I am going to through away all the others! extra soft, dense and very professional at look!</li>
            <li> This is my first sigma brush and just as everyone posted and the videos on youtube, its perfect.  I can&#x27;t wait to order more.  I don&#x27;t wear make up daily but I will now!</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I received my brush today and I&#x27;m so suprised how fast it is, even though I live on the other side of the world! The brush is super soft and blends my foundation perfectly and washes easily too. Will definatley purchase from here again!!!</li>
            <li> I just received my brush today! I love it, it&#x27;s the perfect size &amp; also unbelievably soft.  I loved it so much and will use as soon as possible. It&#x27;s a great quality brush that I for sure recommend to anyone.  Plus shipping was fast ( only 5 days)</li>
            <li> Love it I want to purchase more of these brushes from sigma. Its so amazing feels so soft and applys very well.</li>
            <li> I heard about this brush via YouTube makeup tutorials- hosts are praising this brush as the ideal applicator for foundation. I was skeptical at first, seeing as the brush is only available online, however it lived up to expectations! The bristles are very dense, which applies a very even layer of foundation. The look is very buffed in, rather than cakey or streaked. If I add a small amount of facial lotion to my coverage, one layer is enough for a very clean and natural look. It also has expedited my foundation application process; previously I was always fighting with cheaper brushes until resorting back to my hands. The brush applies makeup quite quick and easy, and doesn&#x27;t waste product. I use this brush now daily!</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing! It makes applying foundation so easy!!!! I highly recommend it to anyone. It is definitely worth the money, also Sigma has way better brushes than Mac and other expensive brands for almost half the price. Shop Sigma!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this brush for my foundation. It blends very nicely and it&#x27;s so soft. Ive had no problems so far!</li>
            <li> High quality brush.  Looking forward to adding more of this brand to my collection of brand name brushes.</li>
            <li> This really is a great brush for liquid foundation. I use it with Revlon Colorstay liquid foundation for combination/oily skin. It really makes a difference as far as application of the foundation and overall appearance. The bristles are soft but dense and gives the airbrushed appearance that other reviewers talk about. It really is one of my favorite brushes.</li>
            <li> This beauty brush is a great way to apply foundation on. The shape makes it more complementary for the face and it takes a few seconds to apply all over it. This brush is a great investment.</li>
            <li> I ordered F82 and F80 because of their incredible Amazon reviews; however, I must say the reviews were exaggerated - they&#x27;re just okay, not even close to my expectation. It&#x27;s reasonable for an upset customer wonder where those amazing compliments on Sigma Brushes came from; the answer possibly was related to a note in my package - it said that I will get a free gift if I left feedback on Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparing to my old Chanel powder brush, I was disappointed that F80 used 3x more mineral powder, but provided much more poor result. Foundation powder was not evenly on my face and some areas had too thick powder. I asked for refund and then sadly learned that they only accept F82 (new, un-used brush) for return. That is to say, I spent $16 for a one-time trial. In which I realized how wonderful job my Chanel brush did - it gently breezed on your face and makeup was evenly and looked so natural (my friends were confused whether I wore makeup or not)! Chanel does have drawbacks - pricey and it will lose some hairs after 1 year. But I definitely will go back to Chanel - yes, it cost more $ but you will get much better quality!</li>
            <li> After using my fingers to apply foundation for many years, I was told to start using brushes in order to clear up my skin.  \\&quot;Keep your fingers off your skin\\&quot;, I was told by my derm.  I&#x27;ve been using a Sephora #55 airbrush, until I recently ordered the Sigma F80 after reading so many positive reviews. This brush was shipped very quickly and came with a nice pouch which will come in handy to store quite a few brushes.  This new brush actually made my foundation seem less obvious, my skin was more finished.  The brush is so soft and dense,  I realized I needed to use less foundation with this brush than my previous one. I will definitely keep using my Sigma F80 for foundation application, keeping my fingers off my face has helped with my overall skin appearance.&lt;br /&gt;This brush is well worth the amount of money I paid for my #55, but the actual cost is no where close.</li>
            <li> Guys this Brush is really INCREDIBLE. it the most amazing brush i have ever used in my life, IT DOES WORK! and it makes your skin with a HD DEFINITION. This Brush does MIRACLES!! everyday I get more surprised and satisfied with SIGMA&#x27;s brushes. It is a well spend money.</li>
            <li> Okay, so after months and months of watching youtube gurus rave about this brush and brand, I finally got around to purchasing it. It was my first sigma brush, and will not be my last!  The price was amazing, making the quality of the brush shocking.  The bristles are extremely soft, and have not shed at all!  I have had the brush for almost a week, and have used it with both powder and liquid foundations. Works great with both!  It works well with my Smashbox Halo powder and my Bare Minerals foundation.  For liquids, I think I would only use this with thicker foundations like Mac since it really buffs the makeup into the skin. I was a little put off by the brush&#x27;s smell, but it&#x27;s really not that bad.  Overall, it is an AMAZING brush and worth more than what it costs!  I am officially declaring Sigma as my brand for makeup brushes!</li>
            <li> First time I have ever used a foundation brush. Love it!!! My foundation looks flawless.</li>
            <li> Seriously, LOVE this brush! So many people have raved about this brush so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Does not leave brush strokes like traditional foundation brushes and doesn&#x27;t get all gunky like a sponge. I will definitely be buy more signma brushes....highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Wow...the Sigma F80-Flat Kabuki is fantastic,it has the perfect design for applying foundation,it goes on smoothly with no streaks or clumps,I use the brush daily and rinse it with warm water once a month and it is in perfect shape.. I would recommend this brush to anyone looking for great foundation brush!</li>
            <li> One of the best purchases I have made for brushes. I was worried about paying so much for a brush but honestly it was worth it. You really get what you pay for and this brush has made such a difference in the application of my makeup. I love that it is a flat top because it does the most perfect application of my foundation.</li>
            <li> The brush is okay. It seems to just push my foundation around without actually putting it in on my skin. Leaves streak marks sometimes</li>
            <li> This brush is exactly what I was looking for, super soft and really dense. My only issue is it&#x27;s a little hard to deep clean... probably because it is so dense. So double edged sword, but great for what I need it for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still very satisfied with this brush, I&#x27;ve been using it for a really long time almost every day to apply liquid foundation. A few times I&#x27;ve noticed a bit of streaking. But overall I still think its the best brush I have used.&lt;br /&gt;---* In the last week or so I have noticed a LOT of shedding. Before now it has maybe lost one or two strands a month. BUT I do clense it regularly because it is a very dense brush and I have found that if i wait too long inbetweeen cleanings, it gets kind of gross, and harder to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT even with its slight problems I am ordering another one. It is a really great brush, I honestly can&#x27;t understand why some people are bashing it so much. It has stood up to my wear and tear like a Champ and I am a return customer because of it.</li>
            <li> This is the best makeup brush for liquid foundation. Hands down. Gives an airbrushed look without sacrificing coverage. I use it with Mac Studio Fix Fluid (NC15).</li>
            <li> I really love my flat top brush. Its so soft and dense and gives me full coverage with my liquid foundation. I love this brush!</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my girlfriend and she loved it. She says the brush is firm and it gave no streaks with full coverage and it was shipped really fast. It evenly distributes foundation. Worth every penny. Overall the brush is great and it doesnt fall apart like other cheap brushes.</li>
            <li> My first high end make up brush! I ordered and revived my f80 brush fast and with nice packaging. I had to try it right away. I used the brush with my liquid foundation, and it looks flawless. Great air brush finish. Shipping was fast, even came early. Definetly will purchase more from sigma!!!</li>
            <li> Best foundation brush ever. I cannot rave enough about this brush. It blends beautifully with any foundation I&#x27;ve ever used (and I&#x27;ve used a lot) and it never fails. I&#x27;ve washed it many times, and has never shed no matter what. Awesome brush, recommend it to anyone. The price is worth it by far. Don&#x27;t think about it buy it.</li>
            <li> This is my third try at a foundation brush.  After reading reviews, watching videos like pixiwoo, and listening to opinions from friends, I finally decided on a stippling brush.  This came up as a recommendation.  When I got it in the mail, I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.  I have used it now over the past week with liquid foundations ( Chanel Pro Lumiere and Aqua Lumiere) and with powders.  It goes on evenly without using too much product and looks like it&#x27;s been airbrushed.  It cleans up nicely and seems to dry quickly.  I have found my HG foundation brush.</li>
            <li> This is the best makeup brush to apply liquid foundation. I was hesitant at first because of how much the shipping cost but I just decided to buy it cause I&#x27;ve heard so many wonderful things from the reviews but mainly on YouTube. Everyone seems to crave this brush and now I do :) it was a great buy and if your hesitant on buying it cause it&#x27;s a bit expensive just do it cause it&#x27;s worth every penny :)</li>
            <li> sigma brushes come in a really cute packaging. i have heard so many reviews on this brush and all i can say is that i love it . i recommend it. [[ASIN:B003UH0528 Sigma Beauty Flat Top Synthetic Kabuki - F80]]</li>
            <li> I watch a lot of beauty vlogs on YouTube and they all seem to gravitate to this brush and so I had to get it.  It really does apply foundation smoothly and it&#x27;s so soft!</li>
            <li> Heard about this brush on a website.  It is an amazing brush.  It totally transformed by face.  My face looks flawless.  Definately recommend for your makeup regimen.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush directly from the Sigma website where it is cheaper with their discount code ($17).  This brush is a great, dense brush that I use for applying liquid foundation.  It is totally easier than using fingers and a sponge.  The sponge soaks up too much foundation that the brush keeps on my face.  It is totally synthetic and one of the softest brushes that I have ever used.  I sometimes get tired of hearing about sigma products on youtube, but I totally have to admit that this brush is worth the price.  Hard to clean but it feels great.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for the perfect foundation brush for some time now.  Thankfully after viewing one of Lisa Eldridge&#x27;s beauty blog videos (she is the master of makeup) I saw her using and raving about this brush.  After checking reviews and blogs I decided I had to try it.  It is amazing and works with all types of foundations.  It&#x27;s even great for buffing concealer.  Soft with densely pack bristles, this brush is the perfect weight and well made.  It buffs any type of foundation on beautifully and makes skin look flawless.  Definitely tops the list of other face brushes.</li>
            <li> The best foundation brush Ive ever had. Worth every penny</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for less than a month. I checked Sigma&#x27;s website to make sure I was buying from a reputable seller. Within two weeks the bristles started falling out and within three weeks the entire head of the brush fell off. I&#x27;ve owned makeup brushes before and know how to adequately clean them. This is just absolutely ridiculous, less than a month and it didn&#x27;t even last. Please may an informed decision before purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> nice brush , i got a MAC brush for my foundation but it was to small and flimsy. i just got this brush today , and i already know it is going to be better then my MAC.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush based on various bloggers reviews. I am so happy that I did. I love this brush it giving me great results and many have noticed how airbrushed my foundation looks plus i currently changed the foundation as well. Over all im so pleased with this brush its very dense so a little product goes along way.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush after hearing about it from a YouTuber who uses it to apply liquid foundation. I was looking for a new foundation brush to cover better, so I thought I would give it a try. I&#x27;m no beauty guru, but this brush has soft bristles and gives beautiful coverage. I use less foundation which helps a lot. The brush is easy to clean and I have had no problems thus far. The shipping was exact and I was happy to receive it!</li>
            <li> This is a Great brush for applying foundation or powder it is by far the best brush I have!!! I cant wait to try the other brushes from this company!!!!</li>
            <li> The best foundation brush EVER!</li>
            <li> I love this brush. It&#x27;s firm but soft and does a nice job of blending my foundation. I&#x27;m in love&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update on August 25, 2013: I prefer this over the beauty blender. It&#x27;s easier to handle and I love the way it makes my makeup look. Plus it doesn&#x27;t hurt my hand when applying. The beauty blender tends to make my hand tired.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing ! It&#x27;s soft and gentle with the skin, and it&#x27;s the first one I felt like it was worth bying. I&#x27;m from France and we don&#x27;t have this kind of brushes here !</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this brush it makes my foundation go on evenly and smoothly, leaving a flawless look!</li>
            <li> Okay, I just got my F80 brush in the mail today. I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out, so I came home, took off my makeup and reapplied it using this brush. I must say I am forever sold on Sigma brushes!!! It&#x27;s unbelievable how dense and soft this brush is!!! I have spent tons of money on foundation and I was always disappointed, I could never figure out why it never looked right...I watch all the YouTube videos, buy high-end makeup, but to be honest my makeup looked horrible....until now! This brush has answered my prayers. My makeup looks flawless. I even used this brush to apply my setting powder and my blush and it done wonderful. I will definitely be buying the rest of my brushes from Sigma from now on. (:</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my foundation brush! I had previously used a Sonia Kushik foundation brush and various sponge applicators for my liquid foundation. It takes me about 20 seconds to evenly apply and blend my foundation and it really looks flawless whereas my previous brush required a lot of extra blending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for a while now, my only complaint would be the upkeep. I clean the brush pretty regularly but it can be somewhat difficult to clean, otherwise I&#x27;m quite satisfied.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing. It gives me an airbrushed look every time, and I&#x27;m able to use foundations that I&#x27;d previously written off because I couldn&#x27;t get them to look good after application. You can sheer out foundation, or layer to achieve full-coverage finishes. I usually use a combination of stippling and swirling liquid foundation onto my skin, then tap gently all over my face to blend. This brush is amazing. The one drawback is that it is very dense, and takes a long time to dry. But as long as I wash it immediately after use, it has plenty of time to dry before I need it the following day.</li>
            <li> This is the best foundation brush I have ever used.  It works for both liquid and powder foundations.  I am currently using the Sigma F80 for my Make Up For Ever duo mat, and it allows me to obtain a flawless and natural looking finish from my foundation.  I was using the Sephora Platinum Airbrush #55, but it doesn&#x27;t give me the same coverage as the Sigma.</li>
            <li> Not only did this brush come BEFORE the estimated delivery date; it&#x27;s AMAZING!  I love how soft the brush is yet it&#x27;s very dense, which then creates that airbrushed look that we all want to achieve.  I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> So I kept hearing about this brush from you tube gurus, but have never really used a brush for my foundation in the past. I decided it was worth trying, and I&#x27;m so glad I did! This brush never sheds(my biggest peeve with brushes), and leaves me with a lovely even finish. Its so nice when a product ends up standing up to the hype!! Thanks Sigma.</li>
            <li> I adore this brush! I use it for foundation when I want a fuller coverage than a damp beauty blender would give. I have very dry skin, so I&#x27;ll usually use this to pat the product onto my face rather than dragging it around. It works for me and gives great coverage. The brush itself is very durable and has held its shape through many washes. I like the weight of the brush in my hand, and I feel like the thick base helps me get a good grip on the brush for more precise handling, if that makes sense. This brush is so great for the price and I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I did get a sigma brush, it wasn&#x27;t a dupe or anything. I do absolutely love it, but if you want to save a buck, buy the eco tools one, or really any one that looks dense. this is great quality, soft, sturdy, and blends makeup amazingly, but im not sure if its worth every penny. although I don&#x27;t regret buying it.:) still deserves 5 stars</li>
            <li> This sigma flat kabuki brush is amazingly soft! It applies liquid foundation evenly and leaves a flawless finish. This brush is literally the best foundation brush I have ever used, it has a sleek black handle with Sigma&#x27;s logo and a description of the brush name going down the side. It is worth every penny, the only word left to say about this brush is perfection.</li>
            <li> I love this brush!  It is so dense and soft.  My makeup looks amazing.  I will definately be using Sigma brushes from now on!</li>
            <li> This brush works really well!! It&#x27;s very dense and applies liquid foundation very smoothly. It does not streak or leave uneven blotches of foundation. The only thing is that it is so dense that it requires some elbow grease but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get used to it. I highly recommend this brush for anyone looking for a good foundation brush!</li>
            <li> Love it!! Bristles don&#x27;t fall out when using or cleaning. Very worth the price. Does its job</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good liqued foundation brush for years and i have a couple.. they left streaks or were too rough on my face. This brush was soft and dense. The liqued foundation went on evenly on my skin...when i used my hands, the foundation looked uneven here and there. So far, i thought the brush helped me give an airbrush look and the person making these brushes knew what a foundation brush needed. As for washing, i was pleased to unexpectedly recieve instructions on how to wash this particular brush and how it can be used...</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I live in Brazil and my brush arrived at the right time. Very well packaged and in perfect condition. I love my new Sigma Flat kabuki brush-F80. It really makes a difference! Makes the makeup much prettier. Congratulations for the great products and to superior customer service..\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I bought my first F80 for personal use over a year ago. I am a freelance Makeup Artist and have now incorporated this brush into all application of liquid and mousse foundations for my clients. It applies effortlessly. The bristles are extremely soft to the touch. My clients have commented on the quality of the brush as well.</li>
            <li> My Sigma F80 Flat Top Kabuki arrived within a week of ordering on Amazon.  I also ordered it after reading the many favorable reviews on Amazon &amp; other cosmetic websites.  I have to concur with the reviewers - it is comfortable to hold, easy to clean (using either a cosmetic brush cleaner or baby shampoo), super-soft, and effective for either powder or liquid foundation.  The best part is the price - I have other make-up brushes that cost in the neighborhood of $40 and this easily compares or even surpasses them.</li>
            <li> Best foundation brush</li>
            <li> Love it! This brush does a fantastic job with both mineral makeup and liquid foundation! I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever gotten such a flawless finish before, using other brushes or sponges. The brush is super soft and dense. I&#x27;ve yet to experience any bristle fallout. Shipping was fast, too. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I already reviewed this a month ago but for some reason can&#x27;t find it on the amazon.com site...weird...or maybe it&#x27;s technical difficulties. Anyway, basically this product loses stars because it took forever to get here (Canada) and the brush requires A LOT of wrist action so that can lead to a lot of fatigue (and my mom won&#x27;t use it for that reason) and if you are doing make up for a while, it gets to be way too much. The bristles are dense and soft. I find I get way more out of my foundation (a little goes a longer way) than if I were to use my regular foundation brush from MAC. No free sample with it...which sucked, especially because I&#x27;m used to getting those when I order with online sellers and it just makes me want to order from that company again! Oh well. Oh, shipping cost as much as the brush..which I thought was crazy. The shipping chart they had at Checkout was not clear..it looked like it would be 2.50 for an item (But really 14 for a shipment which really is contradictory)but it turned out to be MUCH more once I had already paid and could see the invoice. Please clear this up sigma! It&#x27;s really just the 14 for the shipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush did not make my skin look more flawless as I was expecting, which was disappointing. The look was pretty much the same as my MAC foundation brush. No bristles lost (by the way, this is usually the case for most synthetic brushes so this isn&#x27;t something unique about this brush...real hair brushes is where most of the shedding occurs, as I learnt from experience trying many different companies:)).</li>
            <li> I lv my sigma kabuki brush. It covers the blemishes and different color on the face evenly. I never use brush on my face before and I&#x27;m glad I started with this.</li>
            <li> Gives me that airbrush flawless effect, which I love. Definitely with the money. It changes the entire out come of your makeup. Sigma brushes should definitely be a staple in your makeup routine. They are well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Bought this and haven&#x27;t even had it 3 months. It&#x27;s started losing bristles and then when I went to wash it today, the whole head of bristles pulled out of the handle!  So disappointed!</li>
            <li> First of all, I was pleased with how fast the product arrived. It took like 2 days and my brush was here. The brush was well packaged and not damaged while in transit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to purchase this brush. This brush is so great and lives up to its claim of a flawless makeup application :-) The bristles are soft &amp; dense (really dense) - allowing for a perfect application.&lt;br /&gt;I stipple the foundation on with the brush and then just buff it in on my face...love the result!&lt;br /&gt;I will be saving money to buy more Sigma brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the brush does take a while to dry (given the fact that the bristles are super dense)...so make sure you have another brush to use while waiting for the Sigma F80 to dry :-)</li>
            <li> Phenomenal brush. I use it for my foundation. This is the softest brush ever. I love it! This is the 2nd time when I purchase this brush because my mom snuck my first brush :) We love it!!!</li>
            <li> After reading all the great reviews on this brush I decided to order the brush and I&#x27;m glad I did!! This brush is amazing!! It gives me a great finish every time!! I love how soft it is and how easy it is to clean!! Get this brush you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> The F80 provides a perfect coat of liquid foundation. My face is free of streaks and has excellent coverage when I use this brush. For anyone who desires a flawless finish to their makeup application, then this brush is definitely worth the small investment.</li>
            <li> After watching numerous reviews about Sigma brushes on Youtube and not wanting to spend $$$$ on the \\&quot;other\\&quot; brushes &amp;lt;cough&gt; (MAC); I decided to give this Sigma F80 brush a try. First, the shipping was super fast and arrived a day or two earlier than I expected. I immediately opened the package and brushed it up against my face because I couldn&#x27;t wait to see what all the hype was about. Well, let me tell you, this brush is definitely worth the hype! It is incredibly dense and soft. It feels so good. I used it to apply a liquid foundation that I own but doesn&#x27;t even match my skin tone just to see if it would buff it in well and give me that flawless and airbrushed look. It absolutely did! I&#x27;ve washed it and none of the synthetic hairs or bristles come out. So if you&#x27;re thinking about purchasing this brush just go ahead and do it! Its worth every penny....and that&#x27;s no jive!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still experimenting with his brush and so far so good. It blends beautifully and I feel like no matter how much product you apply, the brush will blend it out evenly. It&#x27;s a bit pricey for just a mere brush but then again it is sigma. I haven&#x27;t experienced any fallout yet compared to my Mac brush that always falls out. I have a good experience so far and look forward to purchasing more sigma products :)</li>
            <li> I have previously tried sponges and simply my fingers for liquid foundation application. After a few weeks using the Sigma F80 brush I prefer this to any other application method. I get much more even coverage with less product! I use MAC Selectint right now and feel with this brush I can try a slightly heavier foundation without worrying it could look too thick. It&#x27;s an awesome brush to work with plus it&#x27;s so very soft, it&#x27;s a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> I used to apply my foundation with the fingers because it was easier for me than using a foundation brush. I read so good reviews about this one that I decided to give it a try and WOW! It&#x27;s AMAZING how it sets the foundation. Now I have a wonderful flawless skin, many people that I know has noticed it. So what I say is that every woman must have this brush, it&#x27;s essential.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The service was excellent, I received the product very fast.&lt;br /&gt;Good price, excellent service and the best quality. There are no reasons for not buying the sigma brush F80!</li>
            <li> Great brush! I have been using it to apply my foundation and it gives me a nice and natural finish. The brush is super soft and very thick. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> The Sigma F80 Flat Top Synthetic Kabuki arrived in perfect condition and very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mother try it and she loves it. She said: It&#x27;s unbelievable how dense and soft this brush is!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great great product!! I can&#x27;t wait to get more sigma products!</li>
            <li> I really needed a new face brush, and this was the perfect choice.  It feels so great on my face! So soft and looks so professional.  It gives great coverage too. I am looking forward to buying more Sigma brushes!</li>
            <li> I recently bought the Sigma F80.. I instantly fell in LOVE! It makes my make up look flawless and its so smooth. I love it and will definitely be recommending it to my friends...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that before i started using this brush, i was never satisfied with how other foundation brushes left my skin looking. I always saw patches or streaks and for me it was a hassle because i felt i had to keep on passing the brush more times on the same area even after the foundation dried and even then it still wouldn&#x27;t look right. It looked like i painted my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, to my review. I LOVE THIS BRUSH, is so soft, dense and easy to use. After you use it, your skin looks even and natural, you don&#x27;t look painted at all. Its really easy to move and blend with, NO STREAKS or patches. I&#x27;m really happy with the product and the results it gives. This is a keeper. No brush is better than this one for foundation application. Even if you are new to make up this will be super easy to use. Great shipping and packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE WHO WANT GREAT, NATURAL, EVEN FOUNDATION APPLICATION!!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good foundation brush for a while, and this one is amazing. This brush is so dense and sturdy, yet at the same time extremely soft. I have tried several brushes that were so hard and rough on the skin, but this sigma F80, is so soft. It applies foundation so smoothly, and my makeup is flawless. This is a well made brush and more importantly it does not shed like other much more expensive brushes from different brands I have tried in the past. This is my first sigma brush, and I am definitely going to purchase some others.</li>
            <li> WOW! This brush is fantastic! I can&#x27;t believe I never knew about this brush and why it was so important to use rather than your fingers, sponge or other makeup brush. After using this brush, I was shocked on how good my face looked. Trust me, buy this brush!!! So many of the makeup artists use this brush in order for their clients to achieve a flawless face. Go on youtube and search F80 Brush or even foundation application. FANTASTIC!!! You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> This is one amazing brush. I love it so much. Before, I used my fingers and a regular traditional flat sided foundation brush. Now that I have it, it is a HOLY GRAIL item! It applies liquid foundation so well and blends it nicely. It is SUPPPPPPPPPPER soft as well. It washes easily and doesn&#x27;t shed. This is a brush everyone needs!</li>
            <li> I love this brush, it is the best out of all brushes, it is very dense and flat, and you can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> This is a decent brush, its soft and dense and good for buffing in foundation, but the e.l.f powder brush is too and it&#x27;s 3 bucks...The whole Sigma thing is just a hype. And yes, I say this because I got suckered in. I honestly don&#x27;t have any other use for this brush besides buffing in my foundation. I still use a stippling brush to apply my foundation and this to buff it in, but if I forgot to wash it I use the elf one and get the same result. I&#x27;m not saying that I don&#x27;t like this brush, I do, but if I had to do it all over again I probably would have left it where I found it. It is definately not a \\&quot;must have\\&quot; by any means. If you have the extra money and are into makeup brushes then it&#x27;s worth checking out. But if you are buliding your makeup brushes and makeup collection, I would reccomend checking e.l.f brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brush to apply both powder and liquid foundation and its amazing! I will never use any other brush. It buffs on liquid foundation amazingly and looks flawless. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Received my two Sigmax brushes in appropriate time. Wonderful shipping in a box (not a bag) two brushes sealed with a wonderful red silky bag. Presentation is everything! It&#x27;s obvious that this seller and Sigmax takes pride in their product and believes in customer satisfaction. Thank You! This item was purchased on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I just used this brush today and I already love it! I finished my foundation very fast! I will definitely repurchase more Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> I got my F80 in the mail today and it is amazing. I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it when I first got it, and it definitely didn&#x27;t disappoint!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this brush, completely worth the money. Super soft, and gives a flawless finish when applying foundation! My favorite brush thus far!</li>
            <li> I received the flat top brush and the angled top brush. Both brushes feel great, and upon first use, work great!</li>
            <li> This is a really good foundation brush which you can use with any foundation (liquid, powder and etc).  I also looked at some of other flat top kabuki brushes around this price, and this brush beats other ones if the price is similar.  I think this is a pretty good deal considering the price.  However, I&#x27;d recommend that you purchase directly from Sigma website because shipping charge is cheaper there, and check out some of the youtube channels for 10% off coupon.  If you buy the whole set (12 brushes), 10% could mean free shipping!</li>
            <li> Best brush I have ever used for foundation.</li>
            <li> I love this brush, And I&#x27;ll start off by saying, that there was NO note in my item that said I would receive a gift for a review, so my review is not for a gift, I honestly just love this brush, I use it for both foundation and powder, my makeup goes on very smooth, no lines or patches, I highly recommend brushes for foundation, as they apply it so much better the pads or your fingers. Great buy. SOOO soft.</li>
            <li> I use this to put my foundation on and it is great!! Covers well and is quick and easy! Would recommend this to anyone of any age!!</li>
            <li> so so soft !!. I love love love this brush. I plan on getting more !!&gt; I highly highly highly recommend this product !</li>
            <li> I have tried many different products and brushes but i LOVE this one. The makeup just slides on and it feels so smooth.</li>
            <li> I used this brush Saturday for the first time and I can honestly say my makeup was flawless. Not only did my face looked smooth my makeup also lasted ....I am doing another purchase of sigma brushes. I am a happy costumer...thanks</li>
            <li> Love it ❤️ Its the best brush</li>
            <li> Soft synthetic kabuki, perfect for cream/liquid foundation or powder.&lt;br /&gt;I hate when I buy expensive brushes and they shed all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;This brush is relatively cheap, doesn&#x27;t shed at all, and buffs flawlessly.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this Sigma brush. It is definitely the best brush I have owned. It is so soft and stays soft after using it. This brush blends liquid makeup so naturally and smoothly. It&#x27;s worth the 17 dollars!</li>
            <li> I love this brush! It apply my foundation really good. its soft and the brush doesn&#x27;t shed. I recommend getting this brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with its amazing quality. My skin is ridiculously sensitive and it doesn&#x27;t cause any problems for me. From now on Sigma&#x27;s brushes are pretty much all I will ever need. They are extremely soft and apply make up well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush after reading reviews for it on another website....and I must say that I am not disappointed at all.  It is very soft and dense and is working really well for both my powder foundation and blush application, really helps me to blend it in so that it looks natural and pretty.  I have not had time to wash it yet to see how it holds up but so far, I am really loving it!  P.S. I have many brushes, many of which cost much more than this brush and it holds it own.</li>
            <li> I love this brush and wish I discovered it a long time ago! This is the only way to apply foundation. I am a future make artist and I highly recommend the kabuki brush and this is a great one by Sigma. My foundation just glides on evenly and quickly, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This brush made my face powder look so much better than usual! It&#x27;s super soft and the bristles don&#x27;t fall out like other cheap brushes. It&#x27;s great quality and doesn&#x27;ty make makeup go everywhere, it stays on the brush. I wasn&#x27;t expecting such a great quality brush for the price since I have paid more for a lesser quality in the past. Give it a try, it blends my blush nicely into my powder so there are no harsh lines and it holds up to a good washing.</li>
            <li> The product is great! The brush is very dense. Great for foundation application.</li>
            <li> Amazing! this brush is perfect to apply the Foundation</li>
            <li> This is a quality brush. I give four stars because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the best brush for my skin, personally, but the brush is of high quality.</li>
            <li> Most of my brushes are Chanel, Dior and Mac and I thought I would give the Sigma a try after seeing all the great youtube reviews. I have to say I&#x27;ve had it for 8 days and have used it everyday. I love it! It&#x27;s great for applying my Dior foundation.</li>
            <li> Best foundation brush! I have used a foundation brush in the past that resembles a paint brush. My foundation went on with streaks. NOT with this brush. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this Sigma brush. You will not be sorry if you buy it.</li>
            <li> This brush is really great. I found this after buying MAC brushes got just too expensive, and I have to say, I can&#x27;t tell the difference. The bristles are SO soft and very densely packed. It blends foundation like a dream and doesn&#x27;t absorb foundation much at all. Would definitely recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I searched for so long for a kabuki brush, but every time I bought one, it was all messy because most brushes fell apart. But I finally purchased my long awaited Sigma Beauty Kabuki Brush. My friend recommended me this one, saying how it perfectly blends everything on her face. So, I decided to give it a shot, and I just got it today. The shipping was so fast, and I was so excited that I took off my make up just to try this brush, and I have no regrets! It is perfect, with high quality material and a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is a great brush. Its soft, easy to use, leaves your fave looking flawless. The only thing is it is a bit hard to clean.</li>
            <li> I just got this in today and have already used it. ITS AMAZING.  Im so glad I didnt buy the MAC brush which was more than double the price.  This brush provides really good coverage, lets you use less of your foundation, and is really amazingly soft.  The bristles didnt come off at all, which is a problem ive had with other new brushes.  Love iT! Am a Sigma user for life.</li>
            <li> its not the real product but it gets the job done</li>
            <li> The Sigma F80  Flat top brush  is better than any other makeup brush out there. I have several high end brushes that I thought were great brushes until I tried this one - they don&#x27;t even come close to the coverage this brush delivers.  Using this brush, I have  found that I love my finishing powder even more.  This brush is a miracle worker for buildable coverage. You can also use it with liquid foundation with the same amazing results. This brush is a must have! You will definately see the difference the first time you use it.</li>
            <li> Fake brush. Not sigma!! I have sigma brushes was very easy to tell it was not sigma</li>
            <li> Love my kabuki brush! Changes my makeup routine so much I love the soft bristles. For me it took 3 days to dry but I still love it.</li>
            <li> I just received this brush, and it is full, firm yet soft, and luxurious feeling. I almost want to try it out as a paintbrush!</li>
            <li> Flawless and fast foundation application with this brush.</li>
            <li> I have been using a beauty blender which I love, the makeup looks really natural but my problem is that I tend to use more product to achieve a medium coverage with the beauty blender because the damp sponge sheer the foundation and I don&#x27;t want to be wasting a lot of product. So after reading so many reviews about this brush I decided to give it a try and I have to say it takes longer to blend the foundation on the face. Right away it gives good coverage, like a medium coverage but it doesn&#x27;t look flawless and to get to that point I have to blend it a lot so the foundation will get sheer and I don&#x27;t like that. Also the brush is not easy to clean, takes a long time to dry. About absorbing a lot of product I don&#x27;t think this brush does that. I will keep using it but I prefer the beauty blender. I will use this for every day looks and the beauty blender for special occasions with a flawless face look.&lt;br /&gt;I forgot to add my skin is dry combination and with the brush I can see dry patches, the beauty blender leaves my skin feeling moisturize and looks really nice not dry.&lt;br /&gt;The foundations I have used with both tools are Mac Pro longwear nourishing waterproof foundation, Nars all day luminous foundation and Nars sheer glow.</li>
            <li> Having never tried any product from Sigma, I was very impressed with this brush.&lt;br /&gt;I watch beauty gurus on youtube all the time, and a lot of them use this brush and their make-up always looks flawless.  So, I figured I would try it out too.&lt;br /&gt;My favorite thing about the brush, is that it does not leave my face feeling itchy.  Other brushes I have used (real hair and synthetic)tend to make my face itch and turn red (so not cute).  I also like that this brush is easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;-Ash</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing!!! It is sooo soft and wonderful to use to apply liquid foundation. I love it!!! Worth every cent. Highly recommended!!![[ASIN:B003UH0528 Sigma Beauty Flat Top Synthetic Kabuki - F80]]</li>
            <li> I just got it this morning so I know it&#x27;s only been a day but wow! The bristles are really soft. This brush does it&#x27;s job. I am using my brush for applying foundation. It massages the foundation into my skin for a flawless finish. I heard about this brush from a blogger and am so happy to be the new proud owner. Next up is more Sigma brushes!</li>
            <li> The F80 brush came in the mail today and couldn&#x27;t wait to apply my makeup with it. Terrific after look!!</li>
            <li> I love how thick and soft this brush is! It works great for blending, and the price is to die for.  Thanks to this brush my make up looks like it has been done by a proffessional, you cant go wrong Sigma rules. I feel confident in buying other Sigma products!!!</li>
            <li> Its an amazing brush , it was my first one from Sigma but it will not be my last.&lt;br /&gt;I loooove it , it gives the best look for your foundation and you don&#x27;t look like a cake face.</li>
            <li> I saw the Sigma F80 flat kabuki brush on a you tube video and had to buy it and try it! I love it! It has so many great uses from applying cream foundation,to liquid foundation,and I have even used it with my face toner!&lt;br /&gt;I would totally recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I knew from the reviews that this was a popular brush, but I had no idea I&#x27;d love it this much. I use it with concealer AND liquid foundation. It truly is a multi purpose miracle brush.</li>
            <li> I used to use Chanel brushes that are made with natural hair. But what I discovered after a while that they have very short life span. The hairs fall out remaining on my face which is pretty nasty. So I resorted to finding synthetic brushes instead. This brush delivered as promised. It&#x27;s very dense and makes application of foundation easy. It works with powder foundation great too. Easy to hold handle is not too long, just right to fit in your hand. It takes a couple of washes to get all the gunk out, but I would imagine it&#x27;s normal. I like this brush.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I use it everyday with my wet face makeup. It buffs it in evenly and is great!!:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a newbie to the makeup world... this was perfect for my liquid makeup. Very great quality for the price.</li>
            <li> I just ordered this product 3 day ago and I already received it!!! And I just what thought it&#x27;s the softest brush ever and it&#x27;s a fantastic to apply foundation !!! Love it</li>
            <li> I got this kabuki brush a couple of months ago...I love it! It works so good with my liquid foundation that I bought a back up.</li>
            <li> I Loved this brush, It is so soft on the skin. I use liquid foundation and it applys so flawlessly! five stars!</li>
            <li> Love Sigma brushes, but very disappointed with this one, the hairs are falling out within a couple times of using it... not worth it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this brush long but I love it.  I use it mainly just to buff my foundation after I apply it but I immediately notice a difference.  It makes my foundation look more natural and even and is soft and gentle on my face.  I use mainly MAC products but don&#x27;t want to spend all of the money on their brushes and this was a great alternative.  Good price and great result.  I was incredibly happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Worst brush ever, used once and returned the next day!  The bristles fell out everywhere.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good product. It&#x27;s the most soft i&#x27;ve ever had.[[ASIN:B003UH0528 Sigma Beauty Flat Top Synthetic Kabuki - F80]]</li>
            <li> This brush is great for my foundation I love it I don&#x27;t get any streaks or lines, it looks flawless, I recamend this brush to all my friends! And it&#x27;s a great Xmas gift!</li>
            <li> I first purchased this brush in January, but after almost a year my brush broke in half. I must have been using it too much or too hard because the ferrule came off the handle, and the bristles went all over the place!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But............. I loved it so much I purchased a new one today &#x3D;] I can&#x27;t live without this brush, it blends my foundation so well and everything just looks airbrushed. I just hope it doesn&#x27;t break this time &#x3D;] I use this brush and my travel kit sigma brushes, and the face always looks BAMMMMMMMMM</li>
            <li> I have seen this brush used by several makeup gurus on youtube, but put off buying it for months.  I finally broke down and purchased this brush and have been blown away.  This brush gives a flawless finish that I&#x27;ve never had with any other brush, and I&#x27;ve used many.  The price of this product is perfect and won&#x27;t break the bank!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush! This bristles are incredibly soft and it applies my foundation seamlessly. I&#x27;ve been looking for a good foundation brush for a while, and when I heard good things about this one I decided to try it out. It was such a great decision because I reach for this brush everyday now!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a replacement for my ELF foudation brush and heard about this brush from youtube beauty gurus. It arrived so quickly, in like 3 days, and it feels so soft as if im touching a chinchilla!</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing! I have acne scars on my face that seemed impossible to cover up, and all I needed was this brush! It covers up the scars and blemishes easily and leaves my face looking clear and gives it an airbrushed effect.</li>
            <li> I saw this brush alot on youtube makeup tutorials and I decided to buy it myself. The brush arrived with in only a few days and came in a really cute draw string bag. The brush is soft and definitely great quality! I&#x27;m excited to use it for liquid foundation application!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many foundation brushes and I have to say this is my holy grail brush!  It applies any type of foundation smoothly, streak free.  If you&#x27;re looking for a new brush, give this one a try!</li>
            <li> It works great and a good price totally worth it and looks great I love it and would recommend to friends</li>
            <li> Great quality brush. Happy with my purchase. The brush is exactly what I expected.  Love it. This is by far the best brush in my collection.</li>
            <li> Works like a dream with foundation application. Completely flawless finish. Very dense bristles that are SO soft. No streaking or breaking up the foundation once it&#x27;s on</li>
            <li> The best of the best brushes I&#x27;ve ever used, it blends great and you get the best smooth look :)</li>
            <li> Amazing!! It&#x27;s just great quality! I love it for putting on my powder foundation, and to put on blush :) totally recommend it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush! It is perfect for applying foundation and give a nice smooth finish. I even prefer it over my beauty blender because I feel that it gives me better coverage. I have used many brushes for foundation and this is by far my favorite. This is my first sigma brush and I&#x27;m looking forward to purchasing more.</li>
            <li> Best foundation makeup brush i&#x27;ve ever bought. Although it&#x27;s kind of pricey for a stick that puts on makeup, it smooths it out so you don&#x27;t have uneven makeup all over. Definitely worth the price. You won&#x27;t regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> I had been wanting to place an order for some kind of Sigma brush product for quite some time now, and frankly, after receiving this brush I should have done it sooner! I love the quality of the brush itself and its design. Just as good as MAC and a much less expensive venture! I hope to purchase more in the future!</li>
            <li> \\&quot;The products are 5 Stars, just excellent, and I confirm that SIGMA is the best you can buy.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for making my time to put makeup on enjoyable.</li>
            <li> Good brush, but the handle broke in less than a year and I didn&#x27;t use it with every foundation. Maybe used half the year. Good while it lasted.</li>
            <li> This brush works perfect with my liquid foundation. Spreads evenly on my skin. I definitely recommend this brush to everyone. Affordable and works great!</li>
            <li> Amazing flat kabuki brush. Applies liquid foundation evenly without having to do much work and is very soft with your face.</li>
            <li> This brush has become my holy grail, go-to applicator for my foundation. It blends in your makeup flawlessly it cuts the blending time in half for traditional foundation brushes. I&#x27;ve been using for about a year now and I&#x27;ve had NO fallout when washing. I clean my brushes about once a week (sometimes 2 weeks, depending on my hectic schedule). I just wash it with baby shampoo and all the makeup comes out. It takes about 12 hours to dry, but I found leaving it to dry in front of a fan will do the trick in about 4-5 hours.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Came on time. Description was accurate and came in perfect condition. Overall I am very happy with my purchase. I&#x27;m in love with this brush and use it every time I put on makeup. Gives a flawless finish. Definitely want more Sigma brushes in the future.</li>
            <li> I saw a review on this brush on Youtube by a professional make up artist and so I wanted to see how I would like it.  I use BB creams and it put that on like butter.  Its amazing.  I bought one for my friend, who is a foundation user, and she is in love!  She said its the best foundation brush she has ever used!</li>
            <li> I saw a youtube video from a person who does make-up professionally.  She continue to rave about this brush, so I went for it.  I have used all sorts of tools to apply foundation, the beauty blender, sponges, brushes, etc.  This brush gives smooth, even coverage for a flawless finish.  I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I use this brush every day for my foundation. Does not shed very much, and it applies my foundation very evenly. I can blend it out well. Only problem is cleaning it out because it is so dense. That is a minor issue however.</li>
            <li> Love this product I don&#x27;t have that kind of money to buy mac brushes at the mall or a website but I will order a couple of these brushes at a time till I have the set there wonderful and real!!!</li>
            <li> This is fabulous for foundation.  It is so soft and blends foundation so well no matter the amount that is used.  I&#x27;ve washed mine multiple times and have no prolems with shedding.  It does take at least a full day to dry though, so I always have two available!</li>
            <li> I love this brush because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s so soft yet it&#x27;s very dense. Something that&#x27;s hard to come by. Either a brush is so soft but not very dense or vice versa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It&#x27;s great for liquid products. It buffs foundation or cream blushes really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The quality is fantastic. Sigma brushes have never disappointed me. If you want high quality brushes that are comparable or better than MAC brushes, definitely go with Sigma!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Also, the bristles in the brush do not shed on your face!</li>
            <li> Love my new Signma Brush! It is very dense, but still soft. Also, no funky smells from the new brush. Applies liquid foundation evenly and nicely. Will def buy more products from this company :)</li>
            <li> Best brush to put foundation on, this and the beauty blender are the best foundation application tools. in loveeee with it.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin look perfect.  Gives foundation an airbrushed effect.  Wouldn&#x27;t want to go back to the days before I got this.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this brush! It blends my foundation really well and it looks like my face has been airbrushed! I would pick this brush over any flat foundation brush any day since the flat brushes tend to leave streaks. You will not regret buying this brush! :)</li>
            <li> I always used my hands to apply my liquid foundation. When my sister came to visit me recently, she told me to try her Sigma brush, instead of using my hands. I was amazed with how much better and nicer the foundation went on. Very smooth, with no left over streaks. I had to have one. I went onto Amazon and ordered one that night. I received the product yesterday and got the same wonderful results that my sisters brush gave me. I will buy another one, once the current one wears out.</li>
            <li> i liked using the brush to apply liquid foundation and it made distributing the foundation so much easier. also, one thing i liked about this order that it arrived earlier than what is expected, actually it arrived 5 days earlier. it took only 10 days although i live far away in KSA. i&#x27;ll definitely order from them again hopefully in the near future.</li>
            <li> This is my first sigma brush and i love it!!! It blended my makeup really good. I love it so much. I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> Sometimes I wonder how it took me so long to discover Sigma brushes, which are well made, work beautifully, inexpensive, and CRUELTY FREE. Oh well, guess I&#x27;ll just have to make up for lost time. ;-)</li>
            <li> Using this brush to apply full coverage foundation. It works great on large areas. I would recommend the 3D kabuki for the smaller spaces to apply foundation. Does well to not absorb all the product and evenly applying over the face.</li>
            <li> I had this brush for 6 months and it fell apart and with the amazon receipt they replaced it right away and the new is great! sigma is a great company that makes great brushes!</li>
            <li> Brush hairs fell out after a few washes. Very disappointed, especially for it being so expensive.</li>
            <li> After using my fingers to apply foundation for many years. After reading so many goods reviews about this product, I decided to give it a try. Very good brush! Very soft and thick. Provides excellent coverage when used with my liquid or cream foundations. I wish I thought about this looooong time ago. Great price and quality!</li>
            <li> I have used all types of brushes to apply foundation and this one is perfect! It is dense enough to buff the foundation, yet it isn&#x27;t a brush that sheds like others do. It is totally worth the $23 I spent, I can&#x27;t wait to the other brushes in the line!</li>
            <li> This brush has totally changed the way I apply my makeup! Not only does the brush make applying foundation easier and faster, it is also really soft, durable and easy to clean!  I use this brush to apply foundation, blush, and bronzer!  After discovering this brush I am actually excited about putting on my makeup in the morning!!! I love the brush, and I don&#x27;t think I will ever need another foundation brush again!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing, airbrushed skin and I don&#x27;t have good skin!</li>
            <li> When looking for a great foundation brush...this is it...hands down.  It buffs beautifully on the skin and gives a beautiful porcelain look without the &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34; look.  Best brush I could&#x27;ve bought!</li>
            <li> This is a great brush for the price. It smooths my foundation on evenly, it doesn&#x27;t shed, and I&#x27;m able to use less product. I am not a brush user, I usually would use my fingers but this makes it so easy. Anyone who is nervous about trying a brush for the first time or just interested in purchasing this, I highly, highly recommend it. The bristles are super soft and my makeup always looks so good after the application. You definitely need to try it!</li>
            <li> Love it! I recommend this to anyone looking for a good foundation brush.</li>
            <li> I LOVE my Sigma F80. I have one that I purchased from the Sigma site, and I have one that I purchased here. I can&#x27;t tell which is which, so my guess is that this is authentic since they&#x27;re exactly the same. This is the best way to apply makeup. I get a great finish and great coverage every time.</li>
            <li> Does not disappoint!! Great brush.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it. Foundation goes on effortlessly.</li>
            <li> Nice effect w translucent powder</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take long to get my order and so far I love it! It feels very soft on my skin and it is alot quicker to put my cream foundation on now. I am going to order Sigma brushes from now on!</li>
            <li> The best foundation brush I have ever used. Gives your skin the airbrushed look. I love it!! It washes up beautifully. It still looks as good as the day I bought it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super soft and super dense! and it&#x27;s the perfect size! I love it! I did however expect it to be bigger, but I kinda like it better the size that it is.</li>
            <li> This was the first Sigma brush I purchased. I absolutely love it! I use it to buff in my foundation, and it&#x27;s fantastic. It doesn&#x27;t even compare to the other foundation brushes I own. I love how dense it is but the bristles are very soft. It&#x27;s just an amazing brush. It&#x27;s the Sigma F80 Flat Top Kabuki brush from the Sigmax collection. I will definitely be purchasing the rest of the collection!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would totally recommend this brand to ANYONE. Absolutely adore it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish they were sold in stores. Hopefully soon &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I ORDERED THIS BURSH ALONG WITH THE SIGMA PROFESSIONAL PREMIUM KIT AND MY DAUGHTER LOVES THE APPLICATION OF THIS BRUSH.  I DIDN&#x27;T UPGRADE SHIPPING AND I RECEIVED THE BRUSHES WITHIN 5 DAYS.  NICE PROTECTIVE PACKAGING.  CHECKED THEM FOR AUTHENTICATION THROUGH A PERSONAL SOURCE AND THEY WERE FOUND TO BE AUTHENTIC IN MY OPINION.  GREAT BUY!</li>
            <li> best brush to use to get the airbrush effect on my face, tried other brush and never get the same result! five star for me!</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing!!!! Totally worth the money! It applies my foundation onto my skin flawlessly. It is the softest brush i have ever felt. For those of you who can&#x27;t afford MAC, you MUST buy this brush as a duplicate! The shipping is SOO fast too! which is a \\&quot;brownie point\\&quot; in my book!! Sigma Brush is on the top of my CHRISTMAS LIST this year!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d heard many people raving about this brush on youtube makeup channels and on the web in general, so I finally decided to purchase one of my own. I went the actual sigma website but the shipping said that it would take quite a long time to get to me, and I couldn&#x27;t wait that long. When I found this brush on Amazon, I immediately ordered, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased! The brush works perfectly with my liquid foundation, and I got it SOOO fast! Days before it was scheduled to arrive! I definitely recommend purchasing this brush AND ordering it from this seller!</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;ve been wanting sigma brushes for a long time... but really, they weren&#x27;t even an option. i couldn&#x27;t justify buying makeup brushes when we have bills to pay. i have to admit i settled for &#x27;comparible&#x27; brushes... and now that i have the sigma brushes. they are NOT comparible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i got 2 of the high definition (f80 and f82) sigmax brushes. so finally today they arrived.. and they are AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;they are so dense that they don&#x27;t waste product and the fibers are shorter to get a more precise application. i have to say, they are worth the price. FO SHO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for the full review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[…]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for make up brushes on Amazon and found it really hard to decide if I should choose to go for a make up brush set to \\&quot;save money\\&quot; but in fact I was only looking for a stippling and a kabuki brush. Fortunately, I found a two-in-one brush from Sigma. This F80 is a stippling and kabuki brush in one! It&#x27;s extremely soft and dense. I&#x27;ve experienced no shedding. I&#x27;ve bought a lot of make up brushes before but nothing beats this one! I would definitely want to try their other brushes. Their make up brush is one of my best cosmetic investments ever! :)</li>
            <li> oh my, this brush exceeded all my expectations! It really gives a flawless airbrushed finish. I&#x27;ll never use any other brush for applying my foundation :)</li>
            <li> The delivery of this item was excellent!I believe I received the item in 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I started using this item it is very easy to use. I use liquid foundations and this applies it flawlessly for the most part. The only thing is that I have noticed some minor shedding when I received the item but I dont mind really- its still a great brush and its very well worth the money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definetely will be buying again!</li>
            <li> Placed my order on Sunday--it arrived on Thursday--couldn&#x27;t be happier with the prompt service. Love the Kabuki--is much softer than my BE flat top brush. It makes mineral application a breeze, makeup looks smoother &amp; more natural.</li>
            <li> In one word....awesome! A friend recommended it so I bought it, used it and loved it. Gives a clean natural finish to your liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> I just got this brush in the mail today and used it to apply my makeup and it went on flawlessly.</li>
            <li> Ordered the F80 after seeing countless great reviews. Perfect for liquid and powder foundation. Very soft and just the right size. Great quality. Definitely ordering more brushes from sigma!!!</li>
            <li> this is the best kabuki brush I have used!! it is so soft and dense! I use it to apply my liquid foundation and it gives me a flawless finish.i also use it to apply blush and powder foundation it is so versatile. if you are thinking of purchasing this product i highly recommend you do.</li>
            <li> I just ordered a few of the bushes last week. They came in very fast. Packaging was really nice. I must admit I did not know what to expect from these brushes, but they are wonderful!!! super soft an work amazing with liquid foundation. I read lots of reviews and  gota say you just have to buy these. if you need quality brushes you definitely want to go with Sigma and not over pay by buying Mac. I am very very impressed with these and recommend them whether you&#x27;re a make up beginner or pro.!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical on buying a brush for stippling in fear that it really wouldn&#x27;t work. So, after reviewing many brushes I decided on this one and am I glad I did! I am very happy with this brush! It is amazingly soft, but with the bristles so compact it stipples nicely! I will definately buy more stigma brushes!</li>
            <li> I really mean what I said above in the title....I&#x27;M IN LOVE!!! This is the perfect size brush, it blends makeup so smoothly, and it&#x27;s SOOOO soft. I got butterflies in my stomach when I first used it, I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this brush....and I have a feeling the more Sigma Brushes I buy, the better it&#x27;s going to be! Get yourself one or a lot and you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> This brush is really really nice.  I use it to buff in my setting powder all over my face for that &#x27;airbrushed&#x27; look.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend loves the brush and plans on buying all the sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> Love it! Foundation goes so perfect!</li>
            <li> i love it for foundation it&#x27;s amazing brush</li>
            <li> Love this brush.  I use it to apply my foundation.  NO streaks and works great.</li>
            <li> I love this brush for foundation! Its so easy to use and blends your foundation flawlessly. Its super soft and great quality.</li>
            <li> I must say that this brush is great!! I have always bought MAC brushes but was disappointed with my last MAC brush because it shed so much!! This brush blends  liquid foundation perfectly on my face...I have already placed another order for a powder brush and cant wait to try it out. This is a must have!!!</li>
            <li> Love love LOVE this brush!  I am slowly replacing my makeup brushes with Sigma brushes and this one so far is my absolute favorite! I use it with Tarte Amazonian Clay 12-hour full coverage foundation, and with this brush, the foundation goes on beautifully- no streaks and blends with no problem.  It really does give a flawless airbrush-type finish with minimal foundation usage.  I have no problem blending around my nose either with this brush (not sure why others have said in their reviews they have...?)  I will recommend this brush to anyone, not just those needed to cover blemishes or whatnot on the face.  This is just a flat-out fantastic foundation brush.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush for several weeks and it is the best brush for foundation, hands down.  It blends so well and leaves no streaks or brush marks.  It truly leaves a flawless finish to my foundation.  I will never apply it without this brush ever again!  It cleans up very easy and the brush is very soft on your skin.  Buy this brush...you will not  be disappointed with the quality.</li>
            <li> Love it, soft, useful, new favorite brush</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom because I am obsessed with Sigma brushes. It blends so well.</li>
            <li> Awesome brush. I use this to blend my liquid foundation and it does an awesome job. I use this brush everyday.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing brush. I&#x27;m really satisfied since it makes my foundation routine more easy and perfect than other brushes that I had.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush for foundation application! I wont ever use anything else ever again! My foundation looks flawless.</li>
            <li> I got a fake copy , wasn&#x27;t so surprised about that as I read reviews that I should be carful but it works okay</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this brush since i bought it and i was just researching now i thought it deserves a review. the hair have been falling off ever since i have it, when i put on foundation some hairs stay in my face, its really bad. I dont know if it was just that one or maybe it was just bad luck i had :(</li>
            <li> This brush disappoints. The first time I used it, one of the bristles popped out as longer than the others, and I can&#x27;t even pull it out. See picture. It also does not blend well at all.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!!! almost as perfect as the beauty blender.</li>
            <li> I just started wearing liquid foundation and have found that a traditional flat brush left me with hard to blend streaks. I got this brush after hearing lots of makeup artist rave about it, and its wonderful! It buffs my makeup on flawlessly and leaves little to no streaks. Its a thick dense brush, and its made of a of a high quality material. I did wash it right away and it only shed a few hairs.</li>
            <li> This is my all-time favorite brush for any type of foundation! I usually always use thicker liquid foundations but it&#x27;s great for liquid, cream, powder, anything really. It will leave your foundation looking flawless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is reallyyyyy soft so you don&#x27;t feel like you ripping your face off. You will love tho brush. :)&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> Love love this brush! So ridiculously soft and glides on smooth. I want to rub this over my face all the time haha. Would definitely recommend. Can&#x27;t wait to try other sigma products!</li>
            <li> This flat sigma kabuki brush works great to put on foundation. Love it!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for the wife. My wife speaks very highly of this brush. It is now a staple of her morning makeup routine. From my perspective, she looks beautiful.</li>
            <li> better than any traditional foundation brushes!easy,fast to apply.get you good coverage.&lt;br /&gt;very dense,the softest ever.&lt;br /&gt;worth more than 16 bucks~!</li>
            <li> Let me start out by saying This sigma brush is so soft! It works perfect for my liquid foundation and powder, It glides on my foundation and doesn&#x27;t make my foundation look weird after wards. I don&#x27;t know how to explain it but it just works!!!! So glad I found this, would definitely recommend for someone looking for a kabuki brush.</li>
            <li> I gave up on doing my makeup because my foundation always looked terrible and I didn&#x27;t know how to fix it. I saw a youtube video that recommended this brush and decided to try it. I now do my makeup every single day. Love love love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Sigma Beauty Flat Top F80 brush for about a week to apply foundation on my face.  Brush is great! Haven&#x27;t had any issues with loose brush hairs falling out and the application makes the foundation look flawless!</li>
            <li> I love this brush, it only problem i had with it was that when I got it in the mail, some of the Brussels were sticking out.</li>
            <li> I just recently purchased the Sigma F-80 and it is the best brush I have ever used! It makes my makeup look flawless. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am so excited with my new brush. It is so delicious. It is nice to have a great brush that doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune and then fall apart. Fast shippment. Thank you</li>
            <li> This brush in my opinion applies foundation perfectly! and as a plus its super soft! :) This product is also nice quality. I have never had a problem with sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> I have been watching Samantha Schuerman on Youtube for a while, and she is always talking about how fabulous this brush is. So I decided to give it a try. I must say it is absolutely AMAZING. It&#x27;s by far the best brush I have ever purchased. It makes my foundation look flawless. I will definitly purchase more items from Sigma.</li>
            <li> I really liked the feel of this brush but after a few months of using it the bristle on one side all started to come out! Not happy.</li>
            <li> Good make up brush, worth the price, very dense brush and good size for whole face application. Looks the same as in picture.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, but not great. For the price, I had expected more. Perhaps, I am not using it the way it supposes to be used.  A damp sponge does a better job.&lt;br /&gt;___________________&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I have come to like the brush more and more.  It really holds up perfectly.</li>
            <li> lasted a solid year before all the bristles fell out of the brush handle. I ordered directly from sigma so it was a genuine brush.</li>
            <li> This brush has completely revolutionized my foundation routine. I used to apply foundation with my fingers - not anymore! With this brush my foundation goes on smoothly and flawlessly every time. It truly is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best face brushes I&#x27;ve used! Its so soft and always gives a even coverage. I also got the brush fast. Great seller.(:</li>
            <li> I bought this brush because I wanted to use a brush to add liquid foundation to my face, and I fell in love with it. I had use other brushes for my face (real techniques bold metal foundation brush, Eco Tools foam applicator) but this one was the best. It make your face look great and since the brush is not small it makes applying foundation easier and faster. I would really recommend this brush to anyone looking for a good foundation brush.</li>
            <li> This brush has nice soft and smooth bristles that make it easy to apply foundation. It was delivered to me on time and was not too expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry but this is definitely not the real thing or something is Def wrong with the brush!! Brush itself is small and it sheds like crazy I should have just spent the extra money and got the real deal</li>
            <li> This was the very first makeup brush I ever used once I started getting into makeup &amp; I love it. I use it to apply my foundation every day and it does a great job at not stealing any of your product. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Nice! just as advertised</li>
            <li> love this brush. nice firm brush. only thing is that its smaller than expected. I have the ELF flat top which is larger and covers a wider surface. but it is a great brush. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing brush. My makeup goes on so smooth!!</li>
            <li> Very good foundation brush. Good for liquid foundation, not that much for BB cream. I have been using it for over half a year, very happy about it. It needs frequent cleaning, but not an issue for me.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush! I use it to apply my foundation. My only complaint is that since it&#x27;s so dense it can be hard to clean (I deep clean all my brushes weekly) and it takes forever to dry.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my new brush. This is my first time doing my foundation with this brush instead of my hands or sponge, and I have to say it does make a difference. There are no lines it blends the cream very evenly, I should have ordered this years ago!!! I suppose at 38 yrs old I&#x27;m still continue to learn new things. Also the shipping for this product was very fast.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this brush! It makes my foundation look flawless and airbrushed! They even sent me an eyeliner brush :)</li>
            <li> Great product.  Just have to watch out and not pull too hard on the bristles or the glue that holds it will loosen.</li>
            <li> I love make-up and have more foundations than I care to admit to.  There are always brushes that seem to work well on liquid foundations, or you find one that works well on powder foundations.  What about having a versatile brush that works well with most, if not all foundations?  I found this brush to be perfect!  It blends out each foundation so smoothly, easily shearing it down for minimal coverage or adding more for a fuller coverage.  The bristles are tightly packed together and are super soft on the skin. I can&#x27;t believe how amazing it seems to blend the foundations into your skin.  I&#x27;ve loved it so much, i&#x27;ve purchased this for family and friends and am glad to say they love it as much as I do.  I had to repurchase when I lost my original, and would purchase again if anything happened to the one I have now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sigma has also updated their Amazon authorized sellers:&lt;br /&gt;AVEYOU Beauty Boutique&lt;br /&gt;etailz&lt;br /&gt;Fresh Botanica&lt;br /&gt;Instyle Products&lt;br /&gt;NetRush&lt;br /&gt;NutraGroup, Inc.&lt;br /&gt;PNN Logistics</li>
            <li> I love this brush and the way foundation looks using it. I use this for foundation and my setting powder. It just looks great!</li>
            <li> and now I know why. Such a gorgeous brush! I plan on getting so many more from the collection. If only they made the flat kabuki in copper too):</li>
            <li> I have owned many different types of makeup brushes and Sigma wins out of all of them. I am exceptionally satisfied with my purchase and recommend this specific brush (F80 Flat Kabuki) to EVERYONE that wears foundation.</li>
            <li> This was the first \\&quot;expensive\\&quot; brush that I have purchased, i.e. more than $5.  I was very pleased with the packaging and the way the product arrived.  The brush is super soft and I have not had any problems with shedding.  I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> most of the sigma brushes that i&#x27;ve ordered shed on me like crazy! everyone says they&#x27;re a mac dupe.. but i&#x27;m not too impressed with the quality...</li>
            <li> Now I said I would buy this again. I have MAC and Sigma brushes, and honestly I think they are totally comparable. If I were to be blindfolded and had to tell the two brands apart, I don&#x27;t think I could. My favorite brushes out of this set are the foundation brush and the angled blush brush! Definitely looking into getting more brushes from Sigma!</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush after using the one that came with my BareMinerals set--and what a difference! The BareMinerals one shed bristles everywhere, and I would end up picking off strays from all over my face. I have never had an issue with this one, not a single bristle lost! Color me satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love this brush, however when I received it, the metal was dented and the brush was poorly packaged. I contacted Sigma, as E-tailz was a trusted reseller, and she replaced my brush for me no questions asked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this with Makeup Forever HD Foundation and it goes on really well, no shedding at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make absolutely sure you purchase this from an official retailer (Sigma has a list on their website), because if it arrives damaged Sigma will fix the problem.</li>
            <li> Love this brush, use it to apply liquid foundation. It leaves a great airbrushed look and uses less foundation then another foundation brush I had. Love it!</li>
            <li> I heard about this brush from a friend. When I got it by mail, I noticed how flawless it was! I use it everyday now. It&#x27;s super soft and puts liquid foundation on beautifully!</li>
            <li> This brush rules. It&#x27;s soft. It&#x27;s dense. It&#x27;s affordable. It really makes my makeup blend better than any other brush I&#x27;ve used. I use it to stipple and buff out my liquid foundation. It creates an even coverage. I&#x27;ve washed it a few times and only a few hairs shed. This is my first time using a flat top kabuki so I can&#x27;t really testify if it&#x27;s the \\&quot;best one\\&quot; out there. But I really have no reason to try another brand since I am very satisfied with this brush.</li>
            <li> If you want a flawless looking face then you NEED this brush! With this brush I noticed I am wasting less foundation. Best purchase seriously!</li>
            <li> I only use Sigma brushes because they are wonderful and they get the job done beautifully and the price is reasonable.  However, as much as I love my regular set, the Sigmax brushes are my favorite.  The Kabuki line is amazing and this brush is perfect for foundation application (dry or liquid).  Well done, Sigma.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very grateful about the quality of this brush. This is extremely soft and dense, what make it perfect to apply the foundation. This is far the best brush than I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ll probably try another Sigma Brushes in future.&lt;br /&gt;In addition I have to say that the shipping was faster than I hope. It received the shipment in only 8 days! If the shipping charges to Spain was cheaper, It would be perfect.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush since i received it about a week ago to apply my foundation. It applies smoothly and does not shed at all. This was the first brush i have purchased from Sigma and i will be purchasing many more.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this brush so far.  The synthetic bristles aren&#x27;t irritating to the skin and it stipples very nicely.  Since it&#x27;s a different \\&quot;feel\\&quot; to the MAC 187, my wrist was a little bit tired after the first couple of uses but it&#x27;s definitely fine now.  It&#x27;s also very easy to clean.  I recommend this to anyone looking for flawless coverage!</li>
            <li> very good!better than sonia kashuk ,and price is somewhat okay for $21,not too high,noot too low that makes you think its a stinks product</li>
            <li> I Use this with MAC BB cream, which can be quite thick, after stippling and blending with this brush it finishes to a beautiful skin-like texture</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would really like this or not bc I am so used to using my fingers when I apply liquid foundation  but I was wrong.  I first fell in love with the softness of this brush however it does have a strong plastic (?) Oder when you open it. Wash it before you use it really well and also wash the plastic cover it comes with if you plan on keeping it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works like a dream! I never knew my foundation could look so well on my face! It provides a more superior coverage than if you just used your fingers and the finish is really and truly flawless!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You really need to try it for yourself. I have used some cheaper brushes before for my base but it didn&#x27;t  work like this one, that  is for sure!</li>
            <li> best brush buy far! Applies make-up on flawless. My make-up look sooooooo much better now that I have used this brush... 100++++++ thumbs up. You will not regret buying this product.</li>
            <li> If I had to use a brush to apply foundation it would be this one. Best brush I&#x27;ve found and the hairs stay in place for a long time through many washes.</li>
            <li> Great brush!!! Its so soft and you can tell a good quality. I use it for liquid foundation and sometimes for my powdered highlighter. Washes great, I havent had bristles come out.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting this brush for so long, and have always been somewhat hesitant to buy for the cost, and the shipping cost on the sigma website, i finally decided to go for it when i found it on here for free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was ridiculously quick. It got here on the fourth day after i placed my order!! I love how it also included the monthly free gift brush that sigma provides from their direct website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, wonderful quick shipping, i will definitely be purchasing my other sigma brushes from this retailer!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the brush, it is amazing. Super soft, sturdy and dense bristles which allow for a wonderful application and buffs any liquid into the skin really well!</li>
            <li> My favorite brush.  Work great for applying liquid foundation using stippling method for flawless coverage.</li>
            <li> Authentic Sigma brush. And my foundation comes out flawless. ;)</li>
            <li> This sigma brush Is the best foundation brush for even coverage!</li>
            <li> ordered this to my sister and she loved it so much.</li>
            <li> love love love ... forever.. it&#x27;s the only brush that gives you natural look even if you apply too much foundation.</li>
            <li> This is definitely one of the best brushes I have purchased! The bristles are extremely dense which helps make the application of foundation streak-free! I normally wash it once a week with Dawn dish soap and let it dry overnight. I have been using this brush for about 7 months and IT HAS NOT SHED 1 HAIR!!! I wish I would&#x27;ve bought this brush sooner, instead of wasting my time with the more expensive MAC brushes, since this brush is the same if not better!! One of my Best Buys!!!</li>
            <li> Not worth 1 star I bought this brush at the end of June and it sheds horribly! Never ever had brushes do this. I&#x27;m LIVED!</li>
            <li> Best foundation brush I&#x27;ve ever owned!</li>
            <li> I bought this brush after hearing rave reviews on YouTube. However, the very first time I used it it shed like crazy, like...I&#x27;ve never had a brush shed this bad even my cheaper ones. I haven&#x27;t written it off as horrible, yet. I plan to use it a few more times to see if the shedding subsides. I really want to love this brush.</li>
            <li> Works wonderful with my liquid makeup.</li>
            <li> I was initially skeptical but most of the &#x27;gurus&#x27; rave about this brush for liquid foundation. I gotta say, I am not disappointed! I just started getting into this whole make-up thing with baby steps and just using light foundation, this is definitely a brush I would recommend again.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing and helps make-up go on with a very flawless look. I Highly recommend buying this brush</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Mandy, I&#x27;m using my husband&#x27;s account. This brush is A-MAZING!!! I just used this brush for the first time today &amp; I cannot believe how good my foundation looks. I have never liked wearing foundation bc I hate the way it always looks cakey on me. And until recently I never needed to wear it but now that I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s, my face is changing &amp; I need to even out my skin more. I chose this brush bc Jaclyn Hill always raves about it so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try and OH MY GOSH I am sooo glad I did!!</li>
            <li> Great!!! I use this brush every single day! Best 15 bucks i spent!!!!</li>
            <li> This brush is fantastic!! Helps spread foundation just the way I thought it would! :) awesome job sigma and thank you Amazon!!</li>
            <li> So the packaging on this was just right. I couldn&#x27;t stop passing the bristles on the back of my hand! Buffs foundation into the skin flawlessly with maximum coverage! I&#x27;m definitely going to order more of this brush as I do multiple faces at a time... I think i want ALL of Sigma&#x27;s brushes!!! :)</li>
            <li> BEST FOUNDATION BRUSH EVER !! I LOVE IT .. I WILL NEVER USE ANOTHER BRUSH I SWARE!!!! SO EXCITED , LOVE SIGMA</li>
            <li> I love this brush, it gives a nice flawless finish to any liquid foundation that you use. It&#x27;s the perfect size because it gets into the crevices that bigger brushes can;t.</li>
            <li> I saw this product used in a tutorial on YouTube and thought it might work well for me and it has.  I&#x27;m not a professional...just wanting to learn more about cosmetics and techniques.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product and will purchase additional Sigma products in the future.</li>
            <li> I had very high expectations for this brush prior to use which wasn&#x27;t a bad thing because the brush actually did meet my expectations. Referring to the image above, it was such a perfect application of foundation! No streaky marks, nicely blended and gave me a flawless-looking face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fibers/hairs are EXTREMELY soft! I can&#x27;t emphasise that enough. They are so gentle on my skin, not scratchy at all. I am very please with this brush and it has high quality written all over it from top to bottom - the handle, the silver ferrule and of course, the hair filaments. The hairs being so dense but not too dense is absolute perfection. It makes blending and buffing a breeze</li>
            <li> Literally the best money ever spent! All the money i waisted trying to find cheaper brushes i probably could&#x27;ve used to purchase the entire Sigma set! Would highly recommend the Flat Kabuki for foundation application. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I have try some brushes, but not satisfies yet, this one is the best foundation brush ever!!! It&#x27;s soft, big enough, works quick in my every morning makeup routine. I really recommend this item to everyone who needs a good foundation brush.</li>
            <li> I still love my BeautyBlender but this does a very nice job with making your foundation look flawlessy airbrushed and even over your face! A good foundation probably helps too..</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush for applying foundation.&lt;br /&gt;You do, however, need to be very careful when washing it. I have all kinds of brushes but this is the most delicate. The hairs are easy to pull out and misshape. If you are not careful, you will no longer have a flat top brush.</li>
            <li> The F80 sigma brush is very very good to apply liquid foundation it doesnt leave any lines on my face after i&#x27;am done applying it.</li>
            <li> Love love this brush. I use it for my foundation and it ALWAYS gives an airbrush kind of finish, no streaks and beautiful. Easy to clean and the quality is top notch.</li>
            <li> Guys. I love this brush. I la la la la la love this brush! It makes my foundation look SO GOOD! I didnt know a brush could help my makeup so much!</li>
            <li> This is a great brush!!! It makes makeup look so much more natural. The brush does not shed and it does not smell. I wash it every other day and it still looks perfect. I am very happy with my purchase. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Purchased this because of a recommendation from Jaclyn Hill and it&#x27;s worth every penny. Use it everyday, magnificent investment, airbrush finish, buy it.</li>
            <li> This brush does wonders in applying foundation it blends it so well my makeup looks flawless.  I love sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> The flat kabuki is soft and work great. I am pleased that I ordered it outside the set. Will definitely continue to put it to use.</li>
            <li> Excellent makeup brush and fast shipping</li>
            <li> If you like applying foundation with a brush and are in the market for one, look no further!  This is my absolute GO-TO foundation brush now.  I used to apply foundation with my fingers until this baby came along.  OMG, I cannot say enough great things about the Sigma F80 Flat Kabuki, I&#x27;m a sucker for Sigma brushes anyway but this one takes foundation application to the next level, seriously!  The name is fun to say too, lol.  Actually you should add it to your cart right now....really right... now! ;)</li>
            <li> been hooked with sigma beauty since i purchased on of their makeup sets.damn this brush leaves my foundation flawless and not to mention how soft the bristles are. It does not irratate my skin and it just feels good lol yes ladies and gents this is worth having in your makeup collection! more like a must have!!!</li>
            <li> Looks like it&#x27;s a knock off. The bristles are falling out. Their not standing up anymore. Save your money and buy directly from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Best foundation brush I have ever used!!!!!! Love it!!! Distributes foundation smoothly with no streaks whatsoever. Would highly recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> sigma f80! this is a really nice brush with long lasting smooth finish.easy to blend and doesn&#x27;t take a lot of foundation</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just perfect for foundation..I&#x27;m in love with this brush I can get enough of it...:-)  I recommend for your collection..</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s been working great. Definitely better than my previous cheap brushes. This seller is listed on the Sigma website as an authorized Amazon seller so I believe it&#x27;s not a fake one.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful brush to apply my foundation!  From BB Cream to Matte Foundation, this does the job.  There are NO streak marks and blends my foundation in perfectly.  I HIGHLY recommend this Sigma brush.</li>
            <li> I have heard so many beauty gurus rave about this makeup brush!  I didn&#x27;t believe all the hype but decided to give it a go.  I LOVE this brush!!  It is so soft yet sturdy enough to do the job.  I will never be without it!!</li>
            <li> i have to have 3-4 of these ....love it so much....i will be buying more for sure , for its worth every penny</li>
            <li> I just received my brush in the mail and I&#x27;m a bit skeptical.  The bristles do not appear as \\&quot;dense\\&quot; as they have been made out to be, and some are shedding while others sticking out on the outside are wavy instead of perfectly straight. I&#x27;ve never bought a Sigma product before, so I&#x27;m not sure what to look for, but the reviews online seem to be mixed.  My brush does say \\&quot;made in China,\\&quot; but I&#x27;ve read on here that this is a new legislation on all Sigma products, while others say this is a telltale sign of a dupe. The seller was NG, which I saw as a verified re-seller on the Sigma website, so I&#x27;m confused. The packaging was also sketchy with just a piece of plastic that appears pretty cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason i ordered off of here rather than Sigma itself was due to my Prime account and instant shipping. I&#x27;m not sure if I should return and just buy off of Sigma itself. Please advise.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I use it everyday. It&#x27;s up there with high end brushes like MAC, Sephora, Clinique any of them. I have all of those brushes as well, but this is my go to brush for daily use. It washes well, hairs stay soft, holds product well, and doesn&#x27;t shed. I would recommend Sigma brushes to anyone because all of the sigma brushes I have are great!</li>
            <li> My first time to buy Sigma brush and i must say that i am impressed of the quality. I ordered F80 and just trying how it works out for me, it really makes a big difference on how i applied my foundations, looks flawless! now i am planning to buy a complete set. Yay for Sigma! Thank you :)</li>
            <li> Really good quality brush, I use it to make powder. The best brushed ever! (PS. The bobbibrown&#x27;s may better for the podwer, but the price is to .....)</li>
            <li> I am very much a bargain hunter and I really hate spending full price on anything. That being said, I finally broke down to get a Sigma brush because I had heard wondful things about them. I figured a foundation brush would be the best place to spend my money and went for the F80.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was quick and the packaging was good. I did notice a pretty strong chemical smell when I opened the package but I imagine this will go away quickly enough. The brush is incredibly soft and very thick and sturdy. I went to play with makeup as soon as I had a chance and I love the way this brush applies foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I spent the money on this brush. With good care, I am confident it will last me for a long time and be well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love how evenly foundation goes on with the brush, that is exactly why I had bought it. Then again the E.L.F. Powder brush does the same job just as well as this sigma F80. It does a great job stippling and then blending which I absolutely LOVE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I dislike is the packaging. When I had received my sigma F80, the handle came off right away. I was very very disappointed and that is why I gave it three stars. I have a pet peeve with handles falling because it tells me how well the product was handled, as well as the hairs of the brush were sticking out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, this brush is OKAY, not as dense as the E.L.F. Powder brush (which I recommend , it&#x27;s better quality and you practically save 16 dollars).</li>
            <li> Nice I like it , it&#x27;s one of the stuff that sure I will buy again  , and nice price too</li>
            <li> BEST BRUSH EVER! Can&#x27;t live without this brush. I&#x27;ve gotten this brush for my mom and sister and they love it as well. HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
            <li> There selling fake brushes if you look on your brush and it says made in Chaina there fake. Im very mad about that. I have a real and this fake one and you can tell instantly</li>
            <li> I love this kabuki brush, it blends makeup.  Works well, wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it!</li>
            <li> Applies foundation soooo beautifully. I have other comparable brushes that are cheaper, but I don&#x27;t regret this one at all. I always come back to it. Very full coverage, but smooth.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Spreads evenly.</li>
            <li> Perfect for applying blush. I use it all the time and it makes my makeup come out exactly how I want.</li>
            <li> This brush was all the rave on every website, I usually use a sponge applicator and wanted to try this bc of the talk. Well...my face broke out, and I dont like how heavy the feeling is of having goop on my face. This is my first foundation brush, so it may be that brushes are not for me. It seems good quality, I prefer the sponge though.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to a standard, boring foundation brush again. I love this brush! High quality &amp; semi affordable.. I find it very high end and the Sigma brand in my opinion just blows Mac out of the water. Ive had it for maybe four months now and its never shed once. I could not say that about Mac.. I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li> worth the value, great brush</li>
            <li> Amazing brush! I actually use less makeup now because it&#x27;s actually brushing it on my face rather than soaking it up. Really soft and doesn&#x27;t leave streaks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very dense and I honestly don&#x27;t know what the rave is. It takes up more product than needed.</li>
            <li> Not doing a good job of applying foundation, the brush lost its shape, this is my second bad experience with flat kabuki brush. I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought this brush and didn&#x27;t pay full price for it! Jaclynhill1 Recommended it and she didn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li> SIGMA HAS THE BEST BRUSH LINE IN THE MARKET. I CHOSE THE F80 TO APPLY MY FOUNDATION FOR A FLAWLESS COVERAGE. THIS IS MY FAVORITE FOUNDATION BRUSH AND I WILL BE ORDERING AGAIN SOON.</li>
            <li> This brush is an amazing tool loved it.</li>
            <li> I love this brush! I wasn&#x27;t sure about purchasing it at first because I don&#x27;t typically spend so much on a makeup brush. I&#x27;m a novice when it comes to makeup and application, but this brush really is worth it. It&#x27;s so soft and has really changed the way my foundation is applied. Just love it, only drawback is that I noticed a bristle or two popping out of the top when I received it. No problems with it falling apart so far though, crossing my fingers. Do not regret my purchase at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update: Bought this over a year ago and it is still holding up well. Have lost a few bristles, but it&#x27;s still in great condition.</li>
            <li> I cannot imagining applying foundation any other way! It&#x27;s so soft and thick. I need 3 more to have around though because it gets dirty super fast.</li>
            <li> It is an amazing foundation brush! It makes foundation look flawless. This product is totally worth it! I love it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how i lived without it. It makes my foundation flawless, and i will be using it for the rest of my life!</li>
            <li> The package is only a plastic bag, it is quite disappointed, because the brush shape might be affected.</li>
            <li> This brush feels amazing to use... So soft and high quality. Foundation applies like a dream. I would definitely recommend this product. If you have any doubts just buy it!</li>
            <li> I ordered about 10 brushes from sigma last year. One kept shedding so I emailed them..but long story short got no where quick.&lt;br /&gt;They would not consider helping me but told me it would resolve on its on. It never did. Recently, one of my eye shadow brushes sigma came apart. I have emailed the company many times and again have gotten no where.&lt;br /&gt;I also sent them pictures of the damaged brush. They have a record of my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Finally this weekend I emailed them and told them that I was unhappy about their customer service. I also told them that I threw the brush away and have  bought a replacement. I really do not expect to hear from them.&lt;br /&gt;I really want people to know they are a friendly, helpful company until you have problems. There are lots of brushes that are just as good and cheaper now on amazon. Amazon is a wonderful place to purchase anything because they care and are always helpful after the sale is complete and they have your money. So sad that Sigma is not like amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon you are all doing a wonderful job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an update to my review..&lt;br /&gt;I never heard from sigma but did receive a replacement brush in the mail today.&lt;br /&gt;I guess they took my last email seriously. I must say that I like the brushes that I have bought from them.&lt;br /&gt;I hope others do not have a any problems with their brushes and if they do, the customer service at sigma is helpful.</li>
            <li> Favorite foundation brush!!!</li>
            <li> The reviews don&#x27;t lie on this makeup brush. Easiest application for liquid foundation that I&#x27;ve ever used! This brush gives a flawless, airbrushed look and I&#x27;m so happy I found it!</li>
            <li> Great makeup brush! It does start shedding eventually but it hasn&#x27;t affected applying wet foundation, powder, bronzer, and blush by any means. Love the shape!</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome for applying foundation, however , mine had uneven hairs . I had to cut them. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s the way they are or if this one was poorly manufactured.&lt;br /&gt;I still use it everyday and works well. I was just dissapointed when it arrived</li>
            <li> This is the best foundation brush I have ever used. It leaves my foundation flawless, almost better than my Beauty Blender but I can&#x27;t give it that award because the BB is in a category all of it&#x27;s own. If you&#x27;re looking for a good (albeit expensive) foundation brush that will leave you looking like you don&#x27;t even have any foundation on then this is the brush you need.</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY the Best for putting on Foundation!! Sellers price was amazing</li>
            <li> A must have for applying foundation !! It is my daily  go to brush for applying my foundation and it does so beautifully !  I am impressed with the quality if this brush</li>
            <li> Great brush. Takes less than 5 minutes to apply makeup and coverage is awesome. Will purchase other types of brushes.</li>
            <li> Best makeup tool ever. I used to use a beauty blender for my foundation but this actually works way better. It leaves my foundation looking smooth and flawless.</li>
            <li> Best purchase I have made in a while. Great quality and really does a great job in putting my foundation on smooth and even!</li>
            <li> This is probably the best brush that I have invested in! It works great and is good quality. I have other high end brushes but this one is my favorite!</li>
            <li> Love the brush it is so easy to use and the look that you get is great...you won&#x27;t go wrong if you buy this brush</li>
            <li> Based on all the makeup tutorials I watch, it was what was highly reccommeded and I am happy I purchased it. Study. Seems like it will last for a while.</li>
            <li> I have heard much raves about this brush, I use it with my MAC foundation. It provides a smooth coverage and blends the product great.</li>
            <li> This brush is the best ever.  I love it.  I use this to put my foundation and it has been working like a charm.  I get so many compliments on my skin.  So it does make a big difference.</li>
            <li> RIP Sigma F80. I was careful to never get water in the ferrule and cleaned it just like the rest of my brushes (which are fine), but the bristles came unglued in less than five months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst part is that this is the second time this has happened to a Sigma F80 brush. The same thing happened to my first brush (which made it about a year), but I thought it was a fluke so I replaced it. This seller has refused a refund or replacement.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this brush before and it lasted a couple years before it started falling apart. I thought that was pretty reasonable considering I use it everyday. However, I feel like this brush could be a fake. The handle seems different than my other Sigma brushes (cheaper). I have been using it for a week and the bristles are dense and are not shedding so even though I feel like it could be fake I am happy so far.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I love it!!!!</li>
            <li> Great sigma brushes are the top of the line</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome! I use it to apply liquid foundation and it gives me a flawless pore less look. I really love this brush! It also gives me full coverage, and I have acne scars on my cheeks and chin. I clean this with baby shampoo and it does the job.</li>
            <li> This is my best foundation brush ever!!!</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing and I am so happy with it!! I&#x27;ve been wanting a better foundation brush but didn&#x27;t want to spend the money on one.Finally decided to buy it and am so glad I did! Love how it applies my foundation.Have tried the Real Techniques stippling brush and it didn&#x27;t apply nearly as well as this! If your looking for a brush to apply your foundation this is definitely it.Worth the $24!</li>
            <li> Very sturdy brush for applying liquid foundation. Great size for getting all over and in smaller parts of your face. I like the feeling of it, too. A lot of cheaper brushes feel flimsy and this doesn&#x27;t. Very nice.</li>
            <li> Recommended by make up artist jaclynn hill, love this brush!</li>
            <li> My favorite brush for applying foundation</li>
            <li> Very soft, dense brush, well worth the money, creates excellent stippling effect.  There is no professional generic brand brush equivalent for this. I bought this from Amazon.com for $24 with free prime shipping.</li>
            <li> This is the best foundation brush I have ever used and I have used MANY!  Better than M.A.C.!  Also, the customer service I received from this vendor was excellent!  Super fast shipping.  Thank you so much!  I will definitely be a repeat customer!!</li>
            <li> This brush is so amazing ! This is my favorite brush, liquid foundation goes on perfectly leaving your face Fawless ! I used to use the Mac 180 brush and the sigma one beats it!</li>
            <li> Handle broke after 1st use.</li>
            <li> I love this brush for liquid foundation. It feels great and honestly I have used many brushes but seriously I love this one!!!!</li>
            <li> This is probably one of the best foundation brushes I have EVER had!!! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how I felt about Sigma as a brand after I had reviewed their RIDICULOUSLY PRICED &amp;#34;brush cleaning mit.&amp;#34; However, this had been recommended by so many, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. Wow, this one blows some of my best brushes out of the water. I use this to apply my Dior Airflash, and it gives an airbrushed finish every time.</li>
            <li> Love this brush to put on my foundation! And the price is great on here. If recommended it to anyone who had trouble with other tools they use to apply their foundation.</li>
            <li> From now on only going to buy thus brand :) its dense and firm enough for my foundation but soft on the face.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t live up to the hype. I like it, I really do, but I thought it was going to make my foundation look AMAZING, so I was a bit disappointed. It&#x27;s just so-so. It does feel good on my face...it&#x27;s soooooo soft, but it is hard to clean. My Beauty Blender works better.</li>
            <li> Best Foundation brush EVER!!</li>
            <li> Love this brush. Essential for a flawless and natural skin look. Leaves a smooth foundation application, whether it&#x27;s liquid, cream or powder.</li>
            <li> I love this brush for applying foundation. It&#x27;s the perfect softness, thickness and weight. It cleans well and I am seriously thinking about purchasing a spare!!</li>
            <li> Lately I&#x27;ve been on the fence about buying super expensive foundation and instead opted for this brush after seeing it used in many makeup tutorials online in the hopes that having a &#x27;professional&#x27; tool would help me out with what I already have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is super soft, yet firm enough for perfect application. Compared to using my hands, it greatly improves the coverage quality of the foundation I&#x27;ve been using. I probably won&#x27;t spring for the expensive stuff now that I have a better tool for my &#x27;cheaper&#x27; makeup!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was super fast, too. Overall great purchase. Very happy.</li>
            <li> Love this brush!!! I use it to apply my MUFE HD liquid foundation. My makeup goes on so smoothly and beautiful without leaving streaks all over my face. Going to order another one.</li>
            <li> I really like the quality of this brush! The bristles are so soft and full and really blend makeup very well.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush after seeing so many rave reviews online and on youtube videos. I bought this brush straight from sigma so i know its real. Ive proably had this brush for a month now. i dont know if im using this wrong but it just seems like my liquid foundation sits on top of my face. it gives my face a nice coverage byt after i can completly just wipe it off. no matter how much i try to blend it just collects on the sides of my nose.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE...THIS BRUSH is a miracle product!  I love all sigma brushes and cannot apply my foundations without them.  This is by far my favorite of the foundation brushes though.  I have to purchase another one for back up!</li>
            <li> My friend recommended this brush and I decided to try it. I would never go back to applying liquid foundation with my fingers.Using this brush is super easy and the makeup application is flawless! and I use less foundation each time. The brush is very easy to care for. I use special solution for washing it and the brush dries super fast.</li>
            <li> Great brush! So easy to use, and great quality.&lt;br /&gt;The one I received is definitely the real thing. I was also able to check online and ensure I was ordering it from an authorized seller.</li>
            <li> Arrived in perfect condition. Appears to be the real thing and not a knock off. I purchased from Etailz.&lt;br /&gt;The brush fibers are fantastically soft. Applying my liquid foundation has never felt so good. Blends like a dream and doesn&#x27;t absorb much of the make up. I&#x27;ve only used it 2 days now, but I&#x27;m hopeful the lack of shedding continues on.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this wonderful brush.</li>
            <li> This brush as received a lot of hype from online and social media gurus. It is a great brush to apply foundation. However, I did not find it to be any better or any worse than generic flat top kabuki brushes I own.</li>
            <li> I have never been interested in using makeup brushes before I bought this one. I have watched many youtubers that used this brush for foundation application, and decided to buy. I was using my fingers before, what a difference! I will never go back.</li>
            <li> Great high quality brush great for stippling your foundation on. Essential tool only reason it doesn&#x27;t rinse easily because it&#x27;s such a good quality the bristles are tightly packed together as they should be for this type of brush. Had it fast.</li>
            <li> The brush is incredibly soft and works perfectly with liquid foundation. I&#x27;m a clean freak so I clean my brush every other night and not exactly the gentle cleaning either and to my surprise, not a hair was ever shed! None of my older brushes could survive my rough handling and cleaning but I don&#x27;t care, I&#x27;ve found my perfect brush forever!</li>
            <li> Love the brush.  Unfortunately the packaging was not great because the brush came out and was thrown around the box and the bristles were a mess but I just washed the brush to get them back, just a little inconvenient.  I would put the brushes in a sealed plastic baggy.</li>
            <li> This is great! For some reason I kept skipping over sigma brushes and have some Sephora brand - and for my foundation I purchased the foundation flat stippling brush that was the same brand as the foundation. I didn&#x27;t love the foundation brush but thought that&#x27;s what they all were. I was wrong! I gave this a try after hearing wayne goss talk about how good it was - it is! I used this with my foundation and the foundation didn&#x27;t sink into the brush half as much! And I was able to buff into my skin soooo much better. So glad I bought this. Will look at more sigma brushes in the future.</li>
            <li> This brush is excellent! I&#x27;ve always thought MAC brushes were the best, but after trying this one, I am sold! Excellent material used, really blends your liquid foundation precisely, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I gave this brush 5 stars because it blends everything so well. I use it to apply my makeup and then to blend my concealer and my bronzing sticks.  It is super soft but not at all flimsy like other brushes I&#x27;ve tried. Well worth the $$ and found Amazon had the best price. I even priced it on Sigma&#x27;s website and Amazon still had a better price!  Love it!!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome brush! I use it to blend my foundation and it always looks flawless. I would definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> I bought this to use for my liquid foundations and the results are amazing. It&#x27;s like my magic wand of beauty! All joking aside, I love this brush, would recommend this brush to anyone and have on several occasions. I received this order exactly on time, no issues. The brush is sturdy and well worth the money spent. Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I love this brush for applying liquid foundation. It leaves a flawless full coverage look without being cakey and it blends out excess foundation super easy. I&#x27;ve been using this for over 6 months and have not experienced any shedding. It&#x27;s retained its shape but beware its pretty densely packed (hence good coverage) making it a bit difficult to clean. I swirl it in a teeny tiny drop of olive oil before cleaning with baby shampoo which makes it a bit easier to clean. Overall I highly recommend this brush, If I I could only buy one sigma brush this would be the one.&lt;br /&gt;In comparison to the beauty blender I feel this brush leave a more &amp;#34;full coverage look&amp;#34;  whereas the beauty blender is more natural. But I notice I end up using more foundation with a beauty blender no matter the foundation ( nars sheer glow, shiseido sun protection, chanel perfection lumeire or revon colorstay whipped)</li>
            <li> Wonderful Brush that is very inexpensive compared to known name brands. Always me to use less product than I have used in the past for other brushes. I am Sigma and Morphe brush loyal thanks to these products.</li>
            <li> My daughter ordered this first and raved about it so after a few months I bought my own and I love it.  The bristles are soft and your foundation goes on smooth.  It&#x27;s also great for touching-up if you are in a rush and want to even out your skin.</li>
            <li> works perfectly. can&#x27;t imagine doing my makeup without it now. And, its cruelty free!! No animals hurt to make it :)</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  My stick make up goes on great - thanks for the tip Beat Face Honey .</li>
            <li> I use this every time I use my NARS foundation and it works beautifully. I was looking for a soft blur effect and this is the brush that delivers. I would recommend this 10000 times over.</li>
            <li> This brush is completely AMAZING for putting on liquid foundation! Blends well and doesn&#x27;t soak up the product. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This has to be hands-down my favorite foundation brush of life!  It gives such an even application and it is so soft.  Incredible quality and when you wash it, it comes back even better!</li>
            <li> This was bought for a gift and the recipient loved it. The product itself is perfectly manufactured and the use was easy and gives great results. Can&#x27;t be more specific as I am not the one who uses it, but my friend recommends it fully.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched long and hard and finally found the perfect foundation brush! You must get this - you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush! I bought it on the recommendation of a friend, and boy, it is the best foundation brush I have ever invested in! It gives me a natural flawless finish on my foundation, causes me to use significantly less foundation, and gives me exactly the coverage I want and need. It washes well, and dries almost immediately after I wash it. It is so worth spending the money that I bought a second one!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome brush, perfect for liquid foundation! Makes it very easy to blend! Can&#x27;t wait to complete my collection of sigma brushes!</li>
            <li> Best brush I have ever used for foundation! Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I have no reason to doubt this is a genuine Sigma brush.  It is of the same quality as the brushes I purchased directly from Sigma and the seller is an authorized Amazon retailer according to the Sigma Beauty website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the brush itself, I like it but I find that it doesn&#x27;t give me as good a finish as my Beauty Blender.  It is probably just not a good combination with my particular skin characteristics.  The quality of the brush is excellent and I really wanted it to love this brush but it was not to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference, I have comination skin with large pores which I think is why the brush just doesn&#x27;t work for me...the makeup seems to settle in each pore so I have the polka dot look.  I do not get that with the Beauty Blender.</li>
            <li> The Creme de la Creme of brushes!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product. It allows your makeup to blend in perfectly to skin. Love love love. I am also looking into trying the whole set now. No shedding which i absolutely love</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this flat kabuki brush for about three years (maybe more) now and it still works well. Sometimes I alternate between using this brush, my fingers, or a sponge to apply my liquid foundation. Make sure you keep up with it and wash it well every now and then because mine has gotten a bit gunky from my lack of care for it. Maybe I&#x27;ll purchase a new one soon!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter in law and it arrived pretty fast, but most important that she loved it.  She says the brush is soft and spreads the foundation really well.</li>
            <li> loved thsi brush.  the bristles are sxtra soft.  holds product just right.  glides over skin. hadle fits perfect in hands.</li>
            <li> This is the second F80 brush I have purchased. Awesome brush.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product by Sigma Beaty. Excellent quality! I was travelling in US and it just arrived on time at my friends house.</li>
            <li> I watch several YT makeup gurus and one thing they all have in common is this brush.  I don&#x27;t have a Sigma store nearby so I couldn&#x27;t take a look at it in person but figured it must be as good as they say.  It really is incredible!  The bristles are amazingly soft, densely packed and the handle is solid.  I&#x27;ve cleaned the brush a few times already--no shedding and the brush performs just as well each time.  My order was shipped promptly and there was a bonus brush included, which was a fun surprise.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect brush to use when applying make-up. The bristles are soft but firm enough not to bend. It takes up the right amount if make-up, I only have to shale the tip of the brush. It applies make-up evenly and it looks polished. So, what is the problem?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the second use I found the brush sheds. I kept finding pieces of the brush left on my face. No good, not at all. I had to use another brush, to brush the pieces of this brush off my cheek. Confusing? Well, it works well, but sheds. Story told.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not Recommended For Me. prisrob 06-04-14</li>
            <li> This is the first sigma brush I ever ordered but wish I had waited until I got this one and used it more before purchasing the other Sigma brushes that I did. I would have not purchased the brush set that i did.&lt;br /&gt;This brush is OK, i have a hard time blending product evenly and without streaks. It is soft and pretty dense, but it just doesn&#x27;t work for me I guess. Its difficult to clean product buildup from the brush since the bristles twist out of place easy so you have to be careful to reshape it properly. I haven&#x27;t figured out a good use for this brush yet since I don&#x27;t like using it for what I bought it for. Oh well.</li>
            <li> You can use it to do pretty much anything that you want in the face area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foundation routine has become easier since i got this amazing brush!!!!</li>
            <li> Bristles are very full and dense. Love it....love it!!!!!! I think the sigma brush collection will be my next purchase....for sure..</li>
            <li> Got it as one of my girlfriends Xmas gifts because she watches makeup videos and most girls use this i guess. Out of all i got her this made her day i could tell.... not the roku box or the TV, this little twenty something dollar brush lol women.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what life was like before this brush. It&#x27;s as amazing as everyone says it is. Excellent purchase. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE FOUNDATION BRUSH!!!!!  This brush gives a completely airbrushed finish that no other brush I have does! .</li>
            <li> Lets you put your make up on flawlessly!</li>
            <li> This was a regrettable purchase. I have dozens of brushes- most cost just a few dollars from E.L.F. All my other cheap brushes are better quality. THIS $21 brush started losing bristles- about 20 to 30 of them- after the 1st time I used it. Each time I washed and used it, (you&#x27;re supposed to wash brushes after each use when using with liquid makeup), it lost around 50 more bristles. Well, the 5th time I washed it, less than one week after I got it, the bristles completely fell out of the handle in a big clump!!! I am appalled that this expensive brush was such low quality. Definitely a FAKE!!</li>
            <li> Excellent brush a must need!</li>
            <li> I love to apply foundation with this brush. This brush gives it a nice finish and the makeup looks natural.&lt;br /&gt;I forgot it at my sister&#x27;s house and could not live without it for a month... had to buy a new one again that same week.</li>
            <li> This brush is wonderful if you like that soft perfectly blended flawless foundation look. I have used it with both Clinique and Shiseido foundations and they both looked great!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this brush but i&#x27;ve read good reviews about this so idecided to buy it and it works amaing.&lt;br /&gt;Its so soft and it smoothes out foundation really well</li>
            <li> totally love it!! amazing buy, thanx for everything&lt;br /&gt;love sigma, this brush helpme a lot!, thanx&lt;br /&gt;love F80 bush from sigma</li>
            <li> I received the product very quickly and it&#x27;s a great brush. Sigma makes great products I will definetly purchase again!</li>
            <li> I watched Jaclyn Hill&#x27;s video about this brush on You Tube.  Search for \\&quot;Jaclyn Hill All About Makeup Brushes\\&quot;. The F80 starts at 5:00. She basically says because it&#x27;s synthetic, the brush doesn&#x27;t suck up your product, rather it&#x27;s just a vehicle to transfer product to your face.  You are going to save money because you will waste less product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I thought this brush was unnecessary and I was perfectly happy saving $21 and using my fingers.  I only really put foundation on parts of my face that need cover.  Well.  Since I&#x27;ve bought it, I&#x27;ve been using it to put foundation all over my face because I can&#x27;t help it.  It looks amazingly flawless.  I imagine what I used to look like when I applied foundation with my fingers-like a toddler had attacked me with fingers full of foundation.  I also find it looks natural when I want to put multiple layers of foundation on.  Plus, it takes like 20 seconds flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush saves me time, effort and I end up with a flawless finish.</li>
            <li> I love this brush!! This is my first sigma brush and I am loving it!!! It blends out your foundation so perfectly with no streaks!! I will for sure be getting more sigma brushes now! Good for makeup beginners and experienced. Very high quality brush!! :) buy it!! Worth every penny!! Spend your money on quality brushes like this not cheap ones trust me it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> For a flawless application this brush is a MUST! I apply with a liquid foundation and it leaves such a natural finish. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I used this brush and immediately became possessive of it. IT&#x27;S MINE!  I felt like a 2 year old in an old woman&#x27;s skin, holding on to something that may give me some semblance of a youthful flair for maybe another year or so if I use it.  My children thought it was funny, but I just thought it was sad that I could be reduced to such a state at my age.  But here&#x27;s the bottom line about this brush..... IT&#x27;S MINE!!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it if you are like me and wanted to save $$ on the shipping it&#x27;s not worth it. I own Sigma brushes and got this one but let me tell you it&#x27;s definitely a FAKE! No matter if they are an authorize store I still think they get some fake ones on the side so they don&#x27;t have to pay full price to Sigma alway. So if you bought one and it&#x27;s the real thing good for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DON&#x27;T RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this brush that I&#x27;ve heard so many people rave about. I didn&#x27;t even get to try mine out because it was shedding bristles everywhere right out of the package. It had uneven hairs sticking out of it as well. I do not believe this was a real Sigma brush, even though the seller, Instyle Products, is an authorized dealer according to the manufacturers website. I am returning to amazon and will instead buy this directly from Sigma so I can be positive that it&#x27;s the real thing.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Tried different ones but this is by far my all time favorite. I would definitely recommend it, gets every angle of your face</li>
            <li> This is a great brush. It is very soft and well made. I use it daily. I have had problems with brushes shedding hair and this one definitely does not do that. Really a great brush!</li>
            <li> Just ordered this brush &amp; the F86 on monday. They arrived in perfect condtion 2 days later. Was very impressed how quickly they shipped. I bought them from sigma here on amazon. They sent me a gift with the brushes, some eyeshadow &amp; blusher samples.  The F80 definitely deserves all the hype its been getting. I originally had been using a coastal scents flat top brush for foundation (Im not trying to run down coastal scents) &amp; I always thought my makeup looked fine. But after using the sigma f80 a few times I can really notice a difference in my foundation.  It looks so much better than before. It looks more natural. Every woman should own this brush. I plan on ordering another couple f80&#x27;s for backup and trying out some other face &amp; eye brushes from sigma. The quality of these brushes are amazing. Im only sorry I didnt try them years ago.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying using it.  Didn&#x27;t take long at all to get the hang of it.  I believe that this brush is the very reason my foundation is blending better, looking more natural.  Would suggest checking out a YouTube entry or two to see suggests for it&#x27;s application.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews for this item and decided to go directly to Sigma&#x27;s website. SO glad I did because the brush is amazing! I read a lot of reviews on this particular shipper and decided against ordering off amazon for fear of receiving a fake. I have the real thing and love it!</li>
            <li> This brush is fantastic. It is super dense, doesn&#x27;t absorb product and distributes evenly. I&#x27;ve already recommended it to several friends and actually look forward to using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it with a medium coverage foundation, as well as a BB cream. I saw a noticeable difference with application using this brush vs others and using my fingers. The finish is much smoother and air brushed looking. Will definitely be purchasing more Sigma brushes!</li>
            <li> this foundation brush is awesome I couldn&#x27;t be happier. It works really good and blends the foundation flawless.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife-she is very happy, Brush is so soft, no need to worry about scratching your face. flawless application. very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Its like fully masking my face in color.  I can&#x27;t blend out my makeup its just caking it on.  The brush is soft and everything came on time.  I own other Sigma brushes but this size is just to massive.  This purchase was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this brush! Have no idea what I was doing before it but it&#x27;s my absolute favorite now</li>
            <li> Will not be purchasing Sigma products through Amazon again. This brush barely lasted 2 months! It shed, and was not the quality I expect from Sigma. Very dissapointed and I suspect its a fake.</li>
            <li> This brush is a must have in any make up kit! It&#x27;s great for blending liquid foundation for that airbrushed look. Also great for bleeding for highlighting and contouring. The bristles are soft and the handle well made. Will def buy more sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve used a brush to apply my makeup.  I really like it but I feel I use a little more foundation when I apply it with the brush than if I apply it with my finger.  The brush works very well though.</li>
            <li> I use it for liquid and powder. It really buffs my tinted moisturizer into my skin evenly. The bristles are firm, but not prickly. The handle is easy to grip. It also washes well and the shape returns once it&#x27;s dried. I love this brush. It has quickly become a go to for me.</li>
            <li> Great brush to apply foundation, love it!!!Soft , smoth and resistent i defenetly recomend it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Good price compared to the same quality of others in the market.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this brush. I&#x27;ve had it a little over a month now and it is just spectacular. I use it with my Mac Full Coverage foundation. Winning duo right there. This brush is SO dense and So soft and makes for a very quick and flawless application. No streaking whatsoever. I have had a couple of bristles fall out, but it&#x27;s not many at all and it&#x27;s not getting progressively worse, so I don&#x27;t have a problem with this.</li>
            <li> Shedding like crazy... pretty disappointed. I have less expensive brushes that don&#x27;t shed like this. I only clean this with professional brush cleaner and it shouldn&#x27;t be falling apart like it is.</li>
            <li> I have tectured, oily skin. This brush applies my foundation flawlessly! I used to use a beauty blender. kabucki brush has better coverage and finish. Love the sigma brand.</li>
            <li> This brush leaves my foundation looking flawless! I love it!!!</li>
            <li> absolutely love this brush! I&#x27;ve had it for 3 months now and it&#x27;s still doing it&#x27;s job! definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> LOVE this product. The flattop allows you to spread the foundation evenly and the synthetic fibers do not absorb your makeup. For the price, I don&#x27;t think there is a true comparison. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Soft, durable and easy to clean. I will never use a make up sponge again.</li>
            <li> Just recently discovered the world of brushes for foundation as I&#x27;d either been using a makeup sponge for fingers for years.  After seeing Jaclyn  Hill&#x27;s review for this brush and reading the reviews I decided to invest and WOW has it changed my makeup routine forever.  Will be using this brush from here on out.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush in 2012 when it was $16. Initially I loved this brush and was very happy with it. But after about 6 months, the bristles began falling out after fairly light use, about 2 uses a week. When I say the brush shed, I mean to say it shed a lot and in chunks so much so that it has lost its shape. The picture shows the current state of my brush which saw about a year of use before I gave up on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gently washed this brush so no water got in the ferrule and used the Dry&#x27;N Shape to dry the brushes upside down.</li>
            <li> I went through a lot of reviews about this brush and it was all great. So I gave it a try, but did not do what I expected or do what everyone said it should do.</li>
            <li> I hemmed and hawed over purchasing this brush because I am very skeptical about online reviews since some can be fake or exaggerated, but I finally broke down and bought it after watching a review video on YouTube.  I&#x27;m so glad I did!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to apply my foundation with my hands until I bought an E.L.F foundation brush at my local Target.  It seemed fine so I was using it for a long while as I debated this brush.  (It&#x27;s important that you know that it has only been in the past year that I&#x27;ve been buying more expensive make-up vs. drugstore stuff so I could never justify spending so much for a make-up application brush.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is truly amazing!  First of all, I purchased it from Etailz, one of the Sigma approved Amazon retailers.  As a Prime member, I received my brush in two days in perfect condition and I am positive it is a real Sigma product as it has all the markers other reviewers said a real brush should have.  Then I used the brush and I was blown away at how flawless my foundation came out that day!  The brush is super soft and dense and the product just went on perfectly.  I applied like I always do: pumped some product onto the back of my hand, dipped my brush in, and started at the center of my face, working my way out and up with smooth, circular strokes.  I worked it all in and was thrilled at the the end result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I am going to say that I am a firm believer that the foundation you use makes a huge difference as well (I use YSL Touche Eclat so it&#x27;s a higher-end foundation that itself goes on flawlessly) but I most definitely noticed a difference between the application with the E.L.F brush and this one - there was absolutely no comparison!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is my new go to and I would re-purchase it in a heartbeat.  Just be sure to purchase either from one of the approved sellers so you know you&#x27;re getting a real Sigma brush (another reviewer listed them in a previous review) or go right through Sigma.  I went with Amazon b/c of the super fast, free shipping from Prime.  You won&#x27;t regret your purchase, I promise!  :)nt with Amazon b/c of the super fast, free shipping from Prime.  You won&#x27;t regret your purchase, I promise!  :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really great to use when using foundation. It gets the job done. I recommend it to any girl who loves makeup and makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> this brush is amazing , i put make up on and its better then any of the makeup sponges out there, the only thing is that i thought i was getting it cheaper then the sigma web site. but i end it paying the exact same amount that they sell it for..but other then that i&#x27;m happy with it i love it. please get this ladys..it makes your foundation come out flawless.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I have been wanting in a foundation brush. It doesn&#x27;t leave any brush marks and blends the foundation into the skin to provide a flawless coverage. I use this brush with my MAC foundation and I am amazed at the difference from using this brush to apply versus my fingers. This is my favorite brush!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little late in writing this review, but better late than never.  I purchased this brush in March&#x27;13.  My first time using this brush, I was already really disappointed with the quality.  First off the ferrule was loose.  I always wash my new brushes before using them and always lay them flat to dry, so I&#x27;m pretty sure it was loose beforehand.  Even cheapy brushes don&#x27;t usually have loose ferrules, and considering how much this cost, it doesn&#x27;t exactly fall under the cheapy category.  I have to hold the ferrule with the handle when I&#x27;m using this brush so that it won&#x27;t move, so you can imagine how annoying that is.  Second, a few of the hairs on the brush are longer than others.  Yeah, so I&#x27;m not really happy with this purchase and probably won&#x27;t purchase another Sigma brush again.</li>
            <li> Heard many good things about this brush. They were right. It is a little hard to clean but well worth it. Love this brush! Hope to have it for a long time, will be buying more from Sigma and Amazon</li>
            <li> I have had this brush for a month now. This brush is amazing. It beautifully blends your foundation into your skib to get an airbrushed look and feel! It also covers acne too just depending on what foundation you use. Now for the people who are saying it is fake you can go on the sigma website and see the authorized sellers on amazon if they are not authorized sellers.. There is a chance your brush might be fake. Here are the authorized sellers posted on the sigma website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AVEYOU Beauty Boutique&lt;br /&gt;b-glowing&lt;br /&gt;etailz&lt;br /&gt;Fresh Botanica&lt;br /&gt;Instyle Products&lt;br /&gt;NetRush&lt;br /&gt;NutraGroup, Inc.&lt;br /&gt;PNN Logistics</li>
            <li> applys liquid foundation well and i also use it to blend harsh blush edges. great product!!</li>
            <li> love this brush! Great coverage</li>
            <li> I have used many makeup brushes throughout the years and this has to be the best foundation brush I have ever tried! You can put your foundation on all over your face in a matter of minutes. It will be blended perfectly. The brush bristles are very dense all the more reason that your foundation goes on very well and there&#x27;s very little waste. When you wash this brush it will take a little longer to dry then a typical makeup brush. However, the next day I turned on my blow dryer on low and it finished drying it quickly. I highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> I like the brush. It&#x27;s very soft and seems very durable</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful, top quality brush. Soft, tightly packed bristles. Great for pressing foundation/powder.</li>
            <li> I love my kabuki brush....use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying a new one because I love it so much. I&#x27;m just terrible at taking care of my brushes. This never sheds. I use this for my foundation and it works really nicely. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Loveeeeeeee this brush. I used to use a MAC stippling brush but saw so many reviews on youtube about Sigma and I had to get this brush. The flat top makes all the difference when blending liquid foundation and I feel like there is so much coverage and the brush doesnt absorb all the product. This is my # 1 go to besides the beauty blender but def a must have!</li>
            <li> Good quality, look, and price! I would recommend! Almost like a mac, but cheaper. Will buy more brushes! &#x3D;) &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I use this brush to apply my BB cream and it works so well. I never used a brush until this one was recommended to me. I decided to give it shot and I&#x27;m glad I did. It picks up the BB cream and then releases onto my face perfectly when I dab it on. Love it!!</li>
            <li> i love sigma brushes but i hadnt tried the sigmax ones yet and since it was cheaper here i order this one to try and i love it its now my go to face brush.</li>
            <li> I always use Real Techniques&#x27; stipple brush. However I&#x27;ve been seeing a lot of great reviews on this brush (namely from Jaclyn Hill (youtube)) and decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m glad I did! This brush gives you an &amp;#34;air-brush&amp;#34; effect with your makeup and the end result is even coverage and a flawless canvas. While I still love Real techniques&#x27; stipple brush-the Sigma F80 is the winner for sure.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this brush for liquid foundation application. I use it in a stippling motion. NO STREAKS AT ALL. It truly leaves as airbrushed finish. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments about having &amp;#34;flawless skin.&amp;#34; I do think that it soaks up a lot of product (good for me as a noob since i probably over apply). This brush is really hard to completely clean back to it&#x27;s original while color. I use a mixture between Bare Minerals Brush Shampoo &amp; the BeautyBlender Liquid Cleanser.</li>
            <li> … I haven&#x27;t found one thing wrong with this brush! The bristles stay in and it really blends amazingly! Buy this!</li>
            <li> I love this brush, it works really well with creamy/ liquid foundations. However, I did noticed that your skin needs to be really clean and exfoliated or it might make your pores larger.. Not sure why that happens but I noticed it. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I bought this brush about one month ago.  It drops the hair since the first time I used it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only washed it for 3 times, when it is wet, you can even easily push or pull the hair in or out from the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed. Hopefully I can send it back and get my refund!!</li>
            <li> Love this brush. Easy to apply foundation with. Gives a flawless look. Used it to apply my cousins makeup for her wedding.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why people are so crazy about this one. Yes, it is good for applying foundation, but not the best brush, especially given it&#x27;s price. The bristles are dense, and I haven&#x27;t experienced much shedding, but the brush isn&#x27;t very sturdy, and some bristles stick up much more than others. Ferule is not attached to the handle securely- the parts move, and I&#x27;m wondering if this construction is going to fall apart at some point. Now I expect this from $3 elf brushes, but Sigma isn&#x27;t exactly that cheap.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s on okay brush, but not amazing.</li>
            <li> Awesome!!! I love these brushes. The quality is excellent. The best brushes i have ever used. I will not buy anyother brush.</li>
            <li> I had been wanting to try this product for a long time so I finally ordered it! At first I loved it then I noticed it sheds constantly. Every time I use this to apply my foundation, the brush hairs come out and stick to my face. I am going to invest in a better foundation brush.</li>
            <li> Unlike other brushes, this brush gives full coverage. I use it to apply foundation it doesn&#x27;t streak once you brush it unto the face. I love this brush</li>
            <li> this brush does a great job blending coverage makeup.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this brush it&#x27;s so soft and makes my foundation glide on so easily! Definitely worth the price! :)</li>
            <li> I love this brush works great with an even coverage. Now I have less break outs because it don&#x27;t put my make up on with my fingers anymore.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. It is soft and gently spreads foundation evenly and smoothly for a beautiful finish. I plan to buy more of the Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> this works so well for my foundation. looks like i am air brushed to perfection. Thumbs UP for this product</li>
            <li> I really love this foundation brush.  I have seen some make up artists recommend it, and finally decided to pick it up and I agree with them.  Absolutely wonderful.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best foundation brush I have ever used. Sigma rivals MAC in all aspects, they are great.</li>
            <li> Bought this brush. When I received I realized it was fake. Made in china label when sigma brushes are made in the USA. Only purchase from SIGMABEAUTY.</li>
            <li> my favorite brush. this brush was recommended by everyone on youtube. i&#x27;m glad i purchased it. my base gets evenly distributed with this. it doesn&#x27;t leave streaks. it also doesn&#x27;t soak up my base. washed very nicely too</li>
            <li> good tool.&lt;br /&gt;very useful&lt;br /&gt;looks like the same in the web site in the amazon.com&lt;br /&gt;thank you very much Sigma F80 - Flat Kabuki TM</li>
            <li> This is a good quality brush and you won&#x27;t regret purchasing it.  There is no shedding, so that speaks volumes.&lt;br /&gt;I just am not a fan of the finish you get using brushes for foundation, but that&#x27;s my personal preference.  If you are looking&lt;br /&gt;for quality, you&#x27;ll be very happy with this I believe.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush! It took me a few times to get the technique down and how much pressure to apply but I love the smooth coverage. After use, the brush never feels dried up from the product, it keeps it&#x27;s softness.&lt;br /&gt;However, if you have ACNE, apply concealer over the blemishes with a foundation sponge BEFORE foundation when using this brush. A sponge, in my opinion, covers acne a lot better and smoother. Then to finish out your airbrushed finish, apply foundation with the brush.</li>
            <li> Great brush good coverage</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter for her birthday and she loves it!!</li>
            <li> I love this brush! I use it to apply a creamy-liquid foundation (CC cream), and a solid cream/stick and it spreads them perfectly, like an airbrush finish. I use far less of the product with this brush than if I used a sponge or a fingertip.  Over time, you will pay for the brush in the money you save on foundation.  Please note, I also tested it with a water-based liquid foundation and it didn&#x27;t work as well.&lt;br /&gt;Happy. ~Mrs H</li>
            <li> saves my life for when i&#x27;m running late, the weight of the handle is beautiful, seriously, if you&#x27;re going to splurge on a makeup brush, try this one</li>
            <li> After the fourth time I washed this brush a significant amount of bristles began falling out. I like other sigma brushes I own but I was very disappointed in this brush. The bristle began to push down and honestly it became unusable after approximately 8 washes.</li>
            <li> Love it so much. The best thing I ever did to my makeup routine is adding this tool in my life. I would inshallah continue buying it because it is what I&#x27;ve been looking for to have an air-brushed kind of finishing for my foundation.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because I have found that the sigma F80 Flat Kabuki brush has worked fantastic for me. I watched many sigma review videos on youtube before purchasing this brush and the reviews have been true to fact. This brush blends like magic, my foundation has never before blended so smoothly, I am so glad I finally made this purchase and I will continue to purchase Sigma brushes in the future.</li>
            <li> Use it regularly for my mineral powder foundation. Worked well with liquid foundations as well. Very smooth and even application. The only flaw is the handle, the metal part is starting to twist on the handle and feels a little loose. I also think the black coating might chip soon because of the washing.</li>
            <li> According to my wife, excellent product!</li>
            <li> This brush is perfect for applying my foundation. I had a few bristles come out the first time I used it, but after a cleaning it was great. So perfect!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this brush! It blends perfectly and doesn&#x27;t absorb the make up like other brushes. I can&#x27;t believe it took me this long to own one of these!</li>
            <li> Great brush for liquids like BB Creams.</li>
            <li> Sigma is my favorite brush brand.however this brush after one use began to fall apart&lt;br /&gt;will not be buying again! It&#x27;s not worth the cost for the quality</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M SO IMPRESSED!!!!!! Seriously, you can FEEL the difference this brush makes!!!!  All my other brushes are from MAC, but this one outshines all of them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sigma is my new fav!</li>
            <li> This was definitely an authentic Sigma brush. After reading some reviews I was hesitant to purchase on Amazon. However, if you go to sigmabeauty.com, you can see a list of all Authorized Retailers. Instyle Products IS on that list. (That is who I purchased from.) This brush is super dense. It&#x27;s great for liquid and cream foundations, but I personally use it for mineral foundation. It offers a little more coverage than the domed kabuki brushes that are typically recommended. Also, there has been no shedding, and there has been no issue with the brush coming apart in anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Just a tip: Clicking on the listing for this brush, I noticed the seller changed in the listing. Be sure to look under &amp;#34;In Stock&amp;#34; and see who the brush is sold by. Verify that it is on the list from Sigma&#x27;s website. I&#x27;ve seen different sellers named each time I click the listing. I&#x27;m sure some customers are being sold counterfeit merchandise, without realizing who is fulfilling the order.</li>
            <li> I got this product on time the seller promised.  The package was in an yellow enveloped and the brush was inside a plastic package which disappointment.  Then I looked at the brush and it is made in China so I don&#x27;t know if this item is the real thing from sigma.  I washed it before using it and it turns ok then 1st time using it ...it was fine after a week the brush looks weird so I dont think this is the real brush they sell in sigmabeauty.com&lt;br /&gt;Just sharing my experienced buying this product through amazon....</li>
            <li> Love !!!! Helps Blend sooo good !!!</li>
            <li> After watching many you tube videos of this, I decided to purchase. VERY happy with it. Works well and doesnt shed at all! Very happy with it : )</li>
            <li> Do explain why you liked this product.its great i love it, fit as expected , they are great ok yes for me it&#x27;s the best i never used</li>
            <li> i get my items on time and it is new it is the wonderful f80 for natural foundation  look i like it very much i will repurchase it again i recommend i&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it to my friend</li>
            <li> She puts this on her face and applies makeup, that&#x27;s really all I know about makeup.  I know she uses it every day and has been for a year now, so that sounds good to me.</li>
            <li> This brush just buffed in my foundation flawless.  I also use the blank canvas cosmetics kabuki flat top brush and this Sigma one is very similar.  This works great in the same way my BCC brush does.  The only difference I saw was that this one was more dense.  But same results.  I would recommend either or.</li>
            <li> I bought this one right after I got my Shiseido 113 foundation brush. People recommend these two products very often on makeup forum and I got both of them to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feels and looks of makeup using these two brushes to apply foundation are very very similar, but the brushing area of this one is almost twice as big as Shiseido 113 - which saves you time in the morning. But the bristles of Shiseido 113 seem to be a tiny little bit more fine than SigmaF80 and since it is small it handles the nose area better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: they are both excellent products and I recommend having BOTH of them for your different needs.(You probably need two or more foundation brushes to rotate anyway if you clean the foundation brush everyday because it takes at least a day for them to completely dry)</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say that I enjoy makeup since I got this brush! Before I always struggle with my foundation but this brush will do the job. I really like it</li>
            <li> I bought this brush less than 4 months ago and it has started shedding and losing its bristles. It was the best brush in the world up until this point, loved it! This was my gateway brush to Sigma! I contacted Sigma and since I didn&#x27;t buy the brush directly from them they wouldn&#x27;t do anything for me! Luckily the Amazon store I bought it from offered me a refund, not a replacement because they don&#x27;t carry Sigma anymore (I wonder why?). I will never buy another Sigma brush again which is a bummer because they are a Minnesota company and I am loyal to my state businesses.</li>
            <li> Great product! I recived next day!!!!!!! I really&lt;br /&gt; enjoy doing my make up with this brush!!!!!!!!!!! Love sigma brushes so much!</li>
            <li> This brush is cheaper than the Sephora #56 brush which is also great for foundation... but this one is cheaper and it does the job! I am so happy with it.</li>
            <li> love this brush for putting on my makeup!</li>
            <li> I ordered the flat kabuki brush to apply foundation and I love it. For powder foundation sigma recommends the Round Kabuki which I hope is my next brush.  The Flat kabuki works well for powder foundation as well but works best with liquid make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought my Kabuki from the seller NetRush. They brush came slightly damaged but still worked well they offered to replace it or give me a partial refund if I preferred to keep my brush. They emailed me back with in a few hours if me contacting them about my brush. I am very happy with their service overall as well as my new make up brush.</li>
            <li> I have never been big on using brushes for foundation. I just thought I was incapable of using them or something, despite multiple attempts with high-end brushes. But after hearing rave reviews from multiple Youtubers, I decided to buy it. I LOVE it! It gives my foundation a flawless finish. Now when I do my makeup, I feel like it isn&#x27;t complete until I use this to smooth it out. Definitely a must-have brush in my collection!</li>
            <li> I really love this foundation brush, and I&#x27;m now a convert.  I am going to use this vertical style foundation brush instead of a flat, wide brush-- stippling instead of painting.  However, I&#x27;ve had this Sigma brush 8 months, and the hairs are starting to fall out.  It&#x27;s too bad bc I think Sigma is good quality.  But now, every time I try to apply foundation, I end up with a bunch of short hairs stuck to my wet face.  I&#x27;m trying to decide whether to repurchase or try a different brand.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality brush to apply liquid founation! It covers the areas I want it to and everything goes on so much smoother!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it took me this long to find this brush. Sigma knows how to make their burshes. It applies the foundation with a flawless look and puts most the foundation on your face instead of leaving half of your product on the brush. I am looking forward to replace most of my Mac brushed with Sigmas!!!</li>
            <li> I think this brush is a fake and I was scammed.  I have read so many reviews of sigma brushes, and everyone raves about the high quality and lasting power of this brush.  I bought this brush in May, and now, 3 months later the bristles have fallen out and the entire brush is basically garbage and can&#x27;t be returned.  This seller and Amazon should be ashamed.  When purchasing a product from a reputable site like amazon, I would expect they hold their sellers to a higher standard.</li>
            <li> My friend has a more expensive brush from Mac that does the same thing as this one for a lot less!!</li>
            <li> I have watched a lot of You-tube tutorials demonstrating the correct way to use the Kabuki brush.  It is exactly as described.  The brush head is so so soft.  The foundation goes on so smoothly and easily.  I will have to try other Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> this distributes product very evenly...great for foundation coverage...I would purchase more sigma brushes&lt;br /&gt;The bristles do not fall out either</li>
            <li> Hello All,&lt;br /&gt;I have been reading good and bad reviews on this brush. For those who said the brush fall apart after a while, I suggest you go to the sigmabeauty.com website to purchase the authentic brushes. You have to realize that products on Amazon are always being sold by the actual manufacturer even though it says so. I bought some MAC brushes that read (\\&quot;Sold by M.A.C.) but when I got the brushes they were not authentic. I know things on Amazon are cheaper but there is a reason why. AI understand that the products may cost more in the stores, but at least you get a better guarantee. The brushes I bought from \\&quot;So-Called M.A.C\\&quot; on this website broke off at the handle before I even used it. Therefore, try to buy this Sigma brush on the Sigma website. Also it is $2.00 cheaper on the website, so try the Sigma website. At least on their website your purchase is guaranteed with money back if you are not satisfied with your purchase. I hope this helps!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this brush anymore.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This is a great brush that give smooth finish. I like using it with liquid foundation and to smooth out my  concealer. This one is a must have brush for any collection</li>
            <li> I had used the Mac version of this brush while playing with a friends brushes,and decided to go with sigma instead due to reviews and how much I had heard about them,and I&#x27;m happy I did! I love this brush for applying foundation.It always goes on flawless and even.i am definitely considering buying the premium brush set for work!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best brushes I have used, not only is it soft but it blends and applies smoothly and airbrushed. I use this for applying my dior foundation and it is amazing.</li>
            <li> This brush puts foundation and coin esker on so smoothly! The brush is so dense and soft. I&#x27;ve also noticed that the time putting my foundation on in the morning is much less. This is a wonderful brush and I recommend it to anybody interested in buying it.</li>
            <li> The application is flawless, they texture is dense and super soft. relatively easy to clean and exactly what I was looking for. Unlike traditional tapered foundation brushes this kabuki style leaves no streaks at all. My clients look flawless and airbrushed because the f80 really blends the foundation into the skin. I would and do highly recommend this brush to all buyers looking for flawless foundation application! Hope this helps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*tip: use circular motions when applying foundation using this brush :)</li>
            <li> Must have for your bush kit. I like better than beauty blender. I use it everyday</li>
            <li> I love this product!! It applies my makeup so easily and evenly across my face. It leaves my face looking airbrushed!</li>
            <li> Makeup goes on smooth and even. I love,this brush and would buy it again. Recommend it to anyone looking for great brush</li>
            <li> perfect brush to apply BB Cream, no bristles on face ever.</li>
            <li> Great brush, I love it!</li>
            <li> Loooove this brush! Perfect for foundation. Best I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> I enjoy following make-up bloggers and Sigma brushes kept coming up time and time again.  I&#x27;ve lost count of how many I&#x27;ve purchased this year. This is my favorite.  I use with my GA Luminous Silk foundation and like way better than the GA brush (more than twice the cost) that GA recommends you use.</li>
            <li> Everything was fine and on time</li>
            <li> So disappointed. I&#x27;ve had this brush a year and a half (ordered May 2014). It ways felt a little lose, but I washed it today and as I was drying it, the bristles just came out. So sad!!!</li>
            <li> Quality is not what it used to be. Traditional Kabuki F80 had tightly bound bristles for flawless finish. The last 2 I purchased are airy so makeup doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly. Either this is a fake or SIGMA needs to fire their quality control manager. Hope SIGMA gets it together. Used to be a great product</li>
            <li> Amaze-balls!!!  Using this brush instead of my fingers for application, I have reduced my acne to little to none.. Love, love, love it!!</li>
            <li> Foundation will be more easy to apply and evenly distribute, I love this brush.</li>
            <li> One of my most favorite brushes to use when applying liquid foundation</li>
            <li> I just received this brush today. I haven&#x27;t used it yet but I can tell it is very high quality and is soooo soft. I am soooo glad I found this brush and didnt drop 30 or more on a sephora or mac brush because this sigma brush is just as good.</li>
            <li> I was researching a great brush for some time.. I watched many videos on You Tube and came to conclusion that I need this brush!&lt;br /&gt;Glad I bought it.. I had a big big event coming up and it game me flawless airbrush quality coverage... Great brush, watch tutorials on how to use properly... and you will get great results. (You can look on you tube)</li>
            <li> When I first opened the cute red pouch/bag/thing that it came in, I was completely taken aback by how soft and dense this brush is. WOW. I couldn&#x27;t stop feeling the brush with my hands (before the initial wash). It definitely takes 24 hours-ish to dry because of the density of the brush, but I&#x27;ll take it! Excellent brush, just ordered the whole kit that includes the round kabuki, this flat top kabuki and angled kabuki.</li>
            <li> Love this brush! Authentic.</li>
            <li> I love love love this brush! The Sigma F80 applies liquid foundation flawlessly! I would defiantly recommend this product! Not only is it completely awesome, but I got it super fast! THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a bit wary and skeptical of face/foundation brushes, due to the fact I&#x27;ve had little luck with them when it comes to achieving as flawless an application as something like a dampened sponge applicator or beauty wedge. This is primarily because I suffer from severely sensitive, dry, dehydrated skin, and eczema, which is easily irritated by most all makeup brushes. Additionally, most makeup brushes, no matter how soft, tend to cause too much flaking and exfoliation on my skin, so buffing in any sort of foundation with any brush is typically out of the question. The Sigma F80, however, is phenomenal at getting you as close to an airbrushed perfect application, without any streaking, flaking, or patchiness that I&#x27;ve had with any other foundation brushes. Whether using liquid or mineral foundation, this brush provides the perfect finish and doesn&#x27;t irritate or flake my skin. I recommend it to anyone and everyone, as the only thing better that I&#x27;ve found is actual airbrushing!</li>
            <li> In short, this is a wonderful product! I consider myself to be somewhat of a cosmetic savant, so I find myself taking extra precaution when searching for the perfect tools. Perfect for either liquid or powder foundation, this brush is magic (remember, application is key!). I&#x27;m so happy I waited! This brush will not disappoint!!</li>
            <li> This is a must have brush! It is super dense yet so soft to the touch. It applies powder, liquid, mineral, and cream foundations beautifully! This brush has made all of the difference in how my foundation looks. The shipping was so fast too! It got to me in 3 days. Thanks Sigma!</li>
            <li> I received my sigma brush today in the mail, and not only was it fast shipping, it was packaged very well. I have been waiting to buy this item for a very long time and I could not say enough good things about this product. It is so soft and gives the perfect airbrushed look. I am so happy with this item, and cannot wait to purchase more from Sigma!</li>
            <li> I can honestly say this brush is PERFECT for liquid foundation. love it!!&lt;br /&gt;i am very impressed with this and all Sigma Brushes.</li>
            <li> I JUST RECIEVED MY BRUSH AND I LOVE IT; LADIES IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR AN INXSPENVIE BRUSH SET THAT WORKS AS WELL AS MAC BRUSHES THEN SIGMA IS THE WAY TO GO YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED.</li>
            <li> I got it in the mail today...very fast shipping indeed. Couldn&#x27;t wait to try it and so I did right away! The brush is dense enough so that stippling is a breeze, so much better than the Mac stippling brush which is very soft for that purpose. And as it is a kabuki, it is also perfect for buffing. I&#x27;ve never applied foundation as flawlessly as I did just now with this brush and I am by no means a professional makeup artist! I purchased the Sigma 15-piece set not too long ago and was very happy with it, getting this brush too just made my brush collection complete.  Oh, but I intend to get the travel set next time, :-).</li>
            <li> I just received my Sigma F80 Flat Top Kabuki brush in the mail.  This was my first Sigma brush purchase, this brush is comparable to any MAC brush and a much better value!  Sigma brushes have become my new go to.  I&#x27;ve been using this brush to apply liquid foundation or tinted moisturizer and it provides an airbrushed look.  It distributes the makeup evenly and really helps it to blend into your face perfectly.  This brush will make any foundation look like it was created just for you, which isn&#x27;t that what we&#x27;re all looking for.  I highly recommend purchasing this brush.</li>
            <li> I just got the Sigma F80 brush and I am so surprised because it came in five days! It was suppose to come about five days later, so the shipping was great. The brush itself is SO SOFT!! the softest brush I&#x27;ve ever seen! I will be purchasing brushes from Sigma next time I want a brush. :))</li>
            <li> This brush is totally worth the $16 that I paid for it. It is extremely high quality and is sooooo soft! Like others have said, it applies your liquid and powder products so well and gives your makeup an airbrushed finish. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> As most of you I have seen EVERYBODY and their mother raving about this brush. Before receiving this brush I used a flat top powder brush from e.l.f. to do my foundation and was perfectly happy but the ferrel was getting loose and the bristles weren&#x27;t as soft as when I first bought them. So, I decided I needed a new brush I figured instead of buying another three dollar brush that would break down in another couple of months, I should definitely get this brush. I decided to order through amazon because I had recently credited a gift card to my account and I figured I&#x27;d order for a cheaper price using my ten dollar gift card.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My package arrived sooner than my estimated shipping date and I live in Puerto Rico so that&#x27;s a lot to say. It arrived in a small white box with sigma tape on it. Inside it had a red bag with the brush, brush guard, and pamphlet. As soon as I tried this brush out I got so mad at myself for not trying this brush before. It is way better then my elf flat top brush and leaves my face looking flawless when I use it with liquid foundation. It&#x27;s almost impossible to mess up your foundation when using this brush. I also have found that I use less product with this brush, this is probably due to the fact that the brush is made with the synthetic Sigmax fibers and is extremely dense. I can&#x27;t say enough about this brush it&#x27;s amazing and for anyone who wears foundation I believe it&#x27;s a must have. It will change your life. I tried hard to think about what are the cons of the brush and the only one I could think of is the drying time. I don&#x27;t think that can really be considered a con since ALL synthetic fiber brushes take long to dry so it was expected. The good thing is Simone the owner of SIgma tweeted a photo of this brush saying it had dried in four hours using some kind of drying product she was developing. Let&#x27;s cross our fingers and hope it&#x27;s true because I swear that it will make us gern-o-phobes excited to see our brushes will be drying  a lot faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall Recommendation: Buy this Brush!!!aster.     Overall Recommendation: Buy this Brush!!!</li>
            <li> So first time I discover this brush was watching a few tutorials on You Tube. So I decided to give it a try and order it, just watching these girls put on their foundation it will give them this flawless look to their skin!! AMAZING! When I recieved this brush I was so excited to try it so decided to wash my make up off that I had and right away I loovee how my skin felt so clean like if I didn&#x27;t have any make up on. I really recommend this brush to anyone, specially if your looking for that airbrush look this brush will do it for you! now is time to order the rest of the brushes : )</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t want to do makeup with out this brush!&lt;br /&gt;I use it to apply my foundation and it works better than any brush I&#x27;ve owned (expensive or cheap)&lt;br /&gt;The bristles don&#x27;t fall out and it picks up the right amount of product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is REALLY dense though! so when you clean it, it will take a day or two to dry before you can use it again</li>
            <li> Softest best blending brush EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you want a flawless face, but THIS brush. Very nice. Not alot of shedding.</li>
            <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently purchased sigma kabuki brush #F80, F82 &amp; F84 - and so excited to make a this comment for these brushes, that are so amazing brushes i&#x27; am very surprised about the quality of these brushes in a very reasonable price &amp; yet its so smooth in the skin while applying it plus NO shredding.  I highly recommend these brushes and its a must have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And thank as well for the fast shipment &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I am so excited to use this brush.  After researching so many others I was impressed by the comments left by other customers!!  My brush arrived today and I am looking forward to playing with my make up tonight!!!</li>
            <li> i love  sigmaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!Minha encomomenda chegou  bem antes do  previsto!O flap  top  e o melhor pincel pra passar  minha base,mkinha pele fica  perfeita!!!!![[ASIN:B003UH0528 Sigma Beauty Flat Top Synthetic Kabuki - F80]]</li>
            <li> I learned about this brush online from a YouTube video by Ms Beauty B*tch (substituted the \\&quot;i\\&quot; with a \\&quot;*\\&quot;) whereby she demos the Urban Decay Surreal Cream to Powder foundation. She rec&#x27;d either a MAC stipple brush (which I already have) or this brush, the Sigma F80.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I travel often and need to use a foundation to protect my skin from the southwestern sun, I chose to go with the Sigma F80 because the brush is denser than the MAC stipple brush and because I wanted a more medium coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This F80 brush is perfect and so soft! Softer than my other synthetic brushes and perfect for using a cream based foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend especially with the UD Surreal Skin foundation!</li>
            <li> The product came very well packed. This shows how the Sigma is concerned with their customers satisfaction. The packaging is beautiful and the brush is very well protected. Also,the quality of this brush is unique, I haven&#x27;t found any other brush like this is! I highly recommend Sigma for everyone! :)</li>
            <li> I Love love love this brush! This islands down the best foundation brush on earth, you really can&#x27;t find a better one!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS BRUSH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I looked at this brush for months before getting it because it is more than I usually spend on brushes, but it is sooooooo worth it! I usually apply foundation with a sponge but was thinking about trying something different. When I became pregnant my face broke out so bad! I also had to start using a different makeup because I was using Clinique acne solutions which has salicitic acid, and you can&#x27;t use that when pregnant. So after trying a few I finally tried MAC studio fix which works great and I needed something with full coverage...so back to the brush, when I use a sponge with this foundation it looks ok, but when I use the Sigma brush with my foundation I get a fuller coverage and the finish is so nice! It looks smooth and more professional. I also use it to put a little concealer on after when I have a particular break out. I just make sure to wash the brush every week or two to keep it nice and clean and in good condition. I am rambling because I really love this brush.</li>
            <li> I have to report the brush I received from NG Inc through Amazon as fake.  The brush they sent was made in China.  I have emailed Sigma to verify their brushes are indeed made in the US.  I thought NG Inc stood for NutraGroup Inc, an approved Amazon Sigma reseller, but apparently it does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew immediately the brush was not authentic when feeling the denseness of the bristles...nothing like the F82 I ordered directly from Sigma.  The bristles are of low quality, with shiney, plasticky black strands.  My F82 has browner, and much softer bristles...more like fine animal hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I hear from Sigma that their brushes are made in China, and NG is an authorized reseller, I&#x27;ll edit this post.  As of now, I&#x27;m returning the brush.  The quality is not what my expectations are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Careful who you order from.</li>
            <li> Extremely fast shipping! I just love this brush, I can see why everyone is freaking out about it! It distributes foundation so evenly! I&#x27;m definitely going to be buying more Sigma brushes!!</li>
            <li> Brush was bent, returned to amazon. Not satisfied with my purchase, had to again before getting refund for damaged brush!</li>
            <li> I dig this brush! It does put foundation on super even and smooth!&lt;br /&gt;4 stars because no clue how it will last</li>
            <li> This brush applies foundation very well and it hasn&#x27;t shed at all. I will be buying two more for my sisters.</li>
            <li> My daughter is very happy with this product. It does a wonderful job. Works as explained and is very good quality.</li>
            <li> I use it every day. Very soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> but when I open package the brush was bent im really not happy whit that not for a 21.00 makeup brush ..</li>
            <li> this brush works beautifully for creamy liquid foundation or hightlighting cream sticks. the brush hasnt broken off on my skin at ALL and i&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months now and it&#x27;s still in the same condition it arrived</li>
            <li> I 100% love this brush!!!! It&#x27;s so soft and it doesn&#x27;t use a lot of foundation. This is a must buy.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this brush out because of its rave reviews.  I used it as soon as it arrived and couldn&#x27;t believe how well it worked.  This brush is SO soft, so dense and it doesn&#x27;t shed.  It blends everything so seamlessly that it looks as if I don&#x27;t have foundation on.</li>
            <li> I just had to have another Sigma F80!! There is No other brush of its kind! That is all!!</li>
            <li> Amazing brush it covers all the flaws but I wish if it could be lil bigger but it&#x27;s the best ever</li>
            <li> Best foundation brush ever !!&lt;br /&gt;Easy to blend better than other sigma brushes its just easy to use</li>
            <li> The Sigma Beauty Flat Kabuki (F80) brush is pretty much awesome.  I have seen many youtube makeup gurus rave about this brush so I had to try it out for myself.  I use it with liquid foundation and it buffs on the skin with almost an airbrush finish.  I start out by putting the foundation on the brush then patting it on the areas that need more coverage then I begin buffing all over my face.  When I am done buffing I will go back over any areas that need a little extra attention.  I have been using this brush for awhile and have not had any of the brush hairs fall out.  That is a pet peeve of mine to be applying foundation and have little brush hairs attached to my face.  It is a little pricey but well worth it for the affect you get with your makeup application.</li>
            <li> I purchased the brush to blend in my liquid foundation from Clinique. Overall, the brush blends well. It&#x27;s smooth and the brush tip is flexible. I&#x27;m not a makeup guru but the final finish was amazing compared to the foundation brush from Clinique. I&#x27;d highly recommend purchasing the brush and the quality is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I think I was sold a fake. Bristle fell apart after two months even with proper care and maintanence. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> This brush feels amazing. There are many people who have received fakes, but not from this company. This is straight from Sigma. You can go on their website and look at the authorized dealers. So far so good, pleased with my purchase. :}</li>
            <li> Blends liquid foundation like magic! Bristles are so soft.</li>
            <li> Been using this brush for my liquid foundation since I received it. It gives a smooth application and very easy to blend. I&#x27;ve cleaned this brush 2-3 times already and haven&#x27;t notice any shedding. It still maintain its shape even after washing it. I really like this and will be purchasing another one in the future.</li>
            <li> This is the best liquid foundation make up brush! No streaks. It doesn&#x27;t hold product. Easy to clean. Great buy!!</li>
            <li> Love this brush for putting on my foundation. The bristles are soft yet dense enough to really blend in the foundation flawlessly. Would highly recommend!! LOVE THIS BRUSH!!</li>
            <li> As expected, I LOVE the Sigma F80. I finally broke down and got this brush. I&#x27;d been hearing SO MUCH about it and it is SO NICE. Such high quality brush. Girls, don&#x27;t buy cheap cheap brushes. You get what you pay for and the flat top makes it so easy to apply foundation. I&#x27;m super happy with it, and expect it to last a very long time. It feels so nice on the skin, so smooth, and the makeup goes on very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see on the photos, I first put a dab or three of my foundation on my hand and then swirl my brush in small circles and apply in circular motion to my face. I do that several times and I can&#x27;t tell you how smoothly and beautifully it goes on. This brush has changed the way I look and feel about my foundation application. I hope this helps. Enjoy and be beautiful, with or without your makeup. :)</li>
            <li> this is easy to use！like it！</li>
            <li> Nice brush for foundation, although it is a little large for small faces. Would like if the surface area of the brush were a little smaller.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of purchasing a makeup brush set from amazon that had good description and reviews at a great price. Unfortunately the set was utter garbage and fell apart almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After doing extensive research and watching Youtube  recommends from beauty expert Lisa Eldridge, I bought this Sigma brush, along with [[ASIN:B004Q1GCFG Sigma Beauty Basic Eyes Kit - 7 ct]] and [[ASIN:B005WLVC5O EcoTools Touch Up Set]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sigma Flat Kabuki is of excellent quality and arrived exactly as the image and description indicates. Using this brush to apply liquid foundation is a dream and my skin looks easy-breezy and flawless. The combined sets I purchased perfectly round out my brush collection and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased! Five Stars!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased a makeup brush as I do not normally wear foundation. However, I have an upcoming wedding and wanted to try it out. It makes the foundation look flawless!</li>
            <li> Love the way it feels! Beautiful finish!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for a little less than a year, and it&#x27;s now garbage. It is an amazing brush when you first start using it. I never had a brush that felt softer than this one, but it sheds uncontrollably. I washed this brush every 1-2 weeks and it has shed so much to the point where it&#x27;s so thin, its not usable anymore. I&#x27;m a little disappointed because it was such an expensive brush and everyone told me to invest in it and that I won&#x27;t regret it, but I do regret it because it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Great brush, and received only 3 days  after placing order.</li>
            <li> Love this brush! The application from it is flawless</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> The Sigma F80-Flat Kabuki Brush is as amazing as the reviews suggest.  It has become my go to brush for foundation application.  It is dense and soft--giving a smooth, even, flawless application.  No shedding.  Very pleased with this purchase.  Glad I can order Sigma brushes from a reliable seller, Etailz, through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I really like it. Good brush with good value.</li>
            <li> Love this brush. I have always used a small kabuki brush and I love the long handle. Makes for much easier application!</li>
            <li> I dont really use makeup but when I do I use this!&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is that after a while it got kinda wobbly, but it applies the make up great</li>
            <li> It is great for buffing. So after I use the Sigma F60 i buff it out to have a smooth flawless HD finish!.</li>
            <li> came highly recommended from multiple makeup artists and beauty bloggers! Absolutely love it!!! I want the whole sigma brush set</li>
            <li> Excellent synthetic bristle Sigma kabuki foundation brush makes applying foundation a piece of cake.  Application is smooth and uniform - worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I was Incredibly excited to finally purchase my Sigma F80 brush! I have read amazing reviews and couldn&#x27;t wait to own it! However, I am highly upset at the way my brush arrived. There was a dent on the metal portion surrounding the brush!! I would normally not be as upset but I almost paid $30 with shipping price for this brush.</li>
            <li> Love this brush and got it cheaper than it was on the Sigma website!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope I can get more of these for a steal of a deal!</li>
            <li> Puts on foundation flawlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative comment I have is that you cannot get into smaller areas of your face with it, but no biggie for me. I use a smaller brush to get around my eyes &amp; nose &amp; spot treatment my face.</li>
            <li> I had heard about Sigma brushes on Youtube, but had never seen them in person.  I decided to take a chance, and was not disappointed.  These are great brushes at a very reasonable price.  I&#x27;ve had no shedding with any of my Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> The metal part of the metal part of the brush attached to the handle part of the brush arrived slightly lose :(  I did not return it simply because I LOVE this brush and I was too impatient to wait for the arrival of another one.</li>
            <li> I had been wanting to try Sigma brushes for a while, so I figured that this one was affordable, especially since I use my stippling brush the most. I typically use ELF studio line brushes which are extremely affordable but also durable and useful. I found the shape of this brush to be a tad bit odd but I&#x27;ve been using it the past few days anyhow. It just doesn&#x27;t live up to all the hype. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;d be a decent brush for $6 but not ~$20+. Next time I want to try a more &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; makeup brush I guess I&#x27;ll pick something else.</li>
            <li> Brush arrived fast and was just as expected. I love it!</li>
            <li> BEST BRUSH EVER!!!! MUST HAVE FOR ANYONE WHO WEARS FOUNDATIONI!! :-)</li>
            <li> This is my favorite foundation brush. Absolutely cannot live without. It blends out my foundation so flawlessly. Gives me a full coverage but without looking cakey. It&#x27;s my number one sigma brush.</li>
            <li> This my absolute favorite foundation brush I own! Nothing comes close to this brush. My foundation application is flawless. No streaks left whatsoever. No more cake face for all of you that have those problems. I own many Sigma brushes and they are all great quality.</li>
            <li> I love it. Applies my make-up on effortlessly, flawlessly and doesn&#x27;t waste any product.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because there are more good things than bad things to say about this brush. It is my absolute favorite brush for applying liquid foundations! The synthetic hairs in this brush are extremely packed, dense, soft, and full which are all great things about this brush. It also works like a dream, it gives a flawless application. My favorite thing about this brush is that it save lots of product! A little goes a long way which is great considering the price is not my absolute favorite. The only con about this brush is that the hairs do stick out a little which do bother me...and the delivery took forever PLUS the packaging was horrible! If my brush would have been delivered to me damaged this rating would not have a full five stars :( but overall great brush and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> It sucks up a lot of foundation. I prefer my MAC brushes instead. The Stigma brush requires about 3 pumps of foundation and my MAC brush only with a pump or a pump and a half is more than enough to give me full coverage</li>
            <li> hard to tell by the picture, but this brush is super soft and the perfect size for foundations.  Definitely a must have for anyone who enjoys the art of makeup and looking your best.  I am now looking at other brushes from sigma.  good choice!</li>
            <li> I like this brush because it is very soft!</li>
            <li> I use this to put on any liquid foundation. Works pretty well.</li>
            <li> This brush is wonderful and applies my foundation perfectly.  I think this will replace my beauty blender for my go-to tool.  Also...some people on here are claiming this brush is fake when it is NOT.  [...]&lt;br /&gt;It clearly states on Sigma&#x27;s website that Etailz is an authorized retailer on Amazon.</li>
            <li> High quality brush bought it as a backup for the one on the full kit for my makeup artist friend and she says that it is worth the price</li>
            <li> Hands down best foundation brush for your money!</li>
            <li> How was able to leave with it!!!! Love it...all this years I couldn&#x27;t wear liquid foundation, I thought I suck at applying it no matter how many YouTube videos I watched and the sephora airbrush effect foundation application brushes I got, I didn&#x27;t have the right tools... but the sigma f80 solved every thing... worth my money, give it a try u won&#x27;t regret it ( I mean is really not expensive at all)</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this brush. I&#x27;ve had this brush since March 2014. It gives me a flawless look, no shedding whatsoever and the the handle do not fall off (I seen alot of reviews that said it brakes.&amp;#34;) I believe it&#x27;s how you clean your brushes. Why put water on the handle anyways?Get this brush if you don&#x27;t have it in your make-up bag. :)</li>
            <li> I have several Sigma brushes that have lasted for a couple of years after many washings. I first loved this brush but after the second time I washed it, the entire brush head came out.  I dry my brushes head down so water doesn&#x27;t go into the barrel. I never had this problem with brushes I ordered directly from Sigma. I don&#x27;t know if this is a fake or what, but I am very disappointed. Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> this is my first brush from sigma. i have gone back and forth on wether or not i wanted to spend that much on a brush. but, i&#x27;m sold on it. it blends effortlessly and flawlessly with liquid, creme and mineral foundations. i will be trying more sigma brushes in the future.</li>
            <li> At first, I was weary of buying this product because I didn&#x27;t know if it was authentic. I did my research and found on Sigma&#x27;s website that FRESH BOTANICA is an authorized seller. I also took the liberty of contacting Sigma via facebook and they assured me that the Sigma products being sold by this company are 100% authentic. I ordered the brush and I am SO glad I did! This brush has improved my makeup application by 100x. I like it better then the Beauty Blender and the Real Techniques Expert Face Brush. It&#x27;s very soft and VERY dense. It buffs out foundation to a perfect airbrush finish. I usually find that when I use other brushes, I still have to go in with something else and blend out some small lines, but not with this brush. I would recommend this brush over ANY other foundation brush on the market!</li>
            <li> I am a makeup artist and heard rave reviews on the sigma line so I had to give one a try :) I received my brush today- shipping was very fast.  I can truly say that this brush gave a nice finish with my liquid foundation application.  I look forward to puchasing more brushes in the future.  I highly recommend it! Great brush at a very affordable price.</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with the Sigma F80! It is spool soft, it applies my foundation like a dream! I was afraid to clean it the first time,  because the brushes I had before were never as soft once it was washed, but the sigma was exactly the same as when I received it!!! I am so impressed that I ordered their entire brush roll set!!! Plus I have had ZERO shedding, yay!</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my self with some christmas money. So christmas morning I opened it and went and got my foundation and it gives you complete full coverage and a perfect air brushed look trust me if you buy this product you will not be disaponted.</li>
            <li> I just received my brush today - it came earlier than expected very grateful of that. the brush is super soft and nicely constructed. I thought it would be bigger but very pleased with my purchase. will write a review after a week use. : )</li>
            <li> My first sigma brush and I absolutely love it..it is soo soft and makes application of liquid foundation soo easy.</li>
            <li> Im amazed in how this brush leaves my foundation,  it gives it such a clean buff look... I first saw reviews about it on YouTube and im glad I got it :)</li>
            <li> Brush is nice and dense and soft. I saw no difference in the application of my liquid and powder foundations.  It&#x27;s a nice brush, but now I realize it&#x27;s a bit overhyped.  Delivery was OK.  The item was not sent out immediately after I ordered it.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this brush considering all the great reviews. When I got it in the mail, I found it to be packaged very nicely, the bristles of the brush protected well. Before I used it I made sure to wash the brush and when I did so, some minor shedding occurred. The minor shedding continued when I actually used the brush for the first time. I was a bit disappointed about the shedding given the great reviews. I also found that buffing the liquid foundation on my face was not so effortless. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s my technique, the foundation I&#x27;m using, or just my brush, but I found that buffing the foundation required a bit of force.  Other than those two things, I found the brush to be incredibly soft and dense. Once I finish buffing the foundation, the coverage is very even and smooth. To ensure that my brush dries faster, after I wash it I usually spread out the bristles a little and let it air dry. Doing that, my brush dries in about 3 hours. This is my first flat top kabuki brush, so I don&#x27;t have any other similar brush to compare it to. Overall, it&#x27;s a good quality brush that should last a while if you take care of it.</li>
            <li> I use a liquid foundation and have used the same one for years, with multiple processes of application and I have found that this brush is simply the best! It&#x27;s bristles are incredibly soft and gives a wonderful airbrush finish. It&#x27;s actually better than M.A.C&#x27;s foundation brushes.</li>
            <li> This is my first Sigma brush ever. I purchased this after reading the great reviews on Amazon. I received my order today and so happy with it. It came in the prettiest packaging w/ product info cards. The brush itself is very professional looking.The bristles are very soft and feels nice on the skin. Great quality without breaking the bank. I love it!!!!</li>
            <li> Sigma F80 Flat Top Synthetic Kabuki- Brush was shipped super fast, delivered before estimated date and very well packaged. Ive been searching for a foundation brush for sometime now, since the ones Ive come across are rough that it hurt my face. After see many flawless makeup videos using Sigma brushes, I had to try it for myself. So glad I did. The bristles on this brush are super soft, holds foundation very well, application is smooth and flawless. I am truly happy with my purchase and will definitely be purchasing more Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve needed a good brush for a while and after watching several video&#x27;s on youtube.. I decided to purchase the Flat top kabuki..... After receiving my brush I was amazed at how well it worked. It&#x27;s like HEAVEN..... I&#x27;m hooked ALL SIGMA brush&#x27;s from here on out.</li>
            <li> this brush went on so smoothly whenever i used my liquid foundation!it creates a satiny finish whenever your done and looks so natural and perfect i will definetly be buying more brushes from them.</li>
            <li> This is the best foundation brush i have ever used! I use it for liquid foundation and it goes on flawlessly. I also use it for powder as well and it looks so smooth! Another thing i love about this brush is that it doesnt leave any lines on your face so you don&#x27;t have to do extra blending.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with brushes but I ordered this brush after all of the great reviews.  The bristles for this brush definitely seem sturdy and do not fall off while using.  The brush feels like a sponge.  I like it overall.</li>
            <li> After ordering the Sigma 12 piece set earlier I was so amazed by the quality I decided to order the F80 Kabuki, I can&#x27;t say enough about this brush. I have to admit I was hesitant to order this brush after my disappointment with my Sonia Kashuk Kabuki, but I am beyond thrilled with this brush and will be ordering a back up. It even blends my Nars Sheer Glow which the Sephora sales person told me does not blend well with a brush, it is so soft and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> i got the brush today, 5 days before the estimated arrival:D...this brush is amazing..so soft and works great with my liquid foundation...m glad i purchased this product!!</li>
            <li> I love this brush. It is very soft and applies make evenly. It does not shead and works great!!! I love this brush and at this price will only purchase Sigma brushes from now on.</li>
            <li> This brush is great for applying foundation, wet or dry.  It is super soft, but very dense. The brush washes very easily and dries quickly.  Great overall brush!</li>
            <li> Great brush!!&lt;br /&gt;The fibers are soooooo soft and it applies my favorite foundation very smoothly. Looking to buy more Sigma products in the near future.</li>
            <li> Pro - Quality:&lt;br /&gt;- What I expected, but it&#x27;s my first sigma brush&lt;br /&gt;- I still use it everyday&lt;br /&gt;- Dense but soft&lt;br /&gt;- 3 ring ferrule as Sigma site states&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - may be fake?:&lt;br /&gt;- Came in a plastic bag, no special packaging&lt;br /&gt;- There was a &amp;#34;CHINA&amp;#34; sticker covering the &amp;#34;USA&amp;#34; indented in the brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be buying my brushes directly from Sigma site store moving forward.</li>
            <li> I bought the Flat Top Kabuki brush and the angled blush brush and love both of them.&lt;br /&gt;In addition to excellent coverage, this greatly speeds up my ability to get ready in the morning.  I would certainly come back to Sigma when I need more makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> First off, I will say that overall, I like this brush. When I ordered it, I was shocked that Sigma sent it to me so quickly. The brush arrived less than 3 days later in the mail! The packaging was absolutely adorable. The brush came with a plastic cover in a red, silk drawstring bag. There was a pamphlet inside with information on the brush as well as other brushes in the collection. And yes, there is a card that offers a free gift for reviewing the product on Amazon (I would have posted a review anyway!). The handle of the brush is very sturdy and because its thick, you get great control during use. Sigma claims this is a dense brush and let me tell you, they are not kidding! This is the densest brush I have ever used! Its perfect for applying and blending my liquid foundation! I was impressed with the first application and I wanted to review it right away, but I knew my review would not be credible without having used it and washed it at least once first. The next day after my first use, I washed the brush and there was little fallout, only about 1 or 2 bristles. Also, the color of my foundation came off easily and the brush looked white on the tips again. Then I set it out to dry. This is where I kind of had a problem. The brushed didn&#x27;t fluff up after drying, but I noticed the outer bristles were kind of way and they poked my hand when I touched it to see of it was dry. When I used it for the second time, my foundation still applied nicely with the brush, but the outer bristles did poke me. I&#x27;m not sure if I got a defective brush or something, but when I use it, I try to use the side without the wavy bristles. This is a little annoying. Overall, I am satisfied and I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> I recently brought the Sigma F80 after hearing some really good reviews about it on utube and I love it!! The shipping was really fast, the brush is lovely and soft and makes my foundation look flawless and unlike the MAC 187 it doesn&#x27;t shed!! I will defiantly be buying more Sigma brushes and recommending them to my friends. :)</li>
            <li> This lil&#x27; guy packs a powerful and oh so efficient punch. It&#x27;s soft, evenly distributes liquid foundation as well as powder, and buffs the product into the skin like no other. Well worth the investment. Luvs it. It&#x27;s the \\&quot;Christian Louboutin\\&quot; of makeup brushes lol. I highly recommend this brush to my clients &amp; friends. Add it to your cart now...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!!</li>
            <li> I am loving this brush. Makes a HUGE difference- makeup goes on super smooth and buffs beautifully. Great price and crazy fast shipping too. I don&#x27;t think I will ever use another foundation brush. It&#x27;s a definite must have.... I&#x27;m impressed! :)</li>
            <li> I never used brushes to apply make up before I bought this brush; always used fingers or sponge. This brush is perfect for liquid as well as powder foundations. It gives a very smooth, even feel on the face. I use it everyday and wash it every month, its working great for me!!</li>
            <li> My Sigma F80 got here way quicker than expected! Very impressed with the service and the quality of the brush is wonderful as expected. I will be purchasing more Sigma brushes in the future!</li>
            <li> I use this brush with my foundation and it creates an airbrushed finish. I only took one star off for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike some other reviews, I&#x27;ve had no problems with brush shedding.</li>
            <li> Love this brush makes foundation look flawless.</li>
            <li> Completely changes the look of your foundation to an absolute beautiful airbrush finish. Couldn&#x27;t be any happier! Sigma is the best of the best for makeup brushes. I own their Performance Eye Kit and am still loving it! Simply Amazing.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush! I have never raved about a brush as much as this one. I have heard so many amazing things especially from beauty gurus on YouTube and I finally decided to go ahead and spend the money on the brush. Let me tell you, it&#x27;s so worth it, especially for the price. A similar brush at MAC would probably cost you around $42 and will not give you the same results. You get such an even flawless look with this brush and best of all is that there&#x27;s no streaky lines of foundation and it doesn&#x27;t look cakey either. I would highly suggest this to any body whether you&#x27;re a beginner or pro. Plus Sigma also sends you a free gift with your purchase! I received a free E05 eyeliner brush with my F80. AMAZING! AMAZING! AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Very good brush, true to its reputation</li>
            <li> This brush is great really spreads very well</li>
            <li> all time favorite brush. I highly recommend it for adding your cream foundation</li>
            <li> Best kabuki brush ever I recommend this to everyone makes my make up look even smoother without the streak marks!</li>
            <li> I am SO glad I bought this brush!!!! It feels amazing on my skin and my face looks a million times better after I use it to apply foundation. It&#x27;s AMAZING what a good job this brush does. I cannot recommend this brush enough!!!!</li>
            <li> After reading so many good reviews on this brush, I just couldn&#x27;t wait to try it myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is well built, black wooden handle and metallic ferrule, the bristles are very dense and reaaaaaaaally soft. Nice to the sight and to the touch, this is actually a professional brush, and that&#x27;s exactly the feel it has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a bonus I must add that the bristles are made of sinthetic hair, so this product can be catalogued as vegan-friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used with liquid and powder foundations, you can achieve almost effortlessly an airbrushed look. This brush is so soft that allows you to build up layers until you get the desired coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also found it really nice for applying blush and liquid highlighters such as benefit&#x27;s high beam or nars&#x27; orgasm illuminating fluid, achieving a sheer result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for such a small price, I think you get a high quality brush that will become indispensable.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased a  flat top synthetic kabuki - f80.&lt;br /&gt;The best foundation brush. I&#x27;ve had so many brushes before  none&lt;br /&gt;work as good as this.I loooooooooooove it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I received item really fast and of course I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it with my Lancome liquid foundation and I must say, this is the perfect complement for my liquid makeup! I usually use my hand to apply liquid foundation, never again! This is an amazing tool to apply even makeup and less mess!</li>
            <li> Received this brush yesterday along with the F30 large powder brush, E40 tapered blending brush and E20 beauty blending brush. I washed the brushes and allowed them to dry overnight. The brushes were totally dry and ready to use this morning. The F80 turned my foundation application into a breeze this morning. Used it with Revlon Colorstay liquid foundation and it blended it smoothly and quickly. After reading several reviews for this brush I was confident that I was making a good purchase. Turns out it was a GREAT purchase. Love all the brushes and will continue to purchase more from Sigma as they have quality products.</li>
            <li> The brush is so soft and it distributes the makeup so smoothly and even. I love it!</li>
            <li> I use this to apply tinted moisturizer.  This brush gives a natural but airbrushed look that I do not get if I use my fingers to apply instead.  Plus the brush does not shed. I love this brush.  It&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
            <li> This makeup brush is wonderful. I have always applied my foundation using either my hands or a makeup sponge but after using this brush, I&#x27;ll never go back to my old ways. I also notice that I use a lot less of the makeup when using this brush than I ever used to. Foundation blends so much better and gives my skin an airbrushed appearance. A friend recommended this brush to me and I would highly recommend this brush to other people that are looking for a better way to apply their liquid foundation. Thank you Sigma for a great product!</li>
            <li> I Love this brush. I knew I would because I have several other Sigma brushes that are amazing I have decited to only purchase Sigma brushes from now on.</li>
            <li> This brush is wonderful to use with liquid makeup. I have used foundation brushes before and found that the traditional ones leave streaks &amp; other kabukis use too make foundation but with this brush I can blend brilliantly.</li>
            <li> The Sigma Makeup F80 is a buffer brush that can be used to blend powder or liquid products. The short and dense bristles make it easy to buff your liquid foundation. The long handle adds comfort to your makeup application.&lt;br /&gt;The brush is well-built; the bristles are tight and the length is just right. The hair is soft and dense with NO shed. The F80 Flat Top Kabuki brush has synthetic fibers making it ideal is for applying and blending liquid, cream and powder products onto the skin. The flat surface allows perfect buffing with flawless results.&lt;br /&gt;The fibers/hairs are EXTREMELY soft! I can&#x27;t emphasise that enough. They are so gentle on my skin, not scratchy at all. I am very please with this brush and it has high quality written all over it from top to bottom - the handle, the silver ferrule and of course, the hair filaments. The hairs being so dense but not too dense is absolute perfection. It makes blending and buffing a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003UH0528 Sigma Beauty Flat Top Synthetic Kabuki - F80]]</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried sigma brushes before, but my friend recommended this particular brush because I&#x27;m a foundation junkie. Well I absolutely love it. I use Mufe HD foundation and it goes on okay with my fingers. When I used a sponge it broke me out. But after working with sigma F80 it looks almost flawless :) I recommend this brush to all liquid foundation gals. :)</li>
            <li> As soon as i received this brush in the mail i was amazed of how soft it is and couldn&#x27;t wait to use it. As soon as i used it its amazing how it distributes your makeup and with little effort and just in the first day can&#x27;t wait to continue and best brush i&#x27;ve invested. LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> I have tried every brush out there to blend my foundation, and not one has lived up to my needs.  Enter the Sigma flat top kabuki!  This brush is amazing!  It blends both liquid foundation and mineral foundation effortlessly.  I have found my new brush and can&#x27;t be without it.  I hope sigma keeps making the brush as I want to give some away as gifts and also buy and few more for myself.</li>
            <li> I have tried many brushes to apply foundation, but none of them works as good as this one!!!!!! Thank you again for the SUPER FAST SHIPPING and for the greatest products at an affordable price!!!! I TOTALLY LOVE ALL YOUR BRUSHES!!!!!  Also, this one just like the eye brushes and the contour brush don&#x27;t shed at all. Again i am super happy with my purchase and i will sure buy more of your products!!!!! THANK YOU!!!!!</li>
            <li> Brush is nice, it&#x27;s soft and dense and good for buffing in foundation. This was the first brush I have purchased from Sigma. LOVE IT..!!</li>
            <li> I love this brush and use it daily to apply my foundation. I use chanel perfection lumiere foundation and this brush applies it beautifully. I prefer this brush to any other I&#x27;ve tried for liquid foundation. You can use less makeup Because it spreads and blends it so well. When cleaning this brush, allow ample time to let it dry. It needs at least 12 hours from my experience. The bristles are so densely packed and incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> Very beautiful... Thank you</li>
            <li> I like the brush but I don&#x27;t like how it takes in all the foundation. It soaks it all up. I usually use three pumps for my face and neck with this brush I put up to 5</li>
            <li> I bought this as it was highly recommended by most makeup artists. Works amazing with liquid foundation! Blends great and doesn&#x27;t soak up foundation. Easy to clean as well! Love this brush!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and love this brush!</li>
            <li> soft flat brush&lt;br /&gt;applies makeup flawlessly and makes it look like i&#x27;m not even wearing any on</li>
            <li> I have to say out of all the sigma brushes I have this is by far the BEST foundation brush out there!!! What a difference in how my makeup looks, so smooth and flawless!!!I would use my fingers to apply my foundation not anymore this brush is a miracle, and sealed very safe.Very satisfied lady!!!</li>
            <li> Love love love love love! This brush makes my makeup go on like a dream. I use it with concealer mostly because I don&#x27;t wear foundation, but it blends my concealer over my BB cream perfectly. If I ever need another brush, I&#x27;m definitely skipping the MAC counter and heading right for a Sigma.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush to apply my liquid makeup with and it did an excellent job of it! No streaks, no bristles left behind....just smooth application!</li>
            <li> This brush is worth every penny. Soft, dense, durable, no fall out. Perfect for applying foundation and an absolute beauty must have.</li>
            <li> Great brush! Easy to clean. Fibers stay in tact. Application is smooth and even. High price, but well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Fabulous high quality brush! My favorite brush I own to apply foundation. Makes skin flawless so quickly. I own over a dozen Sigma brushes and all are top high quality brushes!</li>
            <li> Love this brush. Does the job well. Wash well too. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> great product for apply liquid foundation</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing! Before I bought this I was applying my foundation with my fingers and what a difference this has made! I use it every single day! I would definitely recommend this to everyone looking for an easy way to apply and blend their foundation. It completely exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li> This was my favorite brush until I ordered again on Amazon and recieved a fake one which broke right away, the first one lasted like a yr, washed it almost everyday, this one soon as I open bristles fall off which was a bad sign but I was foolish enough to not return and use for a few weeks, seriously what&#x27;s with Amazon!</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Love it</li>
            <li> I loved it ! I use it for applying foundation ... It&#x27;s super fluffy and the bristles are perfect coverage for my face !</li>
            <li> Best Brush I have ever used, it is definitely worth the extra cost</li>
            <li> I love the flat kabuki. This isy second time purchasing it because I am asked to do others make up and so I&#x27;d like to have two but my first one I bought a year agonies still going strong! This brush is so dense it picks up the make up from the back of your hand and puts it on your face as evenly as possible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen a good quality product like this, better than MAC and other brushes I used before, I&#x27;ll purchase again</li>
            <li> I love this brush and it makes my foundation look flawless.  It&#x27;s a HUGE difference from applying it with your hands, it really is.  The tough thing is cleaning it.  The bristles are so dense, sometimes I&#x27;ll wash it 3-4 times and it&#x27;s still not clean.  Awesome brush, though!</li>
            <li> I have found cheaper dupes almost as soft as this Sigma, but none of them have come close to the same density, and because of that Sigma always provides a smoother quicker application. I am only giving it four stars though because I keep experiencing a bit of shed, and because when it arrived it had tiny singular black hairs sticking out from the smooth white finish that needed to be trimmed.</li>
            <li> Makes my makeup look flawless!</li>
            <li> The best blending brush out there. The bristles are so nice and soft and thick, the makeup goes on smooth and flawless.</li>
            <li> This brush works great! I use it to blend my foundation and I love it. Cleans easy and blends great.</li>
            <li> Definitely my favorite brush in my collection. I use liquid foundation every day and this type of brush is a must have for liquid foundation. I used to think just any brush would do the trick, but nope! This make it much easier and makes the foundation go on nice and smooth and blends it perfectly. Just wish I knew to use these kinds of brushes sooner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first one I&#x27;ve had of this type, but I&#x27;ve had it for what feels like a year now or so and it&#x27;s been lasting AND without any shedding, which is incredibly important. I&#x27;ve washed it plenty of times too and have had no problems with shedding after, which a lot of brushed do. So happy about this brush!</li>
            <li> This brush is gives the finish of air brushing. It&#x27;s densely packed head of bristles and the shape get every bit of foundation buffed in the skin.</li>
            <li> This brush broke while using it! The bristles came unglued and fell out during application after owning it less than 9 months. Really upsetting that it didn&#x27;t last that long!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for several months. It has held up nicely and cleans out well. Bought a second one for my daughter. Good price too.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t really see the hype, but then again I&#x27;d never used a brush to apply foundation before so it was an awkward process. Once I got the hang of it, I really see the difference. I love the brush, but I&#x27;m deducting a star simply because it&#x27;s such a pain to clean. Because the bristles are so dense it takes forever.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok. I constantly have to brush the bristles from the brush off my face.  It&#x27;s Definitely not worth the hype.</li>
            <li> This is seriously the best foundation brush i&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> This is a must-have product. U won&#x27;t to wanna miss it!</li>
            <li> I wanted to like it.  Bristles were soft, covered face well, then 1 month after using all the hairs started to fall out.  One day I tried pulling and the whole chunk of them came out.  Sooooo disappointed.  Now I can&#x27;t even return it.  Wasted my money which does not sit well.</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be a lot bigger other than that it smooths your foundation extremely well!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used brushes before.  Now I&#x27;m wondering why it&#x27;s taken so long.  The application for foundation goes on so much more than just with fingertips. Lovely.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Foundation goes on much easier with this brush.&lt;br /&gt;foundation blends much easier and better with this brush too.&lt;br /&gt;I wish it was a little smaller in size but it does the job.</li>
            <li> My new Flat Kabuki brush Easy to apply liquid foundation. Love it. Yes I will purchase other one and highly recommend to family and friends.</li>
            <li> The best brush ever!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this brush for applying my liquid foundation!!! I stipple with it first then kinda buff everything in for a flawless airbrushed finish!! I can&#x27;t imagine NOT using this brush!!! Would definitely recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Great brush. I waste way less product and get a better finish.</li>
            <li> The coverage and control are phenomenal with this brush.</li>
            <li> I love this brush!!!!  It makes my make up look sooooooo much better!!!!  I can&#x27;t believe I ever waisted my time with a regular brush.  I would definitely recommend this to every girl I know!</li>
            <li> By far the BEST foundation brush I&#x27;ve ever had! Saw Jaclyn Hill using this in her videos and had to try it for myself &amp; it is amazing! Totally worth spending a little more on a brush than normal! Completely sold on sigma brushes and can&#x27;t wait to buy the set!</li>
            <li> Best brand of brushes for the price.  This one is perfect for applying foundation.</li>
            <li> Holy grail of foundation brushes.</li>
            <li> After my Elf flat powder brush started shedding, especially while washing, I decided to look for an alternative. This has become my holy grail of brushes. The brush hairs are so soft and make for such a smooth and damn near flawless application of foundation. I use it everyday and I love it. It does take some effort to clean though but that is to be expected given the density of the brush.</li>
            <li> This is the best foundation brush out there. It covers so much area without using a lot of product.</li>
            <li> Loved this brush but within a few months the top seperate from the bottom.</li>
            <li> Item as described! fast delivery! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Like it. So soft when you use it on your face. a good foundation blush.</li>
            <li> This  is a great flat kabuki brush and has lasted a long time.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> When I went to wash my brush for the first time all the hairs came out of the brush. Other than it falling apart I loved it! So pissed I barely had it a month and it broke though. Definitley just buy expensive brushes from now on that can be washed over and over without the glue coming off and ruining the brush.</li>
            <li> I love this brush! It makes my foundation go on evenly without a lot of effort. Cleans well too. This is my favorite brush.</li>
            <li> One of the best brushed I&#x27;ve used. Helps with applying foundation evenly throughout the face. The brush hair is extremely soft and can therefore reach difficult areas such as the corner of the eyes.</li>
            <li> My holy grail foundation brush!!  I use with a sephora brand aerosol spray foundation. It&#x27;s amazing!!!!</li>
            <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li> Love this brush. Great buy!</li>
            <li> The brissles are amazingly soft and worka like a gem. This brush is less expensive than if I got it off the actually sigma website. On the website is says it is $24 whereas I paid $21.</li>
            <li> Love this brush!!!! Got here fast and in perfect condition. Thanks!!</li>
            <li> This is my first makeup brush to use for the stippling technique.  So far I absolutely love it.  What a difference I can see in my foundation makeup.  I will definitely look into other techniques with various other brushes.</li>
            <li> Nice brush for blending foundation.  I prefer a beauty blender or my Target Up &amp; Up complexion brush (which is awesome). I won&#x27;t be tricked into the brush hype again. It&#x27;s nice, but does nothing a less expensive brush can&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li> I loved it for two months. I bought one from Sigma&#x27;s website and one from here. Both at brushes started shedding and the top hair eventually came apart and fell off. Both brushes in the trash! So disappointed.</li>
            <li> waiting a long time to invest in this brush but love it!</li>
            <li> OMG! Amazing brush, love it so much, great high quality,it&#x27;s perfect. Best brushes ever, definitively continuing buying from sigma. Highly recommended for everyone who loves makeup. Essential for applying foundation with a perfect application.</li>
            <li> This brush had a dink on the handle due to super light packaging. I just painted over it with black nail polish. The actual brush itself is authentic and blends like no other. I have used other amazon dupes to avoid paying 24$ for this brush, but after trying the Bestope dupe, coastal scents, and countless others, I caved and purchased the sigma flat top kabuki. It totally makes a difference in your foundation application. This is a must have!</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing! It covers my face evenly and gives me a nice smooth look. My face doesn&#x27;t look uneven like it would without this brush. Its a great brush, you should definitely buy it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing it is soft and dense. I uste to use the sponge but his brush gives full coverage no matter the foundation .</li>
            <li> As a professional makeup artist I use many many brushes. I like the quality on the sigma brushes. This brush is great for blending in foundation, however it does absorb a lot of the makeup thereby wasting product and necessitating deep cleaning more often. I like to be able to spray my brushes with a disinfectant spray that takes off most makeup in seconds, I can&#x27;t do that for this brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s was an amazing brush I love it!!</li>
            <li> I bought this brush because I had watched so many videos of beauty gurus raving over it. When I finally started to use it, however, I found that it was absorbing more of my liquid foundation than my ELF Powder brush (which I won&#x27;t tolerate, seeing that right now, I&#x27;m using Make Up For Ever&#x27;s HD Foundation, which is too expensive to be wasted!!) It is, however, 10x softer and smoother than the ELF Powder brush. I find myself using this brush with a matte powder to set my foundation by sort of pressing and dabbing it where I have my foundation on. Then I&#x27;ll go over that and buff out the excess. (this technique is also great for oily skin!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I had some speculation that this seller might be sending out fake brushes. I&#x27;m not familiar with Sigma&#x27;s line (as this is my first one) but a lot of people have complained about getting fake brushes from eBay and Amazon retailers. (Some have said that the brushes have fallen apart, the bristles are less dense and/or are longer than the \\&quot;real\\&quot; brushes, and that the Sigma signature on the handle is different) If you want this brush, I would suggest you get it from the Sigma site and pay the few extra dollars. I&#x27;ve heard that it comes with a free gift too, so that&#x27;s a plus! I kind of regret not purchasing it from the Sigma site .. but oh well! What can you do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**** UPDATE ****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is now December 5, 2013, so I&#x27;ve had this brush for little over a year. I&#x27;ve washed it regularly throughout the year without any problems, except for the last time. The glue that held the bristles together broke down, causing it to shed until it came off completely. I&#x27;ve heard that this brush has lasted people for years and years, but that wasn&#x27;t the case for me! It completely fell apart and I had to throw it out. It was really disappointing because I&#x27;ve probably had my ELF brushes longer than this one and I have yet to have a problem with shedding.</li>
            <li> fue una recomendacion en videos you tube de beauty gurus como emilynoel 83, makeupbytiffanyd y es todo lo que esperaba y mas</li>
            <li> A lot of people have complimented this brush. But I did not have a good experience. When I received the brush it, the handle felt as though it was going to come off. I didn&#x27;t think nothing of it. The brush itself was excellent applying my foundation was so easy and effortless. Then the handle broke off the brush, I was disgusted. I did not have the brush for a week and it was broken.</li>
            <li> The item came on time and is perfect! I love it!</li>
            <li> Love sigma! Every says my makeup looks so good since I started using sigma. I never realized brushes really do much that much of a difference!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the brush yet but it&#x27;s very soft. The only problem I had was that there was a barcode sticker on the brush which was a little difficult to get completely off.</li>
            <li> This brush is absolutely brilliant for applying foundation!!! It gives you a flawless look which is AMAZING!!!! After using this brush I WILL NEVER use anyone other brush for applying foundation!!! You will definitely not regret purchasing this brush!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best foundation brush I have purchase. I will be purchasing a set of brushes from the Sigma line soon.</li>
            <li> This brush really stretches the amount of foundation I need to use and results in a smooth, natural-looking finish.  The brush is very soft on my face.  Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love this brush sooo much! I use it to apply my liquid foundation and the finish is just amazing, it&#x27;s like an airbrush finish!&lt;br /&gt;Totally recommend this brush! It&#x27;s just AMAZING! Worth every single dollar!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter and she loves this brush to apply foundation .  It has held up well</li>
            <li> I never had a good foundation brush until i came across this one. I have heard alot of people talk about it and finally decided to give it a try and i am so glad i did. I have used this everyday since i purchased it and the shipping was so fast. I will defentiately be purchasing more products from them. Extremely staisfied. If you are debating whether or not to purchase it, just do it; you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> The purfect brush for applying powder foundation. Look no further as I have found this brush to deliver and more!</li>
            <li> The brush I really liked. Way better than a sponge or foundation brush(the one that looks like a paint brush). It&#x27;s very dense which makes liquid go on very flawless! HOWEVER.! I&#x27;ve never seen a real sigma brush so I don&#x27;t know if this is the real deal. I did notice that the silver part and the handle(black part) is starting to wobble .. If that makes sense. I feel like if I pull on it a little, the brush will come apart. I noticed this like 3 weeks after I recieved the brush. Hope this helps :)</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and hassle free, however I am very disappointed with the quality of this brush. I have previously used several sigma brushes and I absolutely love all of them, except for this one. I have read and seen several great reviews about this brush being able to give a flawless finish using liquid foundation, however after a few washes the hairs started shedding. It sheds more with every use and wash. I am very careful with the way I wash my brushes however this particular brush did not hold up to the sigma quality. I am writing this review because just a few minutes ago I gave this brush another chance by giving it another wash, and to my dismay, the whole bundle of hairs eventually fell of from the brush handle itself. I don&#x27;t know, maybe I just got a crappy brush. I&#x27;m not sure if I will repurchase this item, I prefer to use my ELF flat top powder brush, only costs $3 and never had a problem of it shedding.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush from ETAILZ and the handle quality is crap! The bristles are great but Sigma really needs to go back to making their brushes in the USA. Because my writing is coming off. The Gloss on the brush is coming off and I&#x27;m really hating it BUT i do like the brush. It works amazing and puts on my foundation like a masterpiece! But I really dont understand why its started to get Matte on me.</li>
            <li> No other words other than I LOVE IT!!! 🙏😍</li>
            <li> Great foundation brush.</li>
            <li> LOVE my sigma F80 brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it every single day to apply my foundation and it always looks FLAWLESS!</li>
            <li> Gets the job done excellently!</li>
            <li> I love this brush, it&#x27;s so soft!</li>
            <li> This brush is great for liquid foundation. My new every day brush for sure!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite brushes!</li>
            <li> I love this brush if had several that shed this one does not totally worth every penny. Applies foundation perfectly!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Mac blending brush for a year and I loved it.... This definitely blends and feels better. I&#x27;m going to look into Sigma&#x27;s other products.</li>
            <li> I love this Kabuki brush. I have only ever owned one other Kabuki brush so I am not that well educated on them but I am more than happy with this purchase and would reorder it if I am ever in need of a new one. My makeup goes on with a flawless finish when I use this brush, and I like that it is very soft on my skin. This brush makes my makeup application very quick process in the mornings. I highly recommend this Kabuki brush to anyone looking to purchase one.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush to use to apply liquid foundation. I use it with Nars, BareSkin, and Bobbi Brown foundations. It applies foundation smooth. Bristles are soft and very dense. I apply the foundation in dabs to my skin and then buff in. I don&#x27;t know if I would apply it directly to the brush. I am a novice when it comes to the art of makeup so I am not super picky or technical with my brushes. Either they work or they don&#x27;t. This brush was highly recommended in many YouTube videos. I like it better than the beauty blender because I can put it on quicker. All the dabbing with the beauty blender was annoying to me. I will probably use the brush for most of my face and use the beauty blender for under the eye area to apply concealer or if I am using two different foundation colors I may use one with the brush and one with the blender. I have not had to wash it yet so I don&#x27;t know how it &amp;#34;bounces back&amp;#34; after washing yet. But so far I like it and would buy again.</li>
            <li> best foundation buffing brush</li>
            <li> amazing!!!! all I have to say.After so many reviews I decided to give it a chance and I can say with no doubt that is one of the best make up purchase I&#x27;ve ever done.</li>
            <li> 5/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing for my foundation routine, flawless finish! Just the handle is a little weak but that&#x27;s no problem. Love this!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and good product&lt;br /&gt;Thxxxx</li>
            <li> Love this brush! Good deal</li>
            <li> This brush is the softest brush I have ever used. The brush applies foundation on like a dream. The foundation appears alot smoother and natural with this brush. I will definitely be purchasing more brushes from sigma.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try a Sigma brush forever and finally bought this one thanks to tons of hype on YouTube and it did not disappoint! Will be ordering an entire set soon!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand all the negative reviews about this being a fake brush. it is exactly like my other ones. I would recommend this amazing brush to anyone! The bursh comes with a card from the seller stating that if you write a review and follow their instructions (they did not say the review had to be positive), they would send you a free gift. I&#x27;ve not received anything nor heard from them.</li>
            <li> Sigma is a brand name known for quality brushes, and in this case, I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  Arriving on time and beautifully packaged, my brush is better than I could have imagined.  Honestly, its quality is such that you&#x27;d expect it to be twice the price - at least.  I just love it.  This definitely will NOT be my last SIGMA brush purchase, and I will recommend this brand to everyone who will listen!</li>
            <li> I love this brush! Favorite brush every. Leaves makeup looking flawless and perfectly buffs out makeup. I&#x27;ll never buy another brand again.</li>
            <li> the best blending brush ever everyone should have the flat kabuki it makes your makeup flawless</li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with SIGMA!!!</li>
            <li> best brush for putting on your foundation!!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush December 2013, I was so excited, I used for about 5 months it was perfect blended my foundation flawlessly, after those 5 months the brush started shedding, I though it was normal because a lot of brushes shed, I have always heard amazing reviews of the sigma brushes and I never heard of anyone&#x27;s kabuki brush shedding. Anyways all of the sudden after I used for more days it shed like crazy! The crazy part is, the brush started like sinking in and then when I tried fixing it the entire brush part fell out of the tube. I don&#x27;t know if this seller sells fake brushes or I just got a defected one, I have pictures of it. And if I did get a defected one I ask the seller to either please send me my money back and I&#x27;ll order it from the actual website or send me a new one.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this flat kabuki brush! I use this with my Mac Studio Fix Powder Plus Foundation.</li>
            <li> obsessed with using this for my foundation routine! you NEED this in your life! lol</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, brush is very soft, very comfortable. I think I&#x27;ll continue to buy if the price was perfect to get concessions.</li>
            <li> I use it to apply my foundation and it gives a great finish. You din&#x27;t see any lines from the brush.</li>
            <li> This is the best brush for liquid foundation! i am never using another brush again. it is made so well and its so soft. It really makes the liquid foundation look a lot better on your skin. They make these so well and there worth the money. It is a long lasting brush and you won&#x27;t have to worry about having to get a new one anytime soon</li>
            <li> At first I was thinking to buy the Everyday Minerals flat top brush, but after I saw tons of good reviews of this Sigma F80 on Youtube. I decided to buy this one, and my decision was right. The hair was extremely soft and bushy. I don&#x27;t want to stop brush my face when I put on my foundation. Oh, by the way, it&#x27;s a prefect brush for liquid foundation. I love it so much.</li>
            <li> Sigma F80 isn&#x27;t just a brush, it&#x27;s a magic wand that erases all your facial imperfections :). I finally gave into the hype about this brush because i was having some real deal problems when applying my foundation. Cheap sponges made my foundation streak horribly and my fingers didn&#x27;t apply as evenly and made me look cakey. And honestly I was sick of it! So here is my story on Sigma Famazing brush!&lt;br /&gt; Im normally not a stickler for packaging but I was  so pleased that my brush came in a nice secure bag with a plastic shaper on it. I took the brush out and closely examined and it was in perfect condition, brand spanking new. I prepped my face and dabbed on my foundation and worked the brushes magic. The feel of the brush on my face was so soft!! Within a matter of min my foundation was applied, I was so pleased that this required so little effort. I looked at the results and I literally  gasped and gazed into the mirror. Perfection!! No streaks no spots, this brush gave me a flawless finish! The brush smoothed and blended my foundation so beautifully. And my foundation is pretty thick! (Mary Kay 607 Bronze) I was blown away!! Let me tell you Honey, your fingers will NEVER be able to provided you with such beautiful coverage.  I will NEVER use my fingers again. Follow me in Instagram Kissmy_sashay</li>
            <li> The density of this brush is just great for applying foundation. It gives such a shear coverage. A must have!</li>
            <li> This is my first sigma brush and I love it. This F80 flat top kabuki is one of my favorite brushes to apply my liquid foundation. It gives a nice flawless finish, and blends so nicely. I definitely will be buying more.</li>
            <li> favorite brush to put foundation on! have not had any problems with it. its the perfect brush and the right amount of density.</li>
            <li> I received my brush in two days. No problem. Show that this was make up artist favorite foundation brush, so I bought it.</li>
            <li> So far I am very pleased with this brush. It&#x27;s very thick and the bristles don&#x27;t shed. The lenght of the handle is perfect and it comes with a protective plastic sleeve so that it doesn&#x27;t get weird shapes.&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this brush for applying liquid and cream-to powder foundation.</li>
            <li> I read about using the Sigma Flat Top Kabuki makeup brush to apply liquid makeup and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  This brush is phenomenal. It applies liquid and cream foundations smoothly, no streaks, and no shedding. This brush is very well made. I lost my first one while traveling and quickly ordered another one. It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> This brush is incredible for blending foundations and applying cream blush flawlessly. it really is the sigma brand so you don&#x27;t have to worry about knock offs. Amazing product and it shipped fast &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I was looking to replace my old Shu Uemura angled brush with a dense kabuki-type brush.  Although I was skeptical at first, the Sigma brush lived up to the reviews and provides a nice coat while using less powder compared to my old brush.</li>
            <li> i got my brush today, applied my liquid foundation and it was the best flawless finish i have gotten with a foundation.This is by far the best brush i have used even better than they department stores expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Pinceau de qualit&amp;eacute;, look tr&amp;egrave;s haut de gamme &amp;agrave; avoir absolument dans sa trousse &amp;agrave; maquillage pour un maquillage parfait.</li>
            <li> I love this Sigma brush, I have wanted to order this brush for awhile. I love how it smoothes out my foundation perfectly. I really am looking forward to ordering more Sigma brushes!</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft, best brush in my collection.  It makes your foundation go on ultra smooth and makes your skin look flawless.</li>
            <li> Best brush I ever owned, applies make up fast &amp; easy, giving a very natural look and the price is great! I&#x27;ve recomended this brushes to all my friends!  Love sigma</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for foundation apply, and it works great! It applies product seamlessly. And not irritates skin at all. I definitely recommend this brush to every girl who wears foundation. It saves time, and guarantee perfect look skin.</li>
            <li> i shop at sophora alot so you can only imagine the amount of money spent there every weekend. i decided to buy this brush on amazon to give it a try . for 1 its cheap , cheaper then the brushes at sophora. when i finally got it and did half my face with this brush and the other half my face with my expensive sophora brush. the Sigma brush is truly airbrush perfect look. compared to my sophora brush that shows the brush lines with every stroke. so this sigma brush from amazon is the winner . its cheaper and better.. win win</li>
            <li> I had never used this type of brush before and it&#x27;s simply amazing.  I use it for foundation and it&#x27;s perfect.  You can use it for probably just about anything.  It doesn&#x27;t really shed either, which is nice compared to the powder kabuki brush I purchased.  I definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft. Makeup goes on perfectly smooth and even. I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase for myself.</li>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing a Sigma brush and I must say that I am impressed. I will definitely be adding to my brush collection with sigma burshes.</li>
            <li> I loooooooved this brush, it&#x27;s perfect. This brush is great for applying foundation, I wouldn&#x27;t apply foundation with anything else.</li>
            <li> Me encanta esta brocha! en realidad todas las brochas de sigma para mi son las mejores, son tan suaves, resistentes... el maquillaje queda perfecto cuando utilizo estas brochas. las amo!</li>
            <li> The Sigma f80 i received was fake! Right off d bat i knew it was fake!! I wont recommend it! Go to Sigma website! I wish i would hav read all d reviews here bfore i went to purchase it! Dont know how long these brushes would last..bought two for my aunt and cousin! Im so disgusted!</li>
            <li> Just recieved sigma f80, it is not in a seal package, feels unsanitary for something you&#x27;re going to used on the face.</li>
            <li> This brush is very cheaply made!  The metal and wood parts came unglued and fell apart within the first three weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I have two Sigma brushes that I bought directly from Sigma&#x27;s website. They are fantasic! I was ready to try the F80 and since I have Amazon Prime, I figured I would get the brush quickly if I ordered from here(and save a few bucks!)I received the \\&quot;Sigma F80\\&quot; brush in the mail today. I am SO disappointed! The brush is a fake! The brush head isn&#x27;t dense at all, very low quality. I can literally pull the hairs out. With my others Sigmas I have never had a problem with the hairs falling out. Also I can definitely smell paint on the brush, the Sigma logo is painted on and the whole brush reeks of paint. Not something I want to use on my face at all. On my other brushes the logo isn&#x27;t engraved on and with this one it is. Please save yourself some time and just order the brush from Sigma&#x27;s site! This is a no go! I&#x27;m sending mine back and getting a refund!</li>
            <li> So far I have only used this brush once and I absolutely loved it! It leaves an airbrushed look which is really good when using liquid foundations.</li>
            <li> Perfect. No complaints.</li>
            <li> These is not the first time i pay it i like it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I ordered this brush! Usually when I put foundation on I use my fingers because alot of the brushes I use seem to leave streaks  but after hearing so much hype about this brush I thought  maybe it&#x27;s worth the money.. And oh was I RIGHT!</li>
            <li> Wonderful soft brush! I know several makeup artists that swear by Sigma brushes and now I know why. I will be investing in more brushes over time to replace my other subpar brushes. Be sure to check the Sigma website to see who the verified Amazon sellers are so you are sure to get a genuine brush.</li>
            <li> I am new to applying foundation with a brush. I am in the process of deciding between two, this being one of them. So far, I like the coverage and the ability to &amp;#34;stipple&amp;#34; rather than &amp;#34;paint&amp;#34; the foundation.</li>
            <li> Love it best Brush I ever bought</li>
            <li> I cannot tell you how many makeup brushes I have tried. I cannot imagine how much money I have spent trying to find brushes that blend perfectly and do not shed. Sigma brushes are by far the best brushes out there and also have great prices.</li>
            <li> this has to be the best foundation brush ever i use the kat von d foundation. I also use it to blend my concealer and for the setting powder great brush great quality no hairs have fallen. Highly reccomend to anyone</li>
            <li> APPLIES LIQUID FOUNDATION BEAUTIFULLY. I have heard that some have had a problem with the brush falling apart, but I have also heard that Sigma has great customer service and will replace the brush if this happens. HOWEVER, personal experience so far... i love this brush</li>
            <li> I LOVE my Sigma F80 brush.  I use it almost everyday and its still so soft and blends my liquid foundation out flawlessly!!</li>
            <li> Very very very upset with this brush! I had read some amazing reviews on this brush and was so excited to receive it fairly quickly! The application of this brush is just amazing... downfall is that I have used it maybe for a month and the brush broke into half... I take great care of all my make up products but the part where the silver goes into the bottom of the brush came apart, the glue did not make it stay in there well.. so now I have a broken brush. Very upset. Not sure if I just got a faulty brush or what...</li>
            <li> I want to try the angled kabuki and the round-top foundation brush because this one is amazing I know the others will be too! I love sigma brushes they are amazing!!!</li>
            <li> best foundation brush ever!</li>
            <li> It was a nice brush but it wasn&#x27;t a real Sigma brush. Much smaller then a real Sigma brushes. Might as well go buy the real one from the website. I believe it&#x27;s the same price.</li>
            <li> I have used several flat top kabuki brushes that I loved and I heard about this one and figured I would give it a whirl.  I have no idea how I lived without this brush.  It is so dense and fluffy and amazing!  It buffs on foundation like no other and leaves absolutely no streaks or lines.  The bristles are shorter than other flat tops I have tried and they are sooo dense!!  I have held it up and compared the flat top with others like it I owned and there is no comparison.  And the price is extremely fair for the quality of the brush!</li>
            <li> I love love love this brush and so does everyone else in my family.  I&#x27;m currently using the makeup forever hd foundation and this does a wonderful job with application.  Before this, I was using a type of sponge from Mally and it worked great I thought.  This works soooo much better.  I literally use half the makeup.  One small pump on the wrist will do my whole face and I have more to cover than usual.  The coverage was better and I used less makeup...I don&#x27;t know but it was great! I want to tell everyone!!!!! It&#x27;s still small enough to get around your eyes and mouth without making a mess.</li>
            <li> I used a kabuki brush to apply my Bare Minerals.  I&#x27;m used to a short handled brush, so it took a while getting used to this one.  After a little adjustment, I found this brush to be perfect for my needs.  Very pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I love this brush! Its so soft and works so well with foundation! It gave me an air brush finish! I can now see why everyone obsessed with this brush! Thank you SIGMA!</li>
            <li> Great brush! I love it! Very soft bristles! Great for natural looking finish foundation! Comes with brush protector! Fab brush! Great buy!</li>
            <li> Great quality. And affordable price I highly recommended to anyone that&#x27;s looking for a good quality kabuki brush!  Also arrived quickly and nicely packaged</li>
            <li> First of all I got it shipped super fast before the expected delivery date, so that was good. As for the product, I had heard a lot about this brush so I had to get it and I love it!! It makes my foundation go on so flawless. I love the soft bristles also. Overall very good quality and will def. be purchasing more brushes.</li>
            <li> Its great foundation brush you feel that your face more nature with it and I am happpy using it&amp;#62;thank you</li>
            <li> Thank you Sigma for this wonderful product&lt;br /&gt;I loved very, very&lt;br /&gt;Helped me in the distribution of cream base with ease&lt;br /&gt;Her silky hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would advise girls and all women</li>
            <li> fast shipping.It came earlier than i expected.It was a great buy for reasonable price and a great make up brush that i ever purchase.love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller than I expected, but it&#x27;s really soft and the quality is amazing! Really great to apply liquid foundation</li>
            <li> This brush is definitely well worth the hype because it does what it claims. I have never had my foundation go on more even and smooth. Another great thing about using this brush is that you use less product because of the even application. Anyone who is on the fence about buying this brush should just do it...you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> This was my first Sigma brush and well, they have a new follower! This brush doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;eat&amp;#34; my foundation or leave streaks like my other ones do. The bristles are densely packed and super soft, ensuring that a buffing motion is just that, leaving me with a natural airbrushed look. It&#x27;s really easy to clean as well and I&#x27;ll be looking at more from this brand in the future.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush because I heard so many rave reviews on youtube for it and I really needed a new foundation brush. I like the brush but only gave it 4 stars because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the greatest foundation brush ever made, but maybe I&#x27;m not using it the right way? I just bought the chrome extravaganza brush set from Sigma though, so I can&#x27;t wait to try all of their brushes :)</li>
            <li> I love this product.  The application of my makeup with this brush is beyond amazing!  Its dense and adds a clean and even finish!  In love!</li>
            <li> The bristles on this brush are really soft and dense. They feel smooth - like suede -  when you apply your foundation on in a circular motion. It&#x27;s amazing how much difference it makes! I normally use my fingers to apply my foundation. I tried foam triangles before, but they didn&#x27;t apply the makeup evenly. This leaves just the right amount of foundation on to leave you looking polished.</li>
            <li> This brush should be a part of your ideal set of makeup brush. Provides great blending and coverage. I would highly recommend any of Sigma&#x27;s brushes. High quality as well!</li>
            <li> أنا مرة أخرى لأكثر! انها لا تحصل على أفضل من ذلك. سأفعل، وسوف نكون سعداء لشرائها مرة أخرى.&lt;br /&gt;هل أقول أحب هذه المجموعة الفرشاة. يا &amp;#34;حسنا أنا لا أحب هذه المجموعة الفرشاة.</li>
            <li> I love it a lot. When you pay more, you definitely get fine quality. I can&#x27;t express how good of a brush this is. And I hope it works well with you</li>
            <li> Great brush and well worth the money! Gives a smooth finish to your liquid foundation, and SOFT. I will be purchasing more brushes from Sigma in the future.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this brush.  Best foundation brush I&#x27;ve ever used.  Saves on product usage.  Feels like a professional did your makeup and is much quicker.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Love this brush. It is super soft and works well leaving your skin tone looking even and nicely blended. Nice job Sigma</li>
            <li> Excellent quality product. The bristles are soft they do not loosen or break even after a long time of use.</li>
            <li> Love this Sigma brush so far! Think I may have to purchase more Sigma brushes! I have read great reviews on this product so I am anxious to see if I like it!</li>
            <li> Love this brush as a foundation brush it is amazing.  It is full and does an amazing job at coverage. I am not a professional make up artisit but do make for proms, weddings, special occasions and this brush does am amazing job at coverage on any complexion.  Love it can&#x27;t say that enough.  It is well constructed and very full.  I have other professional brush and the quality surpasses my other brushes cant wait to get another brush.</li>
            <li> I use this brush as a foundation applicator and it gets on so smooth with out any lines and lets you use less product.</li>
            <li> This brush is truly the best I&#x27;ve ever used! it&#x27;s soft and easy to use, and if you wash it in a regular base it won&#x27;t change shape</li>
            <li> i absolutely love this brush!! i have brought so many brushes.. i even have a mac one.. but the sigma flat kabuki is so much better for my foundation.. so even on my face and makes my make up flawless</li>
            <li> The brush is super soft. A strong chemical smell but I don&#x27;t mind it, I condition my brushes before hand anyways. I saw this brush used in a makeup tutorial and I just had to have it. I put my foundation on in dabs across my face, and used tiny circular motions to blend in the makeup into my face. Super easy and much faster application than the standard foundation brushes I&#x27;ve used in the past. Not to mention the &amp;#34;flawlessness&amp;#34; of the foundation itself by using this brush. I like it, and if I could afford to have a whole set of Sigma brushes I would but if you&#x27;re gonna spend the money on a fancy brush, spend it on this one, if its the only &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; brush you have (like me), you won&#x27;t regret it. I certainly don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Good quality brush for an affordable price. I love buffing in my liquid foundations with this brush, definitely recommend purchasing if you&#x27;re in the market for an easy to use, yet effective brush.</li>
            <li> I just loved it! I waited some time to buy it and now I can tell you that was the best choice of shopping!!!!</li>
            <li> Applies my foundation flawlessly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used my fingers for liquid foundation application, but I was a makeup tutorial where the artist used this brush, so I thought I would give it a try. I buffed out my foundation until it looked airbrushed and flawless, and it seriously took no time at all compared to trying to blend in foundation with my fingers. It&#x27;s a fairly priced good quality brush I&#x27;d recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> My favorite foundation brush.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. It is so perfect for flawless foundation application. Sigma brushes are the best and totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> IN LOVE with this makeup brush! It&#x27;s so soft! This brush doesn&#x27;t absorb the makeup it just transfers all of the product to your face so that you don&#x27;t waste any. I would recommend this brush to ANYONE. It exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and I have been looking for one like this for months! It is perfect for applying my foundation with out making it look piled on  and streaky !I definitely recommend this for makeup lovers!</li>
            <li> I love this brush! I get full coverage with only a little bit of foundation and it blends everything perfectly! Well worth the 20 dollars spent on this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Kabuki brushes from Bare Minerals that have been shedding all over my face when I apply the product. In a last ditch effort, I purchased this brush. Honestly, it&#x27;s the best thing ever!!! It&#x27;s super soft and it doesn&#x27;t shed, which is why I bought it in the first place.</li>
            <li> Very good Kabuki brush. It is soft and large and it works great applying any kind of mineral foundation.</li>
            <li> Best foundation brush EVAH!</li>
            <li> This applies foundation like a dream. (I&#x27;ve only used it with liquid foundation.) It does not leave streaks, it spreads the product evenly, and the bristles are super soft. I thought Sigma was more inexpensive, so I wasn&#x27;t the biggest fan of the price (it&#x27;s not crazy high, I&#x27;m just frugal), but it&#x27;s definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Great for a air brush finish</li>
            <li> Great at first but way too much fallout! Half the bristles are gone</li>
            <li> Love this brush. I have been using it with the bare minerals foundation and it does a fantastic job applying it. Before I got this brush I was going to take the foundation back but now im a fan.</li>
            <li> i use this every day for applying my foundation it works so well! its very smooth on my skin and doesn&#x27;t absorb too much product.</li>
            <li> Thank sigma brush does wonders, it makes my makeup look flawless I love it I plan on order som more brushes from you by sigma I must tell my friends ❤️❤️😃😃</li>
            <li> When I used this I could hear a chorus singing hallelujah because it is literally that incredible. If you don&#x27;t have this and you have uneven skin color or texture, or both (like me), then you NEED this brush. Most big time makeup artists on youtube have this reaction as well (see video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;jltoL58UlE8).</li>
            <li> I bought several sigma brushes and they are not worth the money. The handle became loose after a few uses. The brush absorbs too much foundation and little is actually left to apply on the skin. Their customer service is horrible. They state that shipping is free over a certain amount and then they make you pay extra to pick up your package by telling you the fees are duties and taxes which they are not after checking with the shipping company. I prefer Real Techniques, good quality and less expensive.</li>
            <li> I love this brush and I love all my sigma brushes I own! this is my favorite tool to apply my foundation with it just always looks airbrushed which is what I want, the only downside in this is that a couple brissles were all bent and stuff which was upsetting cuz this is a pricey product but other than that love this and would buy again.</li>
            <li> LOVE it, awesome brush, great price, very nice quality!</li>
            <li> Great service and product</li>
            <li> The kabuki Sigma F89 does a great job in spreading foundation evenly on your face.  It&#x27;s smooth and soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this brush! Heard so many great things about this from different makeup gurus on YouTube, totally worth it. Spreads the foundation very smoothly and evenly and doesn&#x27;t absorb any product. Love sigma!</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friends as a going away present since she said she had needed a foundation brush. She later wrote me and said that she loved it and it blended like a dream. Since she knows about all things related to makeup, I knew she meant it and so that made up for the price (which is a little pricey). I&#x27;m now planning on getting one for myself, therefore I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone looking for this type of brush!</li>
            <li> Great item! Applies make up even and smooth. Believe the hype!</li>
            <li> Awesome make up brush. I use it to apply my foundation, probably will stick with this every time.</li>
            <li> This is a must have!!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality brush for applying foundation leaving an airbrush effect</li>
            <li> Great brush. A staple in my makeup routine. A little hard to clean but I use it daily.</li>
            <li> Seamless foundation everytime. Helps to make any foundation have better coverage. You use less product because it blends so well.</li>
            <li> This brush was a complete disappointment.  Do not purchase. I bought two of these brushes and one was fine and the other one arrived flawed.  The flawed one arrived with uneven bristles that i assumed would be fine if I trimmed them because it didnt bother me.  Unfortunately, I was completely wrong.  The shedding was minor at first on my face.  As time goes by, the bristles sheds more than my own hair and sheds in lumps.  I couldn&#x27;t have bought an off brand for the price and it withheld just fine.</li>
            <li> Used to apply contouring palette and worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS BRUSH ! Very professional and I use it in all of my make up tutorials.</li>
            <li> niceeeee! love this brush so much so soft and dense!!!</li>
            <li> The brush is very soft.  The brush works nicely applying products and foundation.  I am definitely happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This is really what I was looking for!  The material is perfect to pass my base makeup and is so soft! I recommended this brush!</li>
            <li> I ordered the this brush and its the best foundation brush I have ever used! It is sooo soft, but your foundation does not get lost in the brush. I will definitely buy more Sigma Brushes!!</li>

            <li> I just got mine in the mail and was very excited to use it. I just want to first say when I apply my foundation I just use my fingers cause I though using brushes was just a waste of money. But then I wasn&#x27;t really satisfied with how my make up look on my face. My face has mild acne, dark circles and scars on it. :( So as many of you probably have done, I watched youtube videos of make up tutorials and many of the girls used a buffer brush and their skin looked flawless. I decided to splurge and bought a brush. I usually just buy drugstore foundation cause I am a broke college student and can&#x27;t afford a $60 cover up. While applying, I didn&#x27;t have to use much of the foundation, which mean my foundation will last longer so I don&#x27;t have to keep buying.  The application was soft but firm. This brush help cover all of my imperfections and give a nice even coverage!! It only took two days to ship. The packaging was cute because you get a nice sheer bag, instructions on how to clean the brush and a free gift. I am really glad I bought this product and you will be too!</li>
            <li> I have long been on the quest for the perfect liquid foundation brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To provide a little bit of my foundation brush history:&lt;br /&gt;I went through a phase where I religiously used the MAC 190, but I always felt it left my face streaky. Not to mention the 190 application can be a bit arduous and meticulous. Eventually, I tried the stippling craze, and I attempted to use the MAC 187, but the fibers just weren&#x27;t dense enough. It&#x27;s great for light application of powders, but for any sort of MATTE look, the 187 is not a good choice. Next, I found surprising success with the ELF studio powder brush, which, for three dollars was impressive. But, the ELF brush shed like crazy (handfuls of taklon fibers fell out-- it was gross).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT FINALLY, I found my holy grail, liquid foundation brush in the Sigma F80 flat top kabuki. It is everything i ever wanted in a foundation brush -- good quality (not flimsy or loose handle like the ELF powder brush), it has dense synthetic fibers, and most importantly, it applies all of my liquid foundations like a dream (MAC studiofix, Revlon Colorstay-- you name it). I am a fan of a matte, full coverage finish, which is why the F80 really appealed to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this brush by stippling the foundation (as you would a MAC 187) all over my face, and then swirling and buffing it in. The dense fibers never leave a streaky finish. 100% recommended. I am eager to try the other sigma kabukis now!</li>
            <li> First let me just say this, once you have used the Sigma F80 you will never want to use anything else to put your foundation on. The brush gives you an air brushed look and you hardley have to use any foundation.Love Love Love this brush!!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best foundation brush ever, it really gives you a flawless look and it&#x27;s super soft.</li>
            <li> This is the best foundation brush ever! I had been using standard foundation brushes and another duo fibre brush from another company but this brush tops them all! So easy to blend out for a beautiful smooth look. This brush is a  must!</li>
            <li> I just recieved this today and I LOVE how it applys my liquid foundation. I would buy this brush over and over again if I had to. I really recommend this brush to anyone looking for a brush to apply their foundation. It applies flawlessly :)</li>
            <li> Absolutely love my new Sigma Kabuki brush. Its amazing for applying foundation and super cheap. The brush is so soft and feels great on your skin. I would never use another brush after using this one!</li>
            <li> I love this brush! Blends the product in with no brush streaks, and makes it very easy to apply the product. Love~</li>
            <li> The Sigma F80 is amazing.....flawless liquid foundation application using this brush.  I like it so much that I ordered two more....one for my makeup travel bag and one for my daughter.</li>
            <li> I am not on the bandwagon with this brush. It was just too dense for my skin causing a unnatural foundation finish on me. However, It did apply quickly without streaks. If you want a heavier/ full coverage foundation brush this is for you. I prefer a more natural &amp; airbrush look.</li>
            <li> The brush I received was not authentic. This was obvious from the packaging and the logo on the brush. I should have returned it but figured I would give it a shot. After 1 week&#x27;s use the handle became unglued from the metal part of the brush. Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> Gives an airbrushed,full coverage look with little foundation. I have washed it a few times already with little shedding, but I&#x27;ve only had it for less than a month. So far I&#x27;m extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li> The sigma brushes are ALL very soft, hardly ever shed. This one in perticular is great for my foundation. Makes it alot easier to apply. Just wish it was a little bigger.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I have soooo many sephora brushes for foundation and none of them do me justice. This one is a must have if you love a flawless face . I usually pat it down for more coverage . Love it !! And I should mention that it is real!</li>
            <li> Could not ask for a better brush to apply foundation with! Amazing!</li>
            <li> I just received my brush today.  I had heard they are comparable if not better than my Mac brushes.  I am thinking they brush is a knock off.  It does not have the USA marked on the brush and I haven&#x27;t even used it yet and the bristles are coming out!  Thinking of returning and paying the couple extra bucks to know it is authentic from Sigma directly.</li>
            <li> Best foundation brush! Sooo soft! Ive had it for over a month and so far hairs aren&#x27;t falling off. I love how well it blends my foundation.</li>
            <li> I love Signma brushes, but i don&#x27;t know what it was, but this one kept shedding. I dont know if it was knock off brand or faulty ones, but im very disappointed with this order</li>
            <li> No matter which combinations or types of foundation I use - powder or liquid - it effortlessly blends to a beautiful finish. Love this brush!!!</li>
            <li> Its like a magic brush ... Loved it :)</li>
            <li> I know many people love it and maybe I got a bad one, but the dip came off after the third brush cleaning using the brush cleaner from Bobbi Brown. I use that cleaner on all my brushes and that has never happened. This was my first Sigma brush and it&#x27;s likely going to be my last.</li>
            <li> Love this brush!  I had previously purchased the &amp;#34;Sephora&amp;#34; version of this brush, and all it did from the first day was shed...everywhere and constantly.  I had never used Sigma brushes before, and was equally concerned about this one, but since I&#x27;ve had it, it&#x27;s hardly shed at all.  Love the coverage it provides with my liquid foundation, and will definitely be buying more Sigma brushes!</li>
            <li> This brush broke while using it! The bristles came unglued and fell out during application after owning it less than 3 months. The brush did a great job, but breaking like that is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Well this is the second time I ordered this same brush because I thought the 1st one was fake bacause it had SMDH1402 under Patent Pending on the brush but this time I order from the Sigma company on Amazon and it still has the SMDH1407 underPatent Pending on the brush, so I guess my brushes aren&#x27;t fake but now I&#x27;m out of 24 dollars so idk how many stars to give the brush. I guess the brush is ok idk..I need to order the beauty blender next and see if that will be my staple...but other then that the brush is ok..</li>
            <li> After reading the positive reviews on Amazon, I decided to try this for myself. I&#x27;m glad I listened to the over 400+ reviews&lt;br /&gt;of nothing but praise! This foundation really gives great coverage and for just a short amount of swipes around the face.&lt;br /&gt;I really didn&#x27;t have to use much wrist movement to glide the brush back and forth to create that airbrushed look.</li>
            <li> I like my sigma kabuki brush. It is good quality, and it was shipped fast. I would buy again in the future from sigma.</li>
            <li> Ok I purchased this brush with high hope&#x27;s. After using the brush twice the handle started to come loose by the third use the handle came off. I was highly upset, and it looks like this was a fake because the way the glue was on the handle. I honestly wish I wouldve just gone to the sigma website and spent money on a brush that would last longer then a couple uses.</li>
            <li> I had this brush for about a month and I loved it! It applied my foundation wonderfully and I thought it was a great purchase! I had washed this brush many times before with no problem! The last time of washing this brush I noticed the handle becoming loose and I found that odd, so I dried it off and the handle fell off! I am so upset that I spent $15 and it broke! Not impressed at all. Do not waste your money on this. Get the real thing off Sigma.com</li>
            <li> Sent this brush as a gift and not only did it arrive super fast, but the brush itself is amazing! A must have.</li>
            <li> I love this brush for applying foundation. It makes my makeup look much less cakey than the sponges I had been using. The bristles are soft and dense and I haven&#x27;t shed a single fiber yet (I&#x27;ve owned for about 2 weeks). I will definitely go back to Sigma for more high quality brushes.</li>
            <li> This brush is AMAZING !!!! it blends the foundation beautifully♡♡♡&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a must have</li>
            <li> Great brush for my foundation. I use it every day and it makes the make up look very well blended.</li>
            <li> I use this to apply foundation, it provides flawless coverage with very little blending, and it does not cake the make up to your face.  Don&#x27;t know what I did before I got my brush!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for about 2 years now. The letters have rubbed off but the brush itself still works just as well as day one. I can&#x27;t really say I take the best care of brushes either, I try but I can be pretty lazy about it. So I&#x27;m pretty happy that this brush has held up so we&#x27;ll? If it ever gave out on me or I lost it id replace it immediately .</li>
            <li> This brush is incredible! It makes putting foundation on much easier and makes my face look flawless! Definitely recommend it and I look forward to purchasing more Sigma brushes! :)</li>
            <li> I got this when I read about it via a Make-up artists blog...I love it for applying/blending of foundations and concealers.</li>
            <li> In the past, I would only purchase MAC products (especially brushes) because that is all I knew.  But when I started using the Sigma brushes, I was more impressed.  The product was amazing, but I was also very happy with the price.  First, the Sigma Flat Top Kabuki brush is amazing as a foundation brush.  There are no streaks left behind, making my foundation look flawless.  I also really enjoyed the Sigma Eyes Kit because it has all of the brushes needed for shadows.  The bristles are soft, so they don&#x27;t scratch the eyelid and it also makes it easier to blend eyeshadow colors.  The brushes feel expensive and they don&#x27;t shed like other types I have tried.  I also like the fact that they don&#x27;t have any dyes that come off on your face.  I would buy these brushes again.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting this brush forever.  It costs more on Sigma&#x27;s website because you have to pay shipping so I decided to purchase it here and it works amazing.  I&#x27;ve never used a foundation brush..this is my first and it makes my face look almost flawless.  It works the foundation into the skin really well.  I&#x27;ve used it for two months so far and it hasn&#x27;t lost any hairs and is still holding up well.  It is definitly worth 15 bucks.</li>
            <li> This brush blends even the crummiest foundation perfectly. Foundation is never streaky, but perfectly buffed in, every time.  Love it.</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with Sigma. These brushes are awesome. I love my sigma brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy these brushes always.</li>
            <li> I love the Sigma brushes. I&#x27;ve used MAC for years. I purchased the Sigma after reading reviews online and I&#x27;ll never buy a MAC brush again! They cost less and are better quality!</li>
            <li> lo que yo esperaba y me funciona sigma es lo mejor, y llego a tiempo, y escuchado tanto acerca de este producto que supero mis espectativas, viva sigma</li>
            <li> This brush is perfect for applying foundation! Soft, nice and professional brush!</li>
            <li> Ahhhh... The sigma F80 is amazing! It puts my foundation amazingly :)</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase from Sigma, let me tell you...you won&#x27;t regret it. I had a MAC 187 dual fiber stiple brush for a little over a year...an man that thing fell apart within months, but I kept it around with hopes of finding a better brush. Then when it was completely damaged I read reviews about the Sigma Flat Top Kabuki...took a shot...and I have no regrets...its the best one I own...I use it to apply my liquid and powder foundations...very sturdy and well made!!</li>
            <li> Applies Smooth makeup.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this brush from Amazon, I got it from Sigma. And I can say I like it alot. It does allow for complete coverage of foundation and blending out of concealer. I use this and Makeup Forever&#x27;s foundation Flat foundation blush.</li>
            <li> dense and soft. Really great brush.</li>
            <li> My favorite new brush</li>
            <li> I read about these online and loved mine so got two more for gifts.</li>
            <li> My wife loves hit brushes.</li>
            <li> Ahhh. I&#x27;ve wanted this brush for years and finally took the plunge. I love love love it! The only way I&#x27;ll put my makeup on is with this beauty. Can&#x27;t wait to buy more sigma brushes in the future. Great price, packaging, &amp; shipping time!</li>
            <li> I got this to test it as a substitute to Shishedo&#x27;s foundation brush, which I thought to be the best.  This is better: it doesn&#x27;t suck up the product and applies foundation evenly and with an airbrush like effect.  It&#x27;s on the larger size, more the size of a blush brush, but I find the bristles are flexible enough to get reach all the areas of my face.  No shedding so far, either.</li>
            <li> I love it!!! Best brush ever!!! It def lives up to all the hype. The only downside is that my wrist does tend to get a bit sore from using the brush. But I can live with that since my face looks FLAWLESS thanks to this brush! FAB-U-LOUS!!!</li>
            <li> I just ordered this and got it like 4 days later!!! It&#x27;s the softest brush I&#x27;ve ever bought!!! I can&#x27;t wait to try it out!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush because I had purchased four other brands, and was dissatisfied with their performance. I had stared to think maybe ether all powder brushes are the same, or my technique needs improving. Ether way I was very unhappy with previous four powder brushes. I&#x27;m not a quitter, (lol)  Took a chance and order the Sigma F80 flat kabuki a few days later the brush came. Once I tried it, I fell in LOVE! it is so soft and smooth, and produce such a nice finish. I feel in love instantly, so I immediately got back on amazon, and ordered the angled Sigma kabuki brush for the us of blush and contouring. I love that one just as much. I&#x27;m in love! Thank you SIGMA!  I&#x27;ve found my brush for life. I wish I would have tried sigma sooner.</li>
            <li> Great foundation brush! Sorry I waited so long to purchase. My foundation goes on very well, best brush I have ever used!</li>
            <li> I love this brush for liquid foundation.  I watched a video of a make-up artist who suggested using this brush for applying liquid foundation.  She was right!  This is the best brush I have found for the job.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I bought this brush. This is my second Sigma purchase after the Rounded Kabuki brush which I bought for my creme blushes. It blends foundation beautifully into the skin and leaves a beautiful finish. The brush itself is a work of art. The bristles are soft and most importantly generously thick and sturdy. It is an excellent quality brush for a reasonable price, I have yet to see a comparable brush to it in stores.</li>
            <li> LOVE this brush! I use it to apply my foundation, and it goes on perfectly!</li>
            <li> Holy grail foundation brush. LOVE.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush thru the actual Sigma site, and I LOVE it. I walked into work and got asked if I was wearing a new foundation it literally looked like I had flawless skin all thanks to this brush.. I would highly recommend it. I used to use the flat foundation brush from Clinique, I mean that brush wasnt bad but the F80 just rocked. (I use liquid foundation; even better from Clinique)</li>
            <li> According to my wife, best foundation brush ever. Be sure to clean it on a weekly basis. She uses Clinique brush cleaner.</li>
            <li> I had a gift card and have been wanting to place a sigma order. This brush is perfect for foundation application. It&#x27;s soft on the face and doesn&#x27;t allow for cakey buildup. New favorite foundation blush. I also use it to pat in concealer for blemishes and under eye highlight ;)  brush came on time and packaged well.</li>
            <li> I selected this brush after watching a YouTube video by a girl who does flawless coverage videos. The brush was available by Sigma on Amazon and it came very quickly, within three days! Very happy with the brush, better to use a brush on the face than using fingers so this brush is a charm. It is so soft and leaves my face looking airbrushed. I use it with the Dr. Jarts BB cream and my face looks fantastic. Will be purchasing Sigma brushes form now on, amazed.</li>
            <li> This brush is so awesome! It met all of my expectations I had for it! It is the best thing I have found to put on foundation with.</li>
            <li> I really like the smooth finish this brush gives me when using with foundation.  I&#x27;ve cleaned it without issue and it continues to perform as expected.</li>
            <li> I was recommended this brush by a beauty blogger and I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with it! It has synthetic fibers, so it won&#x27;t eat up your foundation like natural haired brushes will. The bristles are packed in tightly so the foundation brushes on where you want it to. A+!!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever used a brush for applying foundation but I thought it worked really well, bristles did not fall out and get stuck in the foundation, loved it</li>
            <li> Perfect application tool. Blends my make up well and doesn&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> Just purchased this about 2 weeks ago and I&#x27;m in love!!!! My current foundation brush. Gives my foundation a flawless full coverage, not making you look too cakey! I absolutely love this brush. Love the soft fibers and I love the way it just glides on my skin so swiftly. Price is absolutely affordable and way cheaper than what you find on ebay and by any other carries of these sigma brushes! This has become my new must have in my makeup/foundation routine! Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> I love this brush! I use it everyday and it has held up!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t shed...until it shed. Loved it to death for two years. Nicest flat foundation brush I had tried and seemed very high quality...until a few weeks ago, when it began to shed. At this point Kat Von D&#x27;s cat has more fur. I&#x27;ve never had a brush start shedding like this (I&#x27;ve still have Mac and Laura Mercier brushes I bought in the mid-90&#x27;s that are still going strong!). Sadly, there are better brushes out there for not much more money (even the Dior)...that will last decades.</li>
            <li> The brush works really well but all Sigma brushes are made in America. When I received this brush in the mail it had a sticker over made in America, that said made in China... hmmm?</li>
            <li> I always used sponges with my liquid foundation until I saw a &amp;#34;How To&amp;#34; make-up video.&lt;br /&gt;The girl in the video recommended using a Kabuki brush and I can see why. Ever since making the switch, I get compliments all the time on how flawless my skin looks. It makes it light with good coverage, which is also a huge plus.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing for blending out foundation flawlessly. I use it everyday single day and it just works like you want it to. The synthetic bristles don&#x27;t take any product away so you use less foundation and get a smooth, full coverage application.</li>
            <li> I gave this brush to my daughter for Christmas. She has thanked me more than once for it. The brush is sturdy and well-built. The bristles on the brush are soft. When you are putting on foundation, this brush gives you an &amp;#34;air-brushed&amp;#34; look. It makes your foundation look 10 times better. My daughter loves it. She wants to get one for her sister now.</li>
            <li> This is the best foundation brush ever!!! If you&#x27;re looking for the best foundation brush, look no further. Sigma u did that!!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for the perfect application of your liquid or cream foundation, you need this brush!! It buffs product into your skin seamlessly and gives a very natural result. All the beauty gurus on YouTube recommended this brush, and now I know why. Applying my foundation is no longer a hassle, very impressed.</li>
            <li> that one made applying foundation cream much easier. it gives the face smooth look. i use it everyday for the foundation and for my BB cream.</li>
            <li> The only thing that threw me off about this brush is the fact that there was a Made in China sticker covering the Made in USA stamp on the brush. I still am not sure that this brush is legit. If I do order any more brushes i&#x27;ll just order them from the Sigma website with a coupon code. Also, i&#x27;ve been using the brush with a whipped foundation and as soon as i put some foundation on the brush it seems like it sucks it all up and I get barely any on my face. Not sure if it is the brush or foundation, but so far i&#x27;m only somewhat satisfied.</li>
            <li> This brush is the best brush that I have found for foundation application. I have used expensive MAC brushes and this one just gives you a perfect finish, every time. I use it with a full coverage liquid foundation, dab it around and then go in circles to finish it off and it always looks great. HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li> It is great. That&#x27;s what my wife said. I was trying to rate a fuel pressure regulator and I clicked this items stars.  Now I can&#x27;t back out. She loves these things.</li>
            <li> Rec&#x27;d this brush super quick and as described from Etailz. It&#x27;s a genuine sigma brush. It applies foundation flawlesslesy. Your skin looks airbrushed. Will probably buy a second one as a back up when I&#x27;m washing my brushes.</li>
            <li> This well made flat topped brush ensures even foundation coverage!!! It also uses less make up than sponges and maintains its shape perfectly!It&#x27;s a great buy!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I use this all the time.Great brush for everyday use.Cleans well. I keep clean after ever use with makeup clothes then spray it good with a gentle cleaner once a week.Does not shed!</li>
            <li> This is my very first Sigma brush and I LOVE IT and am so impressed that I ordered the entire set of precision brushes. I am a professional MUA and I use this to apply primer and foundation. It presses the product into the skin rather than absorbing product into the brush. My foundation looks amazing and I am now hooked on Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> this brush blends well, no stray bristles, was unfamiliar with the brand as all my other brushes are MAC,am delighted that it is so well made. I will update if anything changes</li>
            <li> I love this brush I first heard about it on YouTube and saw tons and I mean TONS of people talking about it. I had another brush that was ok but decided to give this one a try and BOY am I glad I did. This brush applies my foundation flawlessly, it so easy and quick you never have to worry about streaks or the brush absobing all of your product. I have had little to no fall out on this brush and it is by far the softest brush I have ever put on my face. Once you use this it&#x27;s easy to tell that this brush was beautifully made, unfortunately now I want all the sigma brushes and I want to drive 7-8 hours to the Mall of America so I can visit the store *sigh*</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she seems to like it.  I may update this review if anything happens, but so far she is happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing blending brush for foundation! I usually quickly smooth my foundation on with my fingers  then go back with this brush and dab it to blend. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> For applying liquid foundation, I&#x27;ve always either used my fingers or a simple foundation brush.  Never quite happy with the way my skin looked with those application methods, I was looking for something better.  Several members in my favorite make-up forum raved about this brush and assured me I would have zero complaints.  Knowing what works for one doesn&#x27;t always work for another, I was skeptical but purchased this brush anyway.  I am so glad I did!  My foundation looks incredible after application.  It is so easy to buff and blend into my skin.  As a bonus, I use less product.  To date, I have experienced no issues with the brush shedding.  Cleaning is a breeze.  I am looking into the Sigma line for replacements of my other brushes.  I definitely would recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> i think the brush works great.  I am getting a little worried because the brush is starting to shed pretty badly already not sure yet if good for long term use. i&#x27;ve only had it for maybe six weeks so thats a little scary for a pricey brush.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite foundation brush... it blends very well.  It&#x27;s definitely a must try brush. I also use it for blending out when contouring my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought several different brushes from this line and I honestly like them better than my MAC brushes! I plan to buy more!</li>
            <li> I purchased mine from the Sigma website, I&#x27;ve seen tons of youtube beauty guru&#x27;s raving about this brand of brushes, and this one in particular to apply liquid foundations. It&#x27;s just alright. Though the quality of the brush is great, it&#x27;s very soft, etc; it does not apply products very well. My face looks very unnatural and I&#x27;m left with tons of streaks after using this to apply my liquid foundations. It looks awful no matter how much I try to buff it in! Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I tried the sigma beauty line brushes and I love it. I will get the complete set of brushes thanks again</li>
            <li> Authentic, and awesome for blending liquid foundation. Great brush.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful brush. I have more mature skin and it pushes the product into the skin so it doesn&#x27;t sit on the surface further accentuating fine lines. It works great with bb creams, liquid foundation and creme foundations. I LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> I bought this after seeing a youtube beauty blogger use it online. Its really great for applying foundation and the brush is really great quality.</li>
            <li> It blends every type of foundation flawlessly. I don&#x27;t know how I lived life without it. There was a little shedding when I washed it the first time but nothing too bad. It holds up to some of the higher end brushes I have.</li>
            <li> This brush is my holy grail! I am in love. I am a major makeup fanatic. As someone that knows a lot about makeup products, this is BY FAR the best brush for liquid foundation. It is so easy to apply and makes your skin look flawless. I have had it almost a year now. However, someone that didn&#x27;t know what they were doing washed my brush, and now it has been shedding all over my face. But if you take care of it, I have found absolutely no problems with this brush!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok I feel like others similar are better</li>
            <li> Came apart after washing...</li>
            <li> My favorite foundation brush I love it!</li>
            <li> I use this everyday to apply my foundation!  Previously, I used a flat foundation brush, but read about this one online.  I have been using it for a few years now and it is still in great shape!</li>
            <li> This brush is very soft with really dense bristles, I expected it to be bigger but it blends really nicely</li>
            <li> So glad I finally bought a Sigma brush! It works soooooo well and the bristles don&#x27;t come out.</li>
            <li> Bought it used it for 2 months washed it twice and the whole brush fell apart LITERALLY, overpriced for the quality</li>
            <li> Everything I expected from this brush and more. It just give you the most flawless foundation application I have ever had with a makeup brush. I was seriously so impressed and in love this is my holy grail brush for foundation application.</li>
            <li> The brushes handle is just right. Not too long to hold on to. Bristles are soft yet firm enough for a professional finish.</li>
            <li> This brush is my first sigma brush I purchased. I love this brush.  It was what I was looking for.  The bristles are dense but very soft.  Makes my foundation go on effortlessly.  I will be using this brush for a long time.  Makes me look forward to purchasing other brushes from Sigma.  I really want the Mrs. Bunny essential or travel brushes.  I can&#x27;t wait.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this brush got it last year for christmas and used it everyday til this day blends foundation beautifully. Packaged nicely. Look on YouTube of how to use and keeping it clean and in good condition.</li>
            <li> Its broke the top completely came off. Never purchased again.</li>
            <li> This brush is absolutely amazing. My foundation is applied 100 times better now than before. I am not an expert in makeup, and even I can use this brush effortlessly. Always get compliments on my skin when I use this brush. Not all brushes from Sigma are that good though...I order this one and the blush brush (F10 I think?) and that one doesn&#x27;t work as well as this. So I end up using this one brush for my foundation, blush AND concealer! I&#x27;ve recommended it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> HANDS DOWN THE BEST BRUSH EVER !!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This brush is AMAZING! When applying liquid foundation, this brush gives the most perfect and airbrushed finished. No streakiness, no patches, no unevenness. I bought the F50 sigma brush and was initially very impressed with how it applied liquid foundation, and when I received this brush I was even more impressed (if that&#x27;s even possible). This brush is magic. You don&#x27;t even have to use that much product too, the bristles somehow just distribute it all over the skin without half of it getting wasted in the brush. I have never owned a brush this great, it seriously has changed my makeup game forever. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This brush is one of my faves and i am a makeup brush addict i have tried everything from real techniques to mac pro brushes and i have to say THIS IS DEFINITELY MY FAVORITE BRUSH !! 5 Stars</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful made and it blends like a dream. I&#x27;ve bought 2--one for me and one I gave to my sister.</li>
            <li> This brush feels incredibly soft on the skin, blends foundation beautifully, and does a good job getting around tough places (e.g., the nose).  I have used it mainly with Lancome Teint Idole foundation and the Tarte Amazonian Clay foundation. Here are my thoughts compared to a few other brushes in my collection:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Real Techniques Buffing Brush:  The Sigma F80 is better for foundation.  I do like the buffing brush with BB creams, but if I want to wear a foundation that is tougher to blend, the F80 is superior.  I have fewer streaking issues with the F80 and I feel that I get a fuller coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tarte Foundation Brush:  This brush leaves a beautiful finish for the Tarte Amazonian Clay Foundation BUT it is not great for getting into crevices and smaller spaces.  The F80 is a lot better.  It blends flawlessly all over the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Real Techniques Expert Face Brush:  This brush is good for BB creams and tinted moisturizers but it is really prone to streaking.  The F80 is definitely worth the extra cash compared to the Real Techniques brush for tougher to blend foundations like Estee Lauder Double Wear or Tarte Amazonian Clay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is fairly easy to wash, though the Tarte Amazonian Clay is a bear to clean if I don&#x27;t wash it right away (an issue with that foundation for ALL brushes).</li>
            <li> totally worth the buy! I&#x27;ve always just used my beauty blender but this totally takes the cake</li>
            <li> I love this brush for applying foundation.  I have stopped using my flat foundation brush for full face and only use it for light BB cream application.  This Kabuki gives great coverage and a smoother look.</li>
            <li> I ordered from the supposedly &amp;#34;authorized seller&amp;#34; Etailz. It came in a plastic bag and a sticker on it saying &amp;#34;Made in China.&amp;#34; The brush is even STAMPED with a Made in China mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not gonna bother trying it out. Now I have to go through the trouble to RETURN and re-order from the SigmaBeauty website. I confronted the seller and want to wait to see what she says before I ship it off. Will update.</li>
            <li> Best brushes, love Sigma products because they keep their shape!</li>
            <li> Save your money and buy directly from the retailers. That&#x27;s the only way you&#x27;ll know you&#x27;re buying an authentic product.</li>
            <li> This brush leaves my foundation flawless. I love it! I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a real sigma brush though. I use it to blend my contouring also. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with bristles falling out after cleaning. I guess we will see how it holds up!</li>
            <li> I love it to blend my foundation</li>
            <li> I bought this brush because of all the YouTube recommendations. I use Revlon Colorstay liquid foundation. I use this brush to apply and to buff out the product with light circular motions. To me, it leaves the face streaky because of the coarseness of the bristles. You have to keep working it, and by doing that, the coverage of the foundation diminishes. These brushes hold the products too I think. They do not come clean completely. I will have to try to find a different cleaner I guess.  While this one isn&#x27;t as fragile, as a whole the Sigma brushes are prone to lose their shape after cleaning them.  You have to be very careful with them or they get a little wild.</li>
            <li> I love this brush!! It&#x27;s perfect for applying foundation it&#x27;s just amazing!!!</li>
            <li> Really like this brush and you cannot beat the price. Quick delivery!</li>
            <li> This is fake! I just got it today, and the hair is falling off! And it says &amp;#34;made in China&amp;#34; so disappointed...</li>
            <li> This is a great foundation brush, but mine was dented and damaged. I question the authenticity and I&#x27;ll only be purchasing Sigma on the actual Sigma website.</li>
            <li> I decided to treat myself and get a fancy brush. Various people on YouTube have talked about sigma brushes and I decided to try out one instead of getting a set. It arrived quickly and it was so soft! I LOVED it. I washed it making sure the keep the water running down so I don&#x27;t loosen the handle from the bush head and let it dry overnight. I applied my makeup and it was beautiful. I cleaned it with a makeup brush spray wiped it on a paper towel and put it away. Two days later I was going out for a date night with my fiance and mid stroke..BAM!...the brush head snapped off and fell in my sink. I was devastated! I tried to push it back on to no avail. I had to use a different brush to finish my makeup. I was so disappointed. I spent easily $20 on a brush for it to break after using it once. Will not purchase another sigma brush! Some people seem to enjoy their brushes, maybe I received a bad one I don&#x27;t know but I will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> A must for makeup lovers. Go to retailmenot for a discount code and you a get a free eyeliner brush with this purchase from the sigma website. It does not shed and I&#x27;ve had this brush for 8months.</li>
            <li> After practicing with this brush, I was able to achieve a flawless application of my foundation.  The brush does an excellent job of blending the foundation along the jaw line and applies thin layers to prevent lines forming later in the day under the eyes or at the crows feet.  Brush is easy to clean.  I use this daily to ensure a beautiful finish!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brush to use to apply powder foundation.  I use my beauty blender sponge to apply my liquid foundation and then use this brush to apply my powder foundation lightly over top.  I get a perfectly flawless look!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m bringing this down to 4 stars only because after a few months the bristles start to fall out. Originally this brush had such a smooth application, but now I get a bristle or two each time I apply my foundation on. It doesn&#x27;t effect how my make up goes on so I&#x27;m not really that upset about it</li>
            <li> Fast shipping....Great quality. Not too soft or too hard. Perfect balance :)  Wasnt familiar with the brand. will purchase again.</li>
            <li> 4 stars because I have acne prone skin which means I have sensitive skin, and this brush is a little to dense for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;When I do use it, I am extra careful.</li>
            <li> Ordered this brush for a new foundation I bought at Sephora, works great!!! Sccastaneda (on youtube) raved about it so I deceided to try it, well worth the money!! Shipping was fast, product received was new.</li>
            <li> Love the sigma brush  love love love and it came in pretty quick.. Excellent service and its at a good price.</li>
            <li> I have tried the Mac 187 brush but I wasn&#x27;t really satisfied with the results since I have a sensitive skin and the brush bristles wasn&#x27;t that soft on my skin. So I decided to give the flat kabuki from sigma a try and actually the results were AMAZING. I&#x27;ll definitley recommend this brush to all of my friends and for sure they are going to replace thier brushes for the amazing brand Sigma.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush because it was highly recommended as a great brush to apply foundation.  I currently use a Real Techniques buffing brush for foundation application.  I tried this brush and it does a good job on foundation application but is not as smooth or as easy to use as my current buffing brush.  This is a lovely brush and is well made.  It hasn&#x27;t shaded or lost its shape after continued use and washings.  I will continue to experiment with other uses for this brush.</li>
            <li> This review is for the Sigma Beauty Flat Top Synthetic Kabuki - F80 makeup brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this brush several months ago and it&#x27;s made a convert out of me. Sigma is now my go-to company for new makeup brushes. This brush has a pleasant weight and feel to it which makes it very comfortable to use when applying full face makeup. I&#x27;ve used this to apply mineral powder foundation with very good results. The brush picks up enough product for coverage and not so much that you&#x27;re wasting a lot of product. It applies the powder foundation very evenly and I&#x27;ve found that I can quickly build coverage in spots that need a little extra foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning the brush has been very easy, just a little liquid soap and water to rinse out any built up product. Shedding is so minimal it seems like it doesn&#x27;t shed. I have used several other manufacturers brushes before, Benefit, Sephora, Bare Minerals, and Sigma puts them all to shame (especially the bare minerals buki brushes which shed at an obnoxious rate). The bristles have remained soft and have not clumped throughout my use of the brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing. I have Mac brushes, elf, and a few other brands but this is by far the best. I will be ordering the full set soon.</li>
            <li> This brush is literally amazing.  I just got it this week to use for contouring with my matte Urban Decay bronzer.  I was planning on getting the urban Decay Good Karma brush but it just doesn&#x27;t have the following and amazing praise that this one does!  Helloooo people - there are TEN TIMES as many 5-star reviews as 4 or 3 star ones even!  Its a fantastic brush, beautiful quality at an unbeatable price.  I was much more impressed with this brush than all the other ones I looked at and tested out in Sephora, and it is pretty much two-thirds of the price of those brushes!  It is perfect for bronzer contouring, and I also have used it for blush and highlighter with the same amazing results.  It blends perfectly and sweeps just the right amount across the face.  Really a fantastic, quality product.</li>
            <li> I heard so many great reviews about this product from youtube. I used the regular drug store foundation brushes and although there was nothing wrong with using the drug store foundation brushes, I took it upon myself to see if this product was really as good as people claim it to be. The top part of the brush is very soft and goes on very gentle on your skin. The product is really great, it just gives a more natural look. However I still think my foundation brush from the drug store just does the same exact thing.</li>
            <li> They are in good condition after 2 years of everyday wear.  They are very soft, making makeup application smooth.  The only thing I hate is washing it because they take long to dry.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I use it to blend in oily looking foundations and it also works very well with cream blushes. It is very dence and sturdt yet soft at the same time.</li>
            <li> I had bought sigma brushes before and I thought this would be a good brush, but when I got it, it was hard to take the plastic off plus I realize it was fake because with the Sigma Brushes I bought in the real website this brush that I bought had been painted shiny while the real brushes weren&#x27;t painted like that and didn&#x27;t have that smell. Next time I&#x27;ll just buy from the real website.</li>
            <li> The brush works like a dream when applying foundation! But while I was using the brush, the handle was loose then decided to come off! I am not happy about the construction of this brush. Is this an authentic Sigma Brush or not?</li>
            <li> Just purchased this brush. It is so light weight but applies foundation smoothly. The only thing I am worried about is how it will work once I clean it. Delivery also took 3 weeks so that was a bit annoying but overall worth the wait!</li>
            <li> The hair on the brush is very soft. I like the density of the brush hair.  The brush really makes a difference  in how your makeup looks! I will buy more.</li>
            <li> It does wonders with liquid foundation but recently I switched to creams and started using Bobbi brown stick foundation. Working with cream foundation with this brush is hard</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard awesome things about this brush, so I decided to get it.  It&#x27;s exactly what everyone says.  It&#x27;s that good! My foundation goes on flawlessly.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter and she loves it.  She uses it everyday and she said &amp;#34;perfection&amp;#34;.  Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> This sigma is one of the best brush I have every try,I love this very very much i will order more went I get some money.</li>
            <li> I use this brush to apply my liquid foundation. And it honestly gives you a flawless application -- no streaks at all. it buffs beautifully into the skin. I get so many more compliments on how smooth my skin looks and it definitely because of the brush. My next purchase will be the Essential Brush Kit which contains all the other brushes I want as well :)</li>
            <li> This is a very dense brush, applies my liquid foundation amazingly. Would definitely buy another one as a spare when this one is dirty.</li>
            <li> Never have I used a product that has made my skin look as flawless as this one does. It is amazing!</li>
            <li> Great, flawless application for foundation. Sheds overtime. I have this brush for 6 months I purchased here on Amazon. It came ontime and I was impressed with the make and  handle. I wash my brushes with care so I do not understand why it&#x27;s shedding so bad I have the round top version as well and I&#x27;ve had it for 8 months and no problems whatsoever. Lead me to believe it just may be this one defective brush I got</li>
            <li> I absolutly love this brush! Hope they never discontinue it! Any Sigma brush is worth the investment! Thank you, thank you!</li>
            <li> I love this brush. Never had a brush apply foundation so evenly! It&#x27;s so soft and it feels like it will last. I&#x27;ve washed it 3 or 4 times since purchased a little less than a mo ago and not one hair has fallen out. The price is also great!</li>
            <li> Amazing soft great coverage!!!! This was a very great product work every dollar. In love with this make up brush!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush. I was using the Real Techniques Sigma brush, but this brush is 100X better. It blends my foundation in flawlessly and leaves no streaks. I would definitely recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> Brush it&#x27;s self was nice, it was a accidental order and I got &amp;#34;stuck&amp;#34; with it but I&#x27;m happy I kept it  Worth the 30 dollars.</li>
            <li> awesome brush for foundation!&lt;br /&gt;All Sigma brushes are good!!</li>
            <li> All of my life I have used inexpensive brushes. Typically, my go-to&#x27;s are whatever brushes have came with products I have purchased.  After reading a ton of reviews and watching Youtube tutorials on the Sigma F80 - I decided why not give it a go.  I am very pleased to say that it was an AMAZING purchase.  It gives me a flawless finish. I have NEVER gotten as many compliments on my make-up/complexion before.  It is easy to wash (I just use shampoo and conditioner and let it dry overnight). Minimal to no shedding. Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> The brush is super soft and applies the make up BEAUTIFULLY! If your hesitant to buy the brush this is a sign so go and buy yours now!!!</li>
            <li> After having this Sigma Kabuki brush for about 6 months, one day the entire brush head fell off of the handle</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing. It is my first sigma brush and I love it. I own a collection of brushes and I like all of them but I needed one that could apply liquid and possibly my Bare minerals foundation. This brush is great for buffing. It is soft but still has hold. No fallout yet which is awesome as I have used it a lot and with cheap brushes it would all ready be bad. I highly recommend his brush and will be buying all my brushes from this brand in the future!</li>
            <li> Have purchased several Sigma brushes; very high quality and work wonderfully in applying liquid makeup.  Would never consider another brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally in love with this.It came within the suggested time and in good condition as well. What more can I ask for. Now my make up looks FLAWLESS!</li>
            <li> Purchased this brush directly from Sigma several months ago and absolutely loved it so when I received an amazon gift certificate I decided to get another one.  I&#x27;m not sure however if this is authentic  Sigma.  The bristles do not feel as soft as the ones I ordered directly from the Sigma website.  A company called NG actually ships the item.  hopefully it holds up like my original sigma brushes, but you are better off getting the brush directly from Sigma - they are awesome when real!</li>
            <li> I love it!!! was my dream to have this Sigma Kabuki. OMG. I wanna all of sigma&#x60;s brushes!!!&lt;br /&gt;It is just as i heard about it. PERFECT!</li>
            <li> I bought three Sigma brushes for my wife (DUO FIBRE F80, DUO FIBRE F50, PRECISION FLAT P80) and she loved the quality of the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I surprised her with this gift and Sigma beauty surprised her with the additional gift that they sent to her (a SHORT SHADER E20 brush).&lt;br /&gt;Also she want me to say in this review that she recommends Sigma beauty brushes!!!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for foundation and cream blush. It is dense but soft and blends and buffs flawlessly. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love this brush! It buffs out my lines when in contouring my face...simply amazing! This brush is a must have!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best foundation brush I have purchased, and a heck of a lot cheaper than my MAC brush which I don&#x27;t like as much.</li>
            <li> I use a technique to apply my liquid foundation called stippling, and this is perfect for that! It&#x27;s soft but firm enough to hold the foundation but doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. I have used MUG&#x27;s stippling brush in the past, and to me this one is better and slightly cheaper.</li>
            <li> First of all, I absolutely love the Sigma F80. I used to apply my foundation with my hands. After reading several blogs, I decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m hooked. The flat top kabuki makes for the perfect foundation application - evenly applied and buffed in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered my package on 11/17 and it arrived quickly on 11/20. Upon opening my package, I realized that there was a ripped hole in the plastic packaging. I removed the brush and it fell apart. Literally. The handle just fell off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, love Sigma brushes ,but I wouldn&#x27;t order from this seller.</li>
            <li> Great make up brush.  Applies great coverage and easy to clean which is a bonus.  Will need to get more of Sigma line products.</li>
            <li> i love it very much 😍😍😍❤️❤️&lt;br /&gt;thank u</li>
            <li> I just received my Sigma F80 in the mail, haven&#x27;t even gotten to try it out yet and I&#x27;m already disappointed. The handle of the brush popped off with hardly any force at all. The bristles and ferrule remained in the plastic sleeve, but the handle just came right off while I was trying to take the brush out of the sleeve. That&#x27;s AWFUL. For how much this brush costs, I&#x27;m honestly really surprised. Almost twenty dollars for a brush is a lot, especially when I got a similar brush from the Real Techniques line that came in a set of FIVE brushes for the same price as this one brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve glued it back together with some Loctite, and I&#x27;m hoping that the way it applies my makeup will make up for what happened. I will update with further thoughts on the brush when I actually get to use it.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this brush for 3 years and havent stopped! I love the application!</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite foundation brush it&#x27;s great and never fails to impress.  Very good quality for the money</li>
            <li> For the first month or so, the brush worked great. I loved how dense and soft the brush was, and it seemed to be living up to all the reviews I had read before purchasing it. But as soon as I washed it once, the brush started shedding. All I used to wash it, was a little olive oil, soap and water, which works wonders on my other, cheap brushes, from target. I am so disappointed of how fast this brush just started to fall apart. Within a few months all of the bristles completely broke off and I ended up just trashing the thing all together. I wish I would have listened to the other reviews that said it was fake and just have bought it off of the sigma website. SO PLEASE, save yourself from the mistake I did, and do not buy this brush.... or at the very least, don&#x27;t clean it...</li>
            <li> I love sigma brushes, I think they are the absolute best. The quality is amazing, no shedding, very soft bristles, dense, even application, blends smoothly, doesn&#x27;t make foundation look Caky.. Pretty much everything one could ask for in a foundation brush, the price of these brushes, to me, are absolutely amazing as well considering the quality! I own the Real Techniques Brushes as well, I noticed up there someone said real techniques brushes are &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; than Sigma? I own a lot of RT brushes, even though they are pretty great brushes, I do feel in any way they are &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; than the Sigma brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone is entitled to their own opinions OF COURSE but in my opinion if you want great quality brushes that&#x27;ll last you for quiet some time than sigma is the way to go. You won&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;ve wasted your money at all. Get one at. Time if need be but I encourage you to get some sigma brushes it&#x27;ll be one of your best investments to date(-;</li>
            <li> It feels good, better than fundation brush I tried in Sphora!&lt;br /&gt;By using it, fundation becomes quick and comfortable!!&lt;br /&gt;rocommend!</li>
            <li> I bought the brush from Etailz (authorized Sigma reseller)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush came without any pouch or packaging (unlike the customers&#x27; photos I saw here on Amazon), just the brush itself with a plastic brush guard in an envelope. The envelope wasn&#x27;t damage but the silver ferule part has an obvious dent on it that alters the shape of the brush. I had to send it back. Other than that the brush was really soft and looked high quality. I&#x27;m not sure if I should buy Sigma brushes from this seller from now on.</li>
            <li> I give this brush 5 stars!! My makeup glides on soooo smoothly every time. The brush itself is super smooth and doesn&#x27;t shed. I recommend it to anybody who loves makeup and wants an effortless airbrushed look.</li>
            <li> I love this brush I use it everyday for my liquid foundation. I use less makeup and gives me great coverage.</li>
            <li> Love love love this brush! Best brush ive ever used for foundation.It applies the foundation evenly and there is never any lines or naked spots.  I cant wait to get more brushes from sigma.</li>
            <li> Bought this because I watched a lot of Makeup videos and this was a highly suggested brush. Feels nice, looks nice.</li>
            <li> Fantastic brush and makes coverage application smooth, especially stipling. Just FYI, if you have dry skin or excessive flaking, this brush will enhance, so make sure you exfoliate before use.</li>
            <li> Okay this brush is no joke apply blend what more can I ask for</li>
            <li> love the service and product</li>
            <li> I love this brush! I have very fair skin and it is always difficult to blend foundation at my jawline. This works wonders.</li>
            <li> Love. Love. Love this product.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll EVER use any other foundation brush again.</li>
            <li> Until now, I didn&#x27;t fully comprehend the importance of a makeup brush. For years I applied my foundation with sponges and while it always came out fine, it didn&#x27;t have that seamless, airbrushed quality that I saw on so many and always wanted. I have very fair skin and it was always such a challenge to blend at the chin &amp; neck area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it was all about the foundation. And while that is true to some degree, you don&#x27;t have to spend $40+ on high end foundation. Using Revlon PhotoReady liquid foundation along with this brush DID THE TRICK! I couldn&#x27;t believe the results I got. This brush is in one word AMAZING. Very soft, but also dense and firm which is what you need. It stands up to even the most rigid stippling techniques. So incredibly well made, this brush has almost no shedding and is so easy to care for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To those of you looking to get the finish you see in the media? Buy this brush. It is worth every cent. In my case, one full pump of foundation mixed with a small amount of Smashbox&#x27;s green foundation primer, along with this brush and I finally got the airbrushed finish I was in search for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And no, I don&#x27;t work for any company that makes any of the products I mentioned. I&#x27;m just a very happy consumer and try to pass along my good experience to others in case they are on the fence about buying something. :-) Good luck!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so soft and works really well. But don&#x27;t expect it to last too long. It starts shedding and in the end (after about 6-7 months?) the entire thing of brush hairs came off. This always happens to me with less expensive brushes but never with my bobbi browns or even MAC</li>
            <li> This brush is by far my favorite in foundation brushes of any brand. It is super soft and leaves an airbrushed effect to my foundation when done applying.. a must buy</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush after seeing a lot of great reviews on YouTube. The brush was shipped the day after I ordered it and I received it before the expected delivery date. I&#x27;m using this brush for my liquid foundation and it&#x27;s perfect. It&#x27;s very soft, sturdy, and densely packed. I washed it and there was no sign of shedding. I&#x27;m very happy with my order :)</li>
            <li> I have been wanting this brush for months. After watching lots of video reviews for it on youtube and reading all the great reviews on Makeupalley, I finally broke down and bought it. I usually stick to Ecotools or cheaper drugstore brushes so this was actually a splurge for me. So glad I did, this is the softest brush I&#x27;ve ever owned. It makes my foundation look airbrushed (I use Revlon&#x27;s new whipped colorstay. This makes me want to buy a lot more of the Sigma brushes. Verrry happy with the quality!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this brush but it just does not work for me. Every time I use it, I always use more foundation than if I use my other brush, it also highlights my dry spots on my forehead making an uneven and spotty finish. I&#x27;ll probably give the brush to my sister, hopefully she&#x27;ll get some use out of it.</li>
            <li> I love this brush so much! I never applied my foundation with brushes because I felt my finger did a better job, but I gave this brush a try and it works wonders much better than my finger. I would recommend this to any beauty buff - it has a smooth and easy application and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back.</li>
            <li> It blends and smooths my foundation perfectly! I will be buying from Sigma from now on. I read a lot of reviews about their brushes but I always like to try things and voice my own opinion. Great brush!</li>
            <li> Love love love this brush. I use it for my foundation and it is just amazing.</li>
            <li> I think this might be a fake. I just got mine in the mail and the barrel doesn&#x27;t say USA on it like most of the f80s I see online. Also mine sheds really bad, I used it to apply my liquid foundation and was upset to see I could pull out the hairs...:( makes me not wanna trust anything on this site anymore... :-(</li>
            <li> This brush is great. So soft and distributes the product equally over the face. I will be buying more of Sigma brushes as now i know that the quality is good. I was nervous to order as some people said it was fake. Mine wasn&#x27;t and you can tell by the quality.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush! It delivers professional results in half the time! Its extremely high quality, super soft and dense to help the application of makeup go on amazingly! It has exceeded my expectations! I will deffinantly be recommend the sigma f80 to everyone! Again, I absolutely LOVE this brush!!!</li>
            <li> How do I find another one? I love this brush for putting on my face foundation. It is the bomb.&lt;br /&gt;I want another one and cant find it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;I would appreciate some help here for an extra one to keep in my downstairs bath.&lt;br /&gt;Always buy two is my new theory to life and ordering brushes.&lt;br /&gt;But I do want to purchase another one. Is that a great review or what?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Debi P</li>
            <li> I bought this brush to replace an old elf brush I was using for my face and it is miles and miles above in quality (but I suppose that is to be expected!). So far there&#x27;s been no shedding, and I like the weight of it in my hand - not too heavy or too light. It picks up a bit too much of my BB cream, but that may just be me, and the application is pretty good. The price is great, I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ve broke the bank for a quality brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is so dense and soft I love applying my foundation with it. It blends the foundation so smoothly and gives me the most flawless finish I&#x27;ve seen yet.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent brush for the cost. It is very sturdy while still being soft and pliable. Great size for putting on foundation quickly.</li>
            <li> I had never used a brush to apply makeup before but had heard so many good things about this brush that I had to try it.  Glad I did because I love it and don&#x27;t think I could ever go back to anything else!  Very dense but smooth and cleans easily.  Give it a try, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> This is my first foundation brush, I used to apply my foundation with my fingers but decided to give the brush a go. I had always been disappointed with my foundation (no matter how good or expensive) turns out all I needed was the right tool. This brush is incredibly soft, the first time I used it I wanted to cry tears of joy because my skin had never looked that great! Sigma F80 applies the makeup so  evenly, skin has an airbrushed look to it. I cannot get over this brush this is a MUST buy you will not be disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT. A little pricey, but it does its job well. I have a $7 kabuki brush that I bought at the drug store and I definitely notice the difference between that brush and this one. This brush has a nicer texture and blends well. Since a make up brush is an essential product that really needs to work well, I would recommend paying the price for this.</li>
            <li> This is way better than the one I bought from MAC that is similar !  What a good brush for a good price!</li>
            <li> I can not say enough good things about this brush. I love using this for my foundation. Gives a flawless application! I also use Sonia Kashuk Synthetic Flat Brush and also love it for foundation application. I have to say I love both brushes equally. If you want to buy the Sonia Kashuk brush DONT buy it on here. Its way over priced. I bought mine at Target for like $15.00. I cant say which brush I like more because they both do the job so perfectly. I only bought the Sigma F80 because I love all sigma brushes so far. So naturally Im super happy with this brush!</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I was recommended to buy this brush. It sure does a good job of blending out my foundation. Also because it&#x27;s not goat hairs, it doesn&#x27;t take in a lot of my foundation on the brush, so there is no waste of product.</li>
            <li> A smooth brush that blends the foundation and keep it natural on your face. Good brand and I like it</li>
            <li> The brush is good. Nice quality. Dense bristles. However, it&#x27;s no miracle brush. I don&#x27;t think it deserves all the hype it gets on YouTube. With that said, I still use it to apply my foundation almost daily. I&amp;#34;ll use it until I find something I like better.</li>
            <li> This brush works great for giving you a fabulous airbush finish no matter what foundation you use. The only qualm I have is that you have to keep it absolutley clean for it to work it&#x27;s best, if it&#x27;s not clean it makes me break out and the foundation looks cakey. I wash mine with a mixture of olive oil and dish soap about once a week. It takes 24 hours to fully dry, and I make sure to stand it up ON IT&#x27;S BRISTLES to dry to make sure no water gets down into the glue of the brush. I would say it is worth the money, just make sure you are really taking the time to blend your foundation with the brush to get the best airbrush effect, and take extra time blending when the brush isn&#x27;t the cleanest ;)</li>
            <li> I like my foundation finish. Better than using just my fingers. A little pricey I think but worth trying I guess</li>
            <li> This brush is great to use with liquid foundation or tinted moisturizer. Gives an amazing flawless look and great coverage. I wash it at least once a week for best results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received my Sigma F80 Kabuki Brush ... It deserves every single word of all the positive reviews , I&#x27;m over happy with this brush and I&#x27;ll always re-order this in the future :) Highly recommended and it earns my 5 stars !</li>
            <li> I really love this brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gives you a Full Coverage (Depending on your foundation) and it looks flawless and so airbrush. Doesn&#x27;t even seem like you&#x27;re wearing makeup. But the key is to Buff it and Blend it really well into your skin or else, you&#x27;ll have chalky, cakey face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using a Moisturizer or Primer before you begin with your makeup with this brush, I feel like it gives it a bit more of a glow in your face, especially if you wanna seem Tan in the summer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I have dry skin so I need to use a Moisturizer.</li>
            <li> If you buy this, it will be the best foundation/concealer brush you ever use. I don&#x27;t make bold claims unless I truly believe the product is awesome. I bought this almost 2 years ago and the quality is still the same as the day it arrived in the mail. It&#x27;s better than any mac foundation brush I&#x27;ve used. The sigma F80 makes your foundation look like your own skin, all smooth and flawless appearance, not caked/faked on. Hard to describe until you actually try it. I did my makeup in different lighting with different brushes, and I used alot of heavy foundation. This brush was the only one to blend well.</li>
            <li> Also I bought this brush it says made in China ?! Is this the original sigma brush ?</li>
            <li> I was carefully washing and all bristles came off in less than 4 months super disappointed :)</li>
            <li> Love this brush use it every day very good coverage</li>
            <li> AHHHH amazing!!!Best brush I have ever had!!!! I will be ordering this for my mom this up coming holidays....this brush has changed the way I put my foundation on. I love it</li>
            <li> Glides on foundation PERFECTLY! Everyone needs this brush! Perfect for cream or liquid foundations. Also can be used with a mineral foundation for a more full coverage!</li>
            <li> Love this brush!  Great quality.  Perfect for applying full coverage foundation.  In fact, I plan on buying another to carry with me so I can keep the other at home.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. It has a few bristles that stick out but other than that I don&#x27;t have any complaints.</li>
            <li> I love my new brush, it arrived fast.  The brush is very soft, it does not absorb all of my makeup.  This brush does exactly what a make up brush should do, which it does when applying my make up its awesome.</li>
            <li> This brush was recommend it to me by all my favorite beauty guru&#x27;s and I must say it was worth the hype!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice brush!  It distributes foundation evenly and is easy to work with.  Every makeup lover needs one of these in their arsenal.  I also love and own Makeup Geeks stippling brush, another must have. They are both similar and great to work with!</li>
            <li> If you have large pores, this may not be what you want.  As I use it to smooth out the foundation the thick bristles pressed the cream deep into the pores and therefore show up unflatteringly.  I have not used it since.</li>
            <li> The brush was in good condition upon opening, and unfortunately broke after minimal use. Very disappointed in the product. Would not suggest buying.</li>
            <li> I love this brush for applying my cream/liquid foundations. It blends like a dream and makes makeup application a breeze.</li>
            <li> I love this brush soo much! Foundation looks natural and aplly easily! I will never use another brush after this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used my fingers to apply make-up, as well as a sponge. This was my first try with a brush. I can&#x27;t explain what is so different, but it is. I&#x27;ll never use a sponge again. I put a small amount of make up in the palm of my hand (takes less than a sponge or fingers), dab the brush in it (dab a few times to get the makeup well into the brush - not just on the surface), and use a blotting motion to apply. It really does look more silky, well blended - no streaking. I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference! Even my friends noticed!</li>
            <li> I had a MAC brush and it left black brisles on my faces and didnt really apply my fountation correctly, this brush is amazing I love the way it works super soft and applies my makeup perfectly.</li>
            <li> I have owned this brush for just over 3 months, I wash it weekly to biweekly with a brush cleaner and have never had any issues with bristles falling out and it has always blended everything out so nicely! I had been using it with my foundation this morning and started to notice bristles all over my face, I tried to gently pull what looked to be a flyaway bristle out of the brush and literally the entire brush head/bundle of bristles came out of the silver handle on the brush. I was devastated. I do not feel that I have been rough with this brush at all and am always gentle when cleaning it. I am thoroughly disappointed in the quality of this brush. For having paid what I did for it, I feel like it should have lasted longer than three months. I have had a set of Eco Tools brushes for over a year now and have never had anything near as catastrophic as what happened this morning. Maybe I received part of a bad batch but I have heard raves about this brush all over online. I am sad it is past the point of where I can return or exchange it as I feel totally duped on this product.</li>
            <li> Best foundation brush of life!! Great even application. Such quality and so fancy. Sigma brushes never ever disappoint. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Great quality brush. Love it! I&#x27;ll most definitely purchase Sigma brushes again.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t washed it yet  though. Hope it stands the test of time like my Mac brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with it, it make me love make up ♡</li>
            <li> Best brush ever! You seriously won&#x27;t understand the hype until you get one for yourself. Can&#x27;t live without it now</li>
            <li> This makes your foundation look like it&#x27;s airbrushed, and absolutely perfect. This is the best foundation brush in the entire world. SO worth the money!</li>
            <li> I Absolutely love this brush!  It really buffs the powder into my skin to make it look truly flawless.  This was a great investment!!</li>
            <li> This is the best brush ever for liquid foundation and the bristles always stay put and doesnt leave streaks or anything. Very good quality brush</li>
            <li> Cheap and eficient ! Values more than the price . Good for spreading liquids and creams. Love it , and it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than MAC&#x27; s .</li>
            <li> This brush was amazing, up until it broke! I&#x27;ve had it for two months tops, and it already broke! This brush isn&#x27;t a cheap brush so I am rather disappointed in the cheap workmanship, very disappointed!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super soft and amazing for buffing in foundation! I use it daily and it&#x27;s the best flat kabuki I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> This is the absolute holy grail of brushes. Absolutely any foundation routine will look flawless when applied with this brush. Even my cheap drugstore foundations look 10 times better. Don&#x27;t even consider buying anything else, you will just be wasting your time and money. I threw out all of my other foundation brushes because they don&#x27;t even compare to this one. Buy it now! I promise you will not regret it!!!!</li>
            <li> 1st time to use sigma brush and i have to say my searching is over, I also bought the eye kit brushes and Im very sold, Im a make up junkie hence I got to have the right tools, if you have not done so, please try this sigma flat top synthetic kabuki..a sure winner</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS BRUSH! Heard about it from Jaclyn Hill on YouTube and so glad I purchased it. The brush evens out my foundation and I barely have to use any because this brush makes the product go a long way! Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Love it!! Foundation goes on smoothly and does not cake up. Would def recommend. Thumbs up! You wont regret buying it. The price is spot on.</li>
            <li> Brush is very dense and soft and can be used with liquid or powder mineral foundation. Brush construction is sound, materials are great, and it is of very good quality. I would recommend this brush. It&#x27;s been a great addition to my make up kit.</li>
            <li> This precious pretty awesome. It&#x27;s not my favorite kabuki brush but it definitely does the job I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s worth all the hype but it is pretty legit</li>
            <li> This is an amazing foundation brush!!!  No more wasted foundation using cosmetic sponges.  Buy this brush; you won&#x27;t be dissappointed!</li>
            <li> I did like it a lot, but after washing twice it started to shed so I don&#x27;t really use it anymore because it isn&#x27;t worth the little black hairs all over my face :(</li>
            <li> I rate this brush five stars because from all the foundation brushes I have used this brush does not make my foundation on my face look cakey, and makes it look natural as if I am not wearing any foundation ( A flawless look).  I have bought different type of brushes but this one gets the job done and I will stick to Sigma Brushes from now on.</li>
            <li> Just received my sigma f80 brush today and it is amazing! The quality is outstanding and delivers a smooth and flawless foundation finish. Don&#x27;t waste your money on cheap brushes that the bristles fall out! Sigma is the only way to go when it comes to makeup brushes!!</li>
            <li> This brush feels amazing on my skin and applies my foundation so easily. It makes sure to put on a nice even layer and makes my face look flawless, love it!!</li>
            <li> I heard great feedback about the new kabuki brushes by Sigma. I use mine to apply foundation and I must say I am thrilled with this product. It is so dense and perfect for an all over application. no shedding and beautifully soft. I live in Australia so the shipping arrived two days before the latest date so I was happy with that :) Thank you Sigma!</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft and full, yet it applies my liquid foundation so evenly that it looks flawless. I have another flat kabuki brush that I thought did a good job but after using this I realize it didn&#x27;t apply as smooth and evenly as this Sigma brush does. It was worth every penny! My only concern is in keeping it clean. It&#x27;s so dense that I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ll have a hard time cleaning it without ruining the fibers. I clean with face cleanser (to remove the make up) or light shampoo (to keep the fibers conditioned and not dried out). I hope the brush lasts.</li>
            <li> Loooooove love love love this brush for foundation. Blends everything smoothly and its just perfection</li>
            <li> This brush kinds effortlessly into skin. My face looks absolutely flawless. I am  Very happy with my first sigma brush purchase.</li>
            <li> The brush is just okay, definitely wouldn&#x27;t pay another $20 for this. Works best as a foundation brush rather than a powder brush.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd F80 I&#x27;ve bought, and both of them, after about 6-9 months just start losing bristles like nobody&#x27;s business. It&#x27;s basically unusable, and although I love it, I don&#x27;t want to keep replacing it! I have several other Sigma brushes and none of them have this problem, just the F80, my main foundation brush.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift. Will buy again..</li>
            <li> Best brush for foundation! It helps it to go on smooth and streak free without looking cakey. Sigma brushes are the best!</li>
            <li> This brush is everything I hoped it would be. The fabulous ratings are absolutely correct! I wish I would have purchased this sooner!</li>
            <li> Great brush to finish makeup, either foundation or loose powder, also works well with solid mineral foundation powder, quality product</li>
            <li> I just got my  Kabuki on the mail and it&#x27;s just what I was expecting. Kinda heavy which for me means good quality. Applies my foundation just perfect and  for some reason it came with an eyeliner brush as extra gift !! I guess it was some Store promotion...Lucky me!!!</li>
            <li> VERY NICE. LOVE IT SO MUCH</li>
            <li> I love this brush! I use it to apply liquid foundation and it smooth&#x27;s it out very nicely onto my face.&lt;br /&gt;I had previously heard it was great for liquid foundation application and even saw makeup artists on YouTube using it.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who uses liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> I use this brush EVERY DAY - its a great foundation applicator. I find you get GREAT coverage with LESS product being used. Its a great tool if you are just getting started as a MUA</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for about a week now and I&#x27;m in love. It&#x27;s very soft on the skin and applies foundation evenly. It doesn&#x27;t streak at all and best of all, it doesn&#x27;t shed (even after a deep clean). I recommend this brush to anyone especially those first starting out with make up. Worth every penny! I&#x27;ll be buying a lot more Sigma brushes in the future :)</li>
            <li> Best brush for applying foundation. Doesn&#x27;t shed, and I&#x27;ve washed it many many times. Doesn&#x27;t leave brush strokes and I get a good airbrushed finish. Really love this brush.</li>
            <li> I purchased my brush on Amazon from FRESH BOTANICA about 1 year ago. Before I made the purchase, I called Sigma to make sure FRESH BOTANICA is an authorized reseller and YES they are, so they do sell authentic Sigma brushes. When you purchase from Amazon make sure the reseller is FRESH BOTANICA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I loved my brush and a took a very good care of it, making sure the metal part would not get any water, I would also dry it bristles down on a towel. However after last wash I noticed the brush becoming loose and it started shedding like crazy. I am so disappointed. My next flat top brush will be coming from Makeup Geek.</li>
            <li> A+ Love this brush for highlighter and cream contour.</li>
            <li> This brush seems to work for me. Let it be known I have absolutely no idea what I&#x27;m doing when it comes to make up, but I use this for foundation - either liquid or mousse and it applies it evenly. I haven&#x27;t had too many issues with the brush shedding, even with routine washing. It was also kind of expensive in my opinion for a make up brush.. but I guess I&#x27;m more used to the $3 elf brushes :-)</li>
            <li> Great brush! Very soft!</li>
            <li> Best foundation brush ever</li>
            <li> still prefer the wet sponge not the beauty blender the cheapest dupe  in applying my foundation</li>
            <li> I like all the sigma brushes. I&#x27;ve learned to put makeup with them since all the pros seem to be using them, so why not.</li>
            <li> My favorite brushes!!!</li>
            <li> I knew exactly what brush I wanted and this one was priced well, shipped quick and a good investment.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Best foundation brush I&#x27;ve found which is an absolute must for me as I wear foundation to work/school everyday. Works well with cream/liquid foundations to give a flawless, blended, airbrushed look to the skin no matter the foundation brand! The hairs are so soft and delicate and hold up wonderfully during washes! Will defiantly buy again when I need/feel like it.</li>
            <li> This brush is certainly one of the best . For makeup application it&#x27;s perfect. No shredding. Price very good . Quick shipment as well ...  And Amazon is very dependable</li>
            <li> OMG! I just recently heard of sigma brushes. This is my first one. I love it. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> I am so happy my first Sigma Brush</li>
            <li> Love this brush...it has definitely stepped up my make up game!</li>
            <li> Best foundation brush ever!!!</li>
            <li> I love this brush for my foundation. It&#x27;s wonderful! Blends really well, but I do go over it with a beauty blender for that added smoothness.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful brush.  Works great for me with my liquid foundation.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have used this brush for about a year now and love it. It has held together perfectly and the performance is the same as the day I bought it.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this BRUSH!! Super fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> Best makeup tools for all kinds of makeup.</li>
            <li> First impression was that this brush is SO soft, I&#x27;ve been using it for years and it applies my liquid foundation so flawlessly. Anyone wondering if it&#x27;s worth the buy, I would buy it 10x&#x27;s over.</li>
            <li> Wife asked for it. She loves it. Can&#x27;t say I know anything else about it.</li>
            <li> I already own two, about to order two more. The are great brushes. This brush gives a flawless application of liquid foundation. Buffering and just the way it applies on the skin is great. The only downside is cleaning and drying. Since the handle is so think, it&#x27;s hard to hang upside when drying,</li>
            <li> Love it, works exactly what I need it for. Very good quality</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used this product until a month ago. Never took it out the packaging, never inspected it - NEVER used it at all. So when I finally decided to use it, you could imagine my dismay to open it and have the brush in two pieces. The black part and the silver part of the brush were completely disconnected and I could see the glue inside. If the shipping and arrival of this Sigma brush was not fast, this would be a one star product.</li>
            <li> I use it to blend my foundation and powder and it&#x27;s amazing! The bristles are so soft and they don&#x27;t break off on your face. Totally worth the price. The only downfall is that I live in Canada so it takes longer for the delivery to arrive but I will definitely be putting in an order soon for other brushes :)</li>
            <li> MY FAVORITE BRUSH!!!!! Essential for a flawless finish</li>
            <li> Great brush. My foundation lays down better and looks more natural...even application.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush that I use for foundation. It has great area coverage and it&#x27;s so dense and soft. I don&#x27;t use any other foundation brush anymore.</li>
            <li> This was my first Sigma brush and I got it because a lot of makeup Gurus on Youtube had it and they all love it. It&#x27;s awesome! It&#x27;s so soft and goes on evenly.</li>
            <li> Favorite brush ever! Best results with foundation.</li>
            <li> This brush is the best I have ever used!!!! It feels amazing and my makeup looks flawless!!! I highly recommend this brush to any woman who feels she is worth it!!!!</li>
            <li> This brush really lives up to its hype! Its absolutely perfect in its application, incomparable to other brands in my opinion. I am very happy with my purchase. Here are the Pros (no cons found). Im an MD who barely has time to apply all the steps to my makeup routine because im studying for my boards. This really makes it easy to skip the priming step in my opinion (although priming is essential for long lasting coverage).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Easy to grip as you apply foundation&lt;br /&gt;2. Applies a flawless finish to the face with small circular outward strokes.&lt;br /&gt;3. Super soft and beautiful bristles. ( I never like leaving this brush dirty after i use it, the bristles are super soft)&lt;br /&gt;4. Perfect size and flat top shape that allows the brush to adequately grip the dimensions of anyones face shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Go to Foundation Brush! Thank you sigma.&lt;br /&gt;Will be starting a youtube beauty channel and featuring this brush!</li>
            <li> At first a bit skeptical with between positive reviews and of course the ones that say the company encourages you to leave positive feedback to get a free gift. In any case noticed more positive reviews for this on Amazon and decided to get these for my wife. Unfortunately these brushes didn&#x27;t hold so long, the ferrel fell off just after a week and to say the least both very disappointed. One would think a product with 500+ reviews selling for $25 a brush would hold up for around a year or more, very disappointed to have spent so much on an overrated brush.</li>
            <li> this is absolutely terrible! i have walmart makeup brushes better than this one!! started shedding after two uses!! do not recommend!!</li>
            <li> This brush is the greatest, I use it to put my foundation on, an it works perfectly.  It is very well made.</li>
            <li> I love this one and the round top.&lt;br /&gt;It blends in flawlessly .... I FINALLY found the 2 perfect foundation brushes.....works GREAT with my Clinique liquid foundation, doesn&#x27;t work great for MAC studio cream foundation.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love. I use this for blending my liquid concealer and it works like a charm. Very soft to the touch, but firm so it is perfect for buffing.</li>
            <li> I spent years perfecting how to put liquid foundation on my face. I tried brushes, sponges, beauty blender, finger, etc. nothing would make that perfect magazine look. Until now! First try with this particular brush. I love putting on make up now because of this brush.</li>
            <li> I like this brush - nice and soft and substantial. I have washed a couple of times and I haven&#x27;t had trouble with shedding. Great foundation brush.</li>
            <li> I got this brush because I was looking for a good foundation brush with good reviews. This was it! This brush is awesome! I use it every day with minimal care and get a smooth, even amount of coverage. The bristles are soft on your face, but not so much that they aren&#x27;t providing you the right amount of pressure to apply perfectly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks now and it has yet to leave a stray hair on my face. It is very soft and my foundation looks so much better when applied by this brush. I will buy this brand again!!</li>
            <li> When this product first arrived I couldn&#x27;t stop touching the bristles - they are so incredibly soft. Not only are the bristles soft but this is the best brush I&#x27;ve found to really buff your foundation into your skin. I use this for liquid, cream, and powder foundations and it works with all of them. I also use this to blend my concealer in. It gives the skin a very airbrushed look. The only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5 is that the brush has started to shed a bit. Not too much, mind you. It really is a quality brush for the price.</li>
            <li> love this brush very durable and you can get a full coverage application at a reasonable price</li>
            <li> After listening to Jaclyn hill on you tube for way too long about this damn brush, I had to give in.  Sinne My fav flat kabuki from Coastal Scents, didn&#x27;t make its way home from a trip. Long story- Sigma F80 is a joke. Tiny- Hardly can call it a Face brush. Nothing special about it at all, however I don&#x27;t mind contouring with a darker foundation around my temples and cheekbones with it.</li>
            <li> Best foundation brush I have ever used! Applying your foundation with anything else will seem so wrong after using this! Super soft, doesnt absorb too much product, super dense and buffs out foundation flawlessly!</li>
            <li> Love this brush! The bristles are soft and dense, so your makeup goes on easily. I have used it every day for a few weeks and there has been no shedding. Shipping was fast, too.</li>
            <li> excellent, the size is necessary to place the base in the face. the material is very soft that slips over the face</li>
            <li> Quality brush. Great for liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> Perfect for applying liquid makeup! And so soft!!</li>
            <li> This brush works prefect, it applies my foundation evenly.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing for applying full coverage foundation.</li>
            <li> This Sigma F80 is perfect for Foundation it blends so good that it feels as you didn&#x27;t apply foundation.I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This is the best brush for liquid foundation I&#x27;ve used. It packs on coverage. In order to achieve the fullest coverage stipple on the foundation. Make sure you press it into the skin well for best results. For a lighter coverage, use a buffing motion. I have washed this brush several times with no shedding and the ferrule has not came loose. The bristles feel soft on my face and are densely packed. It takes a little product a long way, preventing cakey-ness. It&#x27;s a high quality product at a good price considering it will last forever instead of having to repurchase $10 brushes that do have the job. If you&#x27;re looking for lighter coverage, I would recommend a stippling brush, or something with less dense bristles. For me, I prefer to get the most coverage out of foundations without cakey-ness.  This brush delivers that. I look forward to using this brush everyday.</li>
            <li> Great Price, Quick Ship, Great Quality</li>
            <li> Very dense brush. My foundation went on flawlessly. The bristles a very soft. I would definitely buy more brushes in the future</li>
            <li> If you are on the fence about this brush, stop reading reviews and go buy it! I have been using a beauty blender sponge for about a year and I didn&#x27;t think it could get any better. I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how wrong I was. This brush gives such a flawless, amazing finish - plus there&#x27;s no wetting a sponge and it will last you way longer than a beauty blender. I can&#x27;t wait to purchase more Sigma brushes - I have my eye on the precision line. A common complaint about this brush is cleaning, but a quick Google search will bring up tons of beauty blogs with cleaning techniques. I just cleaned mine for the first time and it was easy! I definitely recommend this brush!!</li>
            <li> This brush is AMAZING. I heard great things all over YouTube about Sigma, and they&#x27;re ALL TRUE! I&#x27;ve used it with a few different consistencies of foundation and they all have come out great with this brush. Love it, basically.</li>
            <li> Love this brush, it works wonders. It shipped really fast to. It leaves a flawless look. I would totally recommend this brush. It is my first one and I am really happy with it!</li>
            <li> I love the makeup brush.  Great quality, quick delivery, awesome seller.</li>
            <li> Love this brush. Washes well.</li>
            <li> So I was see you my Sigma kabuki brush is so amazing scene I have no problem with this brush it came  in perfect conditions I recommended the quality of this brush is just like a Mac you cannot tell the difference and for what I paid for it is so worth it. I am willing now to try some other brushes from Sigma</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard for a while that Sigma sells high-quality brushes for a lower price, and I&#x27;ve heard great things about the F80, so I went ahead and bought it. The F80 is incredibly soft and dense, and it feels great on the skin. It applies liquid foundation so smoothly and evenly, my skin ends up looking flawless. Also, it doesn&#x27;t shed at all like the stippling brush I used to use for foundation. My one criticism would be that this brush tends to use up more products than other brushes, just a warning. Other than that, if you like flawless-looking skin and smooth, even coverage/application, I would definitely recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> Recieved this today as I was applying my makeup for work. I opened it immediately &amp; used it to apply my foundation &amp; was incredibly pleased! I&#x27;d ordered it because I&#x27;d seen numerous Jaclyn Hill tutorials where she raved over it. I love it. It is incredibly soft yet sturdy &amp; dense enough to get an even application. My foundation is in a pump style container &amp; I usually use 3-4 pumps with a beauty blender. Using this brush, I was able to apply a full face with one pump! I am quite pleased with this brush &amp; I highly recommend it to anyone! (PS, I am a licensed cosmetologist &amp; I&#x27;ve used many brushes both high end &amp; lower end....I&#x27;ll throw rocks at all other brushes!)</li>
            <li> The sigma brush is a great foundation brush for apply liquid or stick foundation.  I gives you a smooth airbrushed finish, I woud definitely recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> I love this brush! It&#x27;s great getting foundation on my face...but to finish I still need my beauty sponge. I&#x27;m 48...have very oily Tzone and eyelids, super dry chin and cheeks...need the sponge to finish off my cheeks and chin. Excellently soft. if i had gotten this brush when I was under 45 it would have been all I would use :)</li>
            <li> i absolutely love this brush :)))))</li>
            <li> The hair is very soft and condense.No wonder that many bloggers recommend it. I bought E75 brush and receive a nice gift F40. Thank you, Sigma.</li>
            <li> FAKE BRUSH i thought it would be a good idea to order the brush on Amazon to save a couple of dollars I received the brush in the mail and was sooo excited I looked at the brush and thought this looks odd but I washed it and put it up something was telling me to google  the brush I looked at the real brush to find out that mine was a fake the logo is different the rings around the brush are different and the &amp;#34;made in &amp;#34; is different I was so pissed I gave the fake one to my bff and I ordered the real one</li>
            <li> LOVE this product!  Fast and easy transaction.  Arrived promptly.  I was a complete skeptic at first, but with all of the positive online reviews, I decided to give it a try.  It is the best brush I have ever found.  I literally do not leave home without it!  I will most certainly be purchasing other brushes in the future!</li>
            <li> Love love love this brush. Wouldn&#x27;t trade it for the world. It&#x27;s so soft and does its job, worth the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush to use for my foundation, but I find that I use it more for my powder application- gives a good flawless finish.</li>
            <li> i tried this brush for liquid foundation and it was superb... the bressels are extremely soft ...its really good quality i imagined it to be bigger but its still fine..... im really glad i bought it....</li>
            <li> Love love love Sigma brushes.  What else can I say, top quality!!</li>
            <li> This brush has been amazing. I can not be anymore happier with it. I normally use my flat foundation brush purchased from my local drugstore, however this brush has def changed my foundation routine, the flatness of the brush allows for my foundation to be applied much more easier as well as blending it.</li>
            <li> Nice, just as expected.</li>
            <li> So soft and spreads your makeup flawlessly! This is my first brush and I am very happy with it!</li>
            <li> This is a good brush, but I wish I would have researched a bit more before.  I would have tried the e.l.f. flat brush first and saved a ton of money.</li>
            <li> I heard great things about this brush so I finally decided to purchase one myself and I am so glad I did. It is a little on the pricier side but if you have the extra money then I say go for it! My foundation looks 10 times better and it&#x27;s way easier to cover blemishes. Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> I really want to love this brush. I just received it and it was a day ahead of schedule which is awesome! Good job on that Sigma. I watch all of Jaclyn Hill&#x27;s YouTube videos and saw her recommend this brush so I bought it to try. The bristles feel soft and thick. Can&#x27;t wait to try it but the part where the handle connects to the metal part is really loose. I&#x27;m really disappointed. I&#x27;d like a replacement or a refund. I will update my review and would love to give full stars if this gets fixed. Thanks Sigma!</li>
            <li> I love my Sigma F80!!! So soft!! It buffs out my foundation like nothing else!!</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Excellent product.</li>
            <li> This brush will turn whatever product youre using (foundation, concealer etc) into a full coverage product. It will blend it into your skin very well. However, keep in mind that this brush does soak up a lot of foundation and cleaning it and then drying it takes at least 1 whole day.</li>
            <li> Perfect brush for full coverage foundation. My favorite so far!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for one year and the bristles are falling out. I&#x27;ve had a $1.99 brush that&#x27;s done better than this</li>
            <li> LOVE. Really good thickness of the brush. Perfect for foundation application.</li>
            <li> This sigma f80 is nice and dense!  It is really soft on the skin.  I would recommend this over the sigma stippling brush, which I have too.</li>
            <li> Never dissapointed in the quality brushes.  Love your brushes!  Just wish they were a little cheaper like Morphe Brushes.</li>
            <li> DO NOT ORDER FROM COSMETICBEAUTYPLACE!!! I just received a fake!!! I paid $25 for a knockoff!! If you plan on ordering any sigma brushes from amazon, order them from Sigma beauty or their website.</li>
            <li> Provides excellent smooth foundation coverage. Makes any foundation look better. Great for blending as well. Love the Sigma F80 brush</li>
            <li> blends liquid foundation perfectly. way better than using your hands because of all the germs and everything. i use to take the shiseido perfect foundation brush, but i like this one a lot better.</li>
            <li> I love this brush, and I will probably never look elsewhere for another foundation brush.  It is soft, easy to clean, and cost effective.  There may be slightly better brushes out there, but for less than $20, who cares?  This one works so well, I can&#x27;t wait to buy more of the Sigma line to replace my cheaper Sonia Kashuk brushes from Target, that are stiff and prickly in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to feel good about yourself for having all Mac brushes, or some other snooty brand, go for it.  If you want professional results for a decent price, go with Sigma.</li>
            <li> This brush works great with liquid foundation. It is extremely soft and blends nicely. I have no complaints and can&#x27;t wait to buy more brushes from Sigma!</li>
            <li> Love the Sigma F80 brush!!  I received it in a timely manner packaging we great! Thank you I will definitely order from this seller again!!! VERY PLEASED!</li>
            <li> Love it!!!! It is an amazing brush and I absolutely love it for putting on my liquid foundation. Blends everything perfectly and is super soft. Such a great purchase!</li>
            <li> Perfect foundation brush!!  Amazing quality brush for unbeatable price!  I will recommend to everyone and will order more similar products immediately!</li>
            <li> By far best brush for foundationn!!!</li>
            <li> Not a bad brush at all. this brush is very dense and seems to do a good job when i&#x27;m applying my foundation</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. It&#x27;s very soft and does its job. I would recommend this to anyone. It&#x27;s better than a Mac brush.</li>
            <li> I have never used a makeup brush until I ordered Bobbi Brown&#x27;s BB Cream and saw from the reviews that it went on better with a make-up brush. I felt the ones on the BB site were too expensive so I went to my &amp;#34;Trusted Advisor&amp;#34; Amazon.com. This one was well reviewed and reasonably priced. I have had it for about 1 month and have not had any problems with it. It really does smooth my makeup and gives me a nice finish.</li>
            <li> Best $21 I have ever spent. Best makeup foundation brush on the market-- hands down. And I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of brushes.</li>
            <li> I was using the Mac 187 brush to apply my foundation and I happened to see a YouTube video showing this brush. So far it is awesome.  I have used it about two weeks and I think my foundation just looks better on. Usually by the time I get home it looks like my makeup has rubbed off.  Using this brush when I get home it still looks like I have makeup on. I saw some reviews where they said it was fake and I don&#x27;t know how to tell if it is or not. I washed it the first day I got it and it seemed to hold up.  Hopefully this will last along time like my Mac brushes did.  I have had two 187 brushes for about 3 years now.&lt;br /&gt; On another note.. I do not break out ever. When I started using the 187 brush I got zits on my forehead and right next to my lip from the brush. I was unable to touch the brush to my forehead without breaking out. I tried the sigma brush on my forehead and so far no breakouts. I guess I was allergic to the hair in the mac brush.. Not sure if these brushes use real hair or synthetic.  I definitely plan on buying a 2nd brush to keep in my car with me.</li>
            <li> The Sigma F80 brush shipped quickly and has definitely impressed me!  I heard about the brush through various people on YouTube (Jaclyn Hill mostly), so I decided to try it.  I&#x27;ve tried the beauty blender and other brushes, but I like this far better.  I can cover a lot more area, and I find it blends my foundation well.  I&#x27;d recommend this brush to anyone looking for a new foundation brush!  :)</li>
            <li> I own every Sigma brush made and this brush is by-far my FAVORITE!! It can be used with liquid, cream, or powder products! I purchase 2 of each brush so that I can 1 for powder and 1 for liquid. They last as long as you keep the ferrule dry, DO NOT SOAK THE BRUSH! I made that mistake and had to replace it because the bristles began coming out.</li>
            <li> good brush, but unfortunately the stick part came loose and now i only use the bristle part of it. It seemed to be glued together (cheaply made) for paying this price, i am very disatisfied.</li>
            <li> Works well to apply liquid foundation.  I have been using it daily for about two months.  I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Love love love this brush! Very soft and gives a very good airbrush look on my liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush by recommendation of a make up artist whose tutorials I watch on you tube (Jaclyn Hill). I must say she was absolutely right about how good this brush is to apply your foundation.. No shedding of the hairs and really applies the product beautifully. The make up artist always says how these brushes are just as good or even better than MAC (and she works for MAC) and they are half the price. Definitely recommend it, can&#x27;t wait to build up my whole collection of them!</li>
            <li> Hesitant on paying 20 dollars for one brush, but so worth the money! This makes my makeup look so flawless! And its so soft!</li>
            <li> great brush! soft and applies makeup evenly, also doesn&#x27;t waste it</li>
            <li> LOVE!&lt;br /&gt;Great foundation brush, gave great coverage</li>
            <li> Product performs as expected!</li>
            <li> Saw so many youtubers using this brush. I know why now! It&#x27;s a very dense brush that distributes make up very nicely and evenly. I have many MAC makeup brushes, but I am becoming a huge fan of Sigma because this brand is comparable and perhaps far exceeds MAC brushes in quality, cost, and performance. I am happy to have invested in this brush. I would purchase again. I continue to look for Sigma brushes to replace my brush collection.</li>
            <li> amaazing wooow and every nice word for it</li>
            <li> Love this brush for foundation</li>
            <li> Love love love this brush! Great for applying liquid foundation. Doesn&#x27;t shed and very well made</li>
            <li> Love this foundation brush!!</li>
            <li> Brush completely came apart after a few months. Don&#x27;t waste your $</li>
            <li> By far the best foudation brush I&#x27;ve ever used. Some people complain that flat brushes make a mess, but not this one. It is firm and smooth at the same time. Quite indispensable, I&#x27;d say.</li>
            <li> I use this brush all the time! Blends foundation perfectly and easy to clean!</li>
            <li> I bought this brush because I had seen so many people using it and raving about Sigma brushes.  These people were not lying, this brush is awesome!  It is so soft and dense, it works perfect for foundation and concealer!!  I will definitely be purchasing more Sigma brushes as the quality is just unparalleled.</li>
            <li> It started falling apart after a couple of uses</li>
            <li> Probably the best brush I have ever bought! Buying more for sure. Can not wait to try more of the brushes.</li>
            <li> There are simply not  enough words to describe how amazing this brush is. I actually look forward to using this with my foundation(liquid) every day. I&#x27;ve only used it for 3 days and I am obsessed. Super soft and very dense, LOVE IT! Every one out there needs this brush!!!</li>
            <li> I used to buy cheap brushes from department stores and complain about the loose bristles that would end up all over my face. This purchase was my first time \\&quot;stepping up\\&quot; and buying a more expensive brush. It&#x27;s not nearly as expensive as department store brushes... so my expectations were not very high. However, I am still happy with this brush many months after purchase. NONE of the bristles have shed, and I use it every single day. I&#x27;ve never used a really expensive brush before... but with this brush, I don&#x27;t think I will ever need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2/2015: Still using this same brush - bristles STILL do not shed, and I use it every single day to apply liquid and powder foundation. Best brush EVER.</li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW! Hands down this is a must have brush if you want to apply foundation. I can literally put a pea size amount on this brush and it covers my whole face with product, thanks to the brush! Try it you will be very pleased! I have always used the wedges or pad to apply foundation in the past.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing, it is recommended by professional make up artists and I recommended too. It is the best foundation brush I have ever tried</li>
            <li> This was my first flat foundation brush.  I had been using the other type of foundation brush. I prefer this much type much more.  I am able to blend more easily and I feel I use less makeup with it.  The bristles feel quite nice and again make blending a breeze.</li>
            <li> Obviously the most commonly recommended brush when applying liquid foundation.  Great for stippling and blending out.  While I have experienced some shedding, it seemed to mostly be in the first few applications.  Cleans easily, solid handle (not too heavy, not flimsy).  Join the sigma club!  Absolutely love their brushes.</li>
            <li> Came in the mail fast.. Works wonderful haven&#x27;t had literally one single hair fall out so soft definitely recommend to all beauty ladies out there</li>
            <li> I have used a few different foundation brushes but this brush by far is the best. It gives a flawless look and it&#x27;s easy to clean. The brush not only works wonderfully but it is well made. I will definitely be buying Sigma for my next brush purchases.</li>
            <li> The brush is very good quality.  It stipples your foundation to a flawless finish, so no unsitely swipes of makeup left behind</li>
            <li> been using everyday since december and hasnt shed and cleans up like a dream! my make up looks fantasic</li>
            <li> Great brush. Fantastic feel and quality. Will order other brushes from them.</li>
            <li> A great brush for foundation...LOVE it! Well worth it and would buy again.</li>
            <li> The minute I started using it, it has been shedding everywhere. Thoroughly disappointed.  frustrating experience overall . I will not be purchasing again. I am not even sure if its the real one.</li>
            <li> Love this! Use it everyday!</li>
            <li> This brush is soooo amazing!!! I finally got to try it out this past weekend for a night out and wow!! From the first stroke, I was sold!! It gave me an airbrushed look and natural, which I like since I don&#x27;t wear foundation very often. :) I must say that this brush works better than any of my M.A.C. brushes. I&#x27;m all about spending $, but the quality needs to live up to the name and price and M.A.C. falls short. I loved this brush so much, that I just purchased a set. Might be throwing away my M.A.C. brushes if I like the rest of the Sigma brushes. I purchased mine on the Sigma website, due to all the reviews I&#x27;ve read about some of the brushes on here being fake. I still love u tho Amazon..lol.</li>
            <li> fast shipping. 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li> LOVE this. Soft. A joy to use. If I every buy another will brush I will purchase this one again. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the brush.</li>
            <li> We received our brush very quickly and in proper packaging...feels and  works great!</li>
            <li> I received an Amazon Gift Card For X-Mas &amp; decided to purchase 2 &amp;#34;Sigma&amp;#34; brushes, I recieved my package within a week and decided to compare the fake &amp; real brushes , I was upset I had purchased fake brushes that say made in CHINA :(</li>
            <li> LA MEJOR PARA BASE DE MAQUILLAJE! sin bien que son caras, pagas por ello!!</li>
            <li> Love this brush buffs out foundation and blends well. Get a better application if you spray a mist on it first.</li>
            <li> Great brush for highlighter, very soft.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and soft! Can&#x27;t wait to use it!! Thank you!</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted this for her makeup artist business, she said it was the best! I&#x27;ll defer to her as the professional in all matters makeup</li>
            <li> I did love this brush when I first got it, and purchased it based on amazing recommendations! However, the bristles are all falling out now! Right after I use it I find bristles on my face and even looking at the brush you can see tons of bristles sticking out past the length of the rest of them and are loose. I am really upset with the way this brush has held up and neither sigma or amazon will give me a refund since it&#x27;s more then 30 days... I feel like I got a defective brush :(</li>
            <li> These make up brushes are fantastic and very high quality. My makeup goes on flawlessly every time with these and my skin looks great! I also started recently using an amazing skin vitamin serum that really make my complexion glow: I have found that combining this mask with [[ASIN:B00VXE0EEY Skingenixx VITAMIN C SERUM - Potent 25% Vitamin C + E Serum with Hyaluronic Acid]].</li>
            <li> I have to say this was my favorite brush because it helped me achieved a very natural finish. It blends incredibly good and the bristles are super soft on your face. The only reason I give this a 3/5 is because after a couple a months (2-3) it completely came apart. I started to notice that whenever I used it started to shed hairs, when I lightly picked at it the hairs would easily come right off, eventually the whole brush head came off. I don&#x27;t know why this happened, since I even made sure to wash my brush just as Sigma advices to wash them. I also made sure to dry them the appropriate way so they wouldn&#x27;t get wet on and inside the handle. I have also notice this shedding and also bleeding from other sigma brushes. As much as I want to love them I haven&#x27;t had good experiences with their brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I bought my brush on the Sigma website.</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying a Sigma makeup brush and I absolutely love it! This flat top kabuki brush works so well with liquid foundation. As a college student (tight budget), I kept on buying the Elf liquid foundation brushes for 1 dollar. But a friend of mine finally convinced me to buy this brush and I can totally notice a difference between the two brushes. The Sigma brush does work wonders (compared to the Elf brushes) with the liquid foundation. I don&#x27;t regret buying it one bit!  I recommend buying it :)</li>
            <li> My favorite brush. Sometimes I think Sigma brushes are overrated for their price, but this brush is my all time favorite. Applies the makeup beautifully and no stray hairs even after multiple washes.</li>
            <li> My very first pricey make up brush, I use it everyday and it leaves my foundation looking flawless. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Amazing brush. A little pricy but very good quality.</li>
            <li> Really gives you a flawless finish when applying your foundation. After purchasing this brush and using it I was so impressed I&#x27;ve decided to purchase the other sigma kabuki brushes.</li>
            <li> Brush head could be much bigger as it doesn&#x27;t cover as much of my face as fast when applying foundation. I have another brand brush much bigger and half the price that is better. Decent brush. Will keep and use to put on BB Creams. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing brush I love it sooooo much</li>
            <li> save your money and use a sponge!</li>
            <li> I am a person who reads reviews before i buy something and and everyone was absolutly right about this product. I love it and the price was great along with the texture of the brush and the look. Purchased many MAC brushes and these are just as good if not better.</li>
            <li> love, love, love this brush.  it&#x27;s so good!</li>
            <li> I bought this item as a gift for my wife which  works as a make-up master and she was very satisfied to use sigma brushes</li>
            <li> I love this brush!!!! You can do so much with it , foundation goes on flawlessly. Really happy with this product</li>
            <li> Best foundation brush you can buy.</li>
            <li> I suggest going onto the Sigma website, because you&#x27;re not going to get the real thing here. The real Sigma F80 brush is amazing. I decided to buy off Amazon and I am so disappointed. What a waste. As soon as it came in I compared it to my  old brush and it is so obviously fake. I doubt it will last a quarter of what my old one lasted, which was a year and a half. It should be $10 or less not $20+.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a fake brush, but I guess it&#x27;s not. Its already shedding after only two washes tho and just doesn&#x27;t feel like great quality. Oh well, gets the job done I suppose.</li>
            <li> I bought this after a few recommendations on youtube , it came very quickly and packaged well and works very well</li>
            <li> Best foundation brush everrrrrrr!!!!! Flawless application every time..... My new hole grail foundation bgrush...... Will be switching all my brushes to sigma brushes</li>
            <li> amazing quality! my favoorite bruush evverr. doesnt shed, reallly durable. and soft.very dense, so it gives amazing coverage. love it!</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with my order, the delivery time was precise.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush! I am new into using the higher quality brushes and products and I am wondering why I went so long without trying this brush! It is very soft and easy to clean. It holds just the right about of product and distributes it evenly. I have trouble getting makeup around my nose and under my eyes and this does it with no issues at all! I definitely recommend this brush to all new and experienced makeup users! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I have recently started using sigma as my go to brushes and I just love them. My favorite use for this brush is to use it for my foundation application. Gives that flawless, airbrushed look with little effort. I love when tools make my life easier.</li>
            <li> it was a fake. the product starting shedding as soon as I took it out the package. sent it back for a full refund.</li>
            <li> Purchased this in June. It was good and now the hair is falling out in big chunks. I took proper care of it, but noticed even in the beginning after just one wash that it began to shed a little... It&#x27;s only gotten worse since then. I had such high hopes for this brush, I would not recommend. I know Jaclyn Hill talks this brush up but maybe order it from the actual sigma sight because this one sucks!</li>
            <li> Perfect for foundation and making it look flawless! I heard about this brush from a friend and I highly recommend it as well. Shipped super fast and exactly like the picture</li>
            <li> I HAVE A LOT OF BRUSHES BY MAC, THIS SIGMA BRUSH IS BY FAR THE BEST BRUSH EVER!!! I WON&#x27;T BUY ANYTHING FROM MAC ANYMORE FIRST BECAUSE THEY ARE SUPER EXPENSIVE AND THE BRUSHES ARE NOT THAT GOOD, I END UP WITH HAIRS ALL OVER MY FACE ALL THE TIME BUT THE SIGMA BRUSHES DON&#x27;T LEAVE ANY HAIRS ON ME, THE PRODUCT GOES ON MY FACE SMOOTHLY  AND IT  GIVING ME A FLAWLESS FINISH. LOVE SIGMA!</li>
            <li> I love this brush, I use it every day and it is so easy to use. It saves a lot of time for me in the morning.</li>
            <li> Item as described. Good communication with seller also. Recommend</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teen and she uses it for foundation.  It blends the product with no streaking.  I will buy one for myself!</li>
            <li> I use MAC foundation, and have tried their brushes.... but nothing compares to the Sigma F80 Flat Kabuki. I never have to worry about uneven foundation again. It gives me good coverage yet goes on lightly enough so that my face looks natural. Worth the cost. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I did&#x27;t know the impact of selecting a quality brush until I found this.  I use it to apply foundation and it works like beautifully.  It even has a clear sleeve when not in use.  I&#x27;m thrilled about getting this purchase</li>
            <li> Love this brush! It lives up to the hype from all of the other reviews. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
            <li> Best foundation brush ever. period.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t always like putting on makeup but now when I do with this Kabuki brush...I love putting it on!</li>
            <li> My MAC makeup artist always uses a brush on me when applying my foundation. One day I asked her why and she explained that it helps buff the product into my skin for more flawless and even coverage. Forget buying one from MAC, frankly, lol, I came on here and searched for one instead. I found this one, got it home, and might as well be sleeping with it next to me in bed. I love it!!!! It provides THE best coverage of my foundation and covers so well, I&#x27;m almost able to go without a bit of concealer on my birthmark!! It&#x27;s awesome. Ladies if you&#x27;re thinking about getting this brush, do not hesitate...get it now...well after you finish reading my review.</li>
