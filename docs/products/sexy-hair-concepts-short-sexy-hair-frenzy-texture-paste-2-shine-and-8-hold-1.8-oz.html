            <li>The familia liked it.</li>
            <li>Great product.....can really work the hair with this and it stays put!!</li>
            <li>Rubs right into my hair and gives it a great hold all day.</li>
            <li>It never went into my hair as a product, but more as a glue.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m OK with</li>
            <li>love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love my hair spikey.</li>
            <li>She offered to get me some through her distributor...would have cost me more than 3 times</li>
            <li>Makes me feel sexy when the hunnies stare</li>
            <li>It smells like grape however, which was kind of cool.</li>
            <li>This is what I&#x27;ve been using for the last 5 months and it has been great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products and this is my new favorite.</li>
            <li>Strong stuff, good for short hair</li>
            <li>Dry look will great hold.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally, I&#x27;ve used many waxes and manipulator products and have only liked two.</li>
            <li>Great hold, but not too sticky and wet looking.</li>
            <li>Have used this for many years after trying many different wax products.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Note for most normal users, this will provide about a 2 month supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works OK but a bit more of a dry look than I wanted.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product as my hairdresser has used it on me and made my hair look fantastic, but for me, it&#x27;s just too thick.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice product to add to Paul Mitchell&#x27;s yellow M product.</li>
            <li>Would recommend to any male with very straight, short hair who wishes to use a product that washes out better than most waxes.</li>
            <li>Works great for thick hair.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Just as described, fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I have use these products over the last eight years or more.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>The hold is far superior and cleaner than any other product and does not leave a noticeable shine.</li>
            <li>and I could never get it to be more than a dry, sticky area of purple</li>
            <li>I have short fine hair</li>
            <li>no matter how much I rubbed my hands together.  </li>
            <li>it works very well to add volume and texture and styling features.</li>
            <li>Spendy,  but lasts forever as you dont need much to do the job.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t require much product to keep your hair in place all day.</li>
            <li>Works completely differently when my room temperature is warm prior to application.</li>
            <li>I use Clarifying Shampoo Three to wash out most of the product, a deep cleaning generic might also work.</li>
            <li>Good hold for that dry messy look.</li>
            <li>I dry my hair (NO BLOWDRYER) with a towel and make sure its 100% dry before applying a nickel size amount into hair, shouldn&#x27;t be too much.</li>
            <li>Perfectly new product.</li>
            <li>The 7 and 8 hold are very similar and it is worth it to shop around since the prices can vary wildly depending on the day.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, so it&#x27;s hard to find something that holds, but doesn&#x27;t cement my hair in place.</li>
            <li>Wow ... was I surprised.</li>
            <li>and now it last the whole day.</li>

            <li> Wow ... was I surprised.</li>
            <li> and now it last the whole day.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know how much to use and started off with a rather small amount.</li>
            <li> My Hair looks natural with little to no product</li>
            <li> I rub in-between hands for about 2-4 seconds before applying from the front of the hair back, pushing it up and getting it to the roots and then forming your faux-hawk or any other style you prefer.</li>
            <li> Colder product will leave my hair harder and clumpier, while warmer product leaves it flexible and natural-looking while still offering hold.</li>
            <li> molds your hair without the wet look</li>
            <li> Note that there will be minimal product build-up with continued multi-week use.</li>
            <li> Matte finish as a expected.</li>
            <li> Came as described despite other saying it wasn&#x27;t the correct brand/</li>
            <li> If applied correctly, small amount in palm rubbed together in hands and evenly applied to dry hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and does well for styling hair if you like your hair to lay flat.</li>
            <li> I got mine for less than $8 for each one, so never pay over $20 for each.</li>
            <li> use it everyday</li>
            <li> Firm control.</li>
            <li> Not the correct product and a waste of time.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first when I opened the jar, this product is very thick and almost chalk-like.</li>
            <li> With just a little of this my hair spiked up and stayed that way all day!</li>
            <li> If it is too hard or clumpy and your hand gets stuck in your hair, heat it up a little.</li>
            <li> It is a thick product and should be applied in small amounts.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time just getting some out of the jar</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff takes some talent to use and I don&#x27;t have that talent.  It&#x27;s a great product as my hairdresser has used it on me and made my hair look fantastic, but for me, it&#x27;s just too thick.  I had a hard time just getting some out of the jar and I could never get it to be more than a dry, sticky area of purple no matter how much I rubbed my hands together.  It never went into my hair as a product, but more as a glue.  I tried it several times and finally gave it to her to use in the shop.  It smells like grape however, which was kind of cool.</li>
            <li> good product … simply I was ripped off by being over charged, thought I am getting two, then I end up getting one for almost $18, meanwhile CVS stores carry it for $12.99, never order it again</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Great hold, but not too sticky and wet looking. A nice matte look.</li>
            <li> Works OK but a bit more of a dry look than I wanted.  The look I&#x27;m OK with but it doesn&#x27;t seem to hold as well as a result.</li>
            <li> This stuff rocks!! I have 5 in pomp and it works perfect for that matte finish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my third or fourth canister of this after about a year. Works great for thick hair. If it is too hard or clumpy and your hand gets stuck in your hair, heat it up a little. Works completely differently when my room temperature is warm prior to application. This difference is noticeable throughout the day. Colder product will leave my hair harder and clumpier, while warmer product leaves it flexible and natural-looking while still offering hold.</li>
            <li> love this stuff. use it everyday</li>
            <li> I love my hair spikey. I&#x27;ve tried many products and this is my new favorite. I was a little skeptical at first when I opened the jar, this product is very thick and almost chalk-like. I didn&#x27;t know how much to use and started off with a rather small amount. Wow ... was I surprised. With just a little of this my hair spiked up and stayed that way all day! Very happy. Hope they don&#x27;t change the formula. Will definitely be buying this again.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for. I will continue to buy this.</li>
            <li> Strong stuff, good for short hair</li>
            <li> Have used this for many years after trying many different wax products. I have short fine hair and I am female.If applied correctly, small amount in palm rubbed together in hands and evenly applied to dry hair it works very well to add volume and texture and styling features. It is a thick product and should be applied in small amounts. Apply a second time if necessary. This will rinse out well with water. It is not a wax. Firm control.</li>
            <li> molds your hair without the wet look</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, so it&#x27;s hard to find something that holds, but doesn&#x27;t cement my hair in place. This is the best product for me. The 7 and 8 hold are very similar and it is worth it to shop around since the prices can vary wildly depending on the day. I got mine for less than $8 for each one, so never pay over $20 for each.</li>
            <li> Spendy,  but lasts forever as you dont need much to do the job.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and what I was looking for. Rubs right into my hair and gives it a great hold all day. Container is deceiving because the bottom is curved to allow you to get all of the product. No corners!</li>
            <li> Came as described despite other saying it wasn&#x27;t the correct brand/style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it all volume, then style it how you like. This stuff works wonders.</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT FRENZY!!!</li>
            <li> Perfectly new product. Just as described, fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Good hold for that dry messy look. Best paste I have used yet for the matte look anyhow.</li>
            <li> Works great, is advertised product</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Dry look will great hold.</li>
            <li> Can confirm, product is now as described. Frenzy 2 SHINE and 8 HOLD. Sold by SpaSourceOnline and Fulfilled by Amazon at time of sale.</li>
            <li> My Hair looks natural with little to no product but I can still get that great Pompadour I have always wanted and now it last the whole day.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist uses this when she does my hair.  She offered to get me some through her distributor...would have cost me more than 3 times what I paid on Amazon!  Thanks for another great deal!</li>
            <li> the products and the shipments was perfect</li>
            <li> Good product  Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair looking shiny.</li>
            <li> I have use these products over the last eight years or more. They change their line up every two to three years, but they always maintain a product that suits me perfectly. The hold is far superior and cleaner than any other product and does not leave a noticeable shine.</li>
            <li> Not the correct product and a waste of time.</li>
            <li> Was not as advertised</li>
            <li> Great product.....can really work the hair with this and it stays put!!</li>
            <li> This product is great because it provides the maximum hold whilst remaining matte finish. Would recommend to any male with very straight, short hair who wishes to use a product that washes out better than most waxes. Note that there will be minimal product build-up with continued multi-week use. Note for most normal users, this will provide about a 2 month supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I&#x27;ve used many waxes and manipulator products and have only liked two. This is what I&#x27;ve been using for the last 5 months and it has been great. I use Clarifying Shampoo Three to wash out most of the product, a deep cleaning generic might also work. Then I finish it off with Awapuhi Shampoo for volume and finish. I dry my hair (NO BLOWDRYER) with a towel and make sure its 100% dry before applying a nickel size amount into hair, shouldn&#x27;t be too much. I rub in-between hands for about 2-4 seconds before applying from the front of the hair back, pushing it up and getting it to the roots and then forming your faux-hawk or any other style you prefer.</li>
            <li> The familia liked it. It&#x27;s thick and does well for styling hair if you like your hair to lay flat. I wouldnt recommend this product if you have hair longer than a couple inches and are looking for a paste that will keep it standing up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple months now and I love it! It doesn&#x27;t require much product to keep your hair in place all day. I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> Makes me feel sexy when the hunnies stare</li>
            <li> Matte finish as a expected. Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> This is a nice product to add to Paul Mitchell&#x27;s yellow M product. Together that create a look with hold, yet softness.</li>
