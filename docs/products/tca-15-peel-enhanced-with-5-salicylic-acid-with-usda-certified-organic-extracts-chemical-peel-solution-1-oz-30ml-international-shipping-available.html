            <li>Works perfectly well to give a peel that is even.</li>
            <li>Best product ever, I am recommending it to my mother, my sister, my co-workers and friends.</li>
            <li>Amazing!!!</li>
            <li>I love it!!!  </li>
            <li>This peel has been great for me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months and have seen great results.  </li>
            <li>Product worked great.</li>
            <li>this is great to get rid of scars and reduces pimples........</li>
            <li>but otherwise this is a great product ......</li>
            <li>with great results.</li>
            <li>lol which I do not recommend</li>
            <li>I feel like its going to look great</li>
            <li>This product is a great buy.  </li>
            <li>Great quality.</li>
            <li>Also great for skin maintenance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a HUGE fan of peels because frankly, for me, THEY WORK!!!  </li>
            <li>I really liked the outcome of the product!</li>
            <li>Catching up on reviews.</li>
            <li>Four days after my first treatment the spot peeled right off!!!!!</li>
            <li>This is by far the BEST product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I love it :-)  </li>
            <li>have used this product many times.</li>
            <li>i am quite satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I love the way my skin feels and looks after this peel.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s better than nothing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This 15% TCA solution indeed causes my skin to slough off the top layer a bit to become more smooth</li>
            <li>this stuff is strong but it works.</li>
            <li>This is strong stuff.</li>
            <li>My skin is nice and as well it doesn&#x27;t burn very much at all</li>
            <li>This may be true but it seems to me it also makes it more risky to use.</li>
            <li>primarily for hyper pigmentation.  </li>
            <li>, I also have light acne scars on my face that I wanted to get rid of.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned and in my 50&#x27;s with moderate sun damage mostly from childhood.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!!!</li>
            <li>then my original skin tone.</li>
            <li>I love how much my skin glows after using this peel!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still in the healing process, but even after the first peel, I saw a huge difference in fine lines.  </li>
            <li>You need about one bottle for the three apps for a full body peel.  </li>
            <li>but this stuff gives a super peel with NO irritation.  </li>
            <li>i wanted it for stretch marks, but this is too mild for that.....</li>
            <li>After a good deal of time my skin got a bit pink.</li>
            <li>but the result is worth the hassles.  </li>
            <li>Used it weekly to clear up acne and have more radiant skin.</li>
            <li>but the product was exciting to use.</li>
            <li>Product is always fresh and delivered promptly.</li>
            <li>, I picked off the scabs and reveled new pink skin, I was super happy tho because my acne marks</li>
            <li>+ the super fast shipping helps too.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second go round with this peel and it frosted almost immediately (which is awesome)  </li>
            <li>The 15% is great for those who have less deep wrinkles-more fine lines and hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li>The first use took away all the sun damage and this time around I concentrated on crows feet.  </li>
            <li>was worried on first time use.</li>
            <li>The instructions say not to leave it on longer than 30-90 seconds at first, with going up to 3 minutes maximum after experience.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll try a greater strength next time.</li>
            <li>This product was shipped in a timely manner and was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Not the first use of it.</li>
            <li>I have been getting professional peels for a few years and this is just as effective!</li>
            <li>I  wanted something strong enough to peel my skin on my knees.</li>
            <li>It takes time; but by educating oneself about the science of  skin and the different products out there, being extremely mindful that this is an acid, being patient and just having common sense in skin care - I can honestly say I&#x27;m finding my results to my liking - and I love that I&#x27;m not paying overly priced clinic visits for something I can do on my own, in the comfort of my home.</li>
            <li>This is the only thing that has battled my extreme hyperpigmentation successfully.</li>
            <li>Besides, they are reasonably priced and you can do them yourself.</li>
            <li>you will look like a monster and scarred the first 1-4 days this is NORMAL and it will go away</li>
            <li>hahaha.</li>
            <li>My skin feels like it&#x27;s brand new!</li>
            <li>My skin looks fresh and clear and is incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>supposedly works because it has smaller molecules that can get under the epidermis more than chemicals with larger molecules.</li>
            <li>Slather on the high SPF sunscreen for about 3 days after you apply the peel, and you will have to continue to use sunscreen, but that is recommended without a peel anyway.</li>
            <li>first time users should use caution..  overall very satisfiedâ€¦.</li>
            <li>Different people&#x27;s skins and the skin on different parts of the body react differently so please consider your own case when reading my comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s starting to peel now and the fresh skin is very soft.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>but I held out for a full 60 Sec.</li>
            <li>It is making the healing process go much quicker than last time!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already ordered several bottles and am on my second peel about three weeks apart from the first one.  </li>
            <li>This is powerful stuff, so be careful and follow directions to a T!!!</li>
            <li>Less downtime than with the higher percentage TCA peels.</li>
            <li>I have tried other peels such as Glycolic and Lactic Acid hoping to remove this pretty large dark spot from my cheek.</li>
            <li>When I got it, I was very careful based on what others had said, but I really didn&#x27;t need to be; it did nothing.</li>
            <li>could see clear burn marks and white frost where I had put the peel, it looked gross but was expected.&lt;br /&gt;D2-</li>
            <li>I am a African American woman who is 24 years old and</li>

            <li> I am a African American woman who is 24 years old and</li>
            <li> Tuesday I still looked very gross, the burns were started to really dry up tho.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin was dry on the second use.</li>
            <li> Some people suggest &#x27;layering&#x27; meaning using this chemical repeatedly to peel the skin before it completely heals from the previous peal.</li>
            <li> If anyone wants to do it on any other part of their body besides the face...get a stronger solution as this was not strong enough.</li>
            <li> Not only does this do well for acne, but makes skin glow, appear even, and seems to make scars less apparent.  </li>
            <li> i used it on my hands and arms for  &amp;#34; sun spots &amp;#34; which are a bit more difficult to treat due to darkness of spots.</li>
            <li> but im being extra careful with it.</li>
            <li> but as mentioned  other parts of the body react differently.</li>
            <li> but this is definitely the most painful.</li>
            <li> Easier for some to tolerate and less likely to have complications.</li>
            <li> Weeks later, though, and I saw very minimal peeling, like just a little dry skin, and no results underneath the peeling.</li>
            <li> I apply three coats within a few hours apart and leave it on until I shower the following evening.  </li>
            <li> It works just be careful</li>
            <li> Healing parts of my skin are still pink</li>
            <li> Lifelong acne sufferer, now age 50 and getting some lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I used this product on Sunday and by Monday the dead layers of skin were already starting to come off.</li>
            <li> Be careful when applying&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li> I have done other peels....</li>
            <li> I did not get the results I was looking for which would be to correct the dark knees I have</li>
            <li> Also, base and powder make-up goes on smoother and more</li>
            <li> i typically would apply Vit. D ointment which promotes healing.</li>
            <li> Im half black</li>
            <li> benzole peroxide, salycylic acid, witch hazel, black soap, retin-A, antibiotics...everything.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t drip anywhere near your eyes because....you will go blind.</li>
            <li> I think (and I may be wrong) that to get the same slight effect that I get, I could use a milder (and less expensive) chemical such as glycolic acid.</li>
            <li> in the past i would go to dermatologist and spend $ 185 for a micro peel.  </li>
            <li> usually within 3-5 days peeling of the skin occurs.  </li>
            <li> My children commented on my complexion when I used it for few weeks (2Ã— weekly), after they hadn&#x27;t seen me lately.  </li>
            <li> No more acne scarring and my skin glows.</li>
            <li> it can be awkward in public as the skin is flaky and peeling.</li>
            <li> and I have oily thick</li>
            <li> sometimes i get frosting which i immediately apply cold wet facecloth.  </li>
            <li> I was always afraid of TCA because I heard it could scar.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;washed off with cold water and</li>
            <li> I looked very disturbing and gross.&lt;br /&gt;D3-</li>
            <li> Holy crap!</li>

            <li> I put this product on my face and parts of my body and I DID not peel at all. I applied it several times and nothing happened.</li>
            <li> This peel has been great for me.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months and have seen great results.  + the super fast shipping helps too.  Probably going to buy the 3 lot next time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second go round with this peel and it frosted almost immediately (which is awesome)  The first use took away all the sun damage and this time around I concentrated on crows feet.  I&#x27;m still in the healing process, but even after the first peel, I saw a huge difference in fine lines.  This is powerful stuff, so be careful and follow directions to a T!!! I love it :-)  I also found a burn gel on Amazon called Silvasorb gel.  It is making the healing process go much quicker than last time!  Thanks Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> I was always afraid of TCA because I heard it could scar.  So, I always used glycolic acids.  HOWEVER, I bought this stuff to try on my arms and legs and it works GREAT!!!  As a matter of fact, glycolics always irritated my arms and legs but this stuff gives a super peel with NO irritation.  I&#x27;m fair skinned and in my 50&#x27;s with moderate sun damage mostly from childhood.  I apply three coats within a few hours apart and leave it on until I shower the following evening.  For me, there is minimum burning upon application and only reddens a bit.  In about 7 days, you start to peel.  I peel in sheets!  I love it!!!  I&#x27;ve already ordered several bottles and am on my second peel about three weeks apart from the first one.  I plan to try it on my chest and neck because these two areas have never responded well to VIPeel or glycolics.  You need about one bottle for the three apps for a full body peel.  Oh yeah, this stuff is also working great on my hands!  I may eventually try it on my face but currently I&#x27;m using VIPeel and plan to try Jessner&#x27;s peel on my face next.  I&#x27;m a HUGE fan of peels because frankly, for me, THEY WORK!!!  Besides, they are reasonably priced and you can do them yourself.</li>
            <li> Product worked great. was worried on first time use. but shouldnt have. used it 3 times and sun spots are going away</li>
            <li> It works just be careful</li>
            <li> this is great to get rid of scars and reduces pimples........the reason i gave it 4 instead of 5 i wanted it for stretch marks, but this is too mild for that.....but otherwise this is a great product ......</li>
            <li> I received this product later than the maximum delivery date. When I got it, I was very careful based on what others had said, but I really didn&#x27;t need to be; it did nothing. The instructions say not to leave it on longer than 30-90 seconds at first, with going up to 3 minutes maximum after experience. However, I left it on for several minutes and didn&#x27;t see frosting. After a good deal of time my skin got a bit pink. Weeks later, though, and I saw very minimal peeling, like just a little dry skin, and no results underneath the peeling. Maybe I&#x27;ll try a greater strength next time. I won&#x27;t hold my breath for it to arrive on time though.</li>
            <li> have used this product many times. in the past i would go to dermatologist and spend $ 185 for a micro peel.  with great results. primarily for hyper pigmentation.  i am quite satisfied with this product. although the results are variable.  sometimes i get frosting which i immediately apply cold wet facecloth.  the dermatologist would do the same.  it stops the burning process. usually within 3-5 days peeling of the skin occurs.  it can be awkward in public as the skin is flaky and peeling. i typically would apply Vit. D ointment which promotes healing. or sometimes just skin cream or Vaseline which helps to mask the dryness, peeling.  but the result is worth the hassles.  i used it on my hands and arms for  &amp;#34; sun spots &amp;#34; which are a bit more difficult to treat due to darkness of spots. but as mentioned  other parts of the body react differently. first time users should use caution..  overall very satisfiedâ€¦. at a fraction of the price charged by a pro.</li>
            <li> Just tried this stuff out... My skin tone. Im half black so I have tan skin, I also have light acne scars on my face that I wanted to get rid of. I didn&#x27;t put it all over my face just in patches on the scars I was trying to get rid of. I lost my directions so idk what I was doing I was just going for it lol which I do not recommend&lt;br /&gt;D1-Sunday After about 30sec it started frosting and BURNING but I held out for a full 60 Sec. |UPDATE| WASH OFF AS SOON AS YOU SEE FROSTING! FOR BEST RESULTS!&lt;br /&gt;washed off with cold water and could see clear burn marks and white frost where I had put the peel, it looked gross but was expected.&lt;br /&gt;D2- Monday Marks where I had the peel turned a shade or two darker then my original skin tone. I looked very disturbing and gross.&lt;br /&gt;D3- Tuesday I still looked very gross, the burns were started to really dry up tho.&lt;br /&gt;D4- Wednesday, I started picking at the peel which I know you should NOT do but I could not help it, I picked off the scabs and reveled new pink skin, I was super happy tho because my acne marks I wanted gone WERE GONE!&lt;br /&gt;D5- Healing parts of my skin are still pink but im being extra careful with it. I feel like its going to look great when im all healed up so yeah I really liked the outcome of the product! Beware tho you will look like a monster and scarred the first 1-4 days this is NORMAL and it will go away hahaha.</li>
            <li> Catching up on reviews. I&#x27;ve been doing TCA peels for 7 months now. This is the only thing that has battled my extreme hyperpigmentation successfully. It takes time; but by educating oneself about the science of  skin and the different products out there, being extremely mindful that this is an acid, being patient and just having common sense in skin care - I can honestly say I&#x27;m finding my results to my liking - and I love that I&#x27;m not paying overly priced clinic visits for something I can do on my own, in the comfort of my home. This product was shipped in a timely manner and was exactly as advertised. I have written an identical review for another TCA peel just one of a different percentage. I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I love how much my skin glows after using this peel! I have been getting professional peels for a few years and this is just as effective! Especially on a budget!</li>
            <li> Lifelong acne sufferer, now age 50 and getting some lines around my eyes.  Not only does this do well for acne, but makes skin glow, appear even, and seems to make scars less apparent.  My children commented on my complexion when I used it for few weeks (2Ã— weekly), after they hadn&#x27;t seen me lately.  1st time EVER from them.  Also, base and powder make-up goes on smoother and more evenly.&lt;br /&gt;Worth your time and $.</li>
            <li> Used it weekly to clear up acne and have more radiant skin. It&#x27;s awesome. My skin is nice and as well it doesn&#x27;t burn very much at all</li>
            <li> WOW! this stuff is strong but it works. Takes about 4 days after treatment to start peeling. I love the way my skin feels and looks after this peel. But it stings ALOT, so be prepared. I have done other peels.... lactic acid, salicytic acid.. etc... but this is definitely the most painful.</li>
            <li> This product is a great buy.  It appears just as shown in photo. Great quality. I will order again from this company.</li>
            <li> I used this product on Sunday and by Monday the dead layers of skin were already starting to come off. My skin looks fresh and clear and is incredibly soft. I will definitely be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly well to give a peel that is even. If you do your homework in advance of using this---and use it carefully---you can give yourself a peel that would cost hundreds of dollars--for a fraction of that amount. I can hear the cries of anguish from the Dermatologists. They stand to lose if word of this gets out.</li>
            <li> If anyone wants to do it on any other part of their body besides the face...get a stronger solution as this was not strong enough. I returned it and they refunded me.</li>
            <li> I am a African American woman who is 24 years old and I  wanted something strong enough to peel my skin on my knees. Well this will. Not the first use of it. Not the second use. My skin was dry on the second use. So I just decided i would not apply lotion on my knees and apply again and that is when it peeled. Well it peeled my knees so the product does what it says it will do. it will sting if you reapply it on your skin in one setting,over and over again, thinking it is not working, so avoid repetition on your skin and take it once a week or as recommended.  I did not get the results I was looking for which would be to correct the dark knees I have but the product was exciting to use. I purchased the 15% level and I have yet to try it on my face, just out of fear and lack of need for it on my face.</li>
            <li> Holy crap! This is strong stuff. I frosted within 10 seconds on my forehead and I have oily thick skin.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been several days but it&#x27;s starting to peel now and the fresh skin is very soft. Be careful when applying&lt;br /&gt;it so it doesn&#x27;t drip anywhere near your eyes because....you will go blind.</li>
            <li> This is by far the BEST product I have ever used. I have tried other peels such as Glycolic and Lactic Acid hoping to remove this pretty large dark spot from my cheek. None have worked until I tried this product last week. Four days after my first treatment the spot peeled right off!!!!! I will be using this product once a month for the rest of my life now. My skin feels like it&#x27;s brand new! Best product ever, I am recommending it to my mother, my sister, my co-workers and friends. Amazing!!!</li>
            <li> Different people&#x27;s skins and the skin on different parts of the body react differently so please consider your own case when reading my comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 15% TCA solution indeed causes my skin to slough off the top layer a bit to become more smooth so it&#x27;s better than nothing. I think (and I may be wrong) that to get the same slight effect that I get, I could use a milder (and less expensive) chemical such as glycolic acid. Some people suggest &#x27;layering&#x27; meaning using this chemical repeatedly to peel the skin before it completely heals from the previous peal. It seems risky to me but maybe that would give me a &#x27;deeper&#x27; peel?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TCA supposedly works because it has smaller molecules that can get under the epidermis more than chemicals with larger molecules. This may be true but it seems to me it also makes it more risky to use.</li>
            <li> Have been using acids from this company for a couple years. Product is always fresh and delivered promptly. The 15% is great for those who have less deep wrinkles-more fine lines and hyperpigmentation. Easier for some to tolerate and less likely to have complications. Also great for skin maintenance. Less downtime than with the higher percentage TCA peels. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have, or had severe acne. I tried EVERYTHING...benzole peroxide, salycylic acid, witch hazel, black soap, retin-A, antibiotics...everything. I started alternating between TCA peels and lactic acid peels, and you would never think I ever had a pimple in my life. These peels are life savers. You must follow the directions and you must not pick your skin!!!!! Slather on the high SPF sunscreen for about 3 days after you apply the peel, and you will have to continue to use sunscreen, but that is recommended without a peel anyway. I peel about once every 4-6 weeks now. No more acne scarring and my skin glows.</li>
