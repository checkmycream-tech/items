            <li>Have been using this product for years now - it came closest to replacing my favorite, which they discontinued...</li>
            <li>Love this smell</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t pass up the deal and will be ordering many more.</li>
            <li>but it was just ordinarly ok.</li>
            <li>What more can I say than this is my favorite scent in lotion.</li>
            <li>my favorite bath and body works lotion</li>
            <li>I received a Twilight Woods gift set awhile ago on Christmas, and I quickly fell in love with the scent!</li>
            <li>Distinctive scent but not too strong.  </li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t use a huge amount.</li>
            <li>I was bummed when this scent was no longer available in stores.</li>
            <li>She is so happy with her present.</li>
            <li>it has a very nice smell which the smell will last on your skin</li>
            <li>was for my girlfriend as a gift, the product let her body with full arome</li>
            <li>love them sooo much.</li>
            <li>Smells so clean and fresh without smellinglike laundry or flowers or elderly women.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and on time.</li>
            <li>I just love lotion and love all different kinds.</li>
            <li>I use it right after I take a bath</li>
            <li>It is very strong so you only need about the size of a pea otherwise</li>
            <li>When using this,only put on a pea size amount or it will be to strong and wont have a natural smell.</li>
            <li>If nothing else, try it as a Tuesday and Thursday lotion, it&#x27;s scent is so unique that it can be a nice break from your usual lotion or just a nice scent if you&#x27;d like to wear something different a couple of days a week.</li>
            <li>This and Midnight Pomegranate are my current favorite fragrances.</li>
            <li>Very well received.</li>
            <li>It really stays.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much</li>
            <li>The scent is so original it could actually work just as well for a man to put on his face after shaving as it could for a woman to put on her hands or feet.</li>
            <li>Dark Kiss is my favorite</li>
            <li>Lasting power of this is great and and a little goes a long way with smell.</li>
            <li>It only takes a little. :)</li>
            <li>But you have to be careful because if you get to much it, it will be very overpowering and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just enough but not too much.</li>
            <li>I can smell this in the next room, behind closed doors, due to the whole house AC when my wonderful wife applies it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was really liquid-y for about a week, then I got the wild idea to stick it in the fridge and it thickened up back to a proper lotion consistency.</li>
            <li>In won major brownie points by buying this for my lady.  </li>
            <li>If you have exceedingly dry skin, try this lotion on the area for a week and see if it doesn&#x27;t clear up completely!</li>
            <li>I heard so much about this scent that I expected to be blown away</li>
    </ol>

            <li> When using this,only put on a pea size amount or it will be to strong and wont have a natural smell. That is what I reccomend anyway.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t the same bottle in the picture</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and it smells great. It is very Dark and mysterious smelling. Which i like. But you have to be careful because if you get to much it, it will be very overpowering and ughhh not good. It is very strong so you only need about the size of a pea otherwise you will smell very very very strong.</li>
            <li> An exotic scent entices through the woods and so does this lotion. The scent is so original it could actually work just as well for a man to put on his face after shaving as it could for a woman to put on her hands or feet. It&#x27;s wonderful on the arms, face, and body as well. It has a slightly strong scent but that is part of the attraction because it&#x27;s not overbearing but more like enchanting and wonderful. It has the scent of the woods and something else, something exotic, and seductive. It&#x27;s a great product though for many reasons. It will soften the skin after shaving and reduce dryness anywhere it is applied. If you have exceedingly dry skin, try this lotion on the area for a week and see if it doesn&#x27;t clear up completely! Bath and Body works has always made such wonderful lotions and I recommend this one. If nothing else, try it as a Tuesday and Thursday lotion, it&#x27;s scent is so unique that it can be a nice break from your usual lotion or just a nice scent if you&#x27;d like to wear something different a couple of days a week.</li>
            <li> Mother&#x27;s Christmas present was well received. She loves any Bath &amp; Body stuff. Very well received. She says &amp;#34;You can get me anything like this, anytime you want&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> liked this lotion it has a very nice smell which the smell will last on your skin would recommend this product</li>
            <li> was for my girlfriend as a gift, the product let her body with full arome and she love it’s essence as well as I</li>
            <li> I love the warm, woodsy smell of this. I get compliments every time I wear it. Absolutely love this product</li>
            <li> The lotion smells great and was packaged almost in some kind of gift wrap. It arrived quickly and on time. The only complaint I have is that the lotion&#x27;s consistency was almost milky when I got it. Being in Arizona, the summer heat probably had something to do with the thinning factor. It was really liquid-y for about a week, then I got the wild idea to stick it in the fridge and it thickened up back to a proper lotion consistency. Make sure to consider weather effects on these kinds of products!</li>
            <li> Very good Lotion it Leaves you skin very nice I Love The Smell and the shipping doesn&#x27;t last so Long</li>
            <li> Dark Kiss is my favorite but this is a close second.  This is a wonderful product and has met my expectations.</li>
            <li> I love the lotion. It&#x27;s just enough but not too much. It really stays. I like how it fades over time and changes into a great smell for fall or anytime of the year.</li>
            <li> Excellent what I expected, very good fragrance! I loved</li>
            <li> I was bummed when this scent was no longer available in stores. Very pleased to find it on here. Identical to what was in stores!</li>
            <li> I can smell this in the next room, behind closed doors, due to the whole house AC when my wonderful wife applies it.&lt;br /&gt;It is STRONG.&lt;br /&gt;But, she&#x27;s happy. What else do you want?</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for years now - it came closest to replacing my favorite, which they discontinued... Smells great. I don&#x27;t even want to wash my shirts after I wear them, as it makes them smell great and I feel bad about discarding them.</li>
            <li> In won major brownie points by buying this for my lady.  She loves it and it smells very nice on her.</li>
            <li> love love love this scent! a mixture of musk and sultry is how i can describe this. definitely a fall scent but i use it all year round. Lasting power of this is great and and a little goes a long way with smell. One of my favorites that i will always repurchase!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best fragance from Bath &amp; Body Works. I already have the shower gel and the body lotion but I bought this for my sister in law who was looking for it since a few months ago. She is so happy with her present.</li>
            <li> Delicious, delicious.  Love this smell</li>

            <li> I received a Twilight Woods gift set awhile ago on Christmas, and I quickly fell in love with the scent! I typically don&#x27;t like faint scented products, I enjoy stronger scents. But this product scent is in between, it&#x27;s not too strong and not too faint. It&#x27;s the perfect medium and it smells wonderful! Great price for a nice size lotion. Great combined with the Twilight Woods fragrance mists, and body wash.</li>
            <li> This and Midnight Pomegranate are my current favorite fragrances. love them sooo much. Just don&#x27;t use a huge amount. It only takes a little. :)</li>
            <li> I requested and pay a body lotion, but I got a shower gel. I liked the fragrance of the shower gel, but it was not what I ordered.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, has a wonderful smell that lasts all day.</li>
