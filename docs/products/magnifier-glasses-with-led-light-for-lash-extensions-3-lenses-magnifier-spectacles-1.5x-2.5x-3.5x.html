            <li>But this product is Great!</li>
            <li>It magnified perfectly</li>
            <li>These are great if you&#x27;re  beginning to do lashes!</li>
            <li>My father in law was very impressed with how well they worked</li>
            <li>This is a great investment.</li>
            <li>Worked great for a while</li>
            <li>I use these for eyelash extensions and do think that they are great.</li>
            <li>I received this great product for inspection and my unbiased review.</li>
            <li>Good optics.</li>
            <li>Very useful and excellent article.</li>
            <li>Luckily I also ordered another kind that work great!</li>
            <li>Bright light at great lenses.</li>
            <li>He told us how easy it was to see and how the light made it wonderful.</li>
            <li>Packaged nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;***I have received this item in exchange for my honest opinion *</li>
            <li>I myself agree they are nice and make upclose things like sewing or threading a needle easy!</li>
            <li>The magnifier glasses with LED light is a great product for sewing, crafting, and so much more.</li>
            <li>Induces very strong headaches.</li>
            <li>Most estheticians resort to purchasing magnifying glass that is attached to their multipurpose machine or is stand alone decide that can be rolled form one room to another.  </li>
            <li>However, I find these glasses to be a better option.  </li>
            <li>Esthetician can take them off and on during treatments and the really nice feature is that glasses have LED light.  </li>
            <li>They help me see way better</li>
            <li>It is kind of cool and OKey to use.</li>
            <li>love that glasses are protable and can be easily put away on the counter or carried in the pocket.  </li>
            <li>However, I haven&#x27;t had to use the light, but I am glad it&#x27;s there if necessary.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t fit well and didn&#x27;t stay on my face during treatments.</li>
            <li>They are comfortable as well.</li>
            <li>And, there was no LED light on it.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth it!</li>
            <li>Easier to clean between the treatments too....</li>
            <li>battery dies quick and cost mosley than the glasses itself</li>
            <li>I bought it for lash extensions, but the light wasn&#x27;t bright enough, and the lenses seemed to be very flimsy and fall off.  </li>
            <li>AMAZING especially for the cost!</li>
            <li>I can choose from 6 Different Lenses and It has an LED light at the top.</li>
            <li>However, it is useful, without the lenses, for my sewing kit.</li>
            <li>I love to be protable nad move equipment and products on a short notice.  </li>
            <li>This piece fell apart the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>The light was helpful and i was glad it came with different magnifying glasses it definitely helped out.</li>
            <li>Delivered fast.</li>
            <li>Decent for the price.</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s even a little light on them!</li>
            <li>These are ok if you don&#x27;t have to look down; they fall off your face!</li>
            <li>they came in and sometimes the light would turn on from the lid&#x27;s closure and run down the battery.</li>
            <li>For that reason, I find this a perfect tool for my practice, not to mention that it is also much less expensive than multi-purpose machine.  </li>
            <li>The object must be up close to see cant see far away .</li>
            <li>Too big for normal face</li>
            <li>; :) I must say of you have bad bad eye sight , they may not work as well as my husband couldn&#x27;t see anything with them, but someone with around normal or not horrible eye sight would love these&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>only issue that I have, is if you use this product often, in which case I do, by removing the lenses frequently you create a lesser grip on the area in which the lenses are held on by.</li>
            <li>So if the room is dark so client can relax during the treatment, a little light can provide just enough help without blasting their eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> battery dies quick and cost mosley than the glasses itself</li>
            <li> I purchased these for myself to wear while I&#x27;m doing eyelash extensions and they are GREAT! I can see every little hidden eyelash. This is a great investment. I like that it does come with three different lenses.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for using a Magnifying Lamp when I do Lash Extensions. I always find that it gets in the way or I have to adjust. But this product is Great! I can choose from 6 Different Lenses and It has an LED light at the top. However, I haven&#x27;t had to use the light, but I am glad it&#x27;s there if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue that I have, is if you use this product often, in which case I do, by removing the lenses frequently you create a lesser grip on the area in which the lenses are held on by.</li>
            <li> A necessary tool to have for eyelash extensions</li>
            <li> Induces very strong headaches. It serves the purpose if using for a very short amount of time.</li>
            <li> It magnified perfectly</li>
            <li> These glasses arrived with the nose piece broken. They didn&#x27;t fit well and didn&#x27;t stay on my face during treatments. DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> Worked great for a while but then the lense started falling out a lot and eventually broke.</li>
            <li> I use these for eyelash extensions and do think that they are great. You have the different options for lenses that suit you.  They are comfortable as well. I recommend!</li>
            <li> Most estheticians resort to purchasing magnifying glass that is attached to their multipurpose machine or is stand alone decide that can be rolled form one room to another.

            <li> Although I  really  looked forward to using these glasses, I  found them to be difficult to use. The lens kept falling as I adjusted them and I stored them in the box they came in and sometimes the light would turn on from the lid&#x27;s closure and run down the battery. I&#x27;m not really happy with this product. Waste of money!</li>
            <li> This piece fell apart the first time I used it. And, there was no LED light on it.  I feel deceived. 😟</li>
            <li> I returned  product immediately , The clip that holds the magna slide was too small ,- does not fit and broke :(</li>

            <li> Too big for normal face</li>
            <li> Bought these for my daughter who&#x27;s just starting her eyelash extension business; she loves them.</li>
            <li> These are great if you&#x27;re  beginning to do lashes! They help me see way better and there&#x27;s even a little light on them!</li>
            <li> I can see the smallest detail, however the glass pops out while working</li>
            <li> Very useful and excellent article.</li>
            <li> I did not like the product I want to return it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even give one star. I Bought two and both broke when I placed the lens onto the glasses.</li>
            <li> It is kind of cool and OKey to use.</li>
            <li> I bought these to take the place of my magnifying loop that i use in my treatment room. I was disappointed when I put them on because they just slide right off. Luckily I also ordered another kind that work great!</li>
            <li> Decent for the price.</li>
            <li> Delivered fast. Packaged nice. Bright light at great lenses. The object must be up close to see cant see far away . Gave them 4 stars haven&#x27;t used them yet and they seem fragile</li>
            <li> AMAZING especially for the cost! Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> Slips off the nose. Wont stay on the face. Not handy if going to be used to apply to apply eyelash extensions. Jamaica 💛💚❤️</li>
            <li> These are ok if you don&#x27;t have to look down; they fall off your face! Not great for lash extensions.</li>
            <li> As lightweight as it appeared in the offer, yet not as fragile as I feared. Should hold up well with care. Good optics.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t stay in place and a bit heavy on the nose bridge.</li>
            <li> This work well ! The definitely provided help with lash extensions. The light was helpful and i was glad it came with different magnifying glasses it definitely helped out. I recommend these for people who are just learning how to do lash extensions. I received this great product for inspection and my unbiased review.</li>
            <li> The magnifier glasses with LED light is a great product for sewing, crafting, and so much more. My father in law was very impressed with how well they worked and although i couldn&#x27;t use them, we gave them to him and he loves them. He told us how easy it was to see and how the light made it wonderful. I myself agree they are nice and make upclose things like sewing or threading a needle easy! &amp;#62; :) I must say of you have bad bad eye sight , they may not work as well as my husband couldn&#x27;t see anything with them, but someone with around normal or not horrible eye sight would love these&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I have received this item in exchange for my honest opinion *(</li>
