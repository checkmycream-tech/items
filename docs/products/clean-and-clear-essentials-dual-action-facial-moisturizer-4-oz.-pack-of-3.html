            <li>But guess what at that moment I made my life happy!!!!</li>
            <li>Thank You dear manufacture for this great product!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a GREAT moisturizing lotion, but not if you break out a lot &amp; want prevention-</li>
            <li>This is a great product without all the drying to the skin.</li>
            <li>If it came in a tinted variety with more SPF protection, it would be beyond perfect.   </li>
            <li>If you use this  (spf 15) and a spf make up you should be good for sun protection.</li>

            <li>If your skin is a little damp when you apply there is a nice cooling/tingling sensation on your skin.</li>

            <li> Ok my face was always clean, thank God. However I had huuuuuge problems with my back and butt area. Was so frustrated. So many pimples and redness,,, One day I saw this product in Walmart and just tought well its hella cheap so even if not gonna work not so much of money spent. But guess what at that moment I made my life happy!!!! It&#x27;s worked immediatelly! I applyed on my back and next day it was less red. I applyed on mornings and evenings. Took me like 3 days to clean up the skin! Wow!!! So I went and purchased 5 more just in case. And few days ago found them in my closet expired now. I totally forgot about them because I didn&#x27;t need to use that anymore. So just try it and it will help!!! Worked for me!!! Locve it!!!! Thank You dear manufacture for this great product!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a simple concept. Prevents overnight pop-ups without drying out your skin. I had this product in my drawer and never used to use it. I realized it was about to expire so I gave it another shot and realized I actually wake up the next morning with slightly smoother skin and no new pimples. I really endorse this product!</li>
            <li> I USE THIS EVERYDAY BEFORE YOU GO TO SLEEP ,, MY SKIN ALWAYS LOOKS BETTER IT DOES WORK</li>
            <li> This lotion works really nice- it&#x27;s very moisturizing. It did help manage break outs, but it definitely didn&#x27;t prevent them. I prefer the Acne Control Moisturizer that looks like this in the silver pump bottle- that one definitely prevents break outs. However, that one isn&#x27;t moisturizing. So, I guess you choose your battle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is real nice though if you just want a middle of the day lotion. My husband likes it (since he obviously doesn&#x27;t wear make up &amp; uses lotion throughout the day). It doesn&#x27;t irritate his shaved skin or anything &amp; keeps his skin soft while adding a little break out prevention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a GREAT moisturizing lotion, but not if you break out a lot &amp; want prevention- I&#x27;ll put it that way.</li>
            <li> This is a very light oil-free moisturizer. Light fragrance. Light feel. And it is absorbed immediately. I find that the fragrance is pleasing. It smells clean and fresh. If your skin is a little damp when you apply there is a nice cooling/tingling sensation on your skin. It&#x27;s nothing to be alarmed about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the dispenser and is convenient to take with me when I travel. I lock the pump by twisting it and it&#x27;s ready to go. I throw one in my gym bag, purse, work bag, etc. However, note that it&#x27;s too big to bring to the airport in a carry on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not the only moisturizer or product I use so I&#x27;m not sure if it clears my skin. It doesn&#x27;t cause any outbreaks that I&#x27;m aware of though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely can&#x27;t beat the price or convenience of Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save program.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because the other popular brand that you order off of TV is WAY too expensive. This clean &amp; clear works better then the TV brand. Its non oily has most of the same ingredients as the TV stuff and most of all doesn&#x27;t add to clogged pores like the TV one did when its not supposed to! I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I use this stuff with the Clean &amp; Clear sensitive skin face wash &amp; toner. I swear.. It&#x27;s a miracle product. I used this during my most stressful semester and it worked amazing and helped prevent anything from popping up. I still did get those huge period hormonal pimple/zit (usually 1 big one) around my period. But that was it. My skin got really bad in high school. Then it got really clear for a while, then bad again. I can now say my skin has never felt and been better thanks to clean &amp; clear!</li>
            <li> There are so many moisturizers that aren&#x27;t half as good and cost more than double the price, not to mention not nearly as much product.    I use this and/or another clear care moisturizer which I also love. If it came in a tinted variety with more SPF protection, it would be beyond perfect.   If you use this  (spf 15) and a spf make up you should be good for sun protection. Or you can dab on a little sun screen.   Still you can&#x27;t beat it for the price and quality.       Pros:    More product for your money  Good quality  Helps keep skin clear and moisturized  Good price      Cons:    Could be doubled in SPF protection (15 vs 30)</li>
            <li> This is a great product without all the drying to the skin. It has helped my complexion clear up with good hygine &amp; daily use. I love how refreshed it makes my skin feel. After cleaning my face, I apply it all over, especially in the breakout prone areas. I give it an 8 on the scale of (1-10) 1 being poor &amp; 10 the highest rating. The product is very reasonable. I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I use this product and shipped some to my son. I dont use anything else to clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear make up, and I don&#x27;t have any issues with my face, but I use this stuff frequently. If you aren&#x27;t much for skin care, I recommend this. It keeps your face clear, bags down and looking decent (just this side of 50, lots of bad habits, lol and hate make-up and any of the beauty care stuff).</li>
            <li> Bought the three pack, but the product expires in two months!! Not helpful. When I go to buy this at target, for example, it doesn&#x27;t expire for a few years. Disappointed that I was sent something expiring so soon. I won&#x27;t possibly go through three bottles in two months.</li>
            <li> This is the product I really needed. Love it so much and would recommend it to friends. it also arrived in time from the seller. It is very affordable.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.  It clears up blemishes quickly.</li>
            <li> my go-to facial moisturizer for years</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite moisturizer for my skin type! (Which is very susceptible to salicylic acid)</li>
            <li> this is a  great moisturizer,  i have used a few to find the perfect one,   and this is it.  its non greasy, doesnt give your face a shiny oily look,  and it goes on so smoothly.  i&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s and have been using this product for over 5 years. My facial skin is very dry and sensitive. In the past, I have made several attempts to switch to other products that claimed to moisturize dry skin, including major brand-name products that are many times more expensive than this one. However, they are still too dry for my skin and my facial skin was allergic to them. My face skin either starts to peel off after a few days or starts to become very dry in the middle of the day. I had to switch back to this product. This is the best product I have found so far. I live in the midwest and have to survive long, cold winter every year. The product keeps my face moisturized even in harsh winters. I never experienced any kind of allergy with this product. I also like the pump bottle design. It&#x27;s very easy to carry around without spilling.</li>
            <li> No need for fancy and high priced moisturizers. This is my daily and it works great.</li>
            <li> I was using a super expensive (for me, at least) zinc based cream which is apparently good for removing acne and spots and whatever according to countless testimonies. Aaaaaand i still got recurring bouts of acne on the regular. They were mostly in my T-zone. I chose this moisturizer at random, and i had enough faith in the brand from my teens. It has been wonderful on my forehead especially which is almost acne and pimple free and getting better by the day. Initially, my cheeks which are dry-ish feel tight and i can&#x27;t really tell if i even applied anything, but the feeling goes and my skin feels good. The only downfall is that it has not been helpful on my nose at all. I guess i could also be trying to figure out my skin and its weirdness, but I&#x27;m sticking to it because there isn&#x27;t a pimple to be seen , anywhere!</li>
