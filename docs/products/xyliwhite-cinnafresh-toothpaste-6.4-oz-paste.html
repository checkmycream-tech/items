            <li>Awesome JOB!!</li>
            <li>Best toothpaste I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Best toothpaste i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Keep up the good work guys!  </li>
            <li>Tastes great.  </li>
            <li>This tooth paste taste great and whitens your teeth.</li>
            <li>This product is great for healthy and breathtaking  mouth&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Good Deal.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste has a nice cinnamon flavor to it and my husband</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to brush and know that I&#x27;m not putting Fluoride into my body.</li>
            <li>Just make sure u have some mouth wash to go along with it,because it does not keep it cinnamon fresh all day,but is great because it doesn&#x27;t have floride in it.</li>
            <li>I use to like this toothpaste but not any more.</li>
            <li>Better health</li>
            <li>I also take Resveritrol for better memory.</li>
            <li>and I enjoy brushing our teeth with this toothpaste!</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ve tried almost all the xylitol oral care products that I have been able to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perhaps the formula of that (which includes peppermint oil) masks it better.  </li>
            <li>Whatever the case, the mint flavor tastes better to me than this cinnamon.  </li>
            <li>Spry cinnamon is my favorite, because it has a stronger and tastier flavor of cinnamon, which I love, so I find myself combining XyliWhite with it or another flavor.  </li>
            <li>Fluoride Free</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad it is more natural than others out there; but I purchased it because it has no fluoride in it.  </li>
            <li>However, more recently, I&#x27;ve been just making my own homemade toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using a lot of xylitol products and like what they can do in terms of adjusting the pH of the mouth, making your teeth feel slippery clean, and providing a \\&quot;food\\&quot; for the bacteria in your mouth that they cannot digest.  </li>
            <li>The flavor is nice, it&#x27;s a cross between pastes and gel, more gel than anything.</li>
            <li>My mouth ALWAYS felt clean and fresh after brushing my teeth with the Xyliwhite Cinnafresh Toothpaste.</li>
            <li>My family are all complaining to me about these that they don&#x27;t even make their mouths feel fresh or clean after use.</li>
            <li>they were a quick shipper and the product was as described.  </li>
            <li>This was a great deal on this product, much less than it would have cost in the store.</li>
            <li>Since I liked it so much, I&#x27;ve made new purchases for each of my family member&#x27;s home.</li>
            <li>NOW Foods must be doing something right.</li>
            <li>I will always buy this product as long as it stays cheap!</li>
            <li>I really like non-fluoride toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I thought a change would be nice, but going back to our regular brand.</li>
            <li>There were some days I forgot to brush my teeth for a second time, but didn&#x27;t need to because the clean feeling lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I can see fewer trips to the dentist in the future, this gets my teeth actually clean and does remove plaque as it claims.</li>
            <li>Made my teeth and my son&#x27;s teeth very sensitive, had to quit using.</li>
            <li>the price was far and I would recommend them to my friends</li>
            <li>Previously, I would have given this product a higher rating, but the last tube I ordered had a distinct moldy taste.  </li>
            <li>I wish it were otherwise, because in general, cinnamon is our preferred flavor.  </li>
            <li>I have been buying natural toothpastes without fluoride for years, and thought I would try something different for my family.</li>
            <li>For the price, however, this product is far healthier than the commercial, flouride brands.</li>

            <li> I use to like this toothpaste but not any more. The taste is not like it use to be. My mouth ALWAYS felt clean and fresh after brushing my teeth with the Xyliwhite Cinnafresh Toothpaste. But not anymore. It doesn&#x27;t even have a cinnamon taste. I&#x27;m sorry but I will not be purchasing this toothpaste anymore!</li>
            <li> I really like non-fluoride toothpaste.  Better health and I stay away from flu shots,  because it contains murcury and aluminum.    I also take Resveritrol for better memory.</li>
            <li> This was a great deal on this product, much less than it would have cost in the store. Good Deal.</li>
            <li> Tastes great.  It&#x27;s hard to find a decent tasting NON floride toothpaste!  Keep up the good work guys!  Awesome JOB!!</li>
            <li> they were a quick shipper and the product was as described.  the price was far and I would recommend them to my friends</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste I have ever used. I used Xyliwhite for a year straight and nothing went wrong with my teeth. There were some days I forgot to brush my teeth for a second time, but didn&#x27;t need to because the clean feeling lasts all day. I switched to Tom&#x27;s after running out and immediately got cavities... NOW Foods must be doing something right.</li>
            <li> Previously, I would have given this product a higher rating, but the last tube I ordered had a distinct moldy taste.  I tossed it and and ordered Spry&#x27;s xylitol/cinnamon toothpaste.  I have had problems with some other Now products and currently tend to avoid them.</li>
            <li> Made my teeth and my son&#x27;s teeth very sensitive, had to quit using. Caused sensitivity worse than any toothpaste I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste has a nice cinnamon flavor to it and my husband and I enjoy brushing our teeth with this toothpaste! It works well and I&#x27;m so glad it is more natural than others out there; but I purchased it because it has no fluoride in it.  We switch between this cinnamon one and their peppermint one after every tube. However, more recently, I&#x27;ve been just making my own homemade toothpaste. We will continue switching back and forth between all 3 (the two flavors of this XyliWhite toothpaste and my homemade toothpaste).</li>
            <li> I just ran out and now I don&#x27;t have any... I need to reorder.  Help!  Help!  Help!  Need my Xyliwhite!</li>
            <li> This is advertised as &amp;#34;Paste,&amp;#34; yet it is a gel. Not a huge fan of the gel, so I came here to buy this &amp;#34;paste&amp;#34; which is more expensive than the same gel from another seller on here. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using a lot of xylitol products and like what they can do in terms of adjusting the pH of the mouth, making your teeth feel slippery clean, and providing a \\&quot;food\\&quot; for the bacteria in your mouth that they cannot digest.  I think I&#x27;ve tried almost all the xylitol oral care products that I have been able to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the flavor of this toothpaste doesn&#x27;t work for me.  While I do like cinnamon, this flavor is not a \\&quot;clean\\&quot; cinnamon, but has a slightly strange \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; or earthy taste.  That taste probably comes from the tea tree oil -just a guess, because I know what that smells and tastes like, and the offensive flavor resembles it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Xyliwhite also makes a Platinum Mint toothpaste which has similar ingredients, but it does not have the \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; flavor.  Perhaps the formula of that (which includes peppermint oil) masks it better.  Whatever the case, the mint flavor tastes better to me than this cinnamon.  I wish it were otherwise, because in general, cinnamon is our preferred flavor.  Both flavors by this brand claim 25% xylitol content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re checking out xylitol oral care products, you might do well to try both flavors -as well as other brands- to find your favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Xyliwhite Cinnamint ingredients: (this list is taken from the tube I have, and differs from what is listed as ingredients on the product page)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;water&lt;br /&gt;xylitol&lt;br /&gt;hydrated silica&lt;br /&gt;glycerin&lt;br /&gt;sorbitol&lt;br /&gt;sodium bicarbonate&lt;br /&gt;sodium carbonate&lt;br /&gt;sodium coco-sulfate&lt;br /&gt;carrageenan&lt;br /&gt;cinnamon leaf oil&lt;br /&gt;tea tree leaf oil&lt;br /&gt;papain&lt;br /&gt;potassium sorbate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Xyliwhite Platinum Mint ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;water&lt;br /&gt;xylitol&lt;br /&gt;hydrated silica&lt;br /&gt;sodium bicarbonate&lt;br /&gt;glycerin&lt;br /&gt;sorbitol&lt;br /&gt;natural mint flavor&lt;br /&gt;peppermint oil&lt;br /&gt;sodium coco-sulfate&lt;br /&gt;carrageenan&lt;br /&gt;papain&lt;br /&gt;tea tree leaf oil&lt;br /&gt;sodium carbonate&lt;br /&gt;potassium sorbate</li>
            <li> Fluoride Free, that&#x27;s why I bought it. Since I liked it so much, I&#x27;ve made new purchases for each of my family member&#x27;s home. It&#x27;s nice to brush and know that I&#x27;m not putting Fluoride into my body.</li>
            <li> This tooth paste taste great and whitens your teeth. Plus it does not have all the poisons the other leading brands have.</li>

            <li> I have been buying natural toothpastes without fluoride for years, and thought I would try something different for my family. I purchased 3 tubes cinnafresh and 3 of the mint. My family are all complaining to me about these that they don&#x27;t even make their mouths feel fresh or clean after use. I thought a change would be nice, but going back to our regular brand.</li>
