            <li>This stuff is great</li>

            <li>/&gt;Very nice and soothing for sunburns too!</li>

            <li>Wonderful, I got this product quickly and everything is good as the one I bought at the shop!  </li>
            <li>Plus the packaging is so great, very appealing to either sex.</li>
            <li>but for the great price and the wonderful benefit of this product, I feel it is completely worth it.</li>
            <li>I have always had good skin, but of course nature takes its toll.</li>
            <li>I was delighted to see it on Amazon at an acceptable price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>making this a good investment (</li>
            <li>Take in consideration that a good nutrition and lots of water is gonna give the product</li>
            <li>Smell is also good .</li>
            <li>You get a good amount of product for what you play for as well.</li>
            <li>but it work perfectly good</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve found it to be a good adition to my moisturing routine.</li>
            <li>I got it about a week ago and its a good standalone moisturizer while being a toner as well.</li>
            <li>but it is not unpleasant in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, without considering the smell that can bother some, this product work magnificently !</li>
            <li>It is very light and makes my skin feel great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to report it sort of works like a very light styling gel or mousse.</li>
            <li>Ships  quickly!!!</li>
            <li>And since Asians make some of the best things ever, I figured they would have some concoctions worth trying.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I very satisfied whit this product I noticed the chance in my skin after 3 days of using it .</li>

            <li>Glad I purchased this!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>OMG this thing is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>I can deal with it and at the amazing price...</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>but nothing amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>I used this for 4 days in a row and the boyfriend remarked on how bright and lovely my skin looks.</li>
            <li>Ahh this stuff is so nice to put on my face and neck.</li>
            <li>This is more of a essence/serum type product, but may be a good moisturizer for oil type people.</li>
            <li>kind of sticky.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and the product came in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>u liked</li>
            <li>so much make very happy</li>
            <li>Holy grail item, smells nice, feels nice</li>
            <li>Nice light serum that&#x27;s great for layering underneath moisturizer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m loving this stuff.</li>
            <li>I can put this on with my acne products to layer, or just add a touch of moisture on its own.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own</li>
            <li>I also own the Shirojyun (whitening).</li>
            <li>I also purchased some 5 layer cotton squares to make my own mask out of.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>Most moisturizers just don&#x27;t satisfy my skin, but if I use this first then apply moisturizer, my skin feels great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure to buy more once my bottle runs out (but it might take years!)</li>
            <li>I just started using the Hydrator and am thus far extremely impressed.</li>
            <li>Great economical version of SK II</li>
            <li>and I agree with most skincare experts that you don&#x27;t need a toner if that&#x27;s the kind of toner you are using.  </li>
            <li>And YES that was true!!</li>
            <li>I know that&#x27;s too good to be true</li>
            <li>I knew it was going to be a very light product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>I will for sure be repurchasing this when I run out.</li>
            <li>and I use more than the amount recommended.</li>
            <li>and I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I had to experiment to see how many drops I should use.</li>
            <li>I liked how light it felt on my skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m glad it works for some people though.</li>
            <li>Like a miracle, I am going to order more as I don&#x27;t want to run out of it</li>
            <li>I combine a drop (eye drop amount) with my favorite daytime moisturizer.</li>
            <li>sure looks pretty\\</li>
            <li>I apply this Hada Labo before my daily moisturizer and it works just great! :)</li>
            <li>I top off with CeraVe, but  I have switched to most of the beauty products offered by this line.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so satisfied with this product that I sent the company a \\&quot;thank</li>
            <li>I ran across Rohto Hadalabo Gokujyn Hyaluronic Acid Lotion when I was in Japan in the spring of 2012, and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>It is always sitting on top of your skin</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s considered quite cheap, but it is one of the most effective drug store items I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>The oil in my T-zone has become more manageable too.</li>
            <li>use it every morning and love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product because it makes my skin supple and radiant.</li>
            <li>even with the best of the products i&#x27;d tried, these red patches were ever-present.)  </li>
            <li>i love this product for its results, but the icing on the cake is the price and amount needed per use.  </li>
            <li>then *pat* it into my skin, making sure to get my lips, eyes, and neck as well.  </li>
            <li>it helps with absorption and you get more product into the places you need it.  </li>

            <li>it helps with absorption and you get more product into the places you need it.  </li>
            <li>This soothes my skin like nothing happened and I just absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I love this toner.  </li>
            <li>However, in Asia, a toner is more of a clarifier (skin balancer) and moisture-inducer.  </li>
            <li>Being using this for a year, and i love it.</li>
            <li>and it moisturized it to the point where i could safely apply foundation.</li>
            <li>That gave me more confidence in buying this product.</li>
            <li>Okay for summer.</li>
            <li>but this product seems to help a LOT more.</li>
            <li>complexion is more elastic, 100% recommended.</li>
            <li>it was sitting on top of it.</li>
            <li>Great customer service and fast shipping though...</li>
            <li>I like this, but I don&#x27;t absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Either way, I will be buying more of this</li>
            <li>After reading many a review online about hyaluronic acid serums I decided that I needed to try one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price: Midrange, $20 for the 170mL bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even my acne is looking better.</li>
            <li>One thing: For me, I needed a bit more than one pea sized amount like what the directions said.</li>
            <li>I read about this lotion in a Top 10 beauty product review and have been using it for about a month.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve started using it on my neck and chest and my skin feels so much better.</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>but I can feel and see my skin looking better every day with the use of this</li>
            <li>/&gt;And if you&#x27;re a reader and follower of Chizu Saeki&#x27;s The Japanese Skincare Revolution, this stuff is perfect for moisture masks!</li>
            <li>more thing, there is a newer version of this lotion.</li>
            <li>Maybe if I had purchased it during the summer instead of winter, it would have worked better.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this gel.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a hydrating toner than a lotion, and that&#x27;s how I use it in my skincare routine.  </li>
            <li>and I have to say that I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I massage it into my face and pat until it gets a bit sticky, then I apply my serum and moisturizer and my face is sooooo smooth!</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Better than the expesive serums on the market like Lancome.</li>
            <li>It scent and alcohol free so perfect for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Everything ok with shipping and delivery time.</li>
            <li>Love this HA...</li>
            <li>The best facial lotion that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t want to use two moisturizers to make me feel even more greasy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the best toner I&#x27;ve ever used, and it certainly doesn&#x27;t have enough horsepower to work as a lotion unless I lived in a much more humid climate, but it&#x27;s good value for money.  </li>
            <li>Great price for high quality product.</li>
            <li>At first I loved this</li>
            <li>although that did a great job of moisturizing, I must say its moisturizing is far more improved with this lotion.</li>
            <li>(But the texture of the skin remains smooth) and because the smell is &amp;#34;plastic-y&amp;#34; smelling although very light.</li>
            <li>Very good product especially for the price</li>
            <li>This is very gentle and perfect for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My 16 year old son has started using it on his exzema, and he&#x27;s happy with it.</li>
            <li>I noticed my skin becoming dryer and the moisturizers I was using wasn&#x27;t helping in the slightest.</li>
            <li>you are under 25 yrs old), but if you are using this as a homemade mask then its great.</li>
            <li>I stuck to the light formula for years because of this, but feel oily more often</li>
            <li>but it for sure is a great product) while also keeping a healthy level of moisture donated to your skin by the present atmosphere.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s able to provide light moisture and after having used it for awhile</li>
            <li>But it is great for making it soft.</li>
            <li>When I DO remember to smooth it over my face, neck, and chest (day and night) for more than 3 days in a row, my boyfriend always remarks on how my skin looks &amp;#34;brighter&amp;#34; and smoother.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no miracle but is a great addition to many dry skin routines, and I have had the most luck with it when using it after a chemical (10% AHA) exfoliator.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Application: It spreads really easily.</li>
            <li>This definitely seems more like a toner than a lotion, but it works great nonetheless.</li>
            <li>I researched the best reviewed and inexpensive product online and came down with Hadalabo.</li>
            <li>After cleansing, I pour a dime-sized amount into my clean palm, rub my hands together to warm it up, and then pat the product onto my skin until fully absorbed.</li>
            <li>I also notice that the fine lines that would appear in the morning from my face being tugged and pulled over night by my pillow are no longer an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yes, it works perfect on black skin, too.</li>
            <li>I works fine as a toner, it&#x27;s too liquid to use it as a lotion.</li>
            <li>It gets absorbed quickly and keeps my skin nicely moisturized till morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I like that this is a very light but easily absorbed hydrater for my face.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;plump\\&quot; fine lines also smooth&#x27;s out and firms your skin</li>
            <li>No fragrance which is a huge plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My face has been acne free as well since using this.</li>
            <li>It is such a great product that I fear the price may go up.</li>
            <li>It is fantastic, adds and keeps moisture all day.</li>
            <li>I wish I could read the colorful bottle, but I&#x27;m sure it says it was made for</li>
            <li>The moisturizer is great and thankfully packaged with English language.</li>
            <li>there are a ton of youtube videos if you need detailed steps.)ow used it twice per day for 6 weeks on my face, body, and hair</li>
            <li>there are a ton of youtube videos if you need detailed steps.)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really important to realize that this is NOT the toner you are probably used to in USA.  </li>
            <li>I thought, hmm, I already have the moist version in the mail, why not try the light version this time.</li>
            <li>Make my face smooth and hydrated .</li>
            <li>Rub a pea-sized amount in your hands to warm it up, pat gently all over your face until it dries.</li>
            <li>Its light and does it job.</li>
            <li>and smooth it on your face and pat pat pat</li>
            <li>the product is all around fantastic.</li>
            <li>This assists product makes my skin so smooth.</li>
            <li>I am very grateful to have such a wonderful product that I can use.</li>
            <li>no alcohol, good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and so consequently, I&#x27;ve gone through my first bottle probably more quickly than most -  </li>
            <li>Its not sticky, it absorbs quick, applies easy, and makes my skin bouncy.</li>
            <li>New favorite lotion!</li>
            <li>Honestly this brand was highly suggested to me by a friend and she suggested to use this as a toner .</li>
            <li>This is a great, super lightweight moisturizing Japanese lotion.  </li>
            <li>It is the original staff from Hadalabo.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to receive my first bottle and was pleased.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer itself is good on its own but because it isn&#x27;t a cream base but a liquid/acid it makes it very ideal for turning it into a mask.</li>
            <li>I know a lot of people is probably using this as a at home sheet mask, which is great, and it is definitely worth the money, even if you are only using this as a toner it is still pretty good on the skin, it is light weight and watery, however i believe this is a product more suitable for younger skin that doesn&#x27;t need much to look beautiful(meaning</li>
            <li>So great for dry skin..</li>
            <li>This lotion formula is more like a light gel and feels very moisturizing, whereas the shirojyun is just watery.</li>
            <li>This one makes my face not dry , its good for my skin . .  </li>
            <li>The lotion itself is quite good, I couldn&#x27;t rate it fair right now, since I&#x27;ve been using it for a too short period, but seems ok, however nothing more special than any other moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I brought it with natural republic&#x27;s aloe vera 92%gel, and it is much better!</li>
            <li>Absorbed easily and quickly and seemed to hydrate skin well.</li>
            <li>I learned this the hard way lol!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s especially pleasant on the delicate under-eye area.</li>
            <li>With as many products as I&#x27;ve tried over the years...and believe me,  there&#x27;s been a whole lot...</li>
            <li>Noting that Japanese women seem to always have gorgeous skin</li>
            <li>The full list of ingredients is as follows:  Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, PPG-10 Methyl Glucose Ether, Disodium Succinate, Methyl Paraben, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Succinic Acid, Sodium Acetylated</li>
            <li>Used AM and PM, my skin is nice and soft and glowy, with no irritation.</li>
            <li>I follow this with a moisturizer and my skin is very grateful.  :-)</li>
            <li>and I love that I don&#x27;t have to use too much in order to apply the product evenly,</li>
            <li>Otherwise, you&#x27;re not getting full use out of this wondrous liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Is easy to apply and it feels thicker than water but no smell or funny \\&quot;after</li>
            <li>Hyaluronic acid may be great, but with parabens and all this other junk, no way I&#x27;m putting this on my face.</li>
            <li>There was even a little gift in the parcel that delighted my daughter :)</li>
            <li>It is fresh and perfect for sensitive dry skin</li>
            <li>This review is for Hada Labo Tokyo Replenishing Hydrator [Super Hyaluronic Acid].</li>
            <li>/&gt;2- Soaks in quickly so that you can follow it almost immediately with additional moisturizer, primer or foundation</li>
            <li>Luckily i had brought this with me…</li>
            <li>my face is much more soft and smooth after using this.</li>
            <li>this product is very suitable for dry skin or in winner.</li>
            <li>It is absolute truth, you only need 3 drops, after my face toner, and before moisturizer or serum, it completely moisture barriers the skin, making the products very much more effective!  </li>
            <li>After patting it on, it makes your skin feel smooth and LOOK really hydrated.</li>
            <li>This is kind of like a cross between a lotion and a toner.</li>
            <li>I decided against putting this on my face, since what we put on our skin can be absorbed by the blood.</li>
            <li>After learning about Hada Labo from a popular online beauty site and prior to purchase, I researched the product and it&#x27;s company.</li>
            <li>I felt it was worth</li>
            <li>Well worth it</li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s no alcohol or mineral oil, no artificial colors, either.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It really hydrates my skin, makes it feel nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Totally worth buying.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t encountered a Hadalabo skin product I don&#x27;t love so far</li>
            <li>It will begin to feel sticky, but keep patting until your skin has completely absorbed it-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m addicted to this great product!  </li>
            <li>(Especially if you&#x27;re the kind of girl who drops $50+ on 1oz jars of moisturizers and whatnot!)&lt;br /&gt;I have semi-sensitive skin and this has no odor and doesn&#x27;t in any way irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>We went a very long stretch of time without having any flare ups and not having to resort to stronger medicated lotions, I am very pleased and will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li>I love to put this on about every other wash for more moisture.</li>
            <li>on usage:  i&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s been covered by many other reviewers, but you use this product after makeup removal and cleansing but before moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>on usage:  i&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s been covered by many other reviewers, but you use this product after makeup removal and cleansing but before moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m happy to say that my psoriasis is completely gone, leaving no trace it ever existed in the first place, and hada labo is the only product i tried with both immediate and long-term efficacy.  </li>
            <li>Then apply the mask to your face, doing this allows the lotion to soak in versus drying out right away from the air.</li>
            <li>It soaks in right away.</li>
            <li>and this helps provide and lock in moisture right after washing my face.  </li>
            <li>I use this right after my cleanser as a toner.</li>
            <li>Even people who cannot read Japanese characters can appreciate the look of this product, very cool!</li>
            <li>Then I decided to give this a go because I know how good hyaluronic acid is for your skin, especially dry skin.</li>
            <li>It is a great lotion for dry and sensitive skin .</li>
            <li>I have the whole hada labo line and this is a great toner, but do not use it for your moisturizing needs, buy the milk lotion or the cream to complete the process because this is only a toner.</li>
            <li>First of all, the line was introduced in 2010 and became an immediate success.</li>
            <li>, most of those reviewers are using the product incorrectly, are ignorant about hyaluronic acid generally, or haven&#x27;t even used</li>
            <li>Only 3 drops were used for my whole face, but it was so light and refreshing with no fragrance or burn.</li>
            <li>(I purchased Selena brand on Amazon, highly recommend for masks as the layers are soft and peel apart very easily.</li>
            <li>Great first step in the series for dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone 2 days without any new eruptions which is huge for me.</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s plain to see why hadalabo is so popular!</li>
            <li>and this is certainly a price I don&#x27;t mind paying!</li>
            <li>I have kind of dry skin and</li>
            <li>I used this product only 2 days and have noticed a great improvement, all the pores are tiny to gone.</li>
            <li>This is super gentle and has never bothered my skin (just for reference, CeraVe hydrating cleanser burns my face.)</li>
            <li>(they&#x27;re the same thing as Sheet Masks but more economical).</li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>my friends recommended it to me, I like it very much.</li>
            <li>this and am never going back: it absorbs so much faster than the light formula and leaves my skin with a much more tacky feel no matter how much I put</li>
            <li>and I must say it works very very well.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>Received product much earlier than expect and was greatly pleased</li>
            <li>Love it, especially to use as a mask</li>
            <li>Works very well!  </li>
            <li>It is exactly what I</li>
            <li>However this product seems different and more than lives up to its claims.</li>
            <li>This is not a lotion, do your research first.</li>
            <li>It has helped my skin so much!</li>
            <li>First I thought, what?</li>
            <li>but more of a product I used back in kindergarden</li>
            <li>Very hydrating and soothing!</li>
            <li>the next morning, my skin was a lot better.</li>
            <li>I saw gradual improvement in the first week.</li>
            <li>I finally don&#x27;t have any more flaking or peeling (from retin-a).</li>
            <li>When I put this on my skin, it feels sticky at first.</li>
            <li>It has a very liquidity texture and is not oily at all!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty cooling.</li>
            <li>and it lasted the whole time!</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product for dry skin!!!</li>
            <li>and like I said, 1-3 drops are more than enough for the whole face.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need more than one or two shakes of the bottle to get enough liquid to cover my whole face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used various products that contain Hyaluronic Acid as well as pure HA on my skin for several years all with good results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always use pure rose water and cornflower water as a toner (never ever did I use a non natural toner especially those one with alcohol in it that strips moisture out of your skin).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sometimes i put more conventional moisturizer over this product once it has been absorbed.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s going to take me a LONG while to get through this whole bottle, and I love it.</li>
            <li>I noticed improvement right after 1 use due to the great hyration to my skin, this is the first Hyaluronic Acid product I have tried, and will continue using it until I find something better, but the chance of that is unlikely.</li>
            <li>I use it in combination with Keihl&#x27;s facial fuel get for a deep hydrating mask with amazing results.</li>
            <li>Really like this toner.</li>
            <li>Surprisely, it didn&#x27;t hurt and was very moist with no fragrance.</li>
            <li>This has not broken me out once</li>
            <li>It is very liquidy</li>
            <li>and it gets really sticky</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin...but oily skin needs moisturizing too, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very watery and slippery--</li>
            <li>really don&#x27;t have any \\&quot;cons\\&quot; with regards to this product.</li>
            <li>you use too much it will take forever to absorb and if you just try to just rub it in, it will probably remain sticky.</li>
            <li>I use this before applying my moisturizer morning and night, absolutely makes a difference in the appearance and feel of my skin.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and hydrating .&lt;br</li>
            <li>Havnet start use it, but looks really moisture.</li>
            <li>Some pointed out the &amp;#34;plastic&#x27;ish&#x27;&amp;#34; smell of it, I cannot find a smell of plastic really</li>
            <li>I can really see the difference in my skin now that I use this product every morning and night.</li>
            <li>So, you&#x27;ll need a real lotion after this &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s really sticky</li>
            <li>so I was really in a pinch.</li>
            <li>I ordered it and didn&#x27;t really expect much from it while I wait for it in the mail.</li>
            <li>but it really happens to me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll layer on another moisturizer or cream after when weather conditions are really drying.  </li>
            <li>Or any skin really.</li>
            <li>Now, if you put a wet sponge onto a paper towel, the towel gets more saturated and fully soaked with moisture.</li>
            <li>This product is available in POUCH REFILL form (!), saving you valuable dollars off the price while being eco-friendly as well.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely adore the results.</li>
            <li>This is really a toner, not a lotion as we know in the USA.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>its really really fast.</li>
            <li>However, this is a much lighter and watery toner.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin prone to breakouts from both my mother&#x27;s and father&#x27;s genes.</li>
            <li>It really moisturize my skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Hyaluronic Acid Lotion maintain your face moist and very even completion all the times.  </li>
            <li>Could definitely use as a light night cream too</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a couple of months now and it has never broken me out.</li>
            <li>It hydrates and moisturizes my skin very well.</li>
            <li>I have super, super dry skin, and I decided to try this after reading up about it online.</li>
            <li>I used to use the american version and liked it enough but this blows it out of the water.</li>
            <li>A very straightforward product with the consistency of a very loose gel.  </li>
            <li>If you have an oily skin or you are young with a combination skin, this is the right toner.  </li>
            <li>It is not heavy on your skin and gives the right amount moisture and does not make your skin oily/shiny.  </li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way, so it is a great buy.</li>
            <li>First off, if you&#x27;re going to buy this, let me make something clear about this being called a lotion</li>
            <li>It worked fine for my sensitive skin, but I didn&#x27;t notice any big changes.</li>
            <li>product, somehow, is able to penetrate down to the deepest layers of my skin.</li>
            <li>this is definitely a new staple in my skincare routine!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard about the hyaluronic acid pulling moisture out of your skin if you don&#x27;t live in a very humid climate, so don&#x27;t bother with this if that applies to you.</li>
            <li>My skin does absorb products better than before, and I have found that during the day my skin shines less</li>
            <li>It moisturizes deeply as promised and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>I wake up the following morning and my face is still moist, soft and free of pillow winkles.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion not too heavy very moisturising and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film.</li>
            <li>It also sits really well under my makeup which I&#x27;ve had trouble with when it comes to most lotions.</li>
            <li>Feels like glycerine and water are the main component of the lotion.</li>
            <li>This is more of a moisturizing TONER but the Japanese refer to such products as lotions.</li>
            <li>Pharmaceutical website, it is the first Japanese skincare line to become available in the U.S. and is the 2nd largest consumer health company in Japan.</li>
            <li>This is the most normal way, I spread a few drops on my face then gently pat until it&#x27;s no longer</li>
            <li>but I was expecting the texture of this toner to be a little thicker so that stay on the skin longer and moisturize more and longer.  </li>
            <li>I use it in addition to a cream moisturizer because my skin is so super dry, but I&#x27;ve forgotten to moisturize afterward a time or two and it kept my skin hydrated for the whole day.  </li>
            <li>(yes I know it&#x27;s weird lol).</li>
            <li>My skin is unbelievably sensitive and this does not irritate it at all, if fact it felt very soothing.</li>
            <li>(I have a normal skin, and normal on the cheeks combination on the T zone in summer time).</li>
            <li>I grew up with toners that were basically astringents; most of them dried out my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have also tried the lotion mask suggestions but that uses so much more product than just putting a few drops on my skin.</li>
            <li>I used so many different moisturizers and would still wake up every morning with dry patches on my face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very moisturizing on it&#x27;s own, but I layer it with other gentle moisturizers.</li>
            <li>I live in S. California</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, acne-prone, combination skin.</li>
            <li>It is very soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if I am using this correctly, I wish there are better instructions.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to discover that it worked!</li>
            <li>I love it as usual.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m only just getting to the bottom of my first bottle.  </li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m only just getting to the bottom of my first bottle.  </li>
            <li>would still advise a weekly mask, but this product allows you to have a higher level of hydration and silky smoothness throughout the week rather than just briefly after you use the mask.</li>
            <li>- I only need about 5 drops and it covers my whole face and neck!</li>
            <li>#34;There is a newer version of this item.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m not sure if all sellers are sending the new version, but honestly, I believe it&#x27;s the same product in just prettier packaging and</li>
            <li>I make a homemade vitamin C serum with glycerin, and I find that it gives me enough moisture under my normal moisturizer/retinA, and I don&#x27;t really need this stuff.</li>
            <li>I do remember that this product REALLY helped my skin calm down</li>
            <li>The entire bottle has no any single English sentence except &amp;#34;Made in Japan&amp;#34;-understandable though :)</li>
            <li>It is very light and only a few drops is needed.</li>
            <li>It does feel a little bit sticky upon application, but it dries smoothly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clear liquid moisturizer, almost watery.</li>
            <li>(for those who have never experienced psoriasis:  even when the scales/flakes are gone or temporarily exfoliated, you can still see a bright red patch indicating psoriasis-affected skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also gone a whole day without makeup or washing my face in the evening, and the next morning my skin still feels soft and moist.</li>
            <li>I am 66 years old with sensitive skin and severe allergies to scents.</li>
            <li>nearly.</li>
            <li>and it said it was for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am 78 years old.</li>
            <li>(My sister, who is only 3 years my senior, commented this very evening</li>
            <li>My skin is so sensitive, but this product has been without any reaction.</li>
            <li>This definitely helped so much and doesn&#x27;t make me oily at all.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t burn even on sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li>I have oily acne/clog prone skin that is sensitive and dehydrated (which causes an over oil production).</li>
            <li>I like it so far.</li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>it actually surprised me</li>
            <li>This soothes my skin, because I have a sensitive exfoliating face cleanser, i sometimes over scrub my skin.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used a toner like that since I was in my early 20s</li>
            <li>In an 8oz spray bottle I mix 4oz this product to 4oz filtered water and spray directly on my scalp eczema.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin be warned.  </li>
            <li>I think that&#x27;s why so many people are having problems with it and giving it negative reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t sting my sensitive skin at all.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive, dehydrated, acne-prone skin</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or upset my sensitive, acneic skin.  </li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to cosmetic products that smell like chemicals, here you go.</li>
            <li>Once your skin drinks it up your face feels soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li>, my skin looks soft and supple.</li>
            <li>Think of it as a moisturizing serum, you use a few drops and then add your regular moisturizer on top of it.</li>
            <li>It also helps my thick moisturizer absorb better.</li>
            <li>either make your skin feel dry or make you shine too much, this is it!</li>
            <li>A small amount is easy to apply to a damp face.  </li>
            <li>My skin is pretty dry.</li>
            <li>It has improved my skin overall, toned down the redness, evened out my complexion, softened it, filled it with moisture and didn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
            <li>I put this on right after I wash my face to boost the moisture, before layering on other products.</li>
            <li>Hyaluronic acid is supposed to draw moisture from the air, but that only works if you&#x27;re in a place that has high humidity.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I was prepared that this was not your typical moisturizer in a review I read prior to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought at first it was it could have also been because I had travelled and flying will sometimes wreak havoc on my sensitive skin, but when my skin finally retuned to normal long after that, I tried it once again, and I had the same reaction.</li>
            <li>I would just do my normal routine (use it after I cleanse my face morning and night), the next morning, it would be gone.</li>
            <li>i got it for a moisturizer and it is not what i expected, i think there are several other korean moisturizers that are better</li>
            <li>This product has drastically improved the texture of my skin and hydrates the dry patches around my nose and eyes very well.</li>
            <li>You just need a pea size for your face and neck, pat dry after gentle cleansing as a toner.</li>
            <li>Lol, seriously though, it&#x27;s thin and really slippery.</li>
            <li>I have really dry skin and figured that I would get this since it was known to moisturize really well.</li>
            <li>Since starting to use this (several months ago) it has really &#x27;locked in&#x27; the moisture and seems to help keep my skin hydrated.</li>
            <li>For my whole face, I only use two drops from the bottle, and the bottle is so big.</li>
            <li>I got turned onto Hyaluronic acid thanks to the Asian paper masks found in Asian markets.</li>
            <li>It is very affordable and works better than expensive products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>This is HG for my dry, sensitive skin, highly, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I personally top it off with an Evian mist (how pretentious!)</li>
            <li>I use it nearly daily, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and when applied on a hot day when your skin is fried</li>
            <li>One wasn&#x27;t enough, and three made me break out (not a bad break out - it went away in a day or two when I started using less.).</li>
            <li>Its only effect is to make my hands and face feel slippery, which also happens when you spill hydrochloric acid on your hands back in high school chemistry or when using it for cleaning.</li>
            <li>An asian-type toner will never strip your skin and, instead, will bring back that balance if your cleansing products may have stripped the skin of some of its natural balance or</li>
            <li>My husband uses it too and we&#x27;ve barely put a dent in the bottle.</li>
            <li>For me, I am getting older and have a combination skin with dry patches here and there.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really had problems with dry skin since I moved back to the East Coast, USA this year from Singapore.</li>
            <li>Hydrates well, but you do need to use another moisturizer over the top in my opinion, at least if you have dry skin.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;d tried everything non-prescription i could get my hands on for two years, and right before purchasing hada labo, the psoriasis started creeping down onto my left eyelid.  </li>
            <li>the skin becomes less saggy and refreshed;however ,it&#x27;s pretty sticky.</li>
            <li>(my skin type is normal to dry).</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is not a typical American lotion.</li>
            <li>Very thin, easily absorbed, super moisturizing.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s really just like any other toner but with a feel of lotion(all</li>
            <li>I feel like this is really soothing and hydrating and that my skin breaks out due to dryness and dehydration.</li>
            <li>Try it every day for at least 4 -6 weeks and watch your skin improve significantly.</li>
            <li>Or if you live in Miami like me, then this alone will do the job( If you don&#x27;t have dry or flake skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>please don&#x27;t be warned off this amazing product bc of a few negative reviews -- from what i can tell</li>
            <li>One bottle of this stuff can definitely also go a long way as I took a bottle 3/4 full on a half year trip to Europe</li>
            <li>I use this after my toner (Paula&#x27;s Choice Skin Recovery for dry to very dry skin) and before my lotion (first aid beauty cream) and vaseline.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and I usually let it sit on my skin for about 30 seconds before following up with a moisturizer and/or serum.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not the only woman who has spent way to much money on products that only promise and don&#x27;t deliver!</li>
            <li>It moisturizes without being hot, heavy, and suficating to the skin(his words).</li>
            <li>I love this not sure if it makes a difference, because I use other products as well, but I have extremely sensitive skin, that too rough products such as proactive leave me face covered in rashes.</li>
            <li>I love the simple thin gel consistency and how it only takes 2 drops to spread over my entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it goes over my black snail AIO and under Biore watery essence and provides just the right amount of moisture to get me through these dry california summer days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for about 2 weeks and dry skin is completely banished.</li>
            <li>It has definately helped my dry and sensitive skin without giving me additional breakouts.</li>
            <li>The very next day, my skin felt supple and not dry.</li>
            <li>Although the consistency is a little thicker than I expected it doesn&#x27;t leave a super sticky feeling.</li>
            <li>consistency of this liquid is like a very slightly viscous liquid- a slightly gooey/sticky water but far more like water with that slight viscosity to it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i have very very dry skin that is somewhat sensitive.  </li>
            <li>And then that same day my aunt from Okinawa came in town and said that she&#x27;s been using Hadalabo for as long as she can remember and that no other product work as well.</li>

            <li> Got it because of great review</li>
            <li> This is great for added hydration but it&#x27;s not a \\&quot;lotion\\&quot; like we think of them in the west.</li>
            <li> Great hydrating toner.  </li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great</li>

            <li> /&gt;Very nice and soothing for sunburns too!</li>
            <li> &#x3D;D Love this product&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Wonderful, I got this product quickly and everything is good as the one I bought at the shop!  </li>
            <li> Plus the packaging is so great, very appealing to either sex.</li>
            <li> but for the great price and the wonderful benefit of this product, I feel it is completely worth it.</li>
            <li> I have always had good skin, but of course nature takes its toll.</li>
            <li> I was delighted to see it on Amazon at an acceptable price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> making this a good investment (</li>
            <li> Take in consideration that a good nutrition and lots of water is gonna give the product</li>
            <li> Smell is also good .</li>
            <li> You get a good amount of product for what you play for as well.</li>
            <li> but it work perfectly good</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve found it to be a good adition to my moisturing routine.</li>
            <li> I got it about a week ago and its a good standalone moisturizer while being a toner as well.</li>
            <li> but it is not unpleasant in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, without considering the smell that can bother some, this product work magnificently !</li>
            <li> It is very light and makes my skin feel great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to report it sort of works like a very light styling gel or mousse.</li>
            <li> Ships  quickly!!!</li>
            <li> And since Asians make some of the best things ever, I figured they would have some concoctions worth trying.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I very satisfied whit this product I noticed the chance in my skin after 3 days of using it .</li>

            <li> I love everything about this product!....</li>
            <li> and I love how it makes my skin feel!</li>
            <li> So glad I found this product, it has transformed my skin!</li>
            <li> I have used it faithfully since getting it, and i love it!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent moisturizer and has done exactly what I hoped it would do.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li> Glad I purchased this!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> OMG this thing is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> I can deal with it and at the amazing price...</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> but nothing amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> I used this for 4 days in a row and the boyfriend remarked on how bright and lovely my skin looks.</li>
            <li> Ahh this stuff is so nice to put on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> This is more of a essence/serum type product, but may be a good moisturizer for oil type people.</li>
            <li> kind of sticky.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and the product came in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> u liked</li>
            <li> so much make very happy</li>
            <li> Holy grail item, smells nice, feels nice</li>
            <li> Nice light serum that&#x27;s great for layering underneath moisturizer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m loving this stuff.</li>
            <li> I can put this on with my acne products to layer, or just add a touch of moisture on its own.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own</li>
            <li> I also own the Shirojyun (whitening).</li>
            <li> I also purchased some 5 layer cotton squares to make my own mask out of.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> Most moisturizers just don&#x27;t satisfy my skin, but if I use this first then apply moisturizer, my skin feels great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure to buy more once my bottle runs out (but it might take years!)</li>
            <li> I just started using the Hydrator and am thus far extremely impressed.</li>
            <li> Great economical version of SK II</li>
            <li> and I agree with most skincare experts that you don&#x27;t need a toner if that&#x27;s the kind of toner you are using.  </li>
            <li> And YES that was true!!</li>
            <li> I know that&#x27;s too good to be true</li>
            <li> I knew it was going to be a very light product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li> I will for sure be repurchasing this when I run out.</li>
            <li> and I use more than the amount recommended.</li>
            <li> and I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I had to experiment to see how many drops I should use.</li>
            <li> I liked how light it felt on my skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m glad it works for some people though.</li>
            <li> Like a miracle, I am going to order more as I don&#x27;t want to run out of it</li>
            <li> I combine a drop (eye drop amount) with my favorite daytime moisturizer.</li>
            <li> sure looks pretty\\</li>
            <li> I apply this Hada Labo before my daily moisturizer and it works just great! :)</li>
            <li> I top off with CeraVe, but  I have switched to most of the beauty products offered by this line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so satisfied with this product that I sent the company a \\&quot;thank</li>
            <li> I ran across Rohto Hadalabo Gokujyn Hyaluronic Acid Lotion when I was in Japan in the spring of 2012, and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> It is always sitting on top of your skin</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s considered quite cheap, but it is one of the most effective drug store items I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> The oil in my T-zone has become more manageable too.</li>
            <li> use it every morning and love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this product because it makes my skin supple and radiant.</li>
            <li> even with the best of the products i&#x27;d tried, these red patches were ever-present.)  </li>
            <li> i love this product for its results, but the icing on the cake is the price and amount needed per use.  </li>
            <li> then *pat* it into my skin, making sure to get my lips, eyes, and neck as well.  </li>
            <li> it helps with absorption and you get more product into the places you need it.  </li>
            <li> i love this product for its results, but the icing on the cake is the price and amount needed per use.  </li>
            <li> then *pat* it into my skin, making sure to get my lips, eyes, and neck as well.  </li>
            <li> it helps with absorption and you get more product into the places you need it.  </li>
            <li> This soothes my skin like nothing happened and I just absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I love this toner.  </li>
            <li> However, in Asia, a toner is more of a clarifier (skin balancer) and moisture-inducer.  </li>
            <li> Being using this for a year, and i love it.</li>
            <li> and it moisturized it to the point where i could safely apply foundation.</li>
            <li> That gave me more confidence in buying this product.</li>
            <li> Okay for summer.</li>
            <li> but this product seems to help a LOT more.</li>
            <li> complexion is more elastic, 100% recommended.</li>
            <li> it was sitting on top of it.</li>
            <li> Great customer service and fast shipping though...</li>
            <li> I like this, but I don&#x27;t absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Either way, I will be buying more of this</li>
            <li> After reading many a review online about hyaluronic acid serums I decided that I needed to try one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price: Midrange, $20 for the 170mL bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even my acne is looking better.</li>
            <li> One thing: For me, I needed a bit more than one pea sized amount like what the directions said.</li>
            <li> I read about this lotion in a Top 10 beauty product review and have been using it for about a month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started using it on my neck and chest and my skin feels so much better.</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> but I can feel and see my skin looking better every day with the use of this</li>
            <li> /&gt;And if you&#x27;re a reader and follower of Chizu Saeki&#x27;s The Japanese Skincare Revolution, this stuff is perfect for moisture masks!</li>
            <li> more thing, there is a newer version of this lotion.</li>
            <li> Maybe if I had purchased it during the summer instead of winter, it would have worked better.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this gel.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like a hydrating toner than a lotion, and that&#x27;s how I use it in my skincare routine.  </li>
            <li> and I have to say that I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I massage it into my face and pat until it gets a bit sticky, then I apply my serum and moisturizer and my face is sooooo smooth!</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Better than the expesive serums on the market like Lancome.</li>
            <li> It scent and alcohol free so perfect for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Everything ok with shipping and delivery time.</li>
            <li> Love this HA...</li>
            <li> The best facial lotion that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t want to use two moisturizers to make me feel even more greasy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the best toner I&#x27;ve ever used, and it certainly doesn&#x27;t have enough horsepower to work as a lotion unless I lived in a much more humid climate, but it&#x27;s good value for money.  </li>
            <li> Great price for high quality product.</li>
            <li> At first I loved this</li>
            <li> although that did a great job of moisturizing, I must say its moisturizing is far more improved with this lotion.</li>
            <li> (But the texture of the skin remains smooth) and because the smell is &amp;#34;plastic-y&amp;#34; smelling although very light.</li>
            <li> Very good product especially for the price</li>
            <li> This is very gentle and perfect for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My 16 year old son has started using it on his exzema, and he&#x27;s happy with it.</li>
            <li> I noticed my skin becoming dryer and the moisturizers I was using wasn&#x27;t helping in the slightest.</li>
            <li> you are under 25 yrs old), but if you are using this as a homemade mask then its great.</li>
            <li> I stuck to the light formula for years because of this, but feel oily more often</li>
            <li> but it for sure is a great product) while also keeping a healthy level of moisture donated to your skin by the present atmosphere.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s able to provide light moisture and after having used it for awhile</li>
            <li> But it is great for making it soft.</li>
            <li> When I DO remember to smooth it over my face, neck, and chest (day and night) for more than 3 days in a row, my boyfriend always remarks on how my skin looks &amp;#34;brighter&amp;#34; and smoother.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no miracle but is a great addition to many dry skin routines, and I have had the most luck with it when using it after a chemical (10% AHA) exfoliator.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Application: It spreads really easily.</li>
            <li> This definitely seems more like a toner than a lotion, but it works great nonetheless.</li>
            <li> I researched the best reviewed and inexpensive product online and came down with Hadalabo.</li>
            <li> After cleansing, I pour a dime-sized amount into my clean palm, rub my hands together to warm it up, and then pat the product onto my skin until fully absorbed.</li>
            <li> I also notice that the fine lines that would appear in the morning from my face being tugged and pulled over night by my pillow are no longer an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes, it works perfect on black skin, too.</li>
            <li> I works fine as a toner, it&#x27;s too liquid to use it as a lotion.</li>
            <li> It gets absorbed quickly and keeps my skin nicely moisturized till morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I like that this is a very light but easily absorbed hydrater for my face.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;plump\\&quot; fine lines also smooth&#x27;s out and firms your skin</li>
            <li> No fragrance which is a huge plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My face has been acne free as well since using this.</li>
            <li> It is such a great product that I fear the price may go up.</li>
            <li> It is fantastic, adds and keeps moisture all day.</li>
            <li> I wish I could read the colorful bottle, but I&#x27;m sure it says it was made for</li>
            <li> The moisturizer is great and thankfully packaged with English language.</li>
            <li> there are a ton of youtube videos if you need detailed steps.)ow used it twice per day for 6 weeks on my face, body, and hair</li>
            <li> there are a ton of youtube videos if you need detailed steps.)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really important to realize that this is NOT the toner you are probably used to in USA.  </li>
            <li> I thought, hmm, I already have the moist version in the mail, why not try the light version this time.</li>
            <li> Make my face smooth and hydrated .</li>
            <li> Rub a pea-sized amount in your hands to warm it up, pat gently all over your face until it dries.</li>
            <li> Its light and does it job.</li>
            <li> and smooth it on your face and pat pat pat</li>
            <li> the product is all around fantastic.</li>
            <li> This assists product makes my skin so smooth.</li>
            <li> I am very grateful to have such a wonderful product that I can use.</li>
            <li> no alcohol, good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and so consequently, I&#x27;ve gone through my first bottle probably more quickly than most -  </li>
            <li> Its not sticky, it absorbs quick, applies easy, and makes my skin bouncy.</li>
            <li> New favorite lotion!</li>
            <li> Honestly this brand was highly suggested to me by a friend and she suggested to use this as a toner .</li>
            <li> This is a great, super lightweight moisturizing Japanese lotion.  </li>
            <li> It is the original staff from Hadalabo.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to receive my first bottle and was pleased.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer itself is good on its own but because it isn&#x27;t a cream base but a liquid/acid it makes it very ideal for turning it into a mask.</li>
            <li> I know a lot of people is probably using this as a at home sheet mask, which is great, and it is definitely worth the money, even if you are only using this as a toner it is still pretty good on the skin, it is light weight and watery, however i believe this is a product more suitable for younger skin that doesn&#x27;t need much to look beautiful(meaning</li>
            <li> So great for dry skin..</li>
            <li> This lotion formula is more like a light gel and feels very moisturizing, whereas the shirojyun is just watery.</li>
            <li> This one makes my face not dry , its good for my skin . .  </li>
            <li> The lotion itself is quite good, I couldn&#x27;t rate it fair right now, since I&#x27;ve been using it for a too short period, but seems ok, however nothing more special than any other moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I brought it with natural republic&#x27;s aloe vera 92%gel, and it is much better!</li>
            <li> Absorbed easily and quickly and seemed to hydrate skin well.</li>
            <li> I learned this the hard way lol!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s especially pleasant on the delicate under-eye area.</li>
            <li> With as many products as I&#x27;ve tried over the years...and believe me,  there&#x27;s been a whole lot...</li>
            <li> Noting that Japanese women seem to always have gorgeous skin</li>
            <li> The full list of ingredients is as follows:  Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, PPG-10 Methyl Glucose Ether, Disodium Succinate, Methyl Paraben, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Succinic Acid, Sodium Acetylated</li>
            <li> Used AM and PM, my skin is nice and soft and glowy, with no irritation.</li>
            <li> I follow this with a moisturizer and my skin is very grateful.  :-)</li>
            <li> and I love that I don&#x27;t have to use too much in order to apply the product evenly,</li>
            <li> Otherwise, you&#x27;re not getting full use out of this wondrous liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Is easy to apply and it feels thicker than water but no smell or funny \\&quot;after</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid may be great, but with parabens and all this other junk, no way I&#x27;m putting this on my face.</li>
            <li> There was even a little gift in the parcel that delighted my daughter :)</li>
            <li> It is fresh and perfect for sensitive dry skin</li>
            <li> This review is for Hada Labo Tokyo Replenishing Hydrator [Super Hyaluronic Acid].</li>
            <li> /&gt;2- Soaks in quickly so that you can follow it almost immediately with additional moisturizer, primer or foundation</li>
            <li> Luckily i had brought this with me…</li>
            <li> my face is much more soft and smooth after using this.</li>
            <li> this product is very suitable for dry skin or in winner.</li>
            <li> It is absolute truth, you only need 3 drops, after my face toner, and before moisturizer or serum, it completely moisture barriers the skin, making the products very much more effective!  </li>
            <li> After patting it on, it makes your skin feel smooth and LOOK really hydrated.</li>
            <li> This is kind of like a cross between a lotion and a toner.</li>
            <li> I decided against putting this on my face, since what we put on our skin can be absorbed by the blood.</li>
            <li> After learning about Hada Labo from a popular online beauty site and prior to purchase, I researched the product and it&#x27;s company.</li>
            <li> I felt it was worth</li>
            <li> Well worth it</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s no alcohol or mineral oil, no artificial colors, either.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It really hydrates my skin, makes it feel nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Totally worth buying.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t encountered a Hadalabo skin product I don&#x27;t love so far</li>
            <li> It will begin to feel sticky, but keep patting until your skin has completely absorbed it-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this great product!  </li>
            <li> (Especially if you&#x27;re the kind of girl who drops $50+ on 1oz jars of moisturizers and whatnot!)&lt;br /&gt;I have semi-sensitive skin and this has no odor and doesn&#x27;t in any way irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> We went a very long stretch of time without having any flare ups and not having to resort to stronger medicated lotions, I am very pleased and will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> I love to put this on about every other wash for more moisture.</li>
            <li> on usage:  i&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s been covered by many other reviewers, but you use this product after makeup removal and cleansing but before moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> on usage:  i&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s been covered by many other reviewers, but you use this product after makeup removal and cleansing but before moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m happy to say that my psoriasis is completely gone, leaving no trace it ever existed in the first place, and hada labo is the only product i tried with both immediate and long-term efficacy.  </li>
            <li> Then apply the mask to your face, doing this allows the lotion to soak in versus drying out right away from the air.</li>
            <li> It soaks in right away.</li>
            <li> and this helps provide and lock in moisture right after washing my face.  </li>
            <li> I use this right after my cleanser as a toner.</li>
            <li> Even people who cannot read Japanese characters can appreciate the look of this product, very cool!</li>
            <li> Then I decided to give this a go because I know how good hyaluronic acid is for your skin, especially dry skin.</li>
            <li> It is a great lotion for dry and sensitive skin .</li>
            <li> I have the whole hada labo line and this is a great toner, but do not use it for your moisturizing needs, buy the milk lotion or the cream to complete the process because this is only a toner.</li>
            <li> First of all, the line was introduced in 2010 and became an immediate success.</li>
            <li> , most of those reviewers are using the product incorrectly, are ignorant about hyaluronic acid generally, or haven&#x27;t even used</li>
            <li> Only 3 drops were used for my whole face, but it was so light and refreshing with no fragrance or burn.</li>
            <li> (I purchased Selena brand on Amazon, highly recommend for masks as the layers are soft and peel apart very easily.</li>
            <li> Great first step in the series for dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone 2 days without any new eruptions which is huge for me.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s plain to see why hadalabo is so popular!</li>
            <li> and this is certainly a price I don&#x27;t mind paying!</li>
            <li> I have kind of dry skin and</li>
            <li> I used this product only 2 days and have noticed a great improvement, all the pores are tiny to gone.</li>
            <li> This is super gentle and has never bothered my skin (just for reference, CeraVe hydrating cleanser burns my face.)</li>
            <li> (they&#x27;re the same thing as Sheet Masks but more economical).</li>
            <li> Very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> my friends recommended it to me, I like it very much.</li>
            <li> this and am never going back: it absorbs so much faster than the light formula and leaves my skin with a much more tacky feel no matter how much I put</li>
            <li> and I must say it works very very well.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> Received product much earlier than expect and was greatly pleased</li>
            <li> Love it, especially to use as a mask</li>
            <li> Works very well!  </li>
            <li> It is exactly what I</li>
            <li> However this product seems different and more than lives up to its claims.</li>
            <li> This is not a lotion, do your research first.</li>
            <li> It has helped my skin so much!</li>
            <li> First I thought, what?</li>
            <li> but more of a product I used back in kindergarden</li>
            <li> Very hydrating and soothing!</li>
            <li> the next morning, my skin was a lot better.</li>
            <li> I saw gradual improvement in the first week.</li>
            <li> I finally don&#x27;t have any more flaking or peeling (from retin-a).</li>
            <li> When I put this on my skin, it feels sticky at first.</li>
            <li> It has a very liquidity texture and is not oily at all!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty cooling.</li>
            <li> and it lasted the whole time!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product for dry skin!!!</li>
            <li> and like I said, 1-3 drops are more than enough for the whole face.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need more than one or two shakes of the bottle to get enough liquid to cover my whole face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used various products that contain Hyaluronic Acid as well as pure HA on my skin for several years all with good results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always use pure rose water and cornflower water as a toner (never ever did I use a non natural toner especially those one with alcohol in it that strips moisture out of your skin).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sometimes i put more conventional moisturizer over this product once it has been absorbed.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going to take me a LONG while to get through this whole bottle, and I love it.</li>
            <li> I noticed improvement right after 1 use due to the great hyration to my skin, this is the first Hyaluronic Acid product I have tried, and will continue using it until I find something better, but the chance of that is unlikely.</li>
            <li> I use it in combination with Keihl&#x27;s facial fuel get for a deep hydrating mask with amazing results.</li>
            <li> Really like this toner.</li>
            <li> Surprisely, it didn&#x27;t hurt and was very moist with no fragrance.</li>
            <li> This has not broken me out once</li>
            <li> It is very liquidy</li>
            <li> and it gets really sticky</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin...but oily skin needs moisturizing too, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very watery and slippery--</li>
            <li> really don&#x27;t have any \\&quot;cons\\&quot; with regards to this product.</li>
            <li> you use too much it will take forever to absorb and if you just try to just rub it in, it will probably remain sticky.</li>
            <li> I use this before applying my moisturizer morning and night, absolutely makes a difference in the appearance and feel of my skin.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and hydrating .&lt;br</li>
            <li> Havnet start use it, but looks really moisture.</li>
            <li> Some pointed out the &amp;#34;plastic&#x27;ish&#x27;&amp;#34; smell of it, I cannot find a smell of plastic really</li>
            <li> I can really see the difference in my skin now that I use this product every morning and night.</li>
            <li> So, you&#x27;ll need a real lotion after this &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s really sticky</li>
            <li> so I was really in a pinch.</li>
            <li> I ordered it and didn&#x27;t really expect much from it while I wait for it in the mail.</li>
            <li> but it really happens to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll layer on another moisturizer or cream after when weather conditions are really drying.  </li>
            <li> Or any skin really.</li>
            <li> Now, if you put a wet sponge onto a paper towel, the towel gets more saturated and fully soaked with moisture.</li>
            <li> This product is available in POUCH REFILL form (!), saving you valuable dollars off the price while being eco-friendly as well.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely adore the results.</li>
            <li> This is really a toner, not a lotion as we know in the USA.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> its really really fast.</li>
            <li> However, this is a much lighter and watery toner.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin prone to breakouts from both my mother&#x27;s and father&#x27;s genes.</li>
            <li> It really moisturize my skin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic Acid Lotion maintain your face moist and very even completion all the times.  </li>
            <li> Could definitely use as a light night cream too</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple of months now and it has never broken me out.</li>
            <li> It hydrates and moisturizes my skin very well.</li>
            <li> I have super, super dry skin, and I decided to try this after reading up about it online.</li>
            <li> I used to use the american version and liked it enough but this blows it out of the water.</li>
            <li> A very straightforward product with the consistency of a very loose gel.  </li>
            <li> If you have an oily skin or you are young with a combination skin, this is the right toner.  </li>
            <li> It is not heavy on your skin and gives the right amount moisture and does not make your skin oily/shiny.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, so it is a great buy.</li>
            <li> First off, if you&#x27;re going to buy this, let me make something clear about this being called a lotion</li>
            <li> It worked fine for my sensitive skin, but I didn&#x27;t notice any big changes.</li>
            <li> product, somehow, is able to penetrate down to the deepest layers of my skin.</li>
            <li> this is definitely a new staple in my skincare routine!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard about the hyaluronic acid pulling moisture out of your skin if you don&#x27;t live in a very humid climate, so don&#x27;t bother with this if that applies to you.</li>
            <li> My skin does absorb products better than before, and I have found that during the day my skin shines less</li>
            <li> It moisturizes deeply as promised and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I wake up the following morning and my face is still moist, soft and free of pillow winkles.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion not too heavy very moisturising and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film.</li>
            <li> It also sits really well under my makeup which I&#x27;ve had trouble with when it comes to most lotions.</li>
            <li> Feels like glycerine and water are the main component of the lotion.</li>
            <li> This is more of a moisturizing TONER but the Japanese refer to such products as lotions.</li>
            <li> Pharmaceutical website, it is the first Japanese skincare line to become available in the U.S. and is the 2nd largest consumer health company in Japan.</li>
            <li> This is the most normal way, I spread a few drops on my face then gently pat until it&#x27;s no longer</li>
            <li> but I was expecting the texture of this toner to be a little thicker so that stay on the skin longer and moisturize more and longer.  </li>
            <li> I use it in addition to a cream moisturizer because my skin is so super dry, but I&#x27;ve forgotten to moisturize afterward a time or two and it kept my skin hydrated for the whole day.  </li>
            <li> (yes I know it&#x27;s weird lol).</li>
            <li> My skin is unbelievably sensitive and this does not irritate it at all, if fact it felt very soothing.</li>
            <li> (I have a normal skin, and normal on the cheeks combination on the T zone in summer time).</li>
            <li> I grew up with toners that were basically astringents; most of them dried out my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have also tried the lotion mask suggestions but that uses so much more product than just putting a few drops on my skin.</li>
            <li> I used so many different moisturizers and would still wake up every morning with dry patches on my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very moisturizing on it&#x27;s own, but I layer it with other gentle moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I live in S. California</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, acne-prone, combination skin.</li>
            <li> It is very soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I am using this correctly, I wish there are better instructions.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to discover that it worked!</li>
            <li> I love it as usual.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m only just getting to the bottom of my first bottle.  </li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m only just getting to the bottom of my first bottle.  </li>
            <li> would still advise a weekly mask, but this product allows you to have a higher level of hydration and silky smoothness throughout the week rather than just briefly after you use the mask.</li>
            <li> - I only need about 5 drops and it covers my whole face and neck!</li>
            <li> #34;There is a newer version of this item.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m not sure if all sellers are sending the new version, but honestly, I believe it&#x27;s the same product in just prettier packaging and</li>
            <li> I make a homemade vitamin C serum with glycerin, and I find that it gives me enough moisture under my normal moisturizer/retinA, and I don&#x27;t really need this stuff.</li>
            <li> I do remember that this product REALLY helped my skin calm down</li>
            <li> The entire bottle has no any single English sentence except &amp;#34;Made in Japan&amp;#34;-understandable though :)</li>
            <li> It is very light and only a few drops is needed.</li>
            <li> It does feel a little bit sticky upon application, but it dries smoothly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clear liquid moisturizer, almost watery.</li>
            <li> (for those who have never experienced psoriasis:  even when the scales/flakes are gone or temporarily exfoliated, you can still see a bright red patch indicating psoriasis-affected skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also gone a whole day without makeup or washing my face in the evening, and the next morning my skin still feels soft and moist.</li>
            <li> I am 66 years old with sensitive skin and severe allergies to scents.</li>
            <li> nearly.</li>
            <li> and it said it was for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I am 78 years old.</li>
            <li> (My sister, who is only 3 years my senior, commented this very evening</li>
            <li> My skin is so sensitive, but this product has been without any reaction.</li>
            <li> This definitely helped so much and doesn&#x27;t make me oily at all.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t burn even on sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li> I have oily acne/clog prone skin that is sensitive and dehydrated (which causes an over oil production).</li>
            <li> I like it so far.</li>
            <li> wow.</li>
            <li> it actually surprised me</li>
            <li> This soothes my skin, because I have a sensitive exfoliating face cleanser, i sometimes over scrub my skin.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used a toner like that since I was in my early 20s</li>
            <li> In an 8oz spray bottle I mix 4oz this product to 4oz filtered water and spray directly on my scalp eczema.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin be warned.  </li>
            <li> I think that&#x27;s why so many people are having problems with it and giving it negative reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t sting my sensitive skin at all.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive, dehydrated, acne-prone skin</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or upset my sensitive, acneic skin.  </li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to cosmetic products that smell like chemicals, here you go.</li>
            <li> Once your skin drinks it up your face feels soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li> , my skin looks soft and supple.</li>
            <li> Think of it as a moisturizing serum, you use a few drops and then add your regular moisturizer on top of it.</li>
            <li> It also helps my thick moisturizer absorb better.</li>
            <li> either make your skin feel dry or make you shine too much, this is it!</li>
            <li> A small amount is easy to apply to a damp face.  </li>
            <li> My skin is pretty dry.</li>
            <li> It has improved my skin overall, toned down the redness, evened out my complexion, softened it, filled it with moisture and didn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
            <li> I put this on right after I wash my face to boost the moisture, before layering on other products.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid is supposed to draw moisture from the air, but that only works if you&#x27;re in a place that has high humidity.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I was prepared that this was not your typical moisturizer in a review I read prior to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought at first it was it could have also been because I had travelled and flying will sometimes wreak havoc on my sensitive skin, but when my skin finally retuned to normal long after that, I tried it once again, and I had the same reaction.</li>
            <li> I would just do my normal routine (use it after I cleanse my face morning and night), the next morning, it would be gone.</li>
            <li> i got it for a moisturizer and it is not what i expected, i think there are several other korean moisturizers that are better</li>
            <li> This product has drastically improved the texture of my skin and hydrates the dry patches around my nose and eyes very well.</li>
            <li> You just need a pea size for your face and neck, pat dry after gentle cleansing as a toner.</li>
            <li> Lol, seriously though, it&#x27;s thin and really slippery.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin and figured that I would get this since it was known to moisturize really well.</li>
            <li> Since starting to use this (several months ago) it has really &#x27;locked in&#x27; the moisture and seems to help keep my skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> For my whole face, I only use two drops from the bottle, and the bottle is so big.</li>
            <li> I got turned onto Hyaluronic acid thanks to the Asian paper masks found in Asian markets.</li>
            <li> It is very affordable and works better than expensive products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This is HG for my dry, sensitive skin, highly, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I personally top it off with an Evian mist (how pretentious!)</li>
            <li> I use it nearly daily, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and when applied on a hot day when your skin is fried</li>
            <li> One wasn&#x27;t enough, and three made me break out (not a bad break out - it went away in a day or two when I started using less.).</li>
            <li> Its only effect is to make my hands and face feel slippery, which also happens when you spill hydrochloric acid on your hands back in high school chemistry or when using it for cleaning.</li>
            <li> An asian-type toner will never strip your skin and, instead, will bring back that balance if your cleansing products may have stripped the skin of some of its natural balance or</li>
            <li> My husband uses it too and we&#x27;ve barely put a dent in the bottle.</li>
            <li> For me, I am getting older and have a combination skin with dry patches here and there.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really had problems with dry skin since I moved back to the East Coast, USA this year from Singapore.</li>
            <li> Hydrates well, but you do need to use another moisturizer over the top in my opinion, at least if you have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;d tried everything non-prescription i could get my hands on for two years, and right before purchasing hada labo, the psoriasis started creeping down onto my left eyelid.  </li>
            <li> the skin becomes less saggy and refreshed;however ,it&#x27;s pretty sticky.</li>
            <li> (my skin type is normal to dry).</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not a typical American lotion.</li>
            <li> Very thin, easily absorbed, super moisturizing.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s really just like any other toner but with a feel of lotion(all</li>
            <li> I feel like this is really soothing and hydrating and that my skin breaks out due to dryness and dehydration.</li>
            <li> Try it every day for at least 4 -6 weeks and watch your skin improve significantly.</li>
            <li> Or if you live in Miami like me, then this alone will do the job( If you don&#x27;t have dry or flake skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> please don&#x27;t be warned off this amazing product bc of a few negative reviews -- from what i can tell</li>
            <li> One bottle of this stuff can definitely also go a long way as I took a bottle 3/4 full on a half year trip to Europe</li>
            <li> I use this after my toner (Paula&#x27;s Choice Skin Recovery for dry to very dry skin) and before my lotion (first aid beauty cream) and vaseline.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and I usually let it sit on my skin for about 30 seconds before following up with a moisturizer and/or serum.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not the only woman who has spent way to much money on products that only promise and don&#x27;t deliver!</li>
            <li> It moisturizes without being hot, heavy, and suficating to the skin(his words).</li>
            <li> I love this not sure if it makes a difference, because I use other products as well, but I have extremely sensitive skin, that too rough products such as proactive leave me face covered in rashes.</li>
            <li> I love the simple thin gel consistency and how it only takes 2 drops to spread over my entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it goes over my black snail AIO and under Biore watery essence and provides just the right amount of moisture to get me through these dry california summer days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for about 2 weeks and dry skin is completely banished.</li>
            <li> It has definately helped my dry and sensitive skin without giving me additional breakouts.</li>
            <li> The very next day, my skin felt supple and not dry.</li>
            <li> Although the consistency is a little thicker than I expected it doesn&#x27;t leave a super sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> consistency of this liquid is like a very slightly viscous liquid- a slightly gooey/sticky water but far more like water with that slight viscosity to it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i have very very dry skin that is somewhat sensitive.  </li>
            <li> And then that same day my aunt from Okinawa came in town and said that she&#x27;s been using Hadalabo for as long as she can remember and that no other product work as well.</li>
            <li> Very mild, but unfortunately, isn&#x27;t quite moisturizing enough for my dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and this has really helped to both tame my T-Zone and hydrate the dryer parts of my face.</li>
            <li> I really like that a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> The texture of this is not like your conventional lotion: it is clear and a consistency of thinned egg white.</li>
            <li> I still get a dry patch here and there, but i csn no long sculpt a mini me out of all the flaking skin on my face.</li>
            <li> I will mention that as it is somewhat \\&quot;watery\\&quot; [somewhere between water and a light gel] in texture and just a little runny you have to be careful when dispensing intoyour hand so not to waste any; the pump bottle helps with this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few weeks now and I cannot really say whether it has made a difference for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I misplaced the bottle during a recent move...and was truly surprised when I noticed my skin acting \\&quot;parched\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This bottle is going to last a really long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Last all day long.</li>
            <li> After years of living in a house filled with chain smokers, I figured it was time to start taking at least a little care of my skin.</li>
            <li> I live in Japan and have been using this for a few years now.</li>
            <li> When I stopped using it for a week and only used lotion, my skin felt dry again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s oily but dry, especially since this winter season.</li>
            <li> I am currently using a $400 moisturizer specifically for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have dry, resistant, pigmented and tanned Asian skin.</li>
            <li> At every use, it has left dry patches on my skin for days.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;See, if your skin is dry, simply applying the lotion doesn&#x27;t allow it to fully penetrate.</li>
            <li> I am a 22-year-old Asian girl and my skin is really dry.</li>
            <li> so this has become a regular as my facial lotion before makeup, before other face products etc.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, I practically only need to use a drop or two for entire face/neck, so a bottle will last me a long while.</li>
            <li> I was desperate in finding a better skin care routine coz I want to get rid of my monthly hormonal breakouts.</li>
            <li> Donno about the long term use,but the immediate effect is impressing:</li>
            <li> One bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The bottle lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> that seals whatever is underneath all night long.</li>
            <li> it is not a natural sent</li>
            <li> Granted, I probably have so much left because I&#x27;m not very regimented with my skin care</li>
            <li> /&gt;Interestingly, Asian and black skin are the same in composition.</li>
            <li> Because you only need so little, I would say the whole bottle could last me for at least 6 months.</li>
            <li> I love it, it helps my dry skin a lot during the winter time, as the winter in my city is really dry and cold.</li>
            <li> - I tried this technique after a long day when my skin felt rather dry.</li>
            <li> I was not aware that this product would be packaged in Japanese language and therefore  I have no idea what I received nor how to use it.  </li>
            <li> Long wait to receive it though!</li>
            <li> I have exceedingly dry skin</li>
            <li> If you have a dry skin like I do, this is one of the \\&quot;must have\\&quot; items.</li>
            <li> STILL I would have dry patches.</li>
            <li> I would never not use this product in the winter time or dry climates ever.</li>
            <li> Decided to try it again during the winter when I noticed dry spots.</li>
            <li> My skin while oily in the T-zone, is extremely dry everywhere else</li>
            <li> and i end up using a surgical blade to scrape the dry skin off.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;I considered this since I have really dry skin.</li>
            <li> By the law of osmosis, the moist hyaluronic acid soaks into the dry skin when it has a chance to be wetter, longer, in contact with the dermis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I gave it a try for two weeks but got dry and flaky skin as a result.</li>
            <li> tried it in the winter and maybe the climate I am in is too dry area.  </li>
            <li> Never feel dry in fall and winter even without cream.</li>
            <li> My skin felt dry regardless.</li>
            <li> I would even double moisturize my face at night with lotion and then a heavy cream but would still wake up the next morning with pillow wrinkles on my face and dry skin.</li>
            <li> before using hada labo, i&#x27;d been battling facial psoriasis that covered my entire forehead, around my nose, and a few spots on my chin.  </li>
            <li> Because you only use a few drops for each treatment, it will last forever.  </li>
            <li> If you are black like me and male and you&#x27;re just tired that lotions and moisturizers never give you the right type of moisture</li>
            <li> but I do believe it helped as during my period I didn&#x27;t had a single break out</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount so this bottle will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> have noticed that the surface redness on my facial skin is much less than it used to be before I introduced this in my routine.</li>
            <li> it only took me 1 and half day to get it.</li>
            <li> I am oily so I only need a little hydration.</li>
            <li> But once in a while a little bump a little bigger than a white head would come out.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and after moving to a very dry region I&#x27;ve got serious dermatitis.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable compare with those expensive bottles we got from big brands..</li>
            <li> After using this my skin was really soft, and it absorbed well (only when I did the patting thing though, which isn&#x27;t as annoying as I thought it would be).</li>
            <li> It has a thin and slippery consistency, so you do not need much for it to work.</li>
            <li> I fully expected it to disturb my foundation</li>
            <li> Got my package two weeks ago and it instructed to only use a few drops.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking of buying them in bulk next time in case they are not available in the US</li>
            <li> properly use this lotion, do what thousands of Japanese and Asian women do with this product: peel cotton pads into thin layers, saturate, then let sit on skin for 3-5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I still have a bit less than half a bottle left!  </li>
            <li> Because of this, we tend to have dry skin and as a result we produce a ton of sebum which leads to oily surface skin that doesn&#x27;t help to moisturize down to the deepest layers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The article where I first heard about this product listed several other similar HA products some priced at $100+ with others in the $50 range, HL&#x27;s Replenishing Hydrator was the least expensive</li>
            <li> little of product goes a long way</li>
            <li> I will say that with this product a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I gave 4 stars instead of 5 due to the moisture dissipating if you don&#x27;t seal it in with a serum/lotion etc.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for one product to replace your other skin care steps, this is not it.</li>
            <li> It helps my other moisturizers to absorb into my skin.</li>
            <li> Hadalabo have a lot of other products, creams and whitening lotions, which I would also recommend.</li>
            <li> This product has repair my moisture barrier and is usually the only moisturizer I use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t sent it back because not sure how to do so.  </li>
            <li> the stickiness some other reviews mention, I won&#x27;t call</li>
            <li> online than in other off-line beauty shops</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!)</li>
            <li> I usually do this before bed once a week and the next morning</li>
            <li> also got those little dry face masks that looks like tums</li>
            <li> After using it for a few weeks, my face still felt dry and I also started breaking out a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The oily section of my skin gets moisturized but the dry section of my face gets drier after a few hours</li>
            <li> I have trouble with dry patches and after using this even those are gone.</li>
            <li> I found that I break out less since starting to add this product in my routine (coincidence or not I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely dry, as is my skin, so one day after showering, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try and apply it to my wet hair and style as usual.  </li>
            <li> So this is not exactly right.  </li>
            <li> If you have a dry skin, or live in dangerously cold and dry area, you should try this product.</li>
            <li> As I began approaching my late 20s</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t read Japanese but at least can figure it</li>
            <li> have sensitive skin and it moisturizes my skin well without breakouts or irritating my skin</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue behind and the skin just feels soft and plump.</li>
            <li> This product cuts the time down to a minute or two.</li>
            <li> Dries down to a non-sticky finish.</li>
            <li> but due to how well this product works, I might look into Rohto Hadalabo&#x27;s Milk lotion product as well!</li>
            <li> I like using it in the summertime, but I usually have to add a little something extra to it in order for my skin to not start flaking (tamanu oil or a little bit of day cream).</li>
            <li> No matter what moisturizer or lotion I used in the past, my skin would always dry up after an hour and then turn all oily for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even a usual sufferer of dry skin</li>
            <li> I have been applying this lotion every day for the past 6 weeks and my skin still feels dry.</li>
            <li> I usually put my hair up in scrunchy clip and let it dry that way.</li>
            <li> But the plus to that is you only need a very small amount so for $18</li>
            <li> ANYONE WITH DRY SKIN NEEDS TO USE THIS PRODUCT!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m black btw if this helps anyone *^-^*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The label states that one bottle is sold every four seconds (in Japan), and my only complaint is that it&#x27;s not readily available in the U.S.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more dry patches!</li>
            <li> it goes over paula&#x27;s choice BHA, black snail AIO, and under Benton snailbee steam cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for half a year and now my sister is using it</li>
            <li> and I seriously use 3-4 drops only.</li>
            <li> On a hurry one day, I just dabbed it on my face, after washing it with warm water, and then splashing some cold water: My face was plump!!</li>
            <li> When my skin is dull and dry, I like to put some on before make up</li>
            <li> In addition, I felt my skin is a little bit tighter than before.</li>
            <li> So little.</li>
            <li> I do use a moisturized after the toner, but I think I should use a little richer/more moisturizing toner for my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;after a few days using hada labo in my skincare routine (after cleansing, but before moisturizing)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t break you out or feel heavy.</li>
            <li> After the Evian mist, I seal in the moisture with a few pumps of Argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But what&#x27;s the japanese secret to using it?</li>
            <li> My skin is supple, plump and firm looking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> but they do not peel apart easily as I do not think they are made for that.</li>
            <li> A little goes a loooong way!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a little disappointed because I really had faith it</li>
            <li> The price is unbelievably inexpensive too.</li>
            <li> so this is meant to be part of a routine that usually includes about 5 steps in Japan.</li>
            <li> /&gt;...and not gunna lie, I still have no idea what it does :/</li>
            <li> I am not sure of its hydration properties.</li>
            <li> Usually worn under another moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I used to get an oil slick on my forehead by mid-day but this product has reduced it dramatically.  </li>
            <li> There are very few make up, shampoos, &amp; etc.</li>
            <li> If you try to use less, it feels too thin like it&#x27;s not a moisturizing anything.</li>
            <li> So, I have started to use it this way as well, although I do continue doing the lotion mask at least once a day.</li>
            <li> the way, I have combination skin that has not been negatively affected by the application of this product--that is, no break outs, nor dryness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for at least six months</li>
            <li> The delivery a bit slow ,but taking in count</li>
            <li> No oil slick!</li>
            <li> We have thicker skin which makes it difficult for moisturizers to get down to the deepest layers.</li>
            <li> Seriously, you still need to use a moisturizer with this product.</li>
            <li> Not good for winter.</li>
            <li> It just like a thin veil of moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> use this toning lotion with the thin face masks and allow it to lay on the skin for 12-20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Asian lotions are quite water-y in consistency and are used as a base layer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Lotion masks are thin cotton pads that you saturate with the Hada Labo and leave on your face for 3-5 minutes</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> i used it multiple times during that vacation and it soothed my terrible sunburn -</li>
            <li> I bought this a year ago because of the crazy hype, used it every day for six months...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: I had to stop using this after I realized it was irritating my skin!!</li>
            <li> Not anything to make it unpleasant though.</li>
            <li> All the things I used before had to be cast aside because everytime I used them, my skin hurts and feel like split, really painful.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to apply a ton of makeup on my poor sunburned skin because I was going out partying that night, but my skin was in terrible condition.</li>
            <li> : the cotton pads to use with this technique are: [[ASIN:B00260T94</li>
            <li> Of course I&#x27;m an idiot</li>
            <li> Very disappointed not packaged in US.  </li>
            <li> and I got an awful sunburn all over my face.</li>
            <li> worst breakout of my life w this stuff - don&#x27;t know why.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Really like this toner. It is fresh and perfect for sensitive dry skin but it is not moisturizing enough in the winter and I have to mix it with a couple of face oil. Will try the milk version next time.</li>
            <li> OMG this thing is AMAZING. I have kind of dry skin and my skin just absorbs this immediately.</li>
            <li> Received product much earlier than expect and was greatly pleased</li>
            <li> Wonderful, I got this product quickly and everything is good as the one I bought at the shop!  Thank you.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and after moving to a very dry region I&#x27;ve got serious dermatitis. All the things I used before had to be cast aside because everytime I used them, my skin hurts and feel like split, really painful. Then I tried this lotion from amazon.Surprisely, it didn&#x27;t hurt and was very moist with no fragrance.Now I may finish this bottle and I&#x27;ll buy it again afterwards.</li>
            <li> This is kind of like a cross between a lotion and a toner. Its slippery and hydrating which allow make up to go on smoother. However, thats about the only benefit I got from this product</li>
            <li> Ahh this stuff is so nice to put on my face and neck. Just put it in your hands and slather it on. Keeps my skin from drying out and doesn&#x27;t leave any white cast or feel oily</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product for dry skin!!! I have super, super dry skin, and I decided to try this after reading up about it online. After patting it on, it makes your skin feel smooth and LOOK really hydrated. For me, I still use moisturizer after, and it looks dewy and plump. This is more of a essence/serum type product, but may be a good moisturizer for oil type people.</li>
            <li> One of the best lotions(toners) I&#x27;ve ever put on my face. Donno about the long term use,but the immediate effect is impressing:the skin becomes less saggy and refreshed;however ,it&#x27;s pretty sticky.The delivery a bit slow ,but taking in count it came from Japan by regular mail it&#x27;s ok.  The entire bottle has no any single English sentence except &amp;#34;Made in Japan&amp;#34;-understandable though :)</li>
            <li> I am 66 years old with sensitive skin and severe allergies to scents. I love this product as it works wonderful to smooth out wrinkles and make your skin glow. It is very affordable and works better than expensive products I&#x27;ve tried. I have exceedingly dry skin so I do use a moisturizer over it. I am very grateful to have such a wonderful product that I can use. There are very few make up, shampoos, &amp; etc. that I can use as they all have either perfume or botanticals.</li>
            <li> Great to use with cotton masks or under moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Perfect hyaluronic acid treatment - bottle lasts for ever!</li>
            <li> This product has drastically improved the texture of my skin and hydrates the dry patches around my nose and eyes very well. (my skin type is normal to dry). It also helps my thick moisturizer absorb better. I put this on after my AHA then I follow the product with my nightly moisturizer. I will for sure be repurchasing this when I run out.</li>
            <li> I feel that this formula has changed...doesn&#x27;t work as well as it use to.</li>
            <li> I use it on my child&#x27;s exzema-prone skin.  We went a very long stretch of time without having any flare ups and not having to resort to stronger medicated lotions, I am very pleased and will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> This is HG for my dry, sensitive skin, highly, highly recommended. I used to use the american version and liked it enough but this blows it out of the water. It also lasts for months and I use more than the amount recommended. LOVE!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I had to stop using this after I realized it was irritating my skin!!</li>
            <li> I love this product!!</li>
            <li> Love it, especially to use as a mask</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a grease ball and I love this moisturizer. I know that its supposed to be a premoisturizer thing but i&#x27;m so oily that this is all I use. Its not sticky, it absorbs quick, applies easy, and makes my skin bouncy.</li>
            <li> Works very well!  One bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> After years of living in a house filled with chain smokers, I figured it was time to start taking at least a little care of my skin. And since Asians make some of the best things ever, I figured they would have some concoctions worth trying. After using this my skin was really soft, and it absorbed well (only when I did the patting thing though, which isn&#x27;t as annoying as I thought it would be). I had to experiment to see how many drops I should use. One wasn&#x27;t enough, and three made me break out (not a bad break out - it went away in a day or two when I started using less.). When I stopped using it for a week and only used lotion, my skin felt dry again. All in all I like it and will keep using it. The bottle lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> Greatest moisturizer for oily acne /blackhead prone skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year, great product! My friends and I love it! It is exactly what I need![[ASIN:B000FQUGXA Rohto Hadalabo Gokujyn Hyaluronic Acid Lotion (Moist) - 170ml]]</li>
            <li> I use this after my toner (Paula&#x27;s Choice Skin Recovery for dry to very dry skin) and before my lotion (first aid beauty cream) and vaseline. It has a thin and slippery consistency, so you do not need much for it to work. Although I&#x27;ve seen some videos where they pat this in, I just slap it on and rub it in. Since starting to use this (several months ago) it has really &#x27;locked in&#x27; the moisture and seems to help keep my skin hydrated. It&#x27;s no miracle but is a great addition to many dry skin routines, and I have had the most luck with it when using it after a chemical (10% AHA) exfoliator.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this product!....nearly. It moisturizes deeply as promised and shipped quickly. I have very sensitive, acne-prone, combination skin. It&#x27;s oily but dry, especially since this winter season. This has not broken me out once and I love how it makes my skin feel! I gave 4 stars instead of 5 due to the moisture dissipating if you don&#x27;t seal it in with a serum/lotion etc. (But the texture of the skin remains smooth) and because the smell is &amp;#34;plastic-y&amp;#34; smelling although very light. I can deal with it and at the amazing price...this is definitely a new staple in my skincare routine! My face has been acne free as well since using this. (I focus on having healthier skin instead of using drying acne products and my acne went away. I&#x27;m black btw if this helps anyone *^-^*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.s. A little goes a loooong way! I learned this the hard way lol!</li>
            <li> I liked how light it felt on my skin and it initially felt hydrating. After using it for a few weeks, my face still felt dry and I also started breaking out a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a little disappointed because I really had faith it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad it works for some people though.</li>
            <li> This products did not have any ingredients listed when I bought it and it said it was for sensitive skin. Well, when it arrived the ingredients listed were: water, butylene glycol, glycerin, disodium succinate, hydrolized hyaluronic acid, hydoxyethylcellulose, methylparaben, PPG-10 methly glucose ether, sodium acetylated, hyaluronate, sodium hyaluronate, succining acid.. I decided against putting this on my face, since what we put on our skin can be absorbed by the blood. Hyaluronic acid may be great, but with parabens and all this other junk, no way I&#x27;m putting this on my face.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for two years. No color no scent no alcohol, good for sensitive skin. Recommend for Asian girls.</li>
            <li> I am 78 years old. I have always had good skin, but of course nature takes its toll. I used this product only 2 days and have noticed a great improvement, all the pores are tiny to gone. Like a miracle, I am going to order more as I don&#x27;t want to run out of it and I have shared this news with friends and family. It is such a great product that I fear the price may go up. It is very liquidy, I pour a bit, like the size of a nickel in my palms and place it on my face avoiding the eyes, and then you keep patting it, Not rubbing but patting and it gets really sticky, Then you know you are done and in an hour of so examine your skin in a magniflying mirror, You will NOT believe it.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin...but oily skin needs moisturizing too, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d read many-a-positive review about this lotion. I&#x27;d also heard a lot of the &#x27;hyaluronic hype&#x27;--how it could make one&#x27;s skin supple and flawless in appearance.&lt;br /&gt;Well...I have to admit, I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this product. It is very watery and slippery--so be prepared. I do not wear it alone though. I combine a drop (eye drop amount) with my favorite daytime moisturizer. It not only extends the life of my semi-pricey moisturizer but also gives a dewy, breathable feel to my skin. It&#x27;s especially pleasant on the delicate under-eye area. I misplaced the bottle during a recent move...and was truly surprised when I noticed my skin acting \\&quot;parched\\&quot;. (Oily parched! An oxymoron?)  With as many products as I&#x27;ve tried over the years...and believe me,  there&#x27;s been a whole lot...this one I will keep in my arsenal. (My sister, who is only 3 years my senior, commented this very evening \\&quot;Your skin sure looks pretty\\&quot;, then incredulously added; \\&quot;You don&#x27;t even have any wrinkles!\\&quot; Both in our forties--that&#x27;s a compliment indeed!) I can&#x27;t credit the lotion as a hallowed &#x27;this will prevent wrinkles&#x27; savior, but I truly like the way my skin feels and looks with its usage. When my bottle eventually runs out, I will be clicking to buy another.</li>
            <li> It is the original staff from Hadalabo. It relieved me from dryness in this winter. Good purchase and will buy it again!</li>
            <li> The texture is quite sticky after.... does it help soften my skin? I do not feel so.  I will probably not repurchase.  I am not sure if I am using this correctly, I wish there are better instructions.</li>
            <li> If you have a dry skin like I do, this is one of the \\&quot;must have\\&quot; items. I apply this Hada Labo before my daily moisturizer and it works just great! :)</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and this has really helped to both tame my T-Zone and hydrate the dryer parts of my face. Already part of my regular skin regimen.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer itself is good on its own but because it isn&#x27;t a cream base but a liquid/acid it makes it very ideal for turning it into a mask. Buy DIY mask tablets and add the same amount you would to your face onto the tablet to soak up. Then apply the mask to your face, doing this allows the lotion to soak in versus drying out right away from the air. When I don&#x27;t have time for masks, apply and wear an overnight water pack (got one made by Leniege) that seals whatever is underneath all night long. And just wash it off in the morning. Just like getting a spa treatment !</li>
            <li> Read the reviews and then buy and try.  It is fantastic, adds and keeps moisture all day. I top off with CeraVe, but  I have switched to most of the beauty products offered by this line. Great for any age.  My skin is so sensitive, but this product has been without any reaction.</li>
            <li> This review is for Hada Labo Tokyo Replenishing Hydrator [Super Hyaluronic Acid]. I just started using the Hydrator and am thus far extremely impressed. I&#x27;ve used various products that contain Hyaluronic Acid as well as pure HA on my skin for several years all with good results. However this product seems different and more than lives up to its claims. After learning about Hada Labo from a popular online beauty site and prior to purchase, I researched the product and it&#x27;s company. According to the Hada Labo /Rohto Pharmaceutical website, it is the first Japanese skincare line to become available in the U.S. and is the 2nd largest consumer health company in Japan. Noting that Japanese women seem to always have gorgeous skin I felt it was worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1- Instantly makes your skin feel silky soft&lt;br /&gt;2- Soaks in quickly so that you can follow it almost immediately with additional moisturizer, primer or foundation&lt;br /&gt;3- No noticeable smell&lt;br /&gt;4- Does indeed \\&quot;plump\\&quot; fine lines also smooth&#x27;s out and firms your skin&lt;br /&gt;5- According to company literature, you can even \\&quot;pat\\&quot; this serum over your foundation - I tried this technique after a long day when my skin felt rather dry. I was surprised to discover that it worked! I fully expected it to disturb my foundation but instead it just disappeared into my skin and softened the lines on my eye lids and mouth without streaking or changing my foundation or my eye [powder] eye shadow.&lt;br /&gt;6- Very reasonably priced. The article where I first heard about this product listed several other similar HA products some priced at $100+ with others in the $50 range, HL&#x27;s Replenishing Hydrator was the least expensive which is what prompted me to give it a try first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t have any \\&quot;cons\\&quot; with regards to this product. I will mention that as it is somewhat \\&quot;watery\\&quot; [somewhere between water and a light gel] in texture and just a little runny you have to be careful when dispensing intoyour hand so not to waste any; the pump bottle helps with this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Opinion: I&#x27;m know I&#x27;m not the only woman who has spent way to much money on products that only promise and don&#x27;t deliver! However, HL Replenishing Hydrator is not one of those products, it truly delivers everything promised and then some. The company claims that a bottle of their Replenishing Hydrator is sold every 4 seconds in Japan, and I can believe it! I&#x27;m so satisfied with this product that I sent the company a \\&quot;thank you\\&quot; email for bringing it to the US.</li>
            <li> Well worth it it&#x27;s great for my skin care routine. This helps give my skin moisture and keeps it locked in.</li>
            <li> I have the whole hada labo line and this is a great toner, but do not use it for your moisturizing needs, buy the milk lotion or the cream to complete the process because this is only a toner. Great first step in the series for dry and sensitive skin. This is not a lotion, do your research first.</li>
            <li> I ran across Rohto Hadalabo Gokujyn Hyaluronic Acid Lotion when I was in Japan in the spring of 2012, and I&#x27;m so glad I did. First of all, the line was introduced in 2010 and became an immediate success. The label states that one bottle is sold every four seconds (in Japan), and my only complaint is that it&#x27;s not readily available in the U.S.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no alcohol or mineral oil, no artificial colors, either. The full list of ingredients is as follows:  Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, PPG-10 Methyl Glucose Ether, Disodium Succinate, Methyl Paraben, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Succinic Acid, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really hydrates my skin, makes it feel nice and soft. Plus the packaging is so great, very appealing to either sex. Even people who cannot read Japanese characters can appreciate the look of this product, very cool!</li>
            <li> Clogged up my pores and it does not absorb into your skin well. It is always sitting on top of your skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really had problems with dry skin since I moved back to the East Coast, USA this year from Singapore. I used so many different moisturizers and would still wake up every morning with dry patches on my face. I am currently using a $400 moisturizer specifically for dry skin. STILL I would have dry patches. Then I decided to give this a go because I know how good hyaluronic acid is for your skin, especially dry skin. I added this toner after my cleaner and exfoliating toner, then put on serum, eye cream, and moisturizer. There is such a big difference! No more dry patches! The very next day, my skin felt supple and not dry. I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for about 2 weeks and dry skin is completely banished. This product is amazing. I would never not use this product in the winter time or dry climates ever. The price is unbelievably inexpensive too. For my whole face, I only use two drops from the bottle, and the bottle is so big. It will take me over a year to use all of this up! So glad I found this product, it has transformed my skin!</li>
            <li> I live in Japan and have been using this for a few years now. It&#x27;s only about $8 here in Japan so it&#x27;s considered quite cheap, but it is one of the most effective drug store items I&#x27;ve ever used. This is super gentle and has never bothered my skin (just for reference, CeraVe hydrating cleanser burns my face.) In Japan lotions are used like moisturizing toners, you put it on after washing your face and before any anti-aging serums and face cream or western &#x27;face lotion&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t take the time to put this on correctly it will be sticky and not absorb well.&lt;br /&gt;I use it 3 ways;&lt;br /&gt;1st. I use it with Chizu Saeki&#x27;s lotion mask technique.&lt;br /&gt;2nd. I use it on the moisturizing setting of my Hitachi Hada Crie.&lt;br /&gt;3rd. This is the most normal way, I spread a few drops on my face then gently pat until it&#x27;s no longer sticky.&lt;br /&gt;If you use too much it will take forever to absorb and if you just try to just rub it in, it will probably remain sticky. Patting is the key to this product.&lt;br /&gt;You will probably still need moisturizer after this. This works like a moisture booster not a replacement for moisturizer. This line of products in Japan has serums and moisturizers in it so this is meant to be part of a routine that usually includes about 5 steps in Japan. If you are looking for one product to replace your other skin care steps, this is not it. If you want your skin care routine to go faster, don&#x27;t get this. If you don&#x27;t like spending time on skin care, don&#x27;t get this.</li>
            <li> Stings my hands when I put a couple drops in my palm and mix with water. Why would I want to add something that irritates and stings my hands to my face? Its only effect is to make my hands and face feel slippery, which also happens when you spill hydrochloric acid on your hands back in high school chemistry or when using it for cleaning.</li>
            <li> I use this before applying my moisturizer morning and night, absolutely makes a difference in the appearance and feel of my skin.</li>
            <li> Used AM and PM, my skin is nice and soft and glowy, with no irritation. I love the simple thin gel consistency and how it only takes 2 drops to spread over my entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AM it goes over my black snail AIO and under Biore watery essence and provides just the right amount of moisture to get me through these dry california summer days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PM it goes over paula&#x27;s choice BHA, black snail AIO, and under Benton snailbee steam cream. So it acts as a moisturizer with the benton steam cream as an emollient/night pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very nice and soothing for sunburns too!</li>
            <li> I like that this is a very light but easily absorbed hydrater for my face. I dont like the residue of lotions before makeup so this has become a regular as my facial lotion before makeup, before other face products etc.</li>
            <li> I love it as usual. Very moisturizing and hydrating .&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep buying it</li>
            <li> I bought this product after seeing the recommendation on Dr. Oz show. I have dry, resistant, pigmented and tanned Asian skin. It doesn&#x27;t burn, feels like starch mixed with water. You just need a pea size for your face and neck, pat dry after gentle cleansing as a toner. I noticed improvement right after 1 use due to the great hyration to my skin, this is the first Hyaluronic Acid product I have tried, and will continue using it until I find something better, but the chance of that is unlikely. So if you have similar skin type to mine, and need afforadable hydration, I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Havnet start use it, but looks really moisture.</li>
            <li> I love this. It helps my other moisturizers to absorb into my skin. It is very light and makes my skin feel great.</li>
            <li> I have to say, I actually have combination skin and this doesn&#x27;t ever get in the way. After I cleanse in the morning, I apply this and moisturize with a mattifying yet moisturizing cream. It has helped my skin so much! I bought this a while back and admit to just leaving it in my cabinet. Decided to try it again during the winter when I noticed dry spots. This definitely helped so much and doesn&#x27;t make me oily at all. In fact, it&#x27;s helped a lot and my skin has been feeling smoother. The oil in my T-zone has become more manageable too.</li>
            <li> kind of sticky.  time consuming and didn&#x27;t see any results.</li>
            <li> Perfect! The shipping was fast and the product came in perfect condition. I&#x27;ve been using this for half a year and now my sister is using it (I&#x27;ve moved on to a cream from Aquamoist). Will buy from here again</li>
            <li> I love to put this on about every other wash for more moisture. I&#x27;m in my 30s and this helps. I wish I could read the colorful bottle, but I&#x27;m sure it says it was made for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is about the consistency of egg whites.  It soaks in right away. Doesn&#x27;t burn even on sensitive areas.  It just like a thin veil of moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to try at such a low price point. Thinking of gifting some to a friend.</li>
            <li> I very satisfied whit this product I noticed the chance in my skin after 3 days of using it . So happy !!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this in the winter after it was recommended in a big beauty magazine. My skin while oily in the T-zone, is extremely dry everywhere else and i end up using a surgical blade to scrape the dry skin off. I have used it faithfully since getting it, and i love it! I still get a dry patch here and there, but i csn no long sculpt a mini me out of all the flaking skin on my face. My 16 year old son has started using it on his exzema, and he&#x27;s happy with it. It moisturizes without being hot, heavy, and suficating to the skin(his words).</li>
            <li> I have used this product when I lived in Asia and only recently ran out of supplies.&lt;br /&gt;So I was delighted to see it on Amazon at an acceptable price.&lt;br /&gt;I use it every morning and love it.  Hadalabo have a lot of other products, creams and whitening lotions, which I would also recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a moisturizer to repair the moisture barrier of my skin. I have oily acne/clog prone skin that is sensitive and dehydrated (which causes an over oil production). This is an excellent moisturizer and has done exactly what I hoped it would do. It&#x27;s a clear liquid moisturizer, almost watery. It is very lovely to &amp;#34;pat&amp;#34; into the skin. This product has repair my moisture barrier and is usually the only moisturizer I use.&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that the surface redness on my facial skin is much less than it used to be before I introduced this in my routine. This is now a MUST for me. Your experience my differ based on your skin type and skin type needs. I am oily so I only need a little hydration.</li>
            <li> I was not aware that this product would be packaged in Japanese language and therefore  I have no idea what I received nor how to use it.  Very disappointed not packaged in US.  I haven&#x27;t sent it back because not sure how to do so.  The moisturizer is great and thankfully packaged with English language.</li>
            <li> As I began approaching my late 20s I noticed my skin becoming dryer and the moisturizers I was using wasn&#x27;t helping in the slightest. I would even double moisturize my face at night with lotion and then a heavy cream but would still wake up the next morning with pillow wrinkles on my face and dry skin. The lines would eventually lead to deep wrinkles later on in life if I didn&#x27;t find a solution fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interestingly, Asian and black skin are the same in composition. We have thicker skin which makes it difficult for moisturizers to get down to the deepest layers. Because of this, we tend to have dry skin and as a result we produce a ton of sebum which leads to oily surface skin that doesn&#x27;t help to moisturize down to the deepest layers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product, somehow, is able to penetrate down to the deepest layers of my skin. I don&#x27;t know how or why but I&#x27;m so happy! I wake up the following morning and my face is still moist, soft and free of pillow winkles. I also notice that the fine lines that would appear in the morning from my face being tugged and pulled over night by my pillow are no longer an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using this at night I would recommend following with a cream because this product makes any moisturizer you use after it sink deep into every layer. I don&#x27;t even have to use a lot of cream at night, I just use a tiny amount and my face is so moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about two weeks.  I have noticed that my pores look smaller.  I like it so far.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it makes my skin supple and radiant. It just only take a pea size to use all over my face.  In addition, I felt my skin is a little bit tighter than before.</li>
            <li> This was a revelation. You can 100% the reviews here. Got my package two weeks ago and it instructed to only use a few drops. First I thought, what? So little. But, I went with the instructions and it works! IT WORKS. No matter what moisturizer or lotion I used in the past, my skin would always dry up after an hour and then turn all oily for the rest of the day. But, this...... wow. I am speechless. If you are black like me and male and you&#x27;re just tired that lotions and moisturizers never give you the right type of moisture either make your skin feel dry or make you shine too much, this is it! I swear I have never had a product that retained the moisture that well before. It puts everything else into shame and like I said, 1-3 drops are more than enough for the whole face. No odor, it feels like water. Because you only need so little, I would say the whole bottle could last me for at least 6 months. I&#x27;m thinking of buying them in bulk next time in case they are not available in the US anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tl:dr Yes, it works perfect on black skin, too.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to receive my first bottle and was pleased. However, after going through inactive ingredients, I&#x27;m a bit hesitant about using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always use pure rose water and cornflower water as a toner (never ever did I use a non natural toner especially those one with alcohol in it that strips moisture out of your skin). But I&#x27;m in love! Some pointed out the &amp;#34;plastic&#x27;ish&#x27;&amp;#34; smell of it, I cannot find a smell of plastic really but more of a product I used back in kindergarden (yes I know it&#x27;s weird lol). Don&#x27;t get me wrong it is not a natural sent but it is not unpleasant in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, without considering the smell that can bother some, this product work magnificently ! I can really see the difference in my skin now that I use this product every morning and night. My skin does absorb products better than before, and I have found that during the day my skin shines less (I have a normal skin, and normal on the cheeks combination on the T zone in summer time). I found that I break out less since starting to add this product in my routine (coincidence or not I&#x27;m not sure but I do believe it helped as during my period I didn&#x27;t had a single break out, it was a first).&lt;br /&gt;At little of product goes a long way, I pad about 3 to 4 drops maximum on my face and neck each time and about the same amount on the decolletage.</li>
            <li> I love it, it helps my dry skin a lot during the winter time, as the winter in my city is really dry and cold.</li>
            <li> Since I started following the Japanese protocol of facial care, I purchased this product. I do like the result, whenever I apply it as a lotion mask. On a hurry one day, I just dabbed it on my face, after washing it with warm water, and then splashing some cold water: My face was plump!! So, I have started to use it this way as well, although I do continue doing the lotion mask at least once a day. A little bit goes a long way, so it is a great buy. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> this product literally transformed my skin and its effects are permanent rather than temporary as with some skincare products (i.e. once you stop using them, your skin returns to whatever state you were trying to correct).  please don&#x27;t be warned off this amazing product bc of a few negative reviews -- from what i can tell, most of those reviewers are using the product incorrectly, are ignorant about hyaluronic acid generally, or haven&#x27;t even used the product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;here&#x27;s my experience from almost two months using this product.&lt;br /&gt;i have very very dry skin that is somewhat sensitive.  before using hada labo, i&#x27;d been battling facial psoriasis that covered my entire forehead, around my nose, and a few spots on my chin.  i&#x27;d tried everything non-prescription i could get my hands on for two years, and right before purchasing hada labo, the psoriasis started creeping down onto my left eyelid.  i was frantic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after a few days using hada labo in my skincare routine (after cleansing, but before moisturizing), the psoriasis scales reduced in size/scope and after a week they began to recede altogether.  after using this product twice a day for about 2 weeks, i couldn&#x27;t even see where the psoriasis used to be.  it actually surprised me and i had to ask my spouse to confirm what my eyes were seeing lol!  (for those who have never experienced psoriasis:  even when the scales/flakes are gone or temporarily exfoliated, you can still see a bright red patch indicating psoriasis-affected skin.  even with the best of the products i&#x27;d tried, these red patches were ever-present.)  i&#x27;m happy to say that my psoriasis is completely gone, leaving no trace it ever existed in the first place, and hada labo is the only product i tried with both immediate and long-term efficacy.  what i tell my friends is if it can disappear psoriasis, it can probably improve most skin ailments, as psoriasis is notoriously difficult to treat even with prescription products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve now used it twice per day for 6 weeks on my face, body, and hair and i&#x27;m only just getting to the bottom of my first bottle.  i love this product for its results, but the icing on the cake is the price and amount needed per use.  i can&#x27;t say enough about this product and will be repurchasing again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(note on usage:  i&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s been covered by many other reviewers, but you use this product after makeup removal and cleansing but before moisturizing.  if you are on your exfoliating days, it should be after exfoliation and before moisturizing.  i put a nickel-sized amount in my palm, rub my hands together, and then *pat* it into my skin, making sure to get my lips, eyes, and neck as well.  i use the patting method with all skincare stuff bc it helps with absorption and you get more product into the places you need it.  there are a ton of youtube videos if you need detailed steps.)ow used it twice per day for 6 weeks on my face, body, and hair and i&#x27;m only just getting to the bottom of my first bottle.  i love this product for its results, but the icing on the cake is the price and amount needed per use.  i can&#x27;t say enough about this product and will be repurchasing again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(note on usage:  i&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s been covered by many other reviewers, but you use this product after makeup removal and cleansing but before moisturizing.  if you are on your exfoliating days, it should be after exfoliation and before moisturizing.  i put a nickel-sized amount in my palm, rub my hands together, and then *pat* it into my skin, making sure to get my lips, eyes, and neck as well.  i use the patting method with all skincare stuff bc it helps with absorption and you get more product into the places you need it.  there are a ton of youtube videos if you need detailed steps.)</li>
            <li> Great economical version of SK II</li>
            <li> I used for weeks u liked so much make very happy 买买买 👍👍👍</li>
            <li> I love this not sure if it makes a difference, because I use other products as well, but I have extremely sensitive skin, that too rough products such as proactive leave me face covered in rashes. This soothes my skin, because I have a sensitive exfoliating face cleanser, i sometimes over scrub my skin. This soothes my skin like nothing happened and I just absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I love this toner.  It&#x27;s really important to realize that this is NOT the toner you are probably used to in USA.  I grew up with toners that were basically astringents; most of them dried out my skin.  I haven&#x27;t used a toner like that since I was in my early 20s and I agree with most skincare experts that you don&#x27;t need a toner if that&#x27;s the kind of toner you are using.  However, in Asia, a toner is more of a clarifier (skin balancer) and moisture-inducer.  An asian-type toner will never strip your skin and, instead, will bring back that balance if your cleansing products may have stripped the skin of some of its natural balance or moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this toning lotion with the thin face masks and allow it to lay on the skin for 12-20 minutes.  I follow this with a moisturizer and my skin is very grateful.  :-)</li>
            <li> Very hydrating and soothing! Great price for high quality product. I discovered that it fixes my eczema as well!!! In an 8oz spray bottle I mix 4oz this product to 4oz filtered water and spray directly on my scalp eczema. You could probably put it on a cotton ball and dab as well. Instantly soothed and healed my scalp eczema.</li>
            <li> Being using this for a year, and i love it. I have oil skin, i won&#x27;t say this lotion reduce the oil on my face, but as u know, if your skin is properly hydrated, then the oil on your skin will eventually reduced, and it has!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a typical American lotion. This is the Japanese version of lotion, WHICH IS THE TONER IN THE US. So, you&#x27;ll need a real lotion after this &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34;.  Or if you live in Miami like me, then this alone will do the job( If you don&#x27;t have dry or flake skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the stickiness some other reviews mention, I won&#x27;t call that&#x27;s really sticky, it&#x27;s really just like any other toner but with a feel of lotion(all lotions has a bit of stickiness).</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin be warned.  I do and this product dries out my skin. At every use, it has left dry patches on my skin for days.  I thought at first it was it could have also been because I had travelled and flying will sometimes wreak havoc on my sensitive skin, but when my skin finally retuned to normal long after that, I tried it once again, and I had the same reaction. So I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> I was on Spring Break vacation in Cancun and I got an awful sunburn all over my face. Of course I&#x27;m an idiot and i forgot my moisturizer (i use Clinique daily moisturizer) at home so I was really in a pinch. Luckily i had brought this with me…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to apply a ton of makeup on my poor sunburned skin because I was going out partying that night, but my skin was in terrible condition. I do remember that this product REALLY helped my skin calm down and it moisturized it to the point where i could safely apply foundation. the next morning, my skin was a lot better. i used it multiple times during that vacation and it soothed my terrible sunburn - i would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> i got it for a moisturizer and it is not what i expected, i think there are several other korean moisturizers that are better</li>
            <li> worst breakout of my life w this stuff - don&#x27;t know why. I have really dry skin and I was hoping that this would be hydrating. I must be allergic so something in it.</li>
            <li> I bought this a year ago because of the crazy hype, used it every day for six months...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...and not gunna lie, I still have no idea what it does :/</li>
            <li> Just pat it on ur face and itl absorb the product</li>
            <li> This is the second time I ordered this product and it works wonders! I will definitely repurchase in the future.</li>
            <li> I have been using similar products purchased for a much larger price point than this. I use it in combination with Keihl&#x27;s facial fuel get for a deep hydrating mask with amazing results.</li>
            <li> Holy grail item, smells nice, feels nice and I love that I don&#x27;t have to use too much in order to apply the product evenly, making this a good investment (Two-three drops is all you need). It has improved my skin overall, toned down the redness, evened out my complexion, softened it, filled it with moisture and didn&#x27;t clog my pores. Definitely will repurchase.</li>
            <li> It is absolute truth, you only need 3 drops, after my face toner, and before moisturizer or serum, it completely moisture barriers the skin, making the products very much more effective!  Long wait to receive it though!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a Japanese facial lotion to try out Chizu Saeki&#x27;s skin care revolution. I was desperate in finding a better skin care routine coz I want to get rid of my monthly hormonal breakouts. I researched the best reviewed and inexpensive product online and came down with Hadalabo. I ordered it and didn&#x27;t really expect much from it while I wait for it in the mail. And then a week later, I stumbled upon it while I was shopping in a local Marina Grocery. I thought, hmm, I already have the moist version in the mail, why not try the light version this time. And then that same day my aunt from Okinawa came in town and said that she&#x27;s been using Hadalabo for as long as she can remember and that no other product work as well. That gave me more confidence in buying this product. And so I tried it and even took pictures daily for my progress. I saw gradual improvement in the first week. And then during the time when I know I&#x27;d have my hormonal breakouts, they did not appear 0_o. Even after a month, 2 months, 3 months...nothing. But once in a while a little bump a little bigger than a white head would come out. I would just do my normal routine (use it after I cleanse my face morning and night), the next morning, it would be gone. I know that&#x27;s too good to be true but it really happens to me. I&#x27;m really happy I found and tried this product. I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going to take me a LONG while to get through this whole bottle, and I love it. Totally worth buying. I only use it at night and I seriously use 3-4 drops only. Although the consistency is a little thicker than I expected it doesn&#x27;t leave a super sticky feeling. It gets absorbed quickly and keeps my skin nicely moisturized till morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also got those little dry face masks that looks like tums http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008M74HZM/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1  I squirt some of this on the mask and after a minute of soaking, the mask expands and I use it for 15 min. before disposing.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few weeks now and I cannot really say whether it has made a difference for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Not good for winter. Okay for summer.</li>
            <li> This is a great, super lightweight moisturizing Japanese lotion.  Asian lotions are quite water-y in consistency and are used as a base layer.  I have dry skin and this helps provide and lock in moisture right after washing my face.  I&#x27;ll layer on another moisturizer or cream after when weather conditions are really drying.  You only need a small amount so this bottle will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion not too heavy very moisturising and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film. It also sits really well under my makeup which I&#x27;ve had trouble with when it comes to most lotions. Glad I purchased this! Haven&#x27;t encountered a Hadalabo skin product I don&#x27;t love so far</li>
            <li> I got this product since I saw review on Youtube. Something that I need to say is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Always research products according to your needs.&lt;br /&gt;2. Take in consideration that a good nutrition and lots of water is gonna give the product a goo kick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I considered this since I have really dry skin. I used after cleansing my face and before my regular moisturizer. After four days, my skin was looking smoother, softer and make up looked actually good again!  I noticed a changed with my regular moisturizer before but this product seems to help a LOT more. Is easy to apply and it feels thicker than water but no smell or funny \\&quot;after feeling\\&quot; on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My complexion is more elastic, 100% recommended.</li>
            <li> Make my face smooth and hydrated . Smell is also good .</li>
            <li> At first I loved this then I realized instead of being soaked up by my face it was sitting on top of it. I will say that with this product a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> ANYONE WITH DRY SKIN NEEDS TO USE THIS PRODUCT!!!! THIS IS MY HOLY GRAIL MOISTURIZING PRODUCT!! I use it in addition to a cream moisturizer because my skin is so super dry, but I&#x27;ve forgotten to moisturize afterward a time or two and it kept my skin hydrated for the whole day.  You only need a miniscule amount so it will last longer than you expect 170ml to last.  Great purchase.  So great for dry skin.. Or any skin really.</li>
            <li> Nice light serum that&#x27;s great for layering underneath moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t break you out or feel heavy. For oily skinned people this could be used alone. I use it alone on my forehead and there&#x27;s no dryness at the end of the day. Very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> This lotion dries in instantly which I use on my hands and arms as well. It takes years off my skin</li>
            <li> i used 2 of them already. it works perfect for me!</li>
            <li> I got turned onto Hyaluronic acid thanks to the Asian paper masks found in Asian markets. Putting on a mask everyday is a hassle though because you have to have 15-20 minutes of dedicated face time with the mask nevermind the whole minute or two it takes to unwrap one and put it on neatly on your face. This product cuts the time down to a minute or two. Rub a pea-sized amount in your hands to warm it up, pat gently all over your face until it dries. It doesn&#x27;t sting or burn and doesn&#x27;t have a noxious smell or taste so if you get some on your lips or close to your eyes it&#x27;s not a problem. I personally top it off with an Evian mist (how pretentious!) but due to how well this product works, I might look into Rohto Hadalabo&#x27;s Milk lotion product as well! After the Evian mist, I seal in the moisture with a few pumps of Argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would still advise a weekly mask, but this product allows you to have a higher level of hydration and silky smoothness throughout the week rather than just briefly after you use the mask.</li>
            <li> Yes, this is a must-have item. But what&#x27;s the japanese secret to using it? LOTION MASKS. If you haven&#x27;t read Chizu Saeki&#x27;s book on japanese anti-aging skincare techniques, get thee over to that Amazon page now and put it in your cart! Otherwise, you&#x27;re not getting full use out of this wondrous liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lotion masks are thin cotton pads that you saturate with the Hada Labo and leave on your face for 3-5 minutes (they&#x27;re the same thing as Sheet Masks but more economical). By the law of osmosis, the moist hyaluronic acid soaks into the dry skin when it has a chance to be wetter, longer, in contact with the dermis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See, if your skin is dry, simply applying the lotion doesn&#x27;t allow it to fully penetrate. it&#x27;s like spraying a paper towel with water. What happens? it evaporates and gets even drier or crunchier.  Now, if you put a wet sponge onto a paper towel, the towel gets more saturated and fully soaked with moisture. Same theory with the lotion masks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To properly use this lotion, do what thousands of Japanese and Asian women do with this product: peel cotton pads into thin layers, saturate, then let sit on skin for 3-5 minutes. You will see a VAST difference in plumping + hydration with this synergistic technique vs. just applying the product on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: the cotton pads to use with this technique are: [[ASIN:B00260T94K Selena Multi-layer Cotton Puffs - 80 sheets]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Money-Saving Tip: This product is available in POUCH REFILL form (!), saving you valuable dollars off the price while being eco-friendly as well.</li>
            <li> This one makes my face not dry , its good for my skin . .  . . .  . .</li>
            <li> The texture of this is not like your conventional lotion: it is clear and a consistency of thinned egg white. I put this on right after I wash my face to boost the moisture, before layering on other products. A little goes a long way, I practically only need to use a drop or two for entire face/neck, so a bottle will last me a long while. Does not irritate my skin. Good product!</li>
            <li> &#x3D;D Love this product&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and it moisturizes my skin well without breakouts or irritating my skin</li>
            <li> I knew it was going to be a very light product. I am not sure of its hydration properties. Feels like glycerine and water are the main component of the lotion. I think it dries the skin if anything... Got it because of great review but I wish I could return it. I gave it a try for two weeks but got dry and flaky skin as a result. Great customer service and fast shipping though...</li>
            <li> it just didn&#x27;t work with me. Didn&#x27;t feel moisturized after apply.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it in the winter and maybe the climate I am in is too dry area.  Hope it would work for someone.</li>
            <li> I like this, but I don&#x27;t absolutely love it. I have been using it morning and night for 4 days and have noticed some difference in the suppleness of my skin but nothing amazing. I have also tried the lotion mask suggestions but that uses so much more product than just putting a few drops on my skin.</li>
            <li> This product is a \\&quot;Toner\\&quot;, totally NOT a lotion (Plz do NOT use Google Translate)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe that&#x27;s why some customers gave really low review!</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I was prepared that this was not your typical moisturizer in a review I read prior to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, you should know that it is of a thin--almost sticky--consistency.  However, do not be put off.  A small amount is easy to apply to a damp face.  Then let it absorb into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes i put more conventional moisturizer over this product once it has been absorbed.  Either way, I will be buying more of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I have combination skin that has not been negatively affected by the application of this product--that is, no break outs, nor dryness.</li>
            <li> Seriously, you still need to use a moisturizer with this product. This is great for added hydration but it&#x27;s not a \\&quot;lotion\\&quot; like we think of them in the west. Think of it as a moisturizing serum, you use a few drops and then add your regular moisturizer on top of it. I think that&#x27;s why so many people are having problems with it and giving it negative reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m loving this stuff. After reading many a review online about hyaluronic acid serums I decided that I needed to try one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price: Midrange, $20 for the 170mL bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging; Nothing fancy. Just a plastic squeeze bottle with a flip cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texture: Feels like lube. Lol, seriously though, it&#x27;s thin and really slippery. No fragrance which is a huge plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application: It spreads really easily. A few drops is really all you need to cover your face/neck/chest. This bottle is going to last a really long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and I absolutely adore the results. It doesn&#x27;t sting my sensitive skin at all. My skin is supple, plump and firm looking. I finally don&#x27;t have any more flaking or peeling (from retin-a). Even my acne is looking better. I&#x27;ve gone 2 days without any new eruptions which is huge for me. I feel like this is really soothing and hydrating and that my skin breaks out due to dryness and dehydration. If you have sensitive, dehydrated, acne-prone skin then I definitely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;A+ would buy again.</li>
            <li> Great hydrating toner.  Will definitely purchase again.  Doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or upset my sensitive, acneic skin.  Hydrates well, but you do need to use another moisturizer over the top in my opinion, at least if you have dry skin.  This is really a toner, not a lotion as we know in the USA.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Absorbed easily and quickly and seemed to hydrate skin well. However, after use, your skin might feel a bit sticky to the touch. Not anything to make it unpleasant though. One thing: For me, I needed a bit more than one pea sized amount like what the directions said. Maybe 2-3 drops worked well</li>
            <li> Its light and does it job. Usually worn under another moisturizer.</li>
            <li> my friends recommended it to me, I like it very much. It is very soft and moisturized. The price is reasonable compare with those expensive bottles we got from big brands..</li>
            <li> I know a lot of people is probably using this as a at home sheet mask, which is great, and it is definitely worth the money, even if you are only using this as a toner it is still pretty good on the skin, it is light weight and watery, however i believe this is a product more suitable for younger skin that doesn&#x27;t need much to look beautiful(meaning you are under 25 yrs old), but if you are using this as a homemade mask then its great.</li>
            <li> No smell AT ALL. If you are sensitive to cosmetic products that smell like chemicals, here you go. I use this one as a &amp;#34;toner.&amp;#34; then I apply the milky lotion after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERY moisturizing. When I put this on my skin, it feels sticky at first. but as i massage on my face.. oh emm geeee&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cheaper online than in other off-line beauty shops ($20-25)</li>
            <li> I read about this lotion in a Top 10 beauty product review and have been using it for about a month. This is a pre-moisturizer product and it&#x27;s done wonders for my combination skin. I used to get an oil slick on my forehead by mid-day but this product has reduced it dramatically.  I&#x27;ve also gone a whole day without makeup or washing my face in the evening, and the next morning my skin still feels soft and moist. No oil slick! My husband uses it too and we&#x27;ve barely put a dent in the bottle. $17 in product will last months, even with daily use by 2 people. You only need 3 drops in your hand, and pat it on before applying moisturizer.  I&#x27;ve started using it on my neck and chest and my skin feels so much better.</li>
            <li> Very good product ! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This definitely seems more like a toner than a lotion, but it works great nonetheless. You get a good amount of product for what you play for as well. Love this!</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin and figured that I would get this since it was known to moisturize really well. And YES that was true!! It has a very liquidity texture and is not oily at all! Once your skin drinks it up your face feels soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li> it only took me 1 and half day to get it. its really really fast. this product is very suitable for dry skin or in winner. i love it.</li>
            <li> I works fine as a toner, it&#x27;s too liquid to use it as a lotion. It worked fine for my sensitive skin, but I didn&#x27;t notice any big changes.</li>
            <li> It feels like applying glue on my face when I use it. It&#x27;s sticky and does not absorb at all.</li>
            <li> I like this toner but I was expecting the texture of this toner to be a little thicker so that stay on the skin longer and moisturize more and longer.  However, this is a much lighter and watery toner.  If you have an oily skin or you are young with a combination skin, this is the right toner.  It is not heavy on your skin and gives the right amount moisture and does not make your skin oily/shiny.  For me, I am getting older and have a combination skin with dry patches here and there.  So this is not exactly right.  The oily section of my skin gets moisturized but the dry section of my face gets drier after a few hours and I feel the need to moisturize again.  I do use a moisturized after the toner, but I think I should use a little richer/more moisturizing toner for my skin.</li>
            <li> I am using this along with &amp;#34;Cure&amp;#34; an excellent exfoliator. It is very light and only a few drops is needed. I have been using this for about a month and am seeing wonderful results. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin prone to breakouts from both my mother&#x27;s and father&#x27;s genes. I stuck to the light formula for years because of this, but feel oily more often than I&#x27;d like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought this and am never going back: it absorbs so much faster than the light formula and leaves my skin with a much more tacky feel no matter how much I put on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go for it even if you are oily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an AWESOME product.  It&#x27;s the best face product I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not actually a lotion,but a toner. Which I understood prior to ordering. I use it nearly daily, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and when applied on a hot day when your skin is fried it&#x27;s pretty cooling.</li>
            <li> I put this on before traditional lotion and it seems to boost moisturization. I just pat it on until the product drys and becomes tacky. Plus the bottle will last forever.</li>
            <li> Very thin, easily absorbed, super moisturizing. I can put this on with my acne products to layer, or just add a touch of moisture on its own. Basically the perfect product. I have acne prone skin and this does not make me break out.</li>
            <li> I was a bit taken aback when I opened the package and saw how watery it was. I thought \\&quot;how could such a watery product even do anything for my skin?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, this stuff is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It made my skin smoother and softer. It even shrunk my pores! Only 3 drops were used for my whole face, but it was so light and refreshing with no fragrance or burn. Now it&#x27;s plain to see why hadalabo is so popular! I&#x27;m sure to buy more once my bottle runs out (but it might take years!)</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! First off, if you&#x27;re going to buy this, let me make something clear about this being called a lotion: It is not the Western definition of lotion. It&#x27;s not like a cream you put on your face to moisturize. This is more of a moisturizing TONER but the Japanese refer to such products as lotions. So do NOT use this by itself. It is to be used BEFORE you place your actual designated moisturizer onto your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency of this liquid is like a very slightly viscous liquid- a slightly gooey/sticky water but far more like water with that slight viscosity to it. It is scentless and contains 3 types of hyaluronic acids meant to penetrate and moisturize your epidermis and dermis(I believe this is just the brand embellishing the efficacy of the lotion but it for sure is a great product) while also keeping a healthy level of moisture donated to your skin by the present atmosphere. From what I saw in the HadaLabo direction video for English-speakers, you are to use it after cleansing and drying your face, pour a bit on your palm (I use three drops. A little goes a long way!) and smooth it on your face and pat pat pat your skin. It will begin to feel sticky, but keep patting until your skin has completely absorbed it- then you can use your actual moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Cetaphil moisturizing cream as my moisturizer of choice and although that did a great job of moisturizing, I must say its moisturizing is far more improved with this lotion. I&#x27;m not even a usual sufferer of dry skin but I can feel and see my skin looking better every day with the use of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if you&#x27;re a reader and follower of Chizu Saeki&#x27;s The Japanese Skincare Revolution, this stuff is perfect for moisture masks! I like to use a bit of this lotion and a pinch of L-ascorbic acid and my skin looks and feels refreshed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing, there is a newer version of this lotion. The seller I chose, sea-trade, sent me not the version pictured above, but instead the newer version which should be in the box that says &amp;#34;There is a newer version of this item.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m not sure if all sellers are sending the new version, but honestly, I believe it&#x27;s the same product in just prettier packaging and the product is all around fantastic. It has earned its five stars and done as advertised!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I put it on before bed and after waking up, and it leaves my skin so moisterized! I have trouble with dry patches and after using this even those are gone. Its excellent under makeup, and doesnt make my skin oily. New favorite lotion!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this great product!  Try it every day for at least 4 -6 weeks and watch your skin improve significantly.</li>
            <li> I have been applying this lotion every day for the past 6 weeks and my skin still feels dry. Hyaluronic acid is supposed to draw moisture from the air, but that only works if you&#x27;re in a place that has high humidity. Maybe if I had purchased it during the summer instead of winter, it would have worked better. I thought this lotion would be a replacement to my Cetaphil, but I have to apply them together to get maximum moisture.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item to use in conjunction with my regular facial moisturizer and I must say it works very very well. It&#x27;s like pouring moisture INTO your skin. My hair is extremely dry, as is my skin, so one day after showering, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try and apply it to my wet hair and style as usual.  I&#x27;m happy to report it sort of works like a very light styling gel or mousse. I usually put my hair up in scrunchy clip and let it dry that way. So when I take my hair out, it sort of &#x27;sets&#x27; in curls.I like the effect and so consequently, I&#x27;ve gone through my first bottle probably more quickly than most -  but for the great price and the wonderful benefit of this product, I feel it is completely worth it. They say Beauty comes at a price - and this is certainly a price I don&#x27;t mind paying!</li>
            <li> It really moisturize my skin. Last all day long. I brought it with natural republic&#x27;s aloe vera 92%gel, and it is much better! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic Acid Lotion maintain your face moist and very even completion all the times.  I recommend this product. Thank you</li>
            <li> If you have a dry skin, or live in dangerously cold and dry area, you should try this product. Great product.</li>
            <li> I love it. I pair this with their night cream as my skin care regiment. While this is supposedly a lotion it&#x27;s supposedly also part toner. Honestly this brand was highly suggested to me by a friend and she suggested to use this as a toner . I can&#x27;t read Japanese but at least can figure it out.&lt;br /&gt;On it&#x27;s own it&#x27;s able to provide light moisture and after having used it for awhile I did notice an improvement in my skin. One bottle of this stuff can definitely also go a long way as I took a bottle 3/4 full on a half year trip to Europe and it lasted the whole time!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I use it before I put my sunscreen/foundation on. It makes your skin glow. You can&#x27;t use it alone or I think you would be too shiny. But it is great for making it soft. Could definitely use as a light night cream too</li>
            <li> This assists product makes my skin so smooth. I use it before moisturizer and it just gives a youthful glow to my skin. I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I have oily, acne-prone skin, and this is an excellent moisturizer for when I want some hydration, without the oily/greasy feeling. After cleansing, I pour a dime-sized amount into my clean palm, rub my hands together to warm it up, and then pat the product onto my skin until fully absorbed. It does feel a little bit sticky upon application, but it dries smoothly. I can use this in the morning and at night. It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue behind and the skin just feels soft and plump. I have been using this for a couple of months now and it has never broken me out. A very nice hyaluronic acid moisturizer!</li>
            <li> This is very gentle and perfect for my sensitive skin. It&#x27;s not very moisturizing on it&#x27;s own, but I layer it with other gentle moisturizers.</li>
            <li> overprice but it work perfectly good</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful. I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I also own the Shirojyun (whitening). This lotion formula is more like a light gel and feels very moisturizing, whereas the shirojyun is just watery. I also purchased some 5 layer cotton squares to make my own mask out of. (I purchased Selena brand on Amazon, highly recommend for masks as the layers are soft and peel apart very easily. I also purchased the Shiseido but they do not peel apart easily as I do not think they are made for that. I do recommend Shiseido for just regular toner uses). I love this gel. My skin is unbelievably sensitive and this does not irritate it at all, if fact it felt very soothing. I will update later to see if it makes a change in my overall skin appearance.</li>
            <li> I purchased a bottle of this months before the Hado line came out in the US.  I still have a bit less than half a bottle left!  Granted, I probably have so much left because I&#x27;m not very regimented with my skin care (I know, I know). I believe that daily use would still last you over a month, probably two. All you need is a dash in the palm of your hand. When I DO remember to smooth it over my face, neck, and chest (day and night) for more than 3 days in a row, my boyfriend always remarks on how my skin looks &amp;#34;brighter&amp;#34; and smoother. It absorbs quickly and I usually let it sit on my skin for about 30 seconds before following up with a moisturizer and/or serum.  This stuff is great and I will definitely be re-upping once my supply gets low. The only warning I would give is that it&#x27;s practically got the same consistency as water; calling it a lotion is misleading. But the plus to that is you only need a very small amount so for $18 this is a totally affordable addition to your skin care process. (Especially if you&#x27;re the kind of girl who drops $50+ on 1oz jars of moisturizers and whatnot!)&lt;br /&gt;I have semi-sensitive skin and this has no odor and doesn&#x27;t in any way irritate my skin. A+&lt;br /&gt;Update: It happened again. I used this for 4 days in a row and the boyfriend remarked on how bright and lovely my skin looks. I cannot stress how great this product is!</li>
            <li> This is amazing! My skin is pretty dry. Most moisturizers just don&#x27;t satisfy my skin, but if I use this first then apply moisturizer, my skin feels great!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. I use it with cotton sheets to make a mask and leave it on my skin for 20 minutes. It&#x27;s nice. It hydrates and moisturizes my skin very well. I usually do this before bed once a week and the next morning, my skin looks soft and supple. When my skin is dull and dry, I like to put some on before make up and my skin is revived again. I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It has definately helped my dry and sensitive skin without giving me additional breakouts.</li>
            <li> A very straightforward product with the consistency of a very loose gel.  It&#x27;s more like a hydrating toner than a lotion, and that&#x27;s how I use it in my skincare routine.  I don&#x27;t need more than one or two shakes of the bottle to get enough liquid to cover my whole face.  I like the lack of alcohol in the ingredients, and the lack of any smell.  It&#x27;s not the best toner I&#x27;ve ever used, and it certainly doesn&#x27;t have enough horsepower to work as a lotion unless I lived in a much more humid climate, but it&#x27;s good value for money.  Dries down to a non-sticky finish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now and I have to say that I LOVE IT. I use this right after my cleanser as a toner. I really like that a little goes a long way - I only need about 5 drops and it covers my whole face and neck! It has a watery texture, and feels like spreading water over your face. It is unscented and uncolored. I massage it into my face and pat until it gets a bit sticky, then I apply my serum and moisturizer and my face is sooooo smooth! Very good product especially for the price, I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li> I am a 22-year-old Asian girl and my skin is really dry. I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 years and I love it. Just several drops of it could keep my skin moist. It is perfect for a girl at my age.</li>
            <li> Rohto Hadalabo Gokulyn Hyalauronic Acid Lotion (Moist)&lt;br /&gt;Great.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for at least six months and I&#x27;ve found it to be a good adition to my moisturing routine. Because you only use a few drops for each treatment, it will last forever.  Better than the expesive serums on the market like Lancome.</li>
            <li> It is a great lotion for dry and sensitive skin . I like it very much. It works well .</li>
            <li> BIG  FAN!!!!  Will  use it  for  years to  come!!  Ships  quickly!!!</li>
            <li> Its now a stable in my daily moisturising routine. It scent and alcohol free so perfect for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff does moisturize, but once it runs out, I don&#x27;t think I will repurchase. I make a homemade vitamin C serum with glycerin, and I find that it gives me enough moisture under my normal moisturizer/retinA, and I don&#x27;t really need this stuff. But its great for what it is.</li>
            <li> Everything ok with shipping and delivery time. There was even a little gift in the parcel that delighted my daughter :) The lotion itself is quite good, I couldn&#x27;t rate it fair right now, since I&#x27;ve been using it for a too short period, but seems ok, however nothing more special than any other moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I got it about a week ago and its a good standalone moisturizer while being a toner as well.</li>
            <li> My skin is combination. this product is so great, I have used it for 4 years.My face had acne problem before.  it moistures my face and thus prevent the breakout. my face is much more soft and smooth after using this. it is great for summer, I don&#x27;t need lotion</li>
            <li> Love this HA...look at instructions to use it on YouTube</li>
            <li> Very mild, but unfortunately, isn&#x27;t quite moisturizing enough for my dry, sensitive skin. I like using it in the summertime, but I usually have to add a little something extra to it in order for my skin to not start flaking (tamanu oil or a little bit of day cream).</li>
            <li> The best facial lotion that I&#x27;ve ever used. Never feel dry in fall and winter even without cream.</li>
            <li> It feels very oily and heavy on my skin after several hours. If you try to use less, it feels too thin like it&#x27;s not a moisturizing anything. My skin felt dry regardless. I wouldn&#x27;t want to use two moisturizers to make me feel even more greasy. I&#x27;ve heard about the hyaluronic acid pulling moisture out of your skin if you don&#x27;t live in a very humid climate, so don&#x27;t bother with this if that applies to you. I live in S. California and I think that applies to me.</li>
