            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using the set for maybe 5 days or so but for now, I think this is one of the best hair aides I&#x27;ve used in a while.</li>
            <li>The product is OK.</li>
            <li>With the Hask Argan Oil Shampoo and Conditioner, I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I have tried many of them and Hask Argan Oil from Morocco Repairing Shampoo and its companion conditioner is my all-time favorite.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff and also the oil.  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s ok but just didn&#x27;t amaze me</li>
            <li>We all love the citrus-y scent.  </li>
            <li>Such a great product!</li>
            <li>Love Hask.</li>
            <li>, you can spend a lot more and not get all the benefits of this combo.</li>
            <li>Let my hair soft bright and with movement!</li>
            <li>Works pretty good</li>
            <li>Such a great low price for a wonderful product!</li>
            <li>The shampoo works into a rich, creamy lather, contains no sulfates or parabens, and is safe to use on my color treated hair.</li>
            <li>My daughter with fine hair washed and conditioned With this product.</li>
            <li>In fact, the label says it is “ideal for dry, damaged, or color treated hair.</li>
            <li>In fact, the label says it is “ideal for dry, damaged, or color treated hair.</li>
            <li>Advertised as gluten free</li>
            <li>Great shampoo and conditioner especially in the humid weather where my hair also gets a lot of sun.</li>
            <li>Most recently I had been using Agadir with great success.</li>
            <li>My daughter and myself was so excited to get our package.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to use this on my hair.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it and will continue to use it, especially with all the complements on how shiny and healthy my hair looks and smells!</li>
            <li>Trying for first time and I love it.</li>
            <li>It smells great, have used it 2 times, so far I really like it.</li>
            <li>Certainly doesn&#x27;t seem much better than cheaper products like Suave.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough about how good makes your hair feel.</li>
            <li>Because Moroccan Argan Oil is one of the rarest oils in the world, most shampoos, conditioners and hair treatments that contain it are costly, but Hask Argan Oil from Morocco Repairing Shampoo and Conditioner are very</li>
            <li>Because Moroccan Argan Oil is one of the rarest oils in the world, most shampoos, conditioners and hair treatments that contain it are costly, but Hask Argan Oil from Morocco Repairing Shampoo and Conditioner are very</li>
            <li>I would suggest it for a low budget good shampoo..</li>
            <li>Soft, easy to style and shine, what more coutd you want?</li>
            <li>Leaves my hairs super shiny.  </li>
            <li>Both the shampoo and conditioner have a fresh, clean, crisp, citrus scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and lovely after using this shampoo.</li>
            <li>It is rapidly absorbed by hair, nourishing it and hydrating it and sealing in moisture by forming a non-evaporating layer around it.</li>
            <li>I like it a lot better than most any other conditioner I&#x27;ve tried for the money.</li>
            <li>really surprises me is the fact that it gets my hair clean</li>
            <li>I have straight, fine but thick hair and this shampoo is great, as is the conditioner.</li>
            <li>This oil is vitamin and mineral rich and contains an unusually high concentration of Vitamin E and carotenes (a form of Vitamin A), both of which are necessary for healthy skin and hair.</li>
            <li>I have hard water and this lathers up great and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair like straw after shampooing.</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying anything argan oil</li>
            <li>I admit I jumped on the Argan Oil beauty band wagon when it first came out.</li>
            <li>The end result is soft, straight, smooth, shiny, run your fingers through it</li>
            <li>Not only does it make my hair look healthier than ever and easy to manage, it has also helped my son.</li>
            <li>It offers a gentle clean, and most importantly, it doesn&#x27;t weigh my thick hair</li>
            <li>but if you don&#x27;t use much then I&#x27;d recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>My hair is much easier to manage now.</li>
            <li>if you use too much the smell gets intensified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some of there other products work and smell better then this one.</li>
            <li>Kind of dry naturally but soft to a point.</li>
            <li>The top was not even screwed down.</li>
            <li>My hair is shinier with less frizz, even the ends look better.</li>
            <li>and I would need to put in several products in my hair to make it soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair dried out or anything my hair has been looking pretty healthy and alive.</li>
            <li>I had high expectations.</li>
            <li>Have used for a little over a week and love how it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>My hair is heavy,wavy, thick and kind of oily...</li>
            <li>do notice that I have to rinse longer than typically I do to make sure the conditioner is rinsed out completely.</li>
            <li>I flat iron many times and after using this duo, I only need to blow dry to make my hair straight!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like I came out of a salon with how soft my hair is!</li>
            <li>At first I only got the shampoo.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off paying a little extra for something that works.</li>
            <li>And I can straighten my hair while blow drying it by using a Conair Professional Round Brush to grasp my hair at the root (with the brush underneath the hair and the hair on top of brush) and while carrying the brush through my hair from root to tip, I follow above the hair with my blow dryer.</li>
            <li>but it made my hair too soft and unmanageable.</li>
            <li>It gets my hair very shiny without making it flat, as does the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I have thick, wavy hair that is prone to frizziness and Hask Argan Oil from Morocco Repairing Shampoo and its companion conditioner tames it and keeps me frizz free even in high humidity.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine, slightly wavy hair.</li>
            <li>My son has had a very dry scalp since we moved to Florida to the point where it was causing large flakes of dandruff to flake off.</li>
            <li>All of a sudden ladies were running their hands through my hair and giving me complements about how soft and wavy my hair was.</li>
            <li>Okay, but not great.  </li>
            <li>So much less time!!!!! I love how shiny it is and soft.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a 4 because these bottle are too small to be worth 20</li>

            <li> Keeps my hair, which goes down to my rear, very soft and manageable and seems to repair flat iron damage.  </li>
            <li> It makes his hair very soft as well - and our 7 year old son, who has thick hair, likes it too.</li>
            <li> my hair is long and basically manageable but tends to frizz or have flyaways and thanks to hard water...</li>

            <li> I have been looking for something for my dry damaged and split ended hair.</li>
            <li> My dry, processed hair shows no improvement after a month of use.</li>
            <li> Upon 1st use of the shampoo and conditioner my hair is as dry and crispy as Death Valley.</li>

            <li> Second time ordering this product. It is a miracle worker. My hair has always been frizzy and since moving to Florida that&#x27;s only gotten worse. Good news is this product helps a LOT. Keeps my hair, which goes down to my rear, very soft and manageable and seems to repair flat iron damage.  Update: This is the third time I am ordering this product. Not only does it make my hair look healthier than ever and easy to manage, it has also helped my son. My son has had a very dry scalp since we moved to Florida to the point where it was causing large flakes of dandruff to flake off. After using Axe&#x27;s dandruff shampoo and head and shoulders and about five other brands, to no avail, I figured why not let him try this? After just one use his scalp was moisturized and the problem was 90 percent gone. Another benefit of this shampoo. I definitely recommend it. It is just all around healthy for your hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good I&#x27;d say only used it 3x buts I like it. Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair dried out or anything my hair has been looking pretty healthy and alive. That&#x27;s all the matters to me though but other than that, it&#x27;s a 4 because these bottle are too small to be worth 20$ I&#x27;m mean at the tj max you get bigger bottles and both for a total of 20$ so idk if you want big don&#x27;t get but if you don&#x27;t use much then I&#x27;d recommend.</li>
            <li> I have hard water and this lathers up great and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair like straw after shampooing. And I just love the scent!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this! I have been using it for about a week or so. My hair is much easier to manage now. I flat iron many times and after using this duo, I only need to blow dry to make my hair straight! So much less time!!!!! I love how shiny it is and soft. It was damaged before this and I would need to put in several products in my hair to make it soft and tangle free. I am Hispanic and have curly wavy hair. Kind of dry naturally but soft to a point. This product made my hair softer so I would say it made it healthier looking. Also, the smell is nice! This is my first time trying anything argan oil and I have found something I love! Try it!</li>
            <li> Today when I received the set, the shampoo was all over in the bag they were packaged in. The top was not even screwed down. My daughter and myself was so excited to get our package. My daughter with fine hair washed and conditioned With this product. There was no difference. I washed and conditioned with this product. My hair is courses and thick. It made my hair like straw. There is no smell what so ever left in your hair. I would no recomemd to my friends nor would I buy again.</li>
            <li> my hair is long and basically manageable but tends to frizz or have flyaways and thanks to hard water...split ends. I&#x27;m always looking for good products to help me achieve the salon results my stylist sends me away with. This set has definitely proven to put me on that path. My hair is shinier with less frizz, even the ends look better. I&#x27;ve only been using the set for maybe 5 days or so but for now, I think this is one of the best hair aides I&#x27;ve used in a while.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t crazy about this shampoo/conditioner. Some of there other products work and smell better then this one.</li>
            <li> The product is OK. Dried my hair a bit and my scalp.</li>
            <li> Been using now for over a year. LOVE this set! Can&#x27;t say enough about how good makes your hair feel. Wish it came in larger bottles. Great for me and price unbeatable! A must have for me!!</li>
            <li> I admit I jumped on the Argan Oil beauty band wagon when it first came out. I wasn&#x27;t a fan, but something in me still goes back to try it time after time. With the Hask Argan Oil Shampoo and Conditioner, I&#x27;m glad I did. It smells amazing. It offers a gentle clean, and most importantly, it doesn&#x27;t weigh my thick hair down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do notice that I have to rinse longer than typically I do to make sure the conditioner is rinsed out completely. I recommend a little (about the size of a nickel) as it goes a long way and rinsing can grow cumbersome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this leaves my hair with incredible shine, smelling amazing and very soft to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Smells good, feels alright. Certainly doesn&#x27;t seem much better than cheaper products like Suave. Save your money.</li>
            <li> is very good product makes my hair so soft and with out frizz</li>
            <li> I have long, fine, slightly wavy hair. This product worked well for me &amp; smells good.</li>
            <li> It smells great, have used it 2 times, so far I really like it.</li>
            <li> Advertised as gluten free and it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to use this on my hair. I also used the deep conditioner after I washed my hair. Um I really wasn&#x27;t impressed. I read a lot of good reviews on this shampoo and conditioner but it didn&#x27;t do anything amazing for me. My hair was tangled after shampooing which I don&#x27;t get when I use my dove shampoo. I will say the oil is amazing and works wonders</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and lovely after using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and conditioner especially in the humid weather where my hair also gets a lot of sun.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner! They cleanse, condition, and detangle my hair. Plus, they smell wonderful! Such a great low price for a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Argan Oil hair care products. I have tried many of them and Hask Argan Oil from Morocco Repairing Shampoo and its companion conditioner is my all-time favorite. Here is why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Hask Argan Oil from Morocco Repairing Shampoo and its companion conditioner are made with Moroccan Argan Oil obtained from the pressed seeds of argan fruit which grows from Moroccan Argan trees. This oil is vitamin and mineral rich and contains an unusually high concentration of Vitamin E and carotenes (a form of Vitamin A), both of which are necessary for healthy skin and hair. It is rapidly absorbed by hair, nourishing it and hydrating it and sealing in moisture by forming a non-evaporating layer around it. This smooths hair and prevents frizziness caused by humid conditions/weather. It also strengthens hair and promotes elasticity, preventing cuticle damage (split ends) and breakage while repairing existing damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) They also contain Keratin (the key structural component of hair) and Panthenol (a derivative of vitamin B5) which smooths and straightens hair and adds gloss and shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) I have thick, wavy hair that is prone to frizziness and Hask Argan Oil from Morocco Repairing Shampoo and its companion conditioner tames it and keeps me frizz free even in high humidity. And I can straighten my hair while blow drying it by using a Conair Professional Round Brush to grasp my hair at the root (with the brush underneath the hair and the hair on top of brush) and while carrying the brush through my hair from root to tip, I follow above the hair with my blow dryer. This dries my hair while straightening it at the same time and there is no need to use a flat iron. The end result is soft, straight, smooth, shiny, run your fingers through it hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Both the shampoo and conditioner have a fresh, clean, crisp, citrus scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) The shampoo works into a rich, creamy lather, contains no sulfates or parabens, and is safe to use on my color treated hair. In fact, the label says it is “ideal for dry, damaged, or color treated hair.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) They are made in the USA which I always appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7) Because Moroccan Argan Oil is one of the rarest oils in the world, most shampoos, conditioners and hair treatments that contain it are costly, but Hask Argan Oil from Morocco Repairing Shampoo and Conditioner are very affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT YOU MIGHT FIND USEFUL:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS (Hask Argan Oil from Morocco Repairing Shampoo): Water/Eau, Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate, Cocomidropropyl Betaine, Cocamide MEA, Glycerin, Glycol Distearate, Fragrance, Sodium Chloride, Argania Spinosa Kernal Oil (Argan Oil), Glycine Soja (Soybean) Protein, Hydrolized Keratin, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Hydrolized Soy Protein, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethiconol, Polyquaternium-10, PEG-150 Distearate, Dicaprylyl Ether, Decyl Glucoside, Glyceryl Oleate, Phenxyethanol, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Citric Acid, Polyquaternium-7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS (Hask Argan Oil from Morocco Repairing Conditioner): Water/Eau, Cetyl Alcohol, Cetrimonium Chloride, Behentrimonium Chloride, Isopropyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Cyclopentasiloxane, Argania Spinosa Kernal Oil (Argan Oil), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Protein, Hydrolized Keratin, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Hydrolized Wheat Protein, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Stearyl Alcohol, Dimethiconol, Dimethicone, Phenoxyethanol, Citric Acid, Fragrance.n my color treated hair.

            <li> Best shampoo and conditioner I have ever tried so far. I have been looking for something for my dry damaged and split ended hair. This set made a difference after only a week (3 washes). It&#x27;s softer and more manageable and the smell is amazing! I can&#x27;t believe it it&#x27;s like I came out of a salon with how soft my hair is! And the price is hard to beat I I don&#x27;t have to spend money on &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; products now that I have found this product. Absolutely love it and will continue to use it, especially with all the complements on how shiny and healthy my hair looks and smells! Must buy!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and also the oil.  Smell is great too</li>
            <li> I had high expectations. I was disappointed. My dry, processed hair shows no improvement after a month of use.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> Lovely but it made my hair too soft and unmanageable. I&#x27;m sure good for thicker hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but just didn&#x27;t amaze me</li>
            <li> Very good product.....  It gives my hair a great feel.....</li>
            <li> Sure helped my breaking ends!</li>
            <li> 1st off..I&#x27;ve used several different brands of argan oil shampoo/conditioners including One &#x27;n Only Argan Oil Moisture Repair, and Agadir Argan Oil Daily Moisturizing Shampoo and Conditioner. Most recently I had been using Agadir with great success. Everytime I went to the barber I was asked if I was using wave activator or some s-curl activator. All of a sudden ladies were running their hands through my hair and giving me complements about how soft and wavy my hair was. However, the Hask Argan Oil shampoo &amp; conditioner is a little cheaper so I decided to give it a try. WORST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE!.. Upon 1st use of the shampoo and conditioner my hair is as dry and crispy as Death Valley. Plus it has odd smell. Needless to say this stuff is going in the trash after just one use or perhaps a late Christmas gift to someone I don&#x27;t like... Moral of the story don&#x27;t try to skimp on taking care of your hair. You&#x27;re better off paying a little extra for something that works. And if you&#x27;re African American DO NOT USE THIS STUFF!!</li>
            <li> Okay, but not great.  I had been using another argan based shampoo I was happier with before that I will return to.</li>
            <li> I have straight, fine but thick hair and this shampoo is great, as is the conditioner. It gets my hair very shiny without making it flat, as does the conditioner.  My husband has coarser thick salt and pepper hair and he loves it too. It makes his hair very soft as well - and our 7 year old son, who has thick hair, likes it too. He has beautiful hair and it brings out its shine.  We all love the citrus-y scent.  I did, however, find this for $5.99 in Walgreens. Something to keep in mind.</li>
            <li> my hair went from straw to silky....helps died hair get its bounce back and makes hair manageable ...less tangles and flyaway</li>
            <li> Finally, finally, finally...something that brings back the bounce and shine of youthful hair!  I love it!  Smells great too!</li>
            <li> (For Shampoo only) I would rate it four and a half stars if I could, the only downside to it is the smell and if you use too much the smell gets intensified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What really surprises me is the fact that it gets my hair clean and I hardly have to use any. I would suggest it for a low budget good shampoo.. I had a bottle last me for one year* start to finish! Who can say that about shampoo?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*With occasionally washing once a week for a couple months and regularly washing 3-5 days</li>
            <li> Have used for a little over a week and love how it makes my hair feel. It&#x27;s easier to style too.</li>
            <li> At the risk of sounding like a promo for this stuff, I&#x27;m just gonna say that my hair hasn&#x27;t felt this good since I was a kid.  At first I only got the shampoo.  I was amazed by the silkiness of my hair.  I couldn&#x27;t keep my hands away!  Such a great product!</li>
            <li> Love Hask. This shampoo and conditioner set is like heaven. Just buy it.</li>
            <li> Really great items! Let my hair soft bright and with movement! My hair is heavy,wavy, thick and kind of oily...</li>
            <li> Trying for first time and I love it. Smells wonderful, was on sale at Walgreen&#x27;s for $4.00, I just got the conditioner. I like it a lot better than most any other conditioner I&#x27;ve tried for the money. I have thick wavy hair and it just looks nicer now.</li>
            <li> Smells great!  Leaves my hairs super shiny.  It arrived when they said it would!</li>
            <li> Great results at an excellent price point, you can spend a lot more and not get all the benefits of this combo. Soft, easy to style and shine, what more coutd you want?</li>
