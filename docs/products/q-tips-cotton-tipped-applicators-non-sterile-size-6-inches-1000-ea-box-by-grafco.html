            <li>Great Price too!</li>
            <li>These swabs are perfect for cleaning eye makeup, outer ears, nail polish.</li>
            <li>these are perfect</li>
            <li>Great:   </li>
            <li>Arrived in great shape.</li>
            <li>They work great.</li>
            <li>I have them in both sizes, and love them!</li>
            <li>Also display nicely in tall glass decanter.</li>
            <li>Perfect for cleaning and medical purpose.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Therefore, these are exactly what we needed, at a good price and with a lot of convenience.  </li>
            <li>Timeliness of delivery   Product was as i expected   Product was as advertised   Excellent service.</li>
            <li>I have used them to clean my AC vents in my car and truck, my house.</li>
            <li>Great for cleaning my rifles with sticks are strong cotton tips average.</li>
            <li>They work for so many different things, besides the insides of your outer ear, putting on eye shadow, too many things to list.</li>
            <li>Sneezing on the cotton tip snaps it right off.</li>
            <li>Clean, apply gently.</li>
            <li>These Q-tips on long wood sticks are so handy.</li>
            <li>Much stiffer than the regular paper &amp;#34;Q-Tip&amp;#34; brand, but the stick breaks fairly easily; could be a bit stronger</li>
            <li>very breakage prone compared to US made box I had before.  </li>
            <li>Everything is fine as I expected.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are pretty much the same things.  </li>
            <li>The sticks are a bit thin and break easily, but for the price, they are fine</li>
            <li>Just as described and work great for cleaning my guns and other small projects I have.</li>
            <li>What can I say I clean a lot of electronics and other things with non steril q-tips</li>
            <li>I prefer wooden stick, and this product is of a very high quality.</li>
            <li>I could have driven across the valley to a store the specializes in tools and supplies for electronics techs, but I&#x27;d have paid 2-3X as much for a lesser amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Normally, this wouldn&#x27;t be an issue but they&#x27;re being used to pack a wound that has rather deep tunneling</li>

            <li> I use them to clean down long narrow places that nothing else will reach, like our fish Aquarium (Tank/Pump).</li>
            <li> They are long enough to reach an area inaccessable to the little three inch ones.  </li>
            <li> They are less likely to leave \\&quot;fuzz\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> One click and they&#x27;re in my mailbox a few days later.</li>
            <li> everything went as expected</li>
            <li> cheap Chinese crap.  </li>
            <li> When the wooden shafts break inside the wound it can cause some serious issues trying to get the remainder of the shaft out of the wound bed.</li>
            <li> Before my wife retired, she&#x27;d bring a few home from the clinic from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Use them for cleaning my guns and gear. Can&#x27;t beat the price for 1000 pieces.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to work on guns. They get all the stuff out of the corners. Great Price too!</li>
            <li> Great:   Timeliness of delivery   Product was as i expected   Product was as advertised   Excellent service.</li>
            <li> My elderly mother-in-law uses these to apply medicine to her gums.  I use them for cleaning audio/video tape heads and paths.  Before my wife retired, she&#x27;d bring a few home from the clinic from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are pretty much the same things.  Non-Sterile (you don&#x27;t need sterile as what is already in your mouth is the filthiest stuff around), wooden sticks with a bit of cotton on the end, packaged 100 to a bag, ten bags to a box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where these stand out is that the drug stores around me only carried the three inch types.  I could have driven across the valley to a store the specializes in tools and supplies for electronics techs, but I&#x27;d have paid 2-3X as much for a lesser amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, these are exactly what we needed, at a good price and with a lot of convenience.  One click and they&#x27;re in my mailbox a few days later.</li>
            <li> I did not get what I ordered. The picture and description on this product is for Q-Tips.  What I got was a box of \\&quot;Made in China\\&quot; dynarex cotton tipped applicators.    I have sent two requests to the company for them to rectify the problem. As of this date, I have not heard from them.    If you are expecting the brand Q-Tips, go somewhere else to make your purchase.    Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Much stiffer than the regular paper &amp;#34;Q-Tip&amp;#34; brand, but the stick breaks fairly easily; could be a bit stronger</li>
            <li> I have them in both sizes, and love them! I prefer wooden stick, and this product is of a very high quality. I will definitely buy these again when I ran out.</li>
            <li> Perfect for cleaning and medical purpose.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Arrived in great shape.</li>
            <li> The package pictured on the page for this product showed them as having a plastic shaft but when I received my order, they were wood. Normally, this wouldn&#x27;t be an issue but they&#x27;re being used to pack a wound that has rather deep tunneling and they tend to break. When the wooden shafts break inside the wound it can cause some serious issues trying to get the remainder of the shaft out of the wound bed. The plastic shafts shown in the picture would just bend rather than leaving a pungi stick in the cavity.</li>
            <li> Everything is fine as I expected.</li>
            <li> These swabs are perfect for cleaning eye makeup, outer ears, nail polish. They are less likely to leave \\&quot;fuzz\\&quot;.  Easier for me to use for cleaning ears, sturdy. Also display nicely in tall glass decanter.</li>
            <li> It is a lot of Q-tips. Bought them for cleaning guns. They work great.</li>
            <li> Just as described and work great for cleaning my guns and other small projects I have.</li>
            <li> everything went as expected</li>
            <li> I use them for cleaning in places I can&#x27;t reach.  The sticks are a bit thin and break easily, but for the price, they are fine</li>
            <li> These Q-tips on long wood sticks are so handy. I have used them to clean my AC vents in my car and truck, my house. I use them to clean down long narrow places that nothing else will reach, like our fish Aquarium (Tank/Pump). They work wonders. They work for so many different things, besides the insides of your outer ear, putting on eye shadow, too many things to list. Price is PERFECTO.</li>
            <li> Sneezing on the cotton tip snaps it right off. Clean, apply gently.</li>
            <li> What can I say I clean a lot of electronics and other things with non steril q-tips these are perfect</li>
            <li> On time, as advertised.</li>
            <li> If you do not require a sterile, cotton-tipped applicator, these Q-Tips are what you are looking for.  They are long enough to reach an area inaccessable to the little three inch ones.  They are well made and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Great for cleaning my rifles with sticks are strong cotton tips average.</li>
            <li> cheap Chinese crap.  very breakage prone compared to US made box I had before.  incidentally, i did not see the Kendall name on the package-probably ashamed.</li>
