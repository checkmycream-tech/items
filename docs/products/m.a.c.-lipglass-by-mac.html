            <li>Fast shipment and product is GREAT!</li>
            <li>They were so great about it and did exactly what they said!</li>
            <li>This MAC clear Lipglass is wonderful!  </li>
            <li>well worth the price, and great to have for that gloss alone or over your favorite combination or lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so my package was not delivered because whoever shipped it put only my first name!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I love M.A.C. Products it was great to find this lip gloss on here for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>As soon as I run out I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m finding more an more products that are equivalent in what they provide for a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Should have in one&#x27;s collection for sure.</li>
            <li>It makes your lips look so much more fuller</li>
            <li>Love this item.</li>
            <li>love the lipglass too</li>
            <li>I love it, and I will be purchasing this item again.</li>
            <li>I received the lipglass I ordered and they were so fast!!!!</li>
            <li>SURE IF THIS WAS TRUE MAC....</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, not clumpy.  </li>
            <li>She looked really pretty with it on too; LipGlass is good for shapely lips, thanks!</li>
            <li>My new favorite lip gloss.</li>
            <li>Especially your own hair.</li>
            <li>I remember when MAC first came out with this lipglass.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cheaper obviously isn&#x27;t always better.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast and neat, would buy from again.</li>
            <li>Lipglass would catch a gnat (true) if it hit your lip, due to the consistency of true MAC.</li>
            <li>and they would ship out a new one asap!</li>
            <li>first off let me say anytime I ship a package I put first and last name</li>
            <li>This is a lot more watered down compared to the one out of the store!</li>
            <li>This lipglass that I purchased at Amazon is by far not the real lipglass.  </li>
            <li>I have since than bought a new one and years</li>
            <li>Prompt shipping item was in new condition will buy again.</li>
            <li>while I appreciate them offering to send another out and letting the first one get sent back to them....</li>
            <li>Mac Lipglass is kind of thick and very shinny and stays on your lips for a long time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend a regular clear lipgloss from the Dollar store for much less $$$ and a better effect.</li>
            <li>Historically I&#x27;ve been a real fan of MAC</li>

            <li> my favorite lip glass!!!</li>
            <li> first off let me say anytime I ship a package I put first and last name so my package was not delivered because whoever shipped it put only my first name!!!!!!! while I appreciate them offering to send another out and letting the first one get sent back to them.... it doesn&#x27;t make sense !!!!!  Now that I have received it I feel like I have been RIPPED OFF!!!!  although it&#x27;s Mac packaging THIS IS NOT M.A.C IT&#x27;S TOO LOOSE AND OILY ITS LIKE BABY OIL!!! I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM HERE AGAIN I SHOULD HAVE WENT TO THE MAC WEBSITE.BUT.I ORDERED FROM AMAZON BECAUSE I HAD A GIFT CARD!!!!! PISSED!!!</li>
            <li> I a, going to try to get my money back it spilled everywhere and is was greasy plastic goo which was really bad dont buy this</li>
            <li> I love M.A.C. Products it was great to find this lip gloss on here for a reasonable price. As soon as I run out I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Best shine around, but everything sticks in it. Especially your own hair.</li>
            <li> Historically I&#x27;ve been a real fan of MAC but I&#x27;m finding more an more products that are equivalent in what they provide for a fraction of the cost.  The Lipglass is great if you don&#x27;t drink or eat- you can sit there and look cute with a great shine to your lips. It&#x27;s sticky and a little messy- I&#x27;d recommend a regular clear lipgloss from the Dollar store for much less $$$ and a better effect.</li>
            <li> best lip gloss ever -- Amazone requires so many words for these reviews....but what can you say about lip gloss. I love it.</li>
            <li> This lipglass that I purchased at Amazon is by far not the real lipglass.  Mac Lipglass is kind of thick and very shinny and stays on your lips for a long time.  This lipglass from Amazon is watery, not shinny at all and only last about 5 minutes.  I&#x27;m not sure where Amazon is purchasing there Mac products from but it&#x27;s almost like it&#x27;s Mac knock off!</li>
            <li> I remember when MAC first came out with this lipglass.&lt;br /&gt;The amount last so very long.... well worth the price, and great to have for that gloss alone or over your favorite combination or lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should have in one&#x27;s collection for sure.</li>
            <li> I use MAC OFTEN (lipglass 2) and decided THIS time to go the cheapest route. I ordered it and after all, it&#x27;s about the same price as in the store!!! However, bad idea. ... This is not mac lipglass.&lt;br /&gt;MAC Lipglass would catch a gnat (true) if it hit your lip, due to the consistency of true MAC. This no named \\&quot;Mac\\&quot; is thin thin thin!!! Definitely a disappointment. Cheaper obviously isn&#x27;t always better. Order from MAC the site or go to the store. It&#x27;s already expensive in itself, once time becomes available I&#x27;d return it. Or I&#x27;ll keep it for the car as the 911 thin, shine, wannabe .. Sigh.  Be honest !!!!</li>
            <li> This is not real. I purchased one out the Mac store &amp; loved it. Which is why when the top to mines broke I was getting gloss everywhere! Purse,hands,etc. Ended up throwing away an purchased another off amazon. This is a lot more watered down compared to the one out of the store! Real Mac gloss could ketch a fly on your lip and stay on all day! This crap goes on like water where as the real one is as thick as blood. Fake! I have since than bought a new one and years later I still have this crap. Just thought I would share.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment and product is GREAT! My new favorite lip gloss. It makes your lips look so much more fuller</li>
            <li> Arrived fast and neat, would buy from again. She looked really pretty with it on too; LipGlass is good for shapely lips, thanks!</li>
            <li> The lid doesn&#x27;t close tightly so it spilled out into my Louis Vuitton handbag. Not pleased with the rounded ca p</li>
            <li> This gloss is a staple for me.  One in my make up drawer and one in my purse. Lots of shine, not sticky. I will always use this product. Buying several for stocking stuffers for my girl, grandaughter and daughter in law.</li>
            <li> Love this item. Prompt shipping item was in new condition will buy again. Can wear alone or on top of another lipstick! Very pleased</li>
            <li> I ordered this lip gloss and what arrived was a different product. When I contacted the seller they said to go ahead and KEEP the powder that came instead and they would ship out a new one asap! YES they did! They were so great about it and did exactly what they said! I received the lipglass I ordered and they were so fast!!!! love the lipglass too</li>
            <li> I AM A LONGTIME MAC USER AND WASN&#x27;T SURE IF THIS WAS TRUE MAC.... IT IS! I RECOMMEND THIS TO EVERYONE</li>
            <li> This MAC clear Lipglass is wonderful!  It goes on smooth, not clumpy.  If you want high-watt shine, then this is your product!  I love it, and I will be purchasing this item again.</li>
