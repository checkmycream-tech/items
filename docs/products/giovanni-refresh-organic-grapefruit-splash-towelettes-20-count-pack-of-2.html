            <li>Took them to italy and was glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I love these towelettes.</li>
            <li>I love these towelettes.  </li>
            <li>love these.  </li>
            <li>These are wonderful for the car, for traveling, or to even keep in your refrigerator for a refreshing wipe down after working out.</li>
            <li>These towelettes are the best thing to wash hands, faces, or other grimy parts on the road.  </li>
            <li>The scent is refreshing -- not \\&quot;perfumey\\&quot; -- and they are a great substitute when there&#x27;s no where to wash your hands properly.</li>
            <li>They slip easily into your purse or travel bag.  </li>
            <li>We used to buy the peppermint version, but this grapefruit is not as strong.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is amazing, and makes your hands feel &amp; smell fresh &amp; clean.  </li>
            <li>A little pricey but super helpful on the go and a wonderful scent.</li>
            <li>I use these to help clean him off before eating or drinking.  </li>
            <li>Need to clean that</li>
            <li>Good price currently on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Peppermint is great also but a little stingy and strong.</li>
            <li>I love that they are individually wrapped to easily keep in my gym bag and purse.  </li>
            <li>They are bigger than most, and strong, for a thorough hand-wash.  </li>
            <li>They are also made of a better quality material than most towelettes as well as being a bit bigger than what you generally find in the grocery store.</li>
            <li>The scent really is energizing!</li>
            <li>Funny update</li>
            <li>I have had these before and could not wait to get more when I noticed I was running low.  </li>
            <li>Also enough to take care of arms and face if you need a quick clean up when you&#x27;re out and about.</li>
            <li>I like that these come in small individual packets and they are ideal for air travel.</li>
            <li>A little more expensive, but if you really want a good, strong wipe, this is the one.</li>
            <li>, how about clean your hands prior to eating at a restaurant?  </li>
            <li>I purchased these to avoid the harsh chemicals in so many hand sanitizers.</li>
            <li>Not only do they clean your hands, they freshen the air and your skin after a long flight.</li>
            <li>However, it seems like there is no perfect alternative to getting clean hands without using a product that is toxic to something (such as fish in large concentrations) and with the risk of creating drug resistant bacteria.</li>

            <li> , how about clean your hands prior to eating at a restaurant?  </li>

            <li> I much prefer this fragrance to the lavender ones even though lavender is what I usually like.  </li>
            <li> They do not irritate my skin at all and my skin is sensitive to heavy perfume scents.</li>
            <li> For normal hand washing I can usually split one with my daughter.</li>
            <li> They smell nice, don&#x27;t make your hands taste horrible, and the clothlike towelette fabric is study enough for some scrubbing.</li>
            <li> Not messy or likely to freeze if you live in very cold climate</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I wish they were a little moister.  </li>
            <li> They are a little thicker than a handiwipe but not quite as thick as a baby wipe and about the same dimensions.</li>
            <li> For everyday outings with the family, I&#x27;ve taken to carrying small washcloths that I&#x27;ve wet with soap and water.</li>
            <li> I keep a few of these wipes in my desk, in my purse, in my car...</li>
            <li> I loove the scent of these cleansing cloths i keep a few in my purse at all times.</li>
            <li> However, a negative is that the packaging is not recyclable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These have a delicate scent of grapefruit, doesn&#x27;t slam you in the face like a lot of fragranced products today.  </li>
            <li> I do feel bad about all the garbage they create, but we only use them when traveling.  </li>
            <li> The lavender version of this towelette smells like the handi-wipe one that I&#x27;m trying to avoid, which is weird.</li>

            <li> I keep a few of these wipes in my desk, in my purse, in my car... the list goes on. They are great to quicken up between work and networking events- particularly in the heat of Texas!</li>
            <li> I loove the scent of these cleansing cloths i keep a few in my purse at all times. They do not irritate my skin at all and my skin is sensitive to heavy perfume scents. I have used these for years and will continue to do so. The scent really is energizing!</li>
            <li> Lovely and refreshing</li>
            <li> These are my favorite hand sanitizers!  You can use them on planes and not blow away the cabin.  Delicious and effective!</li>
            <li> I purchased these to avoid the harsh chemicals in so many hand sanitizers. However, it seems like there is no perfect alternative to getting clean hands without using a product that is toxic to something (such as fish in large concentrations) and with the risk of creating drug resistant bacteria. I like that these come in small individual packets and they are ideal for air travel. They are moist and smell refreshing. However, a negative is that the packaging is not recyclable. For everyday outings with the family, I&#x27;ve taken to carrying small washcloths that I&#x27;ve wet with soap and water. They&#x27;re cumbersome but I don&#x27;t have the concerns over creating yet another drug-resistant bacterial strain because I can&#x27;t get to the sink to soap up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought these several times. They feel great are not irritating and smell wonderful. Great to have on the go. Not messy or likely to freeze if you live in very cold climate</li>
            <li> I carry these all the time - purse, diaper bag, computer bag, kids lunch boxes. A little pricey but super helpful on the go and a wonderful scent. Funny update: I use these for business travel a LOT and recently had one fall out of my bag. My co-worker, thankfully he has a good sense of humor, thought it was a condom. Never realized it, but they totally look like condoms. Be warned!</li>
            <li> I have had these before and could not wait to get more when I noticed I was running low.  Even got another scent.</li>
            <li> These towelettes are a treat to use.  I much prefer this fragrance to the lavender ones even though lavender is what I usually like.  The lavender version of this towelette smells like the handi-wipe one that I&#x27;m trying to avoid, which is weird.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product now for over ten years. I can&#x27;t run out - this is a luxury I gift myself with! I always have these wonderfully scented wipes in my car, in my purse, and in my backpack. The smell is just divine. And every time I give them to a friend to use, they want to know where to get some for themselves!</li>
            <li> These are wonderful for the car, for traveling, or to even keep in your refrigerator for a refreshing wipe down after working out.</li>
            <li> Serves its purpose. Will buy again</li>
            <li> My son has food allergy.  When we do not have soap and water I use these to help clean him off before eating or drinking.  We used to buy the peppermint version, but this grapefruit is not as strong.  The kids like it better.  I do feel bad about all the garbage they create, but we only use them when traveling.  Good price currently on Amazon.</li>
            <li> A MUST FOR TRAVELING AND CHILDREN&lt;br /&gt;GET PRODUCT</li>
            <li> The scent of these is so refreshing.  I love that they are individually wrapped to easily keep in my gym bag and purse.  My only complaint is that I wish they were a little moister.  They are a little thicker than a handiwipe but not quite as thick as a baby wipe and about the same dimensions.</li>

            <li> love these.  they are perfect for traveling.  Need to clean that ***plane seat?, how about clean your hands prior to eating at a restaurant?  or, an afternoon sheen to your face from the heat and humidity?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These have a delicate scent of grapefruit, doesn&#x27;t slam you in the face like a lot of fragranced products today.  they have a moderate (but not in my opinion) wasteful amount of moisture to the packs.  They slip easily into your purse or travel bag.  I never leave home without them.  Peppermint is great also but a little stingy and strong.</li>
