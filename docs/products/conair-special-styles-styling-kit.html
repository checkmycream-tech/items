            <li>Great for traveling.</li>
            <li>Arrived in a timely manner &amp; in great condition  </li>

            <li>my daughter is happy thats what matters ,,,, .... ,,,,, .... ,,,,, ...... ,,,,, ..... ,,,, ..... ,,,, .... ,,,</li>
            <li>Looks great, but doesn&#x27;t keep the heat.</li>
            <li>Which makes the 80 s child in me sooooo happy.  </li>
            <li>great product wife loves it.</li>
            <li>THe curling iron works great.</li>
            <li>and I thought $16 works great</li>
            <li>WORKS AMAZING!</li>
            <li>THis is the perfect gift for any fashion diva 9 year old at an awesome price.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been good.</li>
            <li>beautifully!&lt;br /&gt;-Heat is fairly good.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and it seemed like a good deal.</li>
            <li>Fully functional and my sister loved it</li>
            <li>and so I found what I thought to be a good one on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I suppose it is good for a kid if you are worried about the heat.</li>
            <li>the curling iron worrks fairly well, but it does leave an un-flattering crease or dent if you will, at the bottom of the curl.</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t ever had a straightener or curler and want to try it without spending 100 bucks this one is good.</li>
            <li>I thought it was a good product.  </li>
            <li>It is not the cadillac of styling tools but good for travel</li>
            <li>I love these curlers there great and curl my hair good 5 stars</li>
            <li>I am happy that Amazon has a good return policy :)  </li>
            <li>Heat is very important!</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>I just own 4 perfectly good working curling irons and had no need for another one.</li>
            <li>not for women who know better!</li>
            <li>so she enjoyed it!</li>
            <li>; well it seems like more than 20 mins to heat up!</li>
            <li>I love this hair presser, curler thinger!  </li>
            <li>For the price, this thing is amazing.</li>
            <li>its nice</li>
            <li>but it takes forever to warm up.</li>
            <li>I liked the 3 in one product for my granddaughter.</li>
            <li>Everything came nicely.</li>
            <li>/&gt; honestly.</li>
            <li>I checked the iron and It was barely warm.  </li>
            <li>you would b better off paying a good bit money for a nice one that will work than a one that want work at all.</li>
            <li>it had some great reviews saying it heats up fast and crimps great</li>
            <li>It took forever for this to warm up and</li>
            <li>It is nice that it was the three options.</li>
            <li>i got this for a friend who was reminiscing on the days of crimped hair, and was nervous at first reading all the reviews saying it didn&#x27;t warm up, but my friend loves it and says it works perfectly! :)</li>
            <li>When I used the styler, I was delighted by the easy way this product could be used.  </li>
            <li>Spend $10-$20 more to get something with more quality!</li>
            <li>I was looking for the crimp iron in lots of stores, and finally I decided to go online, and I found a good one at a perfect price :)</li>
            <li>Its amazing that it can do many things for one object</li>
            <li>so great right.  </li>
            <li>I guess as a first crimping iron for a girl this would be great.</li>
            <li>This product seems really great at first glance.  </li>
            <li>Too good to be true.</li>
            <li>I should have know that it was to good to be true.</li>
            <li>The plastic on the straightener/crimper heads was very cheap.</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought this product it does what it is supposed to and is very cheaply priced</li>
            <li>I love that it has reversable falt and crimp irons.</li>
            <li>But I still like it, just have to wait like 5 minutes to get the heat I wanted, and I get my job done :)   </li>
            <li>I love the color and the removable parts</li>
            <li>I used this product and it works ok.  </li>
            <li>However, there is a plastic area on top that you can hold</li>
            <li>i love this product.</li>
            <li>If you want a way better one, get a more pricer one than this one.</li>
            <li>My daughter used her christmas gift card to buy this because she wanted to be able to crimp and curl her hair.</li>
            <li>20 minutes later it&#x27;s at the perfect heat range</li>
            <li>This product works great - heats up fast.</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>i love shopping online.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>Its okay.</li>
            <li>I had to buy my daughter a much better one within a week.</li>
            <li>The waves are more kinky than wavey.</li>
            <li>Seriously, I&#x27;m better off using my mother&#x27;s hair tools from the 80s.....    </li>
            <li>i would gladly .</li>
            <li>Product is okay.</li>
            <li>Anywho, this product is just, okay.</li>
            <li>In this case you definatly get more then you pay for</li>
            <li>I am off to look for a REAL crimper LOL</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a play curling iron.</li>
            <li>I love the curling iron attachment,  </li>
            <li>SHe is sure to love it</li>
            <li>The crimper works but with it taking forever to heat up and on top of that you have to hold the crimper there for like 5 minutes</li>
            <li>I love that this is three tools in one.</li>
            <li>and she is always very excited about hair :)</li>
            <li>I was very excited about getting this because I had one as a kid.</li>
            <li>i was very excited about the features.</li>
            <li>I received this item, and I was very excited to use it.  </li>
            <li>i love the color,, mine was pink, perfect for a girl like me.</li>
            <li>I had the old model in the 1990&#x27;s this one is just as great.  </li>
            <li>She is happy with the item so far.</li>
            <li>I just stuck my hand right on the heating plates and they were mildly warm, that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>I was so excited I should have read more details about this package before I ordered it</li>
            <li>stands on the iron heads makes easy to just put it anywhere without fear of it burning something.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, the attachments are easy to replace.  </li>
            <li>I guess, but the socket used to plug in the heads broke fairly easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to transport too.  </li>
            <li>The curler does not get hot, no, it does not even warm up.  </li>
            <li>It was just fine  </li>
            <li>It curled my hair fine</li>
            <li>It would be fine for a child, or someone to \\&quot;practice\\&quot; doing hair.</li>
            <li>The curler worked fine</li>
            <li>the curling iron will heat up and work fine</li>
            <li>Super cheap attachments that do not work well!</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the quick shipment of this item</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t heat up so it wont straighten my hair, just kind of tugs on it leaving it looking very frizzy, but not as frizzy as the crimper makes my hair look.  </li>
            <li>It allows you to change your hair styling tool to fit what you want to do with each section of your hair.  </li>
            <li>It looks really cheap.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t light up/glow/</li>
            <li>Takes forever to heat up, looks and feels cheap.</li>
            <li>It is cheap, and it doesn&#x27;t even heat up</li>
            <li>though i am incredibly cheap, so</li>
            <li>Also, it is made of really cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this product, and I would most definitely buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for the first iron for a young girl this would be great too.  </li>
            <li>Its a nice price, but it takes a really long time heat up and is not as effective as i would have guessed.</li>
            <li>It works very well, and it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li>so I got to the conclusion that it was a perfect thing to buy for a little girl that wants to play to the saloon being a safe toy...</li>
            <li>And I couldn&#x27;t return it because I lost the original packaging.</li>
            <li>I was actually able to hold on to the plates that should have been hot with ease.  </li>
            <li>Great idea in theory, but it has a long way to go.</li>
            <li>When I got it, I was excited to see how it worked.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to say that it heated up just fine, and I love using the crimper, and the curls come out better than any other curling iron I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I needed it for a special event and ended up throwing it away.</li>
            <li>All the attachable add ons are cool.  </li>
            <li>Overall it good just wish it got hotter.</li>
            <li>I had to give one star to be able to post, but I really wanted to give zero.</li>
            <li>It does a good job of this, especially given the price.  </li>
            <li>but this thing is so cool.</li>
            <li>The crimping looks so cool.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this item, but when i got it i plugged it in, and it didnt get hot AT ALL!</li>
            <li>I got this very cheap and so far am completely satisfied it is my first curling iorn/straightner</li>
            <li>They recommend you let the iron cool before changeing tips but almost every household has something like a oven mit that allows quick changes.  </li>
            <li>It does take awhile to adequately heat up tho  </li>
            <li>The item shipped quickly, but that&#x27;s about where the products usefulness ended.</li>
            <li>and then when it did it wasnt very hot hell</li>
            <li>Does not get very hot.</li>
            <li>Great price, perhaps could for people with very fine thin hair.</li>
            <li>DO NOT PURCHASE THIS HOT IRON!</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t get hot at all!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t get hot, nothing!</li>
            <li>Turned on but never got hot!</li>
            <li>I opened the package, and plugged the crimper part to it first plugged it up, and it didn&#x27;t work!  </li>
            <li>My daughter has had a lot of fun using it on both her hair and her friends.</li>
            <li>Does not get warm enough to even straighten, curl, or crimp.</li>
            <li>My 12 year old wanted to learn how to style her hair different ways so for the price I figured this would be a great start.</li>
            <li>Purchased for 13 year old girl and it works ok.</li>
            <li>the reason why I gave it 2 stars instead of 5 is because it only gets barely warm.</li>
            <li>The packaging is the plastic kind you actually have to take scissors and cut into.  </li>
            <li>Came in quickly will and exactly what she seen on the web site.</li>
            <li>Does not heat up very well.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the money or the time!</li>
            <li>I got the right product because this thing did nothing like the reviews said..</li>
            <li>My 9 year old seems to be able to handle it pretty well.  </li>
            <li>So far my daughter loves it because its easy to handle and since it has a bit of border around the metal plates she does not burn herself.</li>
            <li>Learning how to work it is the biggest thing, but it been a good little tool.  </li>
            <li>If you do, I think this would be a good buy, otherwise, get something a little easier.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s an okay product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experimented with most of the different heads on this thing</li>
            <li>But unfortunatly this does not seem to get that hot.</li>
            <li>I probably would have bought higher heat model without the switch plates.  </li>
            <li>I was upset it wasn&#x27;t hot</li>
            <li>Does not work...does not get hot.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this CHEAP product.</li>
            <li>It never got hot</li>
            <li>It does take a while for it to get hot.  </li>
            <li>okay, it just doesnt get hot enough to perform each function well.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.and</li>
            <li>It worked pretty well this time, so</li>
            <li>I was very upset!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll most likely be returning it if they let me.  </li>
            <li>If you have little or no space to keep an iron and only use it once in a great while for a evening date, this would be a great little tool to have around.</li>
            <li>I love that it has reversible plates for crimping and flat ironing, its also detachable for the included curling iron too.</li>
            <li>Thought this would be a great for my daughter as her first styling tool but this not only doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to even work, it&#x27;s super cheap plastic and broke in half the first time it was dropped.</li>
            <li>up is pretty fast.</li>
            <li>and she wanted to see her hair straight for the first time.</li>
            <li>iron does get hot fast but have no luck using any of the attachments.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to do anything; actually, it barely gets warm at all.</li>
            <li>This is light weight and didn&#x27;t seem to get hot enough.</li>
            <li>The concept of this 3-in-1 set is a great idea, but this particular design works so poorly that it&#x27;s not even worth fighting with to use.  </li>
            <li>the curling iron itself is very cheaply designed, not very high quality and would only be good for a young girl who maybe just starting out...</li>
            <li>Overall, definitely a good product for the price, however, if your main use is going to be straightening I would recommend searching for a new product (I have found that a ceramic straightener by Ceramix has been a terrific investment).</li>
            <li>I have really think, medium length hair</li>
            <li>if-u-will hahaha...</li>
            <li>and she really wanted it.  </li>
            <li>and it still looked straight</li>
            <li>I flew through her whole head in 5 minutes</li>
            <li>It does absolutely nothing to hair.</li>
            <li>Very upset with this product</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get this if you don&#x27;t have much time to prep your hair.</li>
            <li>What I really wanted was the 1/2\\&quot; spiral curling iron.   </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really straighten or crimp my hair to well.</li>
            <li>and it seems to work very well.</li>
            <li>so I figured I don&#x27;t really need the Curling iron</li>
            <li>But even then you could by a 20$ curling iron or crimper that heats up just as fast</li>
            <li>The crimper is nice if you want to crimp a few selections of your hair.</li>
            <li>DO NOT waste your money on it!!!</li>
            <li>The flat iron does not get warm enough to straighten my hair, so I have it to my daughter.</li>
            <li>I immediately emailed the company wanting to return it and simply because I did not have the original packaging, they will not refund my money.  </li>
            <li>Wish I still had the original packaging so I could send it back.</li>
            <li>I wa sooo excited to get this only to find out</li>
            <li>I reccommend finding a better brand possibly and not one that looks like a toy O_O</li>
            <li>Was exactly what I was looking for, but it dose not get hot enough to really crimp the hair well.</li>
            <li>I as an adult would not use or purchase for myself .It doesn&#x27;t get extremely hot or crimp all</li>
            <li>Easy to use, and crimp plates were wide, if you do insist on buying.</li>
            <li>But overall gets the job done (if you don&#x27;t mind spending more than an hour to do, especially if you use the crimper)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying a bigger / better quality crimper next time...</li>
            <li>i probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend it and the krimper is super tiny</li>
            <li>But I had mainly bought it for the crimping part.</li>
            <li>this particular one was for the crimper/straightner</li>
            <li>I like it just wished it would get hotter faster like my older ones.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to someone who buys it.</li>
            <li>Went to Ebay, the prices were too high.  </li>
            <li>Very disapointed so far.  </li>
            <li>this would be great box was I wrong.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised when I got it so fast, and when I opened the box I thought I was just ordering a crimper</li>
            <li>With her normal curling iron (another conair)</li>
            <li>This item is inexpensive and well worth what I paid for it ten times over.</li>
            <li>My mom bought me this because I love styling my hair in various was and have been looking for a crimper for a long time.</li>
            <li>Not getting the hang of the spiral curler at all, maybe we need more practice, but it is not easy to use.</li>
            <li>Takes a long time to heat and doesn&#x27;t get very hot.  </li>
            <li>Tint, more for young girls with little hair.</li>
            <li>In fact, I purchased a new straightener within a week of this one.  </li>
            <li>I need a new straighter</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to straiten or curl.</li>
            <li>but it take about 30 minutes to get hot enough</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to do anything.  </li>
            <li>I left it on for about 20 minutes so that it would get hot</li>
            <li>these don&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.  </li>
            <li>The crimper would not crimp my daughter&#x27;s hair, it seemed like the styler would not get hot enough.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get nearly hot enough.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t even get hot, even when left for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pretty simple for her to change out the pieces though.  </li>
            <li>Only one side of the unit gets hot.</li>
            <li>She opened this up, plugged it in and waited about 10 minutes thinking it would heat up hot enough to crimp her hair.  </li>
            <li>I agree with the reviews that it just doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li>Even when I leave it on for much longer than I should need to, it just barely crimps.</li>
            <li>Got it for my 12 year old and it sucked!</li>
            <li>I have to like wait 30 minutes before it&#x27;s hot enough to do anything to my hair.</li>
            <li>We went to use it and then darn thing gets nowhere near hot enough to straighten, let alone curl or crimp.</li>
            <li>it can be a flat iron and curling iron, but it takes time getting warmed up and doesn&#x27;t get that hot but still does the job</li>
            <li>I bought this product primarily for straightening my hair (my hair is naturally just slightly wavy).  </li>
            <li>It did not get hot enough, the end of the flat iron piece pulled her hair out, and her hair became very frizzy and knotty.</li>
            <li>and I have to completely straighten my natural wavy hair before I use it.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product for my 11 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>Based on the reviews I&#x27;ve seen it seems really hit-or-miss whether it heats up properly.</li>
            <li>She has naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>But it was for my 6 year old</li>
            <li>Got for my nieces 12th birthday; she really wanted this styler b/c of different options.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>just wave it the tiniest....making it look like my natural hair anyway.</li>
            <li>I wish I were able to give this product a negative rating.</li>
            <li>She has used it twice since Christmas and no burns so far.  </li>
            <li>It works as it should so far.</li>
            <li>This curler should be marked as a toy.  </li>
            <li>Going to give it to my 12 year old niece.</li>
            <li>I bought this formy 12 &amp; 13 year old and they have not said anything about it.</li>
            <li>Bought for my 13 yr old, she loves it.</li>
            <li>My 6yr old daughter touched it</li>
            <li>I have searched everywhere high AND low for a new crimper because the one I used to have broke &#x3D;</li>
            <li>But, the product doesn&#x27;t heat up hot enough and doesn&#x27;t keep the heat as you work through an entire head of hair.</li>
            <li>It never got hot enough to actually straighten hair.</li>
            <li>Placed first order, didn&#x27;t come with all attachments shown in second picture and description.&lt;br /&gt;Asked for replacement and second one came</li>
            <li>Even with the suggested heat-up time, it would never reach a temp high enough to create anything.</li>
            <li>no temp controle just low and high..</li>
            <li>Works very well, but it takes a long time to heat up.</li>
            <li>It doest warm up with the tool for straight hair, and the plate for it is too short, actually I believe is not good enough for the price i paid for it</li>
            <li>This is my first iron and it does what I expected.  </li>
            <li>The only thing on there that works is the crimper, the curling iron doesn&#x27;t get hot, neither does the flat iron.</li>
            <li>Quick heat up and doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to singe delicate kid hair.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, so for this not to get hot enough for me is pretty bad.  </li>
            <li>Aside from worrying about my house burning down, this seems to do the trick into getting a messy-headed 1 year old interested in brushing and styling her hair.  </li>
            <li>Who doesn&#x27;t clean up christmas morning and throw away the entire mess in your living room??  </li>
            <li>The unit does not get very hot, and seemed to lose it&#x27;s heat a few times throughout the crimping process.  </li>
            <li>works good, just the crimper SUCKS!!!</li>
            <li>I had to set the heat to high and leave whatever tool I was using for a long time.</li>
            <li>Iron is not hot enough to style hair and my daughter&#x27;s hair is very fine - waste of my money</li>
            <li>but they can be hard to take off and fit on at times.</li>
            <li>As someone else stated, there are only a low and high setting so if you are somewhere in between for heat, I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Just bought this at the dollar general.</li>
            <li>it barely heated up i tried crimping and it didnt crimp it when i tried using the curler part</li>
            <li>Went to several stores looking for the old style crimper.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised to discover that it came with a different attachment that also curled.</li>
            <li>i already have was hot and in less time too.</li>
            <li>NOT for real use, absolutely not worth even the points...</li>
            <li>but it takes forever about  half hour to get hot enough to actually work......</li>
            <li>It really wasn&#x27;t hot enough to crimp my pre teens long thick hair.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and less clutter in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li>It works well on mine, but I have fine hair, and she has very thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li>I have mildly curly and thick hair (but not coarse).</li>
            <li>Crimper and straightening iron don&#x27;t seem to get tight enough on the hair to straighten or crimp very well.</li>

            <li> Good for the money though!</li>
            <li> Great idea, just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> While they do work, they just don&#x27;t do a great job.  </li>
            <li> Great for traveling.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely manner &amp; in great condition  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, a great product</li>
            <li> my daughter is happy thats what matters ,,,, .... ,,,,, .... ,,,,, ...... ,,,,, ..... ,,,, ..... ,,,, .... ,,,</li>
            <li> Looks great, but doesn&#x27;t keep the heat.</li>
            <li> Which makes the 80 s child in me sooooo happy.  </li>
            <li> great product wife loves it.</li>
            <li> THe curling iron works great.</li>
            <li> and I thought $16 works great</li>
            <li> WORKS AMAZING!</li>
            <li> THis is the perfect gift for any fashion diva 9 year old at an awesome price.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been good.</li>
            <li> beautifully!&lt;br /&gt;-Heat is fairly good.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and it seemed like a good deal.</li>
            <li> Fully functional and my sister loved it</li>
            <li> and so I found what I thought to be a good one on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I suppose it is good for a kid if you are worried about the heat.</li>
            <li> the curling iron worrks fairly well, but it does leave an un-flattering crease or dent if you will, at the bottom of the curl.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t ever had a straightener or curler and want to try it without spending 100 bucks this one is good.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a good product.  </li>
            <li> It is not the cadillac of styling tools but good for travel</li>
            <li> I love these curlers there great and curl my hair good 5 stars</li>
            <li> I am happy that Amazon has a good return policy :)  </li>
            <li> Heat is very important!</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I just own 4 perfectly good working curling irons and had no need for another one.</li>
            <li> not for women who know better!</li>
            <li> so she enjoyed it!</li>
            <li> ; well it seems like more than 20 mins to heat up!</li>
            <li> I love this hair presser, curler thinger!  </li>
            <li> For the price, this thing is amazing.</li>
            <li> its nice</li>
            <li> but it takes forever to warm up.</li>
            <li> I liked the 3 in one product for my granddaughter.</li>
            <li> Everything came nicely.</li>
            <li> /&gt; honestly.</li>
            <li> I checked the iron and It was barely warm.  </li>
            <li> you would b better off paying a good bit money for a nice one that will work than a one that want work at all.</li>
            <li> it had some great reviews saying it heats up fast and crimps great</li>
            <li> It took forever for this to warm up and</li>
            <li> It is nice that it was the three options.</li>
            <li> i got this for a friend who was reminiscing on the days of crimped hair, and was nervous at first reading all the reviews saying it didn&#x27;t warm up, but my friend loves it and says it works perfectly! :)</li>
            <li> When I used the styler, I was delighted by the easy way this product could be used.  </li>
            <li> Spend $10-$20 more to get something with more quality!</li>
            <li> I was looking for the crimp iron in lots of stores, and finally I decided to go online, and I found a good one at a perfect price :)</li>
            <li> Its amazing that it can do many things for one object</li>
            <li> so great right.  </li>
            <li> I guess as a first crimping iron for a girl this would be great.</li>
            <li> This product seems really great at first glance.  </li>
            <li> Too good to be true.</li>
            <li> I should have know that it was to good to be true.</li>
            <li> The plastic on the straightener/crimper heads was very cheap.</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought this product it does what it is supposed to and is very cheaply priced</li>
            <li> I love that it has reversable falt and crimp irons.</li>
            <li> But I still like it, just have to wait like 5 minutes to get the heat I wanted, and I get my job done :)   </li>
            <li> I love the color and the removable parts</li>
            <li> I used this product and it works ok.  </li>
            <li> However, there is a plastic area on top that you can hold</li>
            <li> i love this product.</li>
            <li> If you want a way better one, get a more pricer one than this one.</li>
            <li> My daughter used her christmas gift card to buy this because she wanted to be able to crimp and curl her hair.</li>
            <li> 20 minutes later it&#x27;s at the perfect heat range</li>
            <li> This product works great - heats up fast.</li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> i love shopping online.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> Its okay.</li>
            <li> I had to buy my daughter a much better one within a week.</li>
            <li> The waves are more kinky than wavey.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I&#x27;m better off using my mother&#x27;s hair tools from the 80s.....    </li>
            <li> i would gladly .</li>
            <li> Product is okay.</li>
            <li> Anywho, this product is just, okay.</li>
            <li> In this case you definatly get more then you pay for</li>
            <li> I am off to look for a REAL crimper LOL</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like a play curling iron.</li>
            <li> I love the curling iron attachment,  </li>
            <li> SHe is sure to love it</li>
            <li> The crimper works but with it taking forever to heat up and on top of that you have to hold the crimper there for like 5 minutes</li>
            <li> I love that this is three tools in one.</li>
            <li> and she is always very excited about hair :)</li>
            <li> I was very excited about getting this because I had one as a kid.</li>
            <li> i was very excited about the features.</li>
            <li> I received this item, and I was very excited to use it.  </li>
            <li> i love the color,, mine was pink, perfect for a girl like me.</li>
            <li> I had the old model in the 1990&#x27;s this one is just as great.  </li>
            <li> She is happy with the item so far.</li>
            <li> I just stuck my hand right on the heating plates and they were mildly warm, that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> I was so excited I should have read more details about this package before I ordered it</li>
            <li> stands on the iron heads makes easy to just put it anywhere without fear of it burning something.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, the attachments are easy to replace.  </li>
            <li> I guess, but the socket used to plug in the heads broke fairly easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to transport too.  </li>
            <li> The curler does not get hot, no, it does not even warm up.  </li>
            <li> It was just fine  </li>
            <li> It curled my hair fine</li>
            <li> It would be fine for a child, or someone to \\&quot;practice\\&quot; doing hair.</li>
            <li> The curler worked fine</li>
            <li> the curling iron will heat up and work fine</li>
            <li> Super cheap attachments that do not work well!</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the quick shipment of this item</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t heat up so it wont straighten my hair, just kind of tugs on it leaving it looking very frizzy, but not as frizzy as the crimper makes my hair look.  </li>
            <li> It allows you to change your hair styling tool to fit what you want to do with each section of your hair.  </li>
            <li> It looks really cheap.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t light up/glow/</li>
            <li> Takes forever to heat up, looks and feels cheap.</li>
            <li> It is cheap, and it doesn&#x27;t even heat up</li>
            <li> though i am incredibly cheap, so</li>
            <li> Also, it is made of really cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product, and I would most definitely buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for the first iron for a young girl this would be great too.  </li>
            <li> Its a nice price, but it takes a really long time heat up and is not as effective as i would have guessed.</li>
            <li> It works very well, and it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li> so I got to the conclusion that it was a perfect thing to buy for a little girl that wants to play to the saloon being a safe toy...</li>
            <li> And I couldn&#x27;t return it because I lost the original packaging.</li>
            <li> I was actually able to hold on to the plates that should have been hot with ease.  </li>
            <li> Great idea in theory, but it has a long way to go.</li>
            <li> When I got it, I was excited to see how it worked.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to say that it heated up just fine, and I love using the crimper, and the curls come out better than any other curling iron I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I needed it for a special event and ended up throwing it away.</li>
            <li> All the attachable add ons are cool.  </li>
            <li> Overall it good just wish it got hotter.</li>
            <li> I had to give one star to be able to post, but I really wanted to give zero.</li>
            <li> It does a good job of this, especially given the price.  </li>
            <li> but this thing is so cool.</li>
            <li> The crimping looks so cool.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this item, but when i got it i plugged it in, and it didnt get hot AT ALL!</li>
            <li> I got this very cheap and so far am completely satisfied it is my first curling iorn/straightner</li>
            <li> They recommend you let the iron cool before changeing tips but almost every household has something like a oven mit that allows quick changes.  </li>
            <li> It does take awhile to adequately heat up tho  </li>
            <li> The item shipped quickly, but that&#x27;s about where the products usefulness ended.</li>
            <li> and then when it did it wasnt very hot hell</li>
            <li> Does not get very hot.</li>
            <li> Great price, perhaps could for people with very fine thin hair.</li>
            <li> DO NOT PURCHASE THIS HOT IRON!</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t get hot at all!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get hot, nothing!</li>
            <li> Turned on but never got hot!</li>
            <li> I opened the package, and plugged the crimper part to it first plugged it up, and it didn&#x27;t work!  </li>
            <li> My daughter has had a lot of fun using it on both her hair and her friends.</li>
            <li> Does not get warm enough to even straighten, curl, or crimp.</li>
            <li> My 12 year old wanted to learn how to style her hair different ways so for the price I figured this would be a great start.</li>
            <li> Purchased for 13 year old girl and it works ok.</li>
            <li> the reason why I gave it 2 stars instead of 5 is because it only gets barely warm.</li>
            <li> The packaging is the plastic kind you actually have to take scissors and cut into.  </li>
            <li> Came in quickly will and exactly what she seen on the web site.</li>
            <li> Does not heat up very well.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the money or the time!</li>
            <li> I got the right product because this thing did nothing like the reviews said..</li>
            <li> My 9 year old seems to be able to handle it pretty well.  </li>
            <li> So far my daughter loves it because its easy to handle and since it has a bit of border around the metal plates she does not burn herself.</li>
            <li> Learning how to work it is the biggest thing, but it been a good little tool.  </li>
            <li> If you do, I think this would be a good buy, otherwise, get something a little easier.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s an okay product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experimented with most of the different heads on this thing</li>
            <li> But unfortunatly this does not seem to get that hot.</li>
            <li> I probably would have bought higher heat model without the switch plates.  </li>
            <li> I was upset it wasn&#x27;t hot</li>
            <li> Does not work...does not get hot.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this CHEAP product.</li>
            <li> It never got hot</li>
            <li> It does take a while for it to get hot.  </li>
            <li> okay, it just doesnt get hot enough to perform each function well.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.and</li>
            <li> It worked pretty well this time, so</li>
            <li> I was very upset!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll most likely be returning it if they let me.  </li>
            <li> If you have little or no space to keep an iron and only use it once in a great while for a evening date, this would be a great little tool to have around.</li>
            <li> I love that it has reversible plates for crimping and flat ironing, its also detachable for the included curling iron too.</li>
            <li> Thought this would be a great for my daughter as her first styling tool but this not only doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to even work, it&#x27;s super cheap plastic and broke in half the first time it was dropped.</li>
            <li> up is pretty fast.</li>
            <li> and she wanted to see her hair straight for the first time.</li>
            <li> iron does get hot fast but have no luck using any of the attachments.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to do anything; actually, it barely gets warm at all.</li>
            <li> This is light weight and didn&#x27;t seem to get hot enough.</li>
            <li> The concept of this 3-in-1 set is a great idea, but this particular design works so poorly that it&#x27;s not even worth fighting with to use.  </li>
            <li> the curling iron itself is very cheaply designed, not very high quality and would only be good for a young girl who maybe just starting out...</li>
            <li> Overall, definitely a good product for the price, however, if your main use is going to be straightening I would recommend searching for a new product (I have found that a ceramic straightener by Ceramix has been a terrific investment).</li>
            <li> I have really think, medium length hair</li>
            <li> if-u-will hahaha...</li>
            <li> and she really wanted it.  </li>
            <li> and it still looked straight</li>
            <li> I flew through her whole head in 5 minutes</li>
            <li> It does absolutely nothing to hair.</li>
            <li> Very upset with this product</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get this if you don&#x27;t have much time to prep your hair.</li>
            <li> What I really wanted was the 1/2\\&quot; spiral curling iron.   </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really straighten or crimp my hair to well.</li>
            <li> and it seems to work very well.</li>
            <li> so I figured I don&#x27;t really need the Curling iron</li>
            <li> But even then you could by a 20$ curling iron or crimper that heats up just as fast</li>
            <li> The crimper is nice if you want to crimp a few selections of your hair.</li>
            <li> DO NOT waste your money on it!!!</li>
            <li> The flat iron does not get warm enough to straighten my hair, so I have it to my daughter.</li>
            <li> I immediately emailed the company wanting to return it and simply because I did not have the original packaging, they will not refund my money.  </li>
            <li> Wish I still had the original packaging so I could send it back.</li>
            <li> I wa sooo excited to get this only to find out</li>
            <li> I reccommend finding a better brand possibly and not one that looks like a toy O_O</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I was looking for, but it dose not get hot enough to really crimp the hair well.</li>
            <li> I as an adult would not use or purchase for myself .It doesn&#x27;t get extremely hot or crimp all</li>
            <li> Easy to use, and crimp plates were wide, if you do insist on buying.</li>
            <li> But overall gets the job done (if you don&#x27;t mind spending more than an hour to do, especially if you use the crimper)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying a bigger / better quality crimper next time...</li>
            <li> i probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend it and the krimper is super tiny</li>
            <li> But I had mainly bought it for the crimping part.</li>
            <li> this particular one was for the crimper/straightner</li>
            <li> I like it just wished it would get hotter faster like my older ones.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend to someone who buys it.</li>
            <li> Went to Ebay, the prices were too high.  </li>
            <li> Very disapointed so far.  </li>
            <li> this would be great box was I wrong.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised when I got it so fast, and when I opened the box I thought I was just ordering a crimper</li>
            <li> With her normal curling iron (another conair)</li>
            <li> This item is inexpensive and well worth what I paid for it ten times over.</li>
            <li> My mom bought me this because I love styling my hair in various was and have been looking for a crimper for a long time.</li>
            <li> Not getting the hang of the spiral curler at all, maybe we need more practice, but it is not easy to use.</li>
            <li> Takes a long time to heat and doesn&#x27;t get very hot.  </li>
            <li> Tint, more for young girls with little hair.</li>
            <li> In fact, I purchased a new straightener within a week of this one.  </li>
            <li> I need a new straighter</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to straiten or curl.</li>
            <li> but it take about 30 minutes to get hot enough</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to do anything.  </li>
            <li> I left it on for about 20 minutes so that it would get hot</li>
            <li> these don&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.  </li>
            <li> The crimper would not crimp my daughter&#x27;s hair, it seemed like the styler would not get hot enough.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get nearly hot enough.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even get hot, even when left for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Pretty simple for her to change out the pieces though.  </li>
            <li> Only one side of the unit gets hot.</li>
            <li> She opened this up, plugged it in and waited about 10 minutes thinking it would heat up hot enough to crimp her hair.  </li>
            <li> I agree with the reviews that it just doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li> Even when I leave it on for much longer than I should need to, it just barely crimps.</li>
            <li> Got it for my 12 year old and it sucked!</li>
            <li> I have to like wait 30 minutes before it&#x27;s hot enough to do anything to my hair.</li>
            <li> We went to use it and then darn thing gets nowhere near hot enough to straighten, let alone curl or crimp.</li>
            <li> it can be a flat iron and curling iron, but it takes time getting warmed up and doesn&#x27;t get that hot but still does the job</li>
            <li> I bought this product primarily for straightening my hair (my hair is naturally just slightly wavy).  </li>
            <li> It did not get hot enough, the end of the flat iron piece pulled her hair out, and her hair became very frizzy and knotty.</li>
            <li> and I have to completely straighten my natural wavy hair before I use it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my 11 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews I&#x27;ve seen it seems really hit-or-miss whether it heats up properly.</li>
            <li> She has naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> But it was for my 6 year old</li>
            <li> Got for my nieces 12th birthday; she really wanted this styler b/c of different options.</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> just wave it the tiniest....making it look like my natural hair anyway.</li>
            <li> I wish I were able to give this product a negative rating.</li>
            <li> She has used it twice since Christmas and no burns so far.  </li>
            <li> It works as it should so far.</li>
            <li> This curler should be marked as a toy.  </li>
            <li> Going to give it to my 12 year old niece.</li>
            <li> I bought this formy 12 &amp; 13 year old and they have not said anything about it.</li>
            <li> Bought for my 13 yr old, she loves it.</li>
            <li> My 6yr old daughter touched it</li>
            <li> I have searched everywhere high AND low for a new crimper because the one I used to have broke &#x3D;</li>
            <li> But, the product doesn&#x27;t heat up hot enough and doesn&#x27;t keep the heat as you work through an entire head of hair.</li>
            <li> It never got hot enough to actually straighten hair.</li>
            <li> Placed first order, didn&#x27;t come with all attachments shown in second picture and description.&lt;br /&gt;Asked for replacement and second one came</li>
            <li> Even with the suggested heat-up time, it would never reach a temp high enough to create anything.</li>
            <li> no temp controle just low and high..</li>
            <li> Works very well, but it takes a long time to heat up.</li>
            <li> It doest warm up with the tool for straight hair, and the plate for it is too short, actually I believe is not good enough for the price i paid for it</li>
            <li> This is my first iron and it does what I expected.  </li>
            <li> The only thing on there that works is the crimper, the curling iron doesn&#x27;t get hot, neither does the flat iron.</li>
            <li> Quick heat up and doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to singe delicate kid hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, so for this not to get hot enough for me is pretty bad.  </li>
            <li> Aside from worrying about my house burning down, this seems to do the trick into getting a messy-headed 1 year old interested in brushing and styling her hair.  </li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t clean up christmas morning and throw away the entire mess in your living room??  </li>
            <li> The unit does not get very hot, and seemed to lose it&#x27;s heat a few times throughout the crimping process.  </li>
            <li> works good, just the crimper SUCKS!!!</li>
            <li> I had to set the heat to high and leave whatever tool I was using for a long time.</li>
            <li> Iron is not hot enough to style hair and my daughter&#x27;s hair is very fine - waste of my money</li>
            <li> but they can be hard to take off and fit on at times.</li>
            <li> As someone else stated, there are only a low and high setting so if you are somewhere in between for heat, I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Just bought this at the dollar general.</li>
            <li> it barely heated up i tried crimping and it didnt crimp it when i tried using the curler part</li>
            <li> Went to several stores looking for the old style crimper.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised to discover that it came with a different attachment that also curled.</li>
            <li> i already have was hot and in less time too.</li>
            <li> NOT for real use, absolutely not worth even the points...</li>
            <li> but it takes forever about  half hour to get hot enough to actually work......</li>
            <li> It really wasn&#x27;t hot enough to crimp my pre teens long thick hair.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and less clutter in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li> It works well on mine, but I have fine hair, and she has very thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have mildly curly and thick hair (but not coarse).</li>
            <li> Crimper and straightening iron don&#x27;t seem to get tight enough on the hair to straighten or crimp very well.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get this unfortunately</li>
            <li> I would suggest just to get a regular crimper, flat iron, and curling iron.</li>
            <li> It doesnt heat up its defective flat iron from conair if i knew how to send it back</li>
            <li> However the heating area is rather small and the product seems to take a while to heat enough to do much.</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty hard to style with heat anyway due to natural curl, so don&#x27;t get this if that&#x27;s your situation.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron because it came with the crimp and curling option.</li>
            <li> As of now, the flat iron, nor the curling iron have been used.  </li>
            <li> There are 3 interchangable attachments; the crimper, the curling iron and the flat iron.  </li>
            <li> The straightener and crimper heats up fast but after a couple pieces of hair the side not receiving heat will cool down and the tool becomes useless.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t heat up well enough to really do what it is supposed to do, would not buy again, its purple like the picture shows at least.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t get hot enough to crimp my 3 year old thin hair!</li>
            <li> The problem is the same with this curling iron as every other multiple use item out there.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted a curler that would put waves in my hair but this product is a little more difficult to use probably because I&#x27;m still not sure what I&#x27;m doing.</li>
            <li> It just take a really long time to heat up</li>
            <li> It only takes a few seconds to change from a regular curling iron to a spiral, and back again.  </li>
            <li> This takes a long time to heat up, like 10 minutes, but once it is heated up it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I bought this a long time ago from k-mart and it didn&#x27;t work to well with my hair.</li>
            <li> but as I said I had to leave it there for a long time.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money and time.  </li>
            <li> cuz it&#x27;s not hot enough.</li>
            <li> Its also not heating up fast enough for me, i usually have a few minutes to get out</li>
            <li> , I haven&#x27;t used the other accessories with it, but I&#x27;m guessing it would be about the same thing.  </li>
            <li> What I got was the other picture listed... a plastic piece that attaches to the regular iron for the spiral.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to actually straighten or curl your hair, and so is basically useless.</li>
            <li> in order to get any use out of the flat iron/crimper you&#x27;ve got to hold the clamp shut with your free hand, which is awkward and time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just that even though my hair is pretty thin, the iron isn&#x27;t so efficiently doing its job</li>
            <li> The crimps are slightly noticeable and only hold for a couple hours with lots of hair spray.</li>
            <li> and I thought there was some problem with the cord, as it only heated a little</li>
            <li> The actual crimping section is so small, it takes a LONG time to get through medium/long hair.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this thing does not heat up well enough to really use it.</li>
            <li> and I spent over $20 with this.</li>
            <li> the same way.&lt;br /&gt;All attachments are not included,1/2-inch spiral head and round brush attachment is also 3/4 inches.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> This Item was not strong enough for her curls, and it did not work as well on her hair as we thought.</li>
            <li> The curling iron works just not very well due to the lack of heat.</li>
            <li> /Off.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;-Changing heads while in use is pretty difficult.</li>
            <li> ANYWAYS, I bought this piece of garbage hoping it would crimp my hair like my other one did</li>
            <li> Total waste of money!</li>
            <li> I read a lot about it taking a really long time to heat up to just a little bit, so I was a little nervous when I bought it.</li>
            <li> not worth the money.</li>
            <li> no matter how long you hold it, how small the section of hair, or even the amount of hairspray put in before using it....</li>
            <li> Love the curling iorn hate the rest..</li>
            <li> I really hoped this would have worked, but unfortunately it was a let down.</li>
            <li> The spiral curler doesnt spiral (and I have easy-curl hair that measures down to my butt)</li>
            <li> and it takes about an hour and a half to get it fully heated.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t mind that it doesn&#x27;t get crazy hot bc that makes it safer.</li>
            <li> it just takes a little longer.</li>
            <li> Does take little bit to heat</li>
            <li> Got this for my little girl thinking</li>
            <li> When I got it, it reminded me of the shinny purple plastic stuff I used to get from Santa when i was a little girl.</li>
            <li> my daughter was so excited to get this but disappointed that it didn&#x27;t make her hair</li>
            <li> This thing was a waste of $20.</li>
            <li> and it was not cheap.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> this was a waste of 25.00 dollars.</li>
            <li> Waste of my money</li>
            <li> Waste of 15.00 and time.</li>
            <li> Over all I wouldlnt really waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> A waste of money</li>
            <li> I dnt recommend anyone to buy it , its a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I used it a few times, and then I cut my hair.  </li>
            <li> they didn&#x27;t get around to using it till a few weeks ago..</li>
            <li> I opened up the crimper, and realized the part that I needed to heat it up was missing for the crimper.  </li>
            <li> It was a waste of time to even turn on.  </li>
            <li> It has hardly any heat, and you can only crimp a very small amount of hair.</li>
            <li> Seems like it takes A while to heat up, the crimper was a little to small for my hair,  like the options.</li>
            <li> Within a few hours they were a thing of the past.  </li>
            <li> and they tend to last for several years even under rough use, so if you get one and hate it its going to be around for awhile.</li>
            <li> I cried and now my dad is angry such a waste of money</li>
            <li> , it takes FOREVER to heat up and the plates are so little doesn&#x27;t work for thick hair like mine.</li>
            <li> Crimper takes forever, over and over, to crimp even small pieces of hair.</li>
            <li> The curling iron is a bit small but works.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not pleased with it at all.</li>
            <li> not sure how it is going to work yet.</li>
            <li> Pretty bummed :(</li>
            <li> This product is a malfunction to begin with who ever thinks this stupid product works is not smart and should be alive</li>
            <li> She tried it and it did hardly anything.  </li>
            <li> ...very disappointed because that was the main reason I got</li>
            <li> It hardly crimps my hair at all, even when I let it heat up for 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> The item does not heat up and it takes at least and hour just to crimp her hair.</li>
            <li> This iron sucks.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, I have thick hair and it doesnt work</li>
            <li> WUT A WASTE OF MONEY!!</li>
            <li> i realise it was not a good product at all .</li>
            <li> it hardly heats up at all, the plates do not stay on when switching them, the whole thing is horrible.</li>
            <li> The straightener SUCKS!</li>
            <li> Straightener, Sucks!</li>
            <li> Not happy with it</li>
            <li> This product is a rip-off.</li>
            <li> THIN or else</li>
            <li> The waver is not great and haven&#x27;t used the straightener.  </li>
            <li> The crimper is even worse...</li>
            <li> But, I&#x27;m confused on weather</li>
            <li> Poor poor quality and even worse customer service.  </li>
            <li> It seemed like either it would work well, or it would be almost useless.</li>
            <li> Did not work at all, unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> Sad i bought it, prolly going to end up in the trash.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I was mistaken.</li>
            <li> I found that it did this very poorly.  </li>
            <li> a all this stinks</li>
            <li> I am so mad I bought this.</li>
            <li> It is almost impossible to replace the striaghtner/crimper with the curling iron.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and we were both disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am highly disappointed in this set.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an 80&#x27;s girl, so you can imagine how disappointed I was that it didn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a piece of crap.</li>
            <li> Worthless.  </li>
            <li> Bad thing takes 10-20 minutes to heat up!</li>
            <li> I was shocked!  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this purchase.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for awhile, I&#x27;ve tried it over and over again but it doesn&#x27;t work. I have really think, medium length hair and it just doesn&#x27;t work. It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to straiten or curl. I do use it for the crimper but it take about 30 minutes to get hot enough and I have to completely straighten my natural wavy hair before I use it. The crimps are slightly noticeable and only hold for a couple hours with lots of hair spray. I don&#x27;t recommend buying this! Spend $10-$20 more to get something with more quality!</li>
            <li> I bought this not knowing what to expect, because the reviews were so mixed. It seemed like either it would work well, or it would be almost useless. I read a lot about it taking a really long time to heat up to just a little bit, so I was a little nervous when I bought it. I&#x27;m glad to say that it heated up just fine, and I love using the crimper, and the curls come out better than any other curling iron I&#x27;ve used. It works very well, and it&#x27;s very easy to use. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product, and I would most definitely buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> This is my first iron and it does what I expected.  Wonderful for the price and just what I needed since I use it infrequently.</li>
            <li> Takes a long time to heat and doesn&#x27;t get very hot.  Crimper takes forever, over and over, to crimp even small pieces of hair.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful tool! I love that it has reversable falt and crimp irons. Now i only have one tool taking up space in my bathroom. The curling iron is a bit small but works.</li>
            <li> 5 in 1 is a great advantage! It&#x27;s just that even though my hair is pretty thin, the iron isn&#x27;t so efficiently doing its job cuz it&#x27;s not hot enough. But I still like it, just have to wait like 5 minutes to get the heat I wanted, and I get my job done :)   The price is low, but the satisfaction is of that amount.  You get what you pay.  But I still encourage those who want to save money like me!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my 11 year old daughter. My daughter has had a lot of fun using it on both her hair and her friends.</li>
            <li> I tried to crimp my daughter&#x27;s hair and it did not do a thing!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get this unfortunately it just don&#x27;t work.  It doesn&#x27;t heat up so it wont straighten my hair, just kind of tugs on it leaving it looking very frizzy, but not as frizzy as the crimper makes my hair look.  Heat is very important! I haven&#x27;t even tried the curling iron.</li>
            <li> I love the color and the removable parts but they can be hard to take off and fit on at times. Its also not heating up fast enough for me, i usually have a few minutes to get out so i cant wait for it to heat up and style.</li>
            <li> I love these curlers there great and curl my hair good 5 stars</li>
            <li> I used this product and it works ok.  It just take a really long time to heat up so it takes an even longer time to do my hair.  I&#x27;ve only used the crimper, I haven&#x27;t used the other accessories with it, but I&#x27;m guessing it would be about the same thing.  Overall, it&#x27;s an okay product.</li>
            <li> This thing was a waste of $20. It&#x27;s a piece of crap. It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to do anything; actually, it barely gets warm at all. I just stuck my hand right on the heating plates and they were mildly warm, that&#x27;s it. Great idea, just doesn&#x27;t work. Based on the reviews I&#x27;ve seen it seems really hit-or-miss whether it heats up properly. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> Could have bought this item at my local dollar store! Super cheap attachments that do not work well! The spiral curler doesnt spiral (and I have easy-curl hair that measures down to my butt) the curling iron itself is very cheaply designed, not very high quality and would only be good for a young girl who maybe just starting out...a training iron if-u-will hahaha... not for women who know better!</li>
            <li> This thing works.  All the attachable add ons are cool.  It just seems to be the best thing out there.  Why go out and buy multiple curlers when you can get it all in one.  It only takes a few seconds to change from a regular curling iron to a spiral, and back again.  It allows you to change your hair styling tool to fit what you want to do with each section of your hair.  They recommend you let the iron cool before changeing tips but almost every household has something like a oven mit that allows quick changes.  All this sounds so great right.  The problem is the same with this curling iron as every other multiple use item out there.  While they do work, they just don&#x27;t do a great job.  My girlfriend used this iron to style her hair for christmas. She&#x27;s been wanting a spiral iron so I got her this.  Within Ten minutes she was complaining about the curls starting to fade.  Within a few hours they were a thing of the past.  With her normal curling iron (another conair) the curls stay with her all day and often beyond.  If you have little or no space to keep an iron and only use it once in a great while for a evening date, this would be a great little tool to have around. If you are looking for the first iron for a young girl this would be great too.  For someone that styles their hair often and needs it to hold, I suggest getting something different.  On the up side its a conair product and they tend to last for several years even under rough use, so if you get one and hate it its going to be around for awhile.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experimented with most of the different heads on this thing and it&#x27;s been good. I haven&#x27;t burned anything yet..&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Warming up is pretty fast. I give it about a minute.&lt;br /&gt;-Curling/Waving/Crimping comes out beautifully!&lt;br /&gt;-Heat is fairly good. Doesn&#x27;t leave even the tiniest amount of hair fried.&lt;br /&gt;-6-Foot cord is a DREAM.&lt;br /&gt;-The stands on the iron heads makes easy to just put it anywhere without fear of it burning something.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-You get what you pay for. It looks really cheap. The metal-looking thing on the actual iron is just metallic foil.&lt;br /&gt;-No heat settings. There&#x27;s only an \\&quot;On/Off.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;-Changing heads while in use is pretty difficult. You got to try and yank it out without burning your fingers. However, there is a plastic area on top that you can hold onto.&lt;br /&gt;-\\&quot;Red Indicator\\&quot; is just a lil red dot on mine. It doesn&#x27;t light up/glow/anything!&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;BR&gt;For the price, this thing is amazing. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my step-daughter for Christmas as she wanted an iron that did all that this product offered.  Plugged the product in after Christmas, it heated up, we started using the different rods and it did nothing to her hair at all.  Did not straighten it, did not curl it, did not wave it, did nothing.  I immediately emailed the company wanting to return it and simply because I did not have the original packaging, they will not refund my money.  I have the product itself and the pamphlets that came with it, just not the plastic container it was shipped in.  Who doesn&#x27;t clean up christmas morning and throw away the entire mess in your living room??  The package got thrown away with all the Christmas wrap.  And what does it matter, the product itself doesn&#x27;t work at all and it was not cheap.  I am still fighting with the company for my refund, but they are now ignoring my emails.  Poor poor quality and even worse customer service.  This does not even deserve the 1 star I gave it.</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter for Christmas because a friend of her&#x27;s had one and she really wanted it.  Very disapointed so far.  Does not do anything even as well as the straighteners and curling irons we already had.  Not getting the hang of the spiral curler at all, maybe we need more practice, but it is not easy to use.</li>
            <li> i love this product. its nice, i like it,,, i definitely recomment this product to my friends. i love the color,, mine was pink, perfect for a girl like me.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and it seemed like a good deal. We went to use it and then darn thing gets nowhere near hot enough to straighten, let alone curl or crimp. Bought at Kmart and plan to return it.</li>
            <li> I like that it it can be a flat iron and curling iron, but it takes time getting warmed up and doesn&#x27;t get that hot but still does the job it just takes a little longer. Great for traveling. Overall it good just wish it got hotter.</li>
            <li> Thought this would be a great for my daughter as her first styling tool but this not only doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to even work, it&#x27;s super cheap plastic and broke in half the first time it was dropped.</li>
            <li> Takes forever to heat up, looks and feels cheap. But overall gets the job done (if you don&#x27;t mind spending more than an hour to do, especially if you use the crimper)  If you want a way better one, get a more pricer one than this one. You get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> I guess as a first crimping iron for a girl this would be great. It really wasn&#x27;t hot enough to crimp my pre teens long thick hair. It may just have been her hair, so she used it on her doll.</li>
            <li> As described and timely shipping. Fully functional and my sister loved it</li>
            <li> Works very well, but it takes a long time to heat up.</li>
            <li> This product is very good. It has different tools. The curler worked magnificent, all I did was hairspray it, it stayed through the day! Bad thing takes 10-20 minutes to heat up! Good for the money though!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t heat up well enough to really do what it is supposed to do, would not buy again, its purple like the picture shows at least.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to do anything.  I would not buy this product ever again.  Not happy with it</li>
            <li> I had the old model in the 1990&#x27;s this one is just as great.  You save a lot of money and room not buying the different products seperately.</li>
            <li> I have searched everywhere high AND low for a new crimper because the one I used to have broke &#x3D;[ it lasted me about 4 years and then gave out SO ANYWAYS, I bought this piece of garbage hoping it would crimp my hair like my other one did and THIS IRON IS CRAP!!!! DO NOT waste your money on it!!! DO NOT!!! I used the crimper and it doesn&#x27;t even crimp my hair. I left it on for about 20 minutes so that it would get hot and then I crimped my hair and it still looked straight and then I put hairspray cus I thought maybe that would work and NOPE it still didn&#x27;t and then yesterday I tried the barrel to curl my hair and the barrel works good, just the crimper SUCKS!!!</li>
            <li> This is the worst product I have ever purchased. My daughter used her christmas gift card to buy this because she wanted to be able to crimp and curl her hair. The item does not heat up and it takes at least and hour just to crimp her hair. Wish I still had the original packaging so I could send it back. This product is a rip-off.</li>
            <li> It was just fine  Arrived in a timely manner &amp; in great condition  It does take awhile to adequately heat up tho  So plug it in and go have breakfast  Or plug it in and do your makeup  20 minutes later it&#x27;s at the perfect heat range</li>
            <li> This product works great - heats up fast. Overall, I like it. I was looking for the crimp iron in lots of stores, and finally I decided to go online, and I found a good one at a perfect price :) Thanx</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my granddaughter. She has naturally curly hair and she wanted to see her hair straight for the first time. This Item was not strong enough for her curls, and it did not work as well on her hair as we thought. It works well on mine, but I have fine hair, and she has very thick, curly hair. Just not enough power for her hair type. Otherwise, a great product</li>
            <li> I bought this to crimp my 6 year olds hair it works ok but it takes forever about  half hour to get hot enough to actually work...... I guess you et what you pay for 16.99 @ Walgreens Drug Store..</li>
            <li> This hair tool was awful!  I had to send it back.  Did not work at all, unfortunately.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this item, but when i got it i plugged it in, and it didnt get hot AT ALL! this was a waste of 25.00 dollars.</li>
            <li> Took about an hour to crimp my daughter&#x27;s hair.  The unit does not get very hot, and seemed to lose it&#x27;s heat a few times throughout the crimping process.  The actual crimping section is so small, it takes a LONG time to get through medium/long hair.  I give it two stars instead of one only because it EVENTUALLY got the job done.  I&#x27;ll be buying a bigger / better quality crimper next time...</li>
            <li> i bought this for the spiral attachment and it came made of plastic, does not spiral at all.&lt;br /&gt;curling iron does get hot fast but have no luck using any of the attachments.</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter got one of these for Christmas, then decided to do her hair for grandma&#x27;s house... It did not get hot enough, the end of the flat iron piece pulled her hair out, and her hair became very frizzy and knotty. The only thing on there that works is the crimper, the curling iron doesn&#x27;t get hot, neither does the flat iron. I would suggest just to get a regular crimper, flat iron, and curling iron. I hope I helped!</li>
            <li> I never can use it... it didn´t work at all...</li>
            <li> Iron is not hot enough to style hair and my daughter&#x27;s hair is very fine - waste of my money</li>
            <li> I bought this about a year ago. I wa sooo excited to get this only to find out it was IMPOSSIABLE to curl my hair with this!&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY if your hair ISN&#x27;T THIN or else your hair might not curl!</li>
            <li> it barely heated up i tried crimping and it didnt crimp it when i tried using the curler part i gt waves instead of curls and it took forever to heat up and then when it did it wasnt very hot hell i even touched it without burning myself or it hurting or anything.my straightener i already have was hot and in less time too. im so sending this back. not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Curls and crimp does not hold. The mechanism only heats one side of the plate on the straightner and crimper.  Does not get very hot.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. It works alright but it takes forever to warm up. As someone else stated, there are only a low and high setting so if you are somewhere in between for heat, I don&#x27;t recommend this product. However, it will work for what I need it to!</li>
            <li> My mom used to crimp my hair when I was a kid and now that I have a daughter, I want to do it for her. This takes a long time to heat up, like 10 minutes, but once it is heated up it works like a charm. Ive had issues with straighteners where if you put it too close to your scalp it will burn you, this isn&#x27;t like that. The plate is well inside the plastic edging so it won&#x27;t burn my daughter if I touch her scalp with it. I flew through her whole head in 5 minutes and she loves it.</li>
            <li> For all the products within this product it doesn&#x27;t work well in any one of them.  Waste of my money and I&#x27;m not pleased with it at all.</li>
            <li> Just bought this at the dollar general. Waste of 15.00 and time. Doesn&#x27;t heat up enough to actually do anything. Sad i bought it, prolly going to end up in the trash.</li>
            <li> The item shipped quickly, but that&#x27;s about where the products usefulness ended. The girlfriend has wanted a crimper for some time now and so I found what I thought to be a good one on Amazon. Unfortunately I was mistaken.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter for xmas. She is still borrowing mine...these don&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li> this thing is horrible. it hardly heats up at all, the plates do not stay on when switching them, the whole thing is horrible. I am so mad I bought this. never bothered to go through the hassle of returning it.</li>
            <li> Even with the suggested heat-up time, it would never reach a temp high enough to create anything. Easy to use, and crimp plates were wide, if you do insist on buying. Too good to be true.</li>
            <li> Its a nice price, but it takes a really long time heat up and is not as effective as i would have guessed. I should have just bought a regular crimper.</li>
            <li> I was very excited about getting this because I had one as a kid. But unfortunatly this does not seem to get that hot. But it was for my 6 year old so she enjoyed it!</li>
            <li> I liked the 3 in one product for my granddaughter. Heats up fast and less clutter in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;Plus i love shopping online.</li>
            <li> This device does not work. It does absolutely nothing to hair. I was very disappointed in this purchase. Think twice before buying one.</li>
            <li> The straightner doesnt work at all and it takes about an hour and a half to get it fully heated. The crimper is nice if you want to crimp a few selections of your hair. The curling iron works just not very well due to the lack of heat. It is almost impossible to replace the striaghtner/crimper with the curling iron. Over all I wouldlnt really waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> I read the directions and it said &amp;#34;wait 15 mins to heat up&amp;#34; well it seems like more than 20 mins to heat up! Very upset with this product and I spent over $20 with this. Don&#x27;t get this if you don&#x27;t have much time to prep your hair.</li>
            <li> It is cheap, and it doesn&#x27;t even heat up</li>
            <li> I had to give one star to be able to post, but I really wanted to give zero. Horrible. Does not get warm enough to even straighten, curl, or crimp. Do not buy.</li>
            <li> I gave this rating because its a awesome curling iron. I like it. I would highly recommend to someone who buys it.</li>
            <li> Got for my nieces 12th birthday; she really wanted this styler b/c of different options. She enjoys using it on her mannequin heads; and seems to work well enough. Does take little bit to heat up- but I don&#x27;t mind that it doesn&#x27;t get crazy hot bc that makes it safer.</li>
            <li> This is light weight and didn&#x27;t seem to get hot enough. Would not crimp my daughter&#x27;s hair even when we tried tiny sections. Returned</li>
            <li> Tint, more for young girls with little hair.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all. It wouldn&#x27;t even turn on. And I couldn&#x27;t return it because I lost the original packaging.</li>
            <li> Works great! Used it for my daughter&#x27;s hair on picture day and now I will do her hair with the crimper when she is Cleopatra on Halloween.</li>
            <li> It doest warm up with the tool for straight hair, and the plate for it is too short, actually I believe is not good enough for the price i paid for it</li>
            <li> I  got this as a gift i was very excited about the features. However when i started to use it i realise it was not a good product at all . A waste of money</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, I have thick hair and it doesnt work</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron because it came with the crimp and curling option. My 12 year old wanted to learn how to style her hair different ways so for the price I figured this would be a great start. It takes a while to heat up but it does the job. This is not a profesional type iron so definitley have patience when using it. So far my daughter loves it because its easy to handle and since it has a bit of border around the metal plates she does not burn herself.</li>
            <li> Went to several stores looking for the old style crimper.  Couldn&#x27;t find any.  Went to Ebay, the prices were too high.  Ended up buying this.  It&#x27;s okay.  It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.  This was for a child...if it were for myself I probably would have bought higher heat model without the switch plates.  The waver is not great and haven&#x27;t used the straightener.  Don&#x27;t need it on her hair.</li>
            <li> my daughter is happy thats what matters ,,,, .... ,,,,, .... ,,,,, ...... ,,,,, ..... ,,,, ..... ,,,, .... ,,,</li>
            <li> Cheap quality and poorly made. The plates would not even heat up properly.I needed it for a special event and ended up throwing it away.</li>
            <li> i wish i could give this zero stars!</li>
            <li> The crimper would not crimp my daughter&#x27;s hair, it seemed like the styler would not get hot enough.</li>
            <li> Everything came nicely. Unfortunately this thing does not heat up well enough to really use it. I suppose it is good for a kid if you are worried about the heat.</li>
            <li> The picture and what I received are two different things.  What I really wanted was the 1/2\\&quot; spiral curling iron.   The item I received did not even have a spiral curling iron.   So I returned it !!!!</li>
            <li> So I begged my dad to get this for me (this is his daughter) and when I went to use it I was upset it wasn&#x27;t hot a all this stinks I cried and now my dad is angry such a waste of money</li>
            <li> This product seems really great at first glance.  You can straighten, crimp and curl!  Wow.  Also, the attachments are easy to replace.  But, the product doesn&#x27;t heat up hot enough and doesn&#x27;t keep the heat as you work through an entire head of hair. Looks great, but doesn&#x27;t keep the heat.</li>
            <li> Does not work...does not get hot. Got this for my little girl thinking this would be great box was I wrong.</li>
            <li> This picture is misleading.  The picture shows two separate metal pieces for the regular iron and the spiral iron. What I got was the other picture listed... a plastic piece that attaches to the regular iron for the spiral.  I can&#x27;t see how it is going to work.  My daughter just opened so not sure how it is going to work yet.</li>
            <li> I bought this a long time ago from k-mart and it didn&#x27;t work to well with my hair. I had to set the heat to high and leave whatever tool I was using for a long time. It didn&#x27;t really straighten or crimp my hair to well. It curled my hair fine but as I said I had to leave it there for a long time. Oh and it takes awhile to heat up. I reccommend finding a better brand possibly and not one that looks like a toy O_O</li>
            <li> Its okay. The best part of it is the curling part.</li>
            <li> This product is an example of you get what you pay for. It never got hot enough to actually straighten hair. I had to buy my daughter a much better one within a week. Do not waste your money on this CHEAP product.</li>
            <li> Placed first order, didn&#x27;t come with all attachments shown in second picture and description.&lt;br /&gt;Asked for replacement and second one came the same way.&lt;br /&gt;All attachments are not included,1/2-inch spiral head and round brush attachment is also 3/4 inches.</li>
            <li> The waves are more kinky than wavey.</li>
            <li> This iron sucks. It doesn&#x27;t get nearly hot enough. Mine went in the trash.</li>
            <li> Love the curling iorn hate the rest..no temp controle just low and high.. i probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend it and the krimper is super tiny</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I was looking for, but it dose not get hot enough to really crimp the hair well.</li>
            <li> I really hoped this would have worked, but unfortunately it was a let down. I have mildly curly and thick hair (but not coarse). I straighten my hair almost daily. I tried all the tools and still hated it! It doesn&#x27;t even get hot, even when left for about 10 minutes. The straightener SUCKS! The crimper is even worse...no matter how long you hold it, how small the section of hair, or even the amount of hairspray put in before using it....it wouldn&#x27;t do the job...just wave it the tiniest....making it look like my natural hair anyway. The curlers aren&#x27;t impressing either. Seriously, I&#x27;m better off using my mother&#x27;s hair tools from the 80s.....    I would throw this thing out, but my mother bought me this for Christmas only a couple months ago.</li>
            <li> It doesnt heat up its defective flat iron from conair if i knew how to send it back i would gladly . I dnt recommend anyone to buy it , its a waste of money.</li>
            <li> the straightener dose not work! the crimper dose and so dose the curling iron, i use my curler everday.. but just threw rhe straightener part awa!</li>
            <li> Purchased for 13 year old girl and it works ok. She likes it and that&#x27;s all that matters to her. I as an adult would not use or purchase for myself .It doesn&#x27;t get extremely hot or crimp all that well but You get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> This product is a malfunction to begin with who ever thinks this stupid product works is not smart and should be alive</li>
            <li> I love this hair presser, curler thinger!  I used it a few times, and then I cut my hair.  When I used the styler, I was delighted by the easy way this product could be used.  Conair&#x27;s 3-in-1 is quite durable:  I know.  I dropped it a million times, and it still works!  This item is inexpensive and well worth what I paid for it ten times over.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and we were both disappointed. It has hardly any heat, and you can only crimp a very small amount of hair. I should have know that it was to good to be true. Great price, perhaps could for people with very fine thin hair.</li>
            <li> Product is okay. The flat iron does not get warm enough to straighten my hair, so I have it to my daughter.</li>
            <li> I wish I were able to give this product a negative rating. I purchased this crimping iron to do my daughter&#x27;s hair for a show she had to perform in. It never got hot and I had it on for over an hour. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS HOT IRON!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this!  Which makes the 80 s child in me sooooo happy.  It does take a while for it to get hot.  My 9 year old seems to be able to handle it pretty well.  She has used it twice since Christmas and no burns so far.  She has only used the crimper.  As of now, the flat iron, nor the curling iron have been used.  Pretty simple for her to change out the pieces though.  Totally Rad!</li>
            <li> for the record, this is my fathers account. i am in fact female i promise.&lt;br /&gt;  Anywho, this product is just, okay. in order to get any use out of the flat iron/crimper you&#x27;ve got to hold the clamp shut with your free hand, which is awkward and time consuming.&lt;br /&gt;  the curling iron worrks fairly well, but it does leave an un-flattering crease or dent if you will, at the bottom of the curl. which obviously is not ideal.&lt;br /&gt;  ALSO. THIS IS KEY. if you intend to use this product AT ALL. youre going to want to give it 10 minutes MINIMUM heat up time.&lt;br /&gt; honestly. overall the product sort of sucks.&lt;br /&gt;  though i am incredibly cheap, so im making it work, and ive grown to like it.&lt;br /&gt;now though, i suppose you can make an informed choice!</li>
            <li> Everything was timely and as advertised. My daughter was very happy to receive this gift. I was pleased with the quick shipment of this item</li>
            <li> Only one side of the unit gets hot. So the curling iron works. The straightener and crimper heats up fast but after a couple pieces of hair the side not receiving heat will cool down and the tool becomes useless. It causes frizz and doesn&#x27;t crimp AT ALL. Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I ORDERED THIS CONAIR 3-IN1 STYLE SET AND NVR GOT IT! WUT A WASTE OF MONEY!! I DONT RECOMEND GETTING THIS!</li>
            <li> In this case you definatly get more then you pay for I got this very cheap and so far am completely satisfied it is my first curling iorn/straightner and it seems to work very well. I am glad I bought this product it does what it is supposed to and is very cheaply priced it isn&#x27;t the best quality but for the price you can&#x27;t beat it. If you haven&#x27;t ever had a straightener or curler and want to try it without spending 100 bucks this one is good.</li>
            <li> I am highly disappointed in this set.  I bought it as a gift for my daughter who has been wanting one forever.  She opened this up, plugged it in and waited about 10 minutes thinking it would heat up hot enough to crimp her hair.  She tried it and it did hardly anything.  I checked the iron and It was barely warm.  I was actually able to hold on to the plates that should have been hot with ease.  I wish I would have read the reviews before buying this thing... Worthless.  I am happy that Amazon has a good return policy :)  Yeah Amazon!  I am off to look for a REAL crimper LOL</li>
            <li> great product wife loves it. Came in quickly will and exactly what she seen on the web site. Will order again in the future from this company</li>
            <li> worst hair styler i&#x27;ve ever bought, it takes FOREVER to heat up and the plates are so little doesn&#x27;t work for thick hair like mine.</li>
            <li> Very pleased. Giving this as a Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> i got this for a friend who was reminiscing on the days of crimped hair, and was nervous at first reading all the reviews saying it didn&#x27;t warm up, but my friend loves it and says it works perfectly! :)</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t get hot enough to crimp my 3 year old thin hair! Won&#x27;t get hot at all! Total waste of money!</li>
            <li> i bought this for my daughter! she is only 8 but i am a hairdresser and she is always very excited about hair :)</li>
            <li> I like this product. It comes with a curler, a crimper, and a straightener! Its amazing that it can do many things for one object</li>
            <li> I bought this product primarily for straightening my hair (my hair is naturally just slightly wavy).  I found that it did this very poorly.  In fact, I purchased a new straightener within a week of this one.  However, my friend bought the same item and used it for curling, waving, and some crimping.  It does a good job of this, especially given the price.  Overall, definitely a good product for the price, however, if your main use is going to be straightening I would recommend searching for a new product (I have found that a ceramic straightener by Ceramix has been a terrific investment).</li>
            <li> Product works okay, it just doesnt get hot enough to perform each function well. It would be fine for a child, or someone to \\&quot;practice\\&quot; doing hair.</li>
            <li> I agree with the reviews that it just doesn&#x27;t get hot enough. Even when I leave it on for much longer than I should need to, it just barely crimps. Pretty bummed :(</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this item to anyone. It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.and the crimping iron part does not work. It does switch to a curling iron which I do use. But I had mainly bought it for the crimping part. So yeah I was disapointed.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to discover that it came with a different attachment that also curled. Great value for the price!</li>
            <li> We purchased this for our daughter who is in her teens. She is happy with the item so far. It works as it should so far. I would recommend it to others</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter. She loves it.</li>
            <li> this was a returned product.</li>
            <li> the reason why I gave it 2 stars instead of 5 is because it only gets barely warm. but this thing is so cool. I was really surprised when I got it so fast, and when I opened the box I thought I was just ordering a crimper but instead it came with a crimper, curling iron and straightening plates I was so excited I should have read more details about this package before I ordered it but I am not complaining this was great!</li>
            <li> Horrible! Never worked! Didn&#x27;t get hot, nothing! Got it for my 12 year old and it sucked! Turned on but never got hot!</li>
            <li> Granddaughter loves it</li>
            <li> This curler should be marked as a toy.  It doesn&#x27;t heat up and doesn&#x27;t curl.  It&#x27;s more like a play curling iron.</li>
            <li> My mom bought me this because I love styling my hair in various was and have been looking for a crimper for a long time. This product didn&#x27;t totally suck, but you get what you pay for. The plastic on the straightener/crimper heads was very cheap. The curler worked fine I guess, but the socket used to plug in the heads broke fairly easily. My hair is pretty hard to style with heat anyway due to natural curl, so don&#x27;t get this if that&#x27;s your situation. The waves from the crimper didn&#x27;t last longer than an hour (if that) in my hair. Great idea in theory, but it has a long way to go.</li>
            <li> Seems like it takes A while to heat up, the crimper was a little to small for my hair,  like the options. I love the curling iron attachment,  that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girls as a Christmas gift..they didn&#x27;t get around to using it till a few weeks ago..the curling iron will heat up and work fine the but the crimper/staightner would not even heat up...very disappointed because that was the main reason I got this particular one was for the crimper/straightner</li>
            <li> This is for kids.  It does not heat up enough to make a curl.  Should have known by the price.  Going to give it to my 12 year old niece.</li>
            <li> The concept of this 3-in-1 set is a great idea, but this particular design works so poorly that it&#x27;s not even worth fighting with to use.  It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to actually straighten or curl your hair, and so is basically useless.</li>
            <li> I got this to use it as a crimper.  When I got it, I was excited to see how it worked.  After I plugged it in, I forgot about it so when I went to use it, it had been heating up for about 45 minutes.  It worked pretty well this time, so I thought it was a good product.  However, now when I wake up in the morning, I don&#x27;t have 45 minutes to wait for it to heat up.  It hardly crimps my hair at all, even when I let it heat up for 30 minutes.  Also, it is made of really cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, so for this not to get hot enough for me is pretty bad.  I&#x27;m an 80&#x27;s girl, so you can imagine how disappointed I was that it didn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> Learning how to work it is the biggest thing, but it been a good little tool.  Easy to transport too.  I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> THis is the perfect gift for any fashion diva 9 year old at an awesome price. SHe is sure to love it</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this item to anyone.  I received this item, and I was very excited to use it.  I opened the package, and plugged the crimper part to it first plugged it up, and it didn&#x27;t work!  I was shocked!  I then plugged the curler part to it, &amp; it did not work.  I opened up the crimper, and realized the part that I needed to heat it up was missing for the crimper.  I was very upset!  I would not reccomend it you would b better off paying a good bit money for a nice one that will work than a one that want work at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this formy 12 &amp; 13 year old and they have not said anything about it. I like the different aattachments it came with. A&#x27;ll in one is perfect!</li>
            <li> I ordered this to my bank in exchange for \\&quot;points\\&quot;. When I got it, it reminded me of the shinny purple plastic stuff I used to get from Santa when i was a little girl. Then I plugged it and I thought there was some problem with the cord, as it only heated a little ( I could touch the plates without burning myself after 20 minutes plugged)... so I got to the conclusion that it was a perfect thing to buy for a little girl that wants to play to the saloon being a safe toy... NOT for real use, absolutely not worth even the points...</li>
            <li> I need a new straighter and I was looking into buying a crimper. I got a $20 gift card for my birthday so I figured I don&#x27;t really need the Curling iron but it can&#x27;t hurt to have an extra. I bought this product and boy was I upset. It takes FOREVER to heat up. I have to like wait 30 minutes before it&#x27;s hot enough to do anything to my hair. Straightener, Sucks! Didn&#x27;t do a dang thing. My hair is wavy and it didn&#x27;t straighten my hair at all. The crimper works but with it taking forever to heat up and on top of that you have to hold the crimper there for like 5 minutes it&#x27;s just to time consuming so I never use it.&lt;br /&gt;As for the curling iron. WORKS AMAZING! aside from the time it takes to heat up. THe curling iron works great. I just own 4 perfectly good working curling irons and had no need for another one. I don&#x27;t recommend this product unless you want a curling iron or have 2 hours to crimp your hair in the morning. But even then you could by a 20$ curling iron or crimper that heats up just as fast and you wont be so time consuming.&lt;br /&gt;I actually only bought this becuase it had some great reviews saying it heats up fast and crimps great and I thought $16 works great and I get three styliong tools thats a steal. But, I&#x27;m confused on weather I got the right product because this thing did nothing like the reviews said..</li>
            <li> Curling iron works great! Crimper and straightening iron don&#x27;t seem to get tight enough on the hair to straighten or crimp very well.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE!!! DON NOT BUY!!</li>
            <li> I really wanted a curler that would put waves in my hair but this product is a little more difficult to use probably because I&#x27;m still not sure what I&#x27;m doing. If you do, I think this would be a good buy, otherwise, get something a little easier.</li>
            <li> I love that it has reversible plates for crimping and flat ironing, its also detachable for the included curling iron too. 3 in 1. Bought for my 13 yr old, she loves it.</li>
            <li> It took forever for this to warm up and when it did, it didn&#x27;t crimp at all.  I may give it another try...my daughter was so excited to get this but disappointed that it didn&#x27;t make her hair wavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll most likely be returning it if they let me.  The packaging is the plastic kind you actually have to take scissors and cut into.  No salvaging the packaging on this one!</li>
            <li> Aside from worrying about my house burning down, this seems to do the trick into getting a messy-headed 1 year old interested in brushing and styling her hair.  There are 3 interchangable attachments; the crimper, the curling iron and the flat iron.  Quick heat up and doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to singe delicate kid hair.  It is not the cadillac of styling tools but good for travel and you need 3 tools or for the kid who is finding her style.</li>
            <li> I love that this is three tools in one. However the heating area is rather small and the product seems to take a while to heat enough to do much.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is the worst I have ever purchased and was very happy to return it.  It was a waste of time to even turn on.  The curler does not get hot, no, it does not even warm up.  My 6yr old daughter touched it and she thought it was off!!!.  Complete waste of money and time.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li> I like it just wished it would get hotter faster like my older ones. It is nice that it was the three options. The crimping looks so cool.</li>
            <li> When crimping the hair you have to sqeeze the barrel to get it to work. Does not heat up very well.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the money or the time!</li>
