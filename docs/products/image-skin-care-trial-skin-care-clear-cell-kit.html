    <ol>
            <li>The best skincare ever!</li>
            <li>Loved these products!!</li>
            <li>This kit is best for oily skin.</li>
            <li>The trial kit is the perfect size for an overnight visit or for any vacation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product to try and the trial sizes are perfect to see if it&#x27;s for you!</li>
            <li>great.  </li>
            <li>She loved it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Wanted to be nice and contacted the seller, she promised to send me a substitution but never has.</li>
            <li>for the product, I used it before and really liked it, so I do recommend the product.</li>
            <li>I really liked the anti-aging syrum and the moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>and I think that&#x27;s really their best product.</li>
            <li>Love this product line</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve been able to use it over time and just moisturize to counter-act some of the drying effects from the washes.</li>
            <li>The mask works great as a spot treatment but you will peel and the mattifier absorbs oil very well.</li>
            <li>Tried to use it anyway and got a strong allergy.</li>
            <li>perhaps an allergic reaction or perhaps just way too strong for my face?</li>
            <li>The Image Skincare product line is a fantastic line.  </li>
            <li>but I believe it is worth it!</li>
            <li>I will just go to my spa to make sure I get the real stuff</li>
            <li>1/4 of a ounce is not enough to know if the product is good for you or not for you.</li>
            <li>To buy the full sized products in the kit will run you about $120</li>
            <li>After suffering from problematic skin, I can honestly say this product has completely cleared up my skin.</li>
            <li>Her face cleared up quickly.</li>
            <li>if you start to peel use more of the vital c and don&#x27;t rub it in all the way.</li>
            <li>the products feel great on my skin, only drawback is not enough in the trail kit!  </li>
            <li>Kind of harsh to your skin at first,</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really care for the matte moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I think that $14.00 is over priced for how much product you are getting.</li>
            <li>I really, really like this stuff</li>
            <li>I tried lots of stuff for my breakouts and nothing seemed to much until I tried this kit.</li>
            <li>It really works on your pimples, but dries out your skin and makes it flaky if you put on too much.</li>
            <li>The description of the product did not say how much product was in the trial kit.</li>
            <li>Haha</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who wants clearer, healthier looking skin.</li>
            <li>I normally use the hydrating cleanser by Image</li>
            <li>Every product in this kit is worth buying individually and its not harsh like proactive.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and relaxed.</li>
            <li>skin is clear, soft, supple and I get tons of compliments.</li>
            <li>Other than adding more water to my daily routine, this is the only thing I have changed.</li>
            <li>it was a yellow color and smelled different than the full size bottle I ordered later on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything from proactiv to Clinique and this is the only thing that has cleared my adult acne!</li>
            <li>Definitely helped clear up my face within a week or two</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get to use any of the samples except two that were actually sealed and they seemed to work ok but not great.</li>
            <li>Clear Cell works to dry up pimples fast and you only need to dab a little of the product on the pimple.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The best skincare ever! I&#x27;ve tried everything from proactiv to Clinique and this is the only thing that has cleared my adult acne! I will never use anything else!</li>
            <li> Loved these products!! Definitely helped clear up my face within a week or two and I&#x27;ve bought the bigger sizes of them now.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this from a spa so I know what to expect. 1 of the items did not have the inner seal and the consistency of it was odd. The medicated acne lotion was grainy and watery and did not have a seal like the other items  so I tossed it. The medicated cleanser and masque seemed legit. I will just go to my spa to make sure I get the real stuff</li>
            <li> Love this product line</li>
            <li> Two of the sample jars in this pack were already open and had spilled all over everything. I didn&#x27;t get to use any of the samples except two that were actually sealed and they seemed to work ok but not great. Not worth the cost in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a hard time with my skin and image skincare clear cell is the only product I&#x27;ve seen legit results from. Kind of harsh to your skin at first, but I&#x27;ve been able to use it over time and just moisturize to counter-act some of the drying effects from the washes. Great product to try and the trial sizes are perfect to see if it&#x27;s for you!</li>
            <li> the products feel great on my skin, only drawback is not enough in the trail kit!  I didn&#x27;t really care for the matte moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter. She loved it. Her face cleared up quickly. As a result I bought the regular size.</li>
            <li> You are get 1/4 ounce in each of the products. The picture in the listing is the size that you are getting all the products in, even the face wash. 1/4 of a ounce is not enough to know if the product is good for you or not for you. I feel like you need a couple of washes to determine if the product is going to workout. I think that $14.00 is over priced for how much product you are getting.</li>
            <li> Received faulty product, the cremes looked like cottage cheese, the gel was crystallized. Tried to use it anyway and got a strong allergy. It looks like it was stored wrong, frozen or something. Wanted to be nice and contacted the seller, she promised to send me a substitution but never has. Don&#x27;t recommend the seller.&lt;br /&gt;As for the product, I used it before and really liked it, so I do recommend the product.</li>
            <li> I really, really like this stuff but I haven&#x27;t been using it for the recommended 90 days yet so I only gave it 4 stars. To buy the full sized products in the kit will run you about $120 but I believe it is worth it! I tried lots of stuff for my breakouts and nothing seemed to much until I tried this kit. Some products only last a week and some last a few weeks so I bought 3 kits altogether and I&#x27;m very pleased. The mask works great as a spot treatment but you will peel and the mattifier absorbs oil very well. Tip: if you start to peel use more of the vital c and don&#x27;t rub it in all the way. This kit is best for oily skin.</li>
            <li> Use this sparingly.  It really works on your pimples, but dries out your skin and makes it flaky if you put on too much.</li>
            <li> I like this product as a means of testing a lot of this company&#x27;s products at once. However, the masque came completely dried out and unusable.  The salicylic cleanser also made my entire face very red- perhaps an allergic reaction or perhaps just way too strong for my face? I&#x27;m not sure. I really liked the anti-aging syrum and the moisturizer.  I normally use the hydrating cleanser by Image and I think that&#x27;s really their best product.</li>
            <li> I pruchased this for my son and it worked. great.  A fix for his acne when used properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The description of the product did not say how much product was in the trial kit. It was a very small amount and after buying the larger size of each product I noticed that the trial kit was probably expired or old, expecially the acne lotion it was a yellow color and smelled different than the full size bottle I ordered later on. I would not have ordered the trial kit if I had known that I would only get enough product to last me a week,</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I works wonders and I like that it&#x27;s not a system but they give you a system to use that works well with or without being I sync with it. Every product in this kit is worth buying individually and its not harsh like proactive.  My skin feels soft and relaxed. No burning here...sorry Proactive.  Haha</li>
            <li> The Image Skincare product line is a fantastic line.  Clear Cell works to dry up pimples fast and you only need to dab a little of the product on the pimple.</li>
            <li> After suffering from problematic skin, I can honestly say this product has completely cleared up my skin. I love it! The trial kit is the perfect size for an overnight visit or for any vacation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is clear, soft, supple and I get tons of compliments. Other than adding more water to my daily routine, this is the only thing I have changed. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who wants clearer, healthier looking skin.</li>
