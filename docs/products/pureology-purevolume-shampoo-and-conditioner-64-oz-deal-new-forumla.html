            <li>it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>There were so many good reviews for this product</li>
            <li>The two bottles were not protected in any effective way.  </li>
            <li>I see a holistic doctor who tested it and it tested very very strong with applied kinesiology.  </li>
            <li>I have copper colored hair and Pureology is the best shampoo I have used so far for color retention.  </li>
            <li>I love these products.  </li>
            <li>It pays to order in bulk, it is so much more affordable than buying in the salon.</li>
            <li>I love this hair product -</li>
            <li>I have been using this product off &amp; on for several years, always looking for the best deals.</li>
            <li>Looks healthy.  </li>
            <li>Gentle on hair and fragrant with great conditioner.</li>
            <li>My hair has more volume and looks/feels healthier.</li>
            <li>Satisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>I have fine wavy color treated hair</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite shampoo &amp; conditioner!</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine, straight, no texture &amp; this shampoo, conditioner actually gives great fullness but leaves your hair so healthy looking.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product for your hair</li>
            <li>Buying in bulk is also a great deal and you actually save about $2.50/oz.  </li>
            <li>It worries me to think that I may not have gotten genuine products.</li>
            <li>I was using cheap products, but Pureology is much much better- worth the cost.</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner is great for my extremely fine hair--it doesn&#x27;t weigh to down or cause me to have static in the winter time.  </li>
            <li>Not only is it rich and creamy, but it is good for your hair.  </li>
            <li>I stays full until you wash it out.  </li>
            <li>I want a full refund,  and I do not beklieve the the manufactures&#x27; want their product represented in this manner.  </li>
            <li>(I have naturally curly hair, which is great in humidity but which has unmanageable waves in desert air (where I live).</li>
            <li>Received this quick, packaged with tape over lids just in case.  </li>
            <li>and I am super picky.  </li>
            <li>With Pureology, my hair is healthy, soft, easy to work with or not, and looks much fuller</li>
            <li>The large bottles are nice to reduce my cost per ounce, and I simply transfer product from these huge bottles to smaller, more manageable ones.</li>
            <li>I wish I had had it for my first 60 years.</li>
            <li>This product was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Lesson learned... Never buy in bulk unless you first try a sample size.</li>
            <li>It is time to reorder and will be looking for a good deal in a few days.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very fine; many think my hair is thick and luxurious.  </li>
            <li>Save your money for better products though really anymore the options are running low.</li>
            <li>my hair feel and smell amazing but not worth the irritation.</li>
            <li>I tend to change brands a lot with most products, but have stuck with Pureology for a long time now.</li>
            <li>Product is pure and as labeled.  </li>
            <li>I have not tried the new pureology formulation that has many mixed reviews.</li>
            <li>When I found them on here and realized how much cheaper it was...</li>
            <li>and this is a gentle hair care product.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery of product.  </li>
            <li>so really it&#x27;s like getting salon quality hair care that is not toxic for the price of the $10 store bought bottles.  </li>
            <li>I also really like this bulk size/pricing bc</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and it is highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Lots of dandruff and very itchy scalp.  </li>
            <li>I use it now and then just because I paid so much for it</li>
            <li>Looks like the real thing.</li>
            <li>Any assistance you can give will be greatly appreciated in resolving this matter.  </li>
            <li>I was sent a smaller size of the exact same product (Pureology Pure Volume Conditioner) by a friend who is a haircareprofessional and has beenusing the product for many years.</li>
            <li>, I highly recommend to anyone with curly or straight hair.</li>
            <li>It helps keep my deep color true by protecting my hair like sunscreen protects my skin.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t have spent so much time with straighteners and huge rollers and any number of tools to control my hair.</li>
            <li>Would have only liked the shampoo to not be as pink colored as it was</li>
            <li>Pureology is worth the price because it gives me and my several friends who use it a voluptuous head of hair with body.</li>
            <li>The product fit  extremely tightly  due to the size box that was used (presumably to save on shipping costs)  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend for peoplw with fine hair that want a little volume.</li>
            <li>The price is higher than store brands, but you just need a tiny bit to work throughout your hair</li>
            <li>I was terribly disappointed in this shampoo and conditioner after hearing nothing but the greatest praise for it.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft, and my fine hair doesn&#x27;t feel weighed down.</li>
            <li>This claims to be natural</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to color my hair as frequently as I had been.</li>
            <li>This is the old formulation which I like a lot.</li>
            <li>It falls to my shoulders, is shiny, soft and blows with the wind</li>
            <li>The package was nearly torn apart when it arrived at my office.  </li>
            <li>of the the labels had been intentionally defaced by completely scatching off the information regarding the expiration date or a manufacturing date or pehaps</li>
            <li>The contents are obviously old.  </li>
            <li>This company is clearly dumping their old sock,  perhaps going out of business or losing money or for whatever reason,  </li>
            <li>I wil not waste my time with cheats and liars.</li>
            <li>This was the firm time using this seller and the shampoo I received wasn&#x27;t the same that I have bought for many years.  </li>
            <li>No other professional quality shampoo I purchase does this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard that after a few weeks it is advisable to use a good standard shampoo to release the Pureology for a few days.  </li>
            <li>I usually only use natural products.  </li>
            <li>the bottle would last for a couple years (had I not left it in the bath with my 3 yr old)</li>
            <li>It is super expensive yet is more like a drug store quality shampoo that leaves my hair limp (where&#x27;s the volume) and oily.</li>
            <li>I read some general reviews about the authenticity of Pureology products that are purchased outside of salons.</li>
            <li>Two very smaill &amp;#34;Airplus&amp;#34; pillows were place in between the handle portions of the bottles,  where the bottles do not touch and cannot shift because the bottom portions of the bottle were so tightly packed the box bulged until it ripped along a seam.  </li>

            <li> It should last a long time because it&#x27;s so concentrated</li>

            <li> isn’t harsh on our hair leaves my hair soft and big plus</li>
            <li> I weighed the containers containing products and thought it was strange that although both shampoo and conditioner are supposed to be 64 oz.</li>
            <li> I was orginally paying my hairdresser every other month to purchase the smaller bottles of shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> (I have a lot of hair!), so the bottle lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling dry</li>
            <li> My color is a dark cherry red and this product is a life saver.</li>
            <li> This is a must have for difficult colors like blue-reds that fade quickly.</li>
            <li> I have not sent feedback or other correspondence to the seller,  </li>
            <li> the conditioner weighed considerably less.</li>
            <li> and it felt slimey and not clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately it was accepted by our operations manager and subsequently set aside for me on a padded leather office chair.  </li>
            <li> Pair it up with the Pureology ColourMAX Antifade Complex.</li>
            <li> So I have what seems like an endless supy of crappie shampoo and conditioner in jugs that are a bit difficult to handle in the shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with the product at all.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my scalp doesn&#x27;t agree with this product.</li>
            <li> Horrible seller experience.</li>

When rinsing my hair, it felt matted to the point I couldn&#x27;t run my fingers through it to get a rinse and it felt slimey and not clean feeling.  I emailed the seller and never received a response.  Threw it all away and was out over $150!!!  Horrible seller experience.</li>
            <li> Wonderful!  It&#x27;s the best hair product I&#x27;ve used a d the bottle would last for a couple years (had I not left it in the bath with my 3 yr old)</li>
            <li> Pureology is a wonderful product. I don&#x27;t have to color my hair as frequently as I had been. With Pureology, my hair is healthy, soft, easy to work with or not, and looks much fuller (It&#x27;s thinning with age, drat). I wish I had had it for my first 60 years. I wouldn&#x27;t have spent so much time with straighteners and huge rollers and any number of tools to control my hair. (I have naturally curly hair, which is great in humidity but which has unmanageable waves in desert air (where I live). Also, I am very happy with the vendor.</li>
            <li> I have not tried the new pureology formulation that has many mixed reviews. This is the old formulation which I like a lot. It works well for my hair, thickening and adding volume. I also really like this bulk size/pricing bc it actually makes pureology affordable.</li>
            <li> My color is a dark cherry red and this product is a life saver. It helps keep my deep color true by protecting my hair like sunscreen protects my skin. This is a must have for difficult colors like blue-reds that fade quickly. Pair it up with the Pureology ColourMAX Antifade Complex.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and it is highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product off &amp; on for several years, always looking for the best deals. My hair is very fine, straight, no texture &amp; this shampoo, conditioner actually gives great fullness but leaves your hair so healthy looking. Love the scent too! This is my absolute favorite shampoo &amp; conditioner!</li>
            <li> Product shipped in a timely fashion.  Product came as described.  Fantastic product for your hair, I highly recommend to anyone with curly or straight hair.</li>
            <li> and my husband loves to run his hands through it!!  I get rave reviews on my hair all the time and I&#x27;m no spring chick.  It falls to my shoulders, is shiny, soft and blows with the wind and --- I&#x27;ve been coloring it for about 40 years.  Looks healthy.  I have lots of hair but it&#x27;s very fine; many think my hair is thick and luxurious.  I think these products help.  Buying in bulk is also a great deal and you actually save about $2.50/oz.  Good all around!</li>
            <li> Gentle on hair and fragrant with great conditioner. Would have only liked the shampoo to not be as pink colored as it was</li>
            <li> If you have silky-limp hair....this is the product for you!  Pureology is worth the price because it gives me and my several friends who use it a voluptuous head of hair with body. I stays full until you wash it out.  I&#x27;ve heard that after a few weeks it is advisable to use a good standard shampoo to release the Pureology for a few days.  Then start again.</li>
            <li> The products arrived promptly and fairly well packaged. I read some general reviews about the authenticity of Pureology products that are purchased outside of salons. It worries me to think that I may not have gotten genuine products. I will definitely take a sample and compare to the products offered in salons. I weighed the containers containing products and thought it was strange that although both shampoo and conditioner are supposed to be 64 oz. the conditioner weighed considerably less.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly as described.  I would order again from the seller.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my scalp doesn&#x27;t agree with this product. Lots of dandruff and very itchy scalp.  I wish I sampled it before buying. There were so many good reviews for this product so I didn&#x27;t bother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made my hair feel and smell amazing but not worth the irritation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with the product at all. I have color treated hair and the shampoo leaves it feeling brittle and stripped. The conditioner doesn&#x27;t seem to rehydrate or moisturize the hair. I use it now and then just because I paid so much for it I feel I can just throw it away.  To add insult to I jury, I ordered the pump to go with and never received it. So I have what seems like an endless supy of crappie shampoo and conditioner in jugs that are a bit difficult to handle in the shower. Lesson learned... Never buy in bulk unless you first try a sample size.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling dry</li>
            <li> My hair has more volume and looks/feels healthier. I was using cheap products, but Pureology is much much better- worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Shipped on time. Product was what we ordered. Would order again in future. Satisfied with this product.  Looks like the real thing.</li>
            <li> me hubby and the kids use pureology its smells great isn’t harsh on our hair leaves my hair soft and big plus is the shampoo is concentrated! love it</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo and condition EVER! It is time to reorder and will be looking for a good deal in a few days.</li>
            <li> These people are thieves.  They have misrepresented what they are selling.  The package was nearly torn apart when it arrived at my office.  I would not have accepted it,  but unfortunately it was accepted by our operations manager and subsequently set aside for me on a padded leather office chair.  The two bottles were not protected in any effective way.  Two very smaill &amp;#34;Airplus&amp;#34; pillows were place in between the handle portions of the bottles,  where the bottles do not touch and cannot shift because the bottom portions of the bottle were so tightly packed the box bulged until it ripped along a seam.  The product fit  extremely tightly  due to the size box that was used (presumably to save on shipping costs)  It was a flat rate box, the &amp;#34;If it fits it ships&amp;#34;  provided by the USPS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both of the the labels had been intentionally defaced by completely scatching off the information regarding the expiration date or a manufacturing date or pehaps a&amp;#34;Use by&amp;#34; date.  The contents are obviously old.  I was sent a smaller size of the exact same product (Pureology Pure Volume Conditioner) by a friend who is a haircareprofessional and has beenusing the product for many years. This company is clearly dumping their old sock,  perhaps going out of business or losing money or for whatever reason,  feel it O.K.  to use Amazon.com to defraud people.  I am contacting my credit card compaly as well as the actual manufaturer.  I want a full refund,  and I do not beklieve the the manufactures&#x27; want their product represented in this manner.  Any assistance you can give will be greatly appreciated in resolving this matter.  I have not sent feedback or other correspondence to the seller,  I wil not waste my time with cheats and liars.</li>
            <li> Not only is it rich and creamy, but it is good for your hair.  The fragrance is heavenly.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I was terribly disappointed in this shampoo and conditioner after hearing nothing but the greatest praise for it. It is super expensive yet is more like a drug store quality shampoo that leaves my hair limp (where&#x27;s the volume) and oily. No other professional quality shampoo I purchase does this. It also is over poweringly fragrant and leaves my scalp feeling burned and irritated. Save your money for better products though really anymore the options are running low.</li>
