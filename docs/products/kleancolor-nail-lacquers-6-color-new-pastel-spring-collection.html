            <li>The really good.</li>

            <li>Good opacity.</li>
            <li>I know it was a good price, but</li>
            <li>When I saw these polishes, I loved the colors since I have been looking for good pastels.</li>
            <li>but then i read some reviews saying it was actually good</li>
            <li>So that&#x27;s GOOD.</li>
            <li>The polish is good.</li>
            <li>price was good for this bargain.</li>
            <li>Good nail polish for the price &amp; the colors show well with two coats.</li>
            <li>Good nail polish.</li>
            <li>Go for good quality polishes not Kleancolor.</li>
            <li>Good things:  </li>
            <li>and she loved them.</li>
            <li>good buy</li>
            <li>I bought this set because I loved the colors.  </li>

            <li>It then chips on almost every nail by the end of the day, even with a good topcoat.</li>
            <li>Cute colors, good value for the price!</li>
            <li>i gave this a two star rating instead of one because the colors are awesome and look great for the first day or so.</li>
            <li>I love that these came and how beautiful they are.</li>
            <li>These colors are true to the pictures and perfect for Spring.  </li>
            <li>for the most part I mix the two pink/purple pastel colors on one nail and it turns out beautifully.</li>
            <li>I love the colors and it applies beautifully.</li>
            <li>i have so many beautiful colors &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>I am VERY pleased with the colour~! :)</li>
            <li>All my colours are beautiful and soft and I love them!!!!</li>
            <li>While I will continue to wear the polish because I love the colors (they work great for spring/summer), it&#x27;s a hassle to have to take off &amp; re-apply the color every day.</li>
            <li>But this purple is still very lovely</li>
            <li>The quality is great and applies on smoothly!</li>
            <li>Before ordering this nail polish I read most of the reviews and thought I was getting a great deal.</li>
            <li>This was a very cute nail polish</li>
            <li>they have good coverage and are nice and popping in color.</li>
            <li>Despite that issue, the product is nice, the brushes are good size, and the thickness is about medium, so it won&#x27;t run all over the place.</li>
            <li>Nice polish, good price</li>
            <li>Really nice color and good nail polish</li>

            <li>so happy with this purchase colors are so pigmented and the polish doesn&#x27;t smell as strong as others polishes do</li>
            <li>Amazing .</li>
            <li>The colors are great but the product seems to be cheap.</li>

            <li>I love the bright colors.</li>
            <li>the color range an the diffrents kinds its amazing.</li>
            <li>i just started using these colors and they are amazing</li>
            <li>Surprisingly nice colors.</li>
            <li>Nice colors,</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t turn out as nice as the rest.</li>
            <li>Takes about three coats to cover nicely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is so good price too:)</li>
            <li>The color is nice</li>
            <li>or any kind of gift.</li>

            <li>I really liked the colors.</li>
            <li>You get all the colors and they&#x27;re all good quality :-)</li>
            <li>The colours are just what i like and they have a nice shine.</li>
            <li>the nail polish sticky and comes in clumps and does not apply nicely</li>
            <li>nice surprise</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s what you pay for, and the colors are nice.</li>
            <li>When painting your nails they go on nicely</li>

            <li>love light orange one that color is so beautiful</li>
            <li>Some of the polishes were kind of clumpy and it chips very easily.</li>
            <li>I love pastel colors and these are very cute.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how these polishes would be, but I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li>the colors aren&#x27;t as vibrant as they look, I found if you pair this with their holo counterparts by kleancolor, they do look very nice for springy colors!</li>
            <li>Use in well-ventilated area - they have a VERY strong smell.</li>
            <li>They smell very strong too.</li>
            <li>Chips very easily.</li>
            <li>However they chipped very easily.</li>
            <li>Pretty good product!</li>
            <li>Goes on great, a pretty good polish. :)</li>

            <li>I was so pleased with this.</li>
            <li>However the quality is great and the formula is not thin or runny.</li>
            <li>Love this set.  </li>
            <li>Some of the colors applied better than others.</li>
            <li>But a cute variety of tones.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THE COLORS.</li>
            <li>, MAYBE USING TOP COAT WILL STAY ON LONGER</li>
            <li>glad I didn&#x27;t get any more from this brand.</li>
            <li>I plan to order more sets.  </li>
            <li>was not as impressed when I actually used them.</li>
            <li>The colors are still great in person, but I don&#x27;t see using them very often because of the problems with application.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE the colors the service was AAA+++</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m okay with that.</li>

            <li>Im planning on buying more.</li>
            <li>Thank you love these colors</li>
            <li>My grand niece just loves to pant her finger nails like a rainbow.</li>
            <li>I love the vibrancy of these polishes!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I absolutely love and recommend these to anyone who paints their nails.</li>
            <li>They are more neon than anything</li>
            <li>but for what I paid for it, I guess it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>and I had to keep putting on more then two coats...</li>
            <li>and it is FABULOUS!</li>
            <li>The colors are cute just need two coats of it</li>
            <li>I love all the colors.  </li>
            <li>They are all extremely cute on my caramel yellowish skin color.  </li>
            <li>I love, love these polishes...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even sure how I found these, but really glad that</li>
            <li>Plan on ordering more soon.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love them.</li>
            <li>So make sure you have the time before using them!&lt;br /&gt;Took</li>
            <li>This is simply the best  brand of nail polish</li>
            <li>The colors are so stylish and they matches with the Spring season.</li>
            <li>I love these nail polishes.</li>
            <li>just a bit more words to be accepted.</li>
            <li>the bottles for the polish are really cute and look like tulips to me.</li>
            <li>the teal color in this set is the perfect tiffany blue imo, and i really love using it for a tiffany themed nail art look.</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>Have to apply 3 coats to get true color, but otherwise, they are very cute colors.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m enjoying the product.</li>
            <li>they are on top of it and you will be satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nevertheless, u can&#x27;t expect more from it since it&#x27;s just $1.81/item&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;U should also apply a top coat to make the colors appear better</li>
            <li>Love the colors but the product is not to my liking.</li>
            <li>they all look lovely on..</li>
            <li>I am giving 2 more sets as gifts.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more colors.</li>
            <li>I put Sally Hansen no chip top coat on but they still would crack.</li>
            <li>Also they are probably the most toxic smelling nail polish I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li>In the end I wouldn&#x27;t buy any more sets but the polish is okay.</li>
            <li>Lovely colors.</li>
            <li>and once I used the polish it was fantastic!</li>
            <li>The polish is the perfect thickness and only took two coats to achieve the desired look!</li>
            <li>I love the colors they come in...</li>
            <li>The colors are really cute, like a matte color</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Most of the colors needed about 2 coats to fully cover the nail.  </li>
            <li>Maybe this set would be okay for a one-day-wear type thing or for a child.</li>
            <li>It really looks great..</li>
            <li>What more can I say.</li>
            <li>these are better than reg.</li>
            <li>Some are thicker than others and the color looks best with two white polish coats and a top coat.</li>
            <li>I love these colors and it delivered within 2 days of purchase.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty cute, all are amazing colors!</li>
            <li>i never did better purchase before i love it</li>
            <li>Love the colors, thank you.</li>
            <li>I love these nail polishes</li>
            <li>I love combining pinks and blues ...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I love Kleancolor.</li>
            <li>my niece will love this</li>
            <li>....\\&quot; :)</li>
            <li>i love them</li>
            <li>Pretty good and easy to work with polish!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind this too much because the quality of the colors was very nice.</li>
            <li>Really pretty !!!</li>
            <li>The colors are so bright and such nice pastel colors!</li>
            <li>REALLY pretty colors and most of all, she totally loved it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVED the colors when I first saw them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I got them in conjunction with the &#x27;oh yes, I do&#x27; set which has a beautiful clear sparkle polish in it.</li>
            <li>The quality of the nail polish is pretty good.</li>
            <li>Very nice colors and decent quality</li>
            <li>i highly recommend them, you are gonna love them!!</li>
            <li>feel about them, but worth the buy!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited!</li>
            <li>Many people suggest that the polish has a strong scent .</li>
            <li>They came quick in the mail and were packed nicely.</li>
            <li>It does chip easily if u have your hands in water a lot, so be sure to wear gloves when washing dishes.  </li>
            <li>The color is wonderful, but it took over 2 hours for them to dry.</li>
            <li>You get 6 beautiful pastels that wear great alone or would be a perfect base or addition to your collection for nail artists.  </li>
            <li>these dry super fast and are great for stamping, very happy with them and love all my kleancolor polishes</li>
            <li>Large bottles, good cover.</li>
            <li>When I received these Kleancolor pastel nail polishes I was thrilled; the colours are really pretty!</li>
            <li>Very sweet.</li>
            <li>pastel pink is too bright to be considered pastel!!  </li>
            <li>Polish were cheap which is even better.</li>
            <li>packaging was good and they were each wrapped in bubble wrap and looked like it was handled very well</li>
            <li>also fast shipping and good wrapping with them&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>THEY ARE FUN COLORS AND LOOK REALLY NICE ON MY HANDS AND FEET.  </li>
            <li>She loved them so much I had to get a set for myself.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;and is ready for use good quality item , come on time</li>
            <li>I recommend the colors they are very nice, also the price was quite good which made me not return the product it was not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li>It might chip fast on natural nails if you don&#x27;t have a good &amp; good top coat.</li>
            <li>Other than that they&#x27;re great!</li>
            <li>Chips too easy.</li>
            <li>And to my fortunate surprise the colors were all as expected and in perfect order.</li>
            <li>I Also heard of some of the reviews stating that they chip easily: they don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>the two blue colors are great my favorite</li>
            <li>Just they chip off so easily and that annoys me because everytime I do my hair, which the polish on, it comes out in my hair.</li>
            <li>Doesnt chip easy, but colors arent correct.</li>
            <li>All of these colors chip easily though</li>
            <li>They do have a strong smell (to my nose anyway).</li>
            <li>Oh and the smell is toooo too strong...</li>
            <li>but gives a strong odor</li>
            <li>Strong chemical smell though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall the product is very good besides those minor set backs.</li>
            <li>These colors are amazing and exactly as shown in the picture.</li>
            <li>However, once all that was done with it lasted about 5 days without a top coat and close to a full week with one.  </li>
            <li>these are absolutely beautiful, however, the picture advertises six separate nail polishes and i have only recieved five.</li>
            <li>Was expecting a beautiful yellow, and got a dingy color.</li>
            <li>is because the color is really nice and pretty</li>
            <li>it takes up to 2-3 coats to produce the fine color.</li>
            <li>but it is fine.</li>
            <li>so I know it will be just fine.  </li>
            <li>Everything shipped just fine too, they used bubble wrap.</li>
            <li>was worried about how &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; they would be, but two coats (which is normal for all polish) and the color is steadfast and bright.</li>
            <li>2 or 3 coats are fine.  </li>
            <li>and it was fine.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>I will list the polish names so you can look them up to get a more accurate idea of their true colors:</li>
            <li>Came quickly!</li>
            <li>Super cute and cheap.</li>
            <li>I love these colors, and the lacquer goes on and dries smoothly and relatively quickly as well.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and just as important, comes off easily with remover.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful vibrant colors, but chip way too fast.</li>
            <li>The colors are very true to what is shown on Amazon, and the polish bottles are full size, not samples.</li>
            <li>The customer photo lured me in but I am a huge fan of pastel colors</li>
            <li>I read some reviews about colors not being accurate</li>
            <li>There is one color that is really light and pithy</li>
            <li>Sticky nail polish that does not apply smooth and it peel off as soon as it dries.</li>
            <li>But overall its great nailpolish</li>
            <li>This polish doesn&#x27;t apply smoothly</li>
            <li>The colors were bright and soft.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth</li>
            <li>The colors were fantastic.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Pastel&amp;#34; is being thrown around quite freely here.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>FANTASTIC SELLER&amp;#62;  </li>
            <li>They do not spread smoothly on the nails and hence leaves a tacky look after they are applied.</li>
            <li>You will never get a smooth coat</li>
            <li>Great price for 6 different looks.  </li>
            <li>Just know, I&#x27;m never ordering from Mighty Gadget AGAIN.</li>
            <li>Over all I am happy with the products and would definitely recommend buying.</li>
            <li>Cheap I throw them out</li>
            <li>This is such a great deal for the price and quality of these polishes.</li>
            <li>These polishes fit the bill and work for me.</li>
            <li>These are great especially for summer toes.</li>
            <li>But if u put on a gel top coat, it will smooth it right out</li>
            <li>Comes off easily easily but not bad for the price</li>
            <li>Wrapped individually in paper.. very nice package presentation.  </li>
            <li>Smooth rich colors.</li>
            <li>Looks very pretty and doesn&#x27;t chip easily.</li>
            <li>I received this product earlier then the delivery date which I was super Happy.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t really respecting much in the way of quality...and was pleasantly surpised.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love the colors, and they are exactly what I was hoping for in that aspect.  </li>
            <li>Love the polish, and drys fast!</li>
            <li>I am in love with these colors they are so pretty</li>
            <li>so pretty pastels, I love them 100%  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to get them</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump, and glides on clean.</li>
            <li>As a licenced beauty professional I really think klean color is a great Polish for your money.  </li>
            <li>The colors are exactly what they look like, they paint on the same way the look in the bottle, one coat came out beautiful.</li>
            <li>just kind of attempt to buff it out - it actually worked OK for me.  </li>
            <li>Another pro is they are wonderful for stamping with and show up very well on either dark or light colors</li>
            <li>I got all the right colors &amp; the price was great for 6 nail polishes, also they do need atleast two coats to get the actual color</li>
            <li>Upon completion, you would still have to give it a good hour to dry, during which time it would smudge extremely easily.</li>
            <li>Tho its kinda hard to apply perfectly on your nails.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s coral and instead of the bright blue</li>
            <li>Use them for nail art instead of full nail, I think.</li>
            <li>but you need 2 to 3 layers before getting the true and homogeneous color.</li>
            <li>it is true, this polish doesn&#x27;t chip it peels...</li>
            <li>I do not think that is true .</li>
            <li>This is a good buy overall.</li>
            <li>So they would be more for doing before you go to bed, and just giving them the whole night.</li>
            <li>For the price these nail polishes were good enough.</li>
            <li>One good thing is that you only need one coat to achieve the color of the bottle.</li>
            <li>yellow was leaking and it didn&#x27;t look good .</li>
            <li>otherwise the others are true to color.</li>
            <li>They look lovely on so much so that my children were begging me ti paint theres as well.</li>
            <li>Love these colors soooooo much .</li>
            <li>The overall product is good, if it is for yourself.</li>
            <li>Also the bottles were full size.</li>
            <li>but it takes two or three coats to cover the nail not such a good polish</li>
            <li>I love the colors very spring like colors.</li>
            <li>Although all of the colors take multiple coats for full coverage, the colors are gorgeous and get lots of compliments.</li>
            <li>The delivery is super fast and I am so satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Beautiful colors easy to use and no more that 2 covers</li>
            <li>the colors are beautiful, although not super pastel.</li>
            <li>Pretty colors but chips easily</li>
            <li>color were very pretty and true.</li>
            <li>(Let&#x27;s face it, we all love trying new colors! )</li>
            <li>Loved it Im actually going to buy it again since I ran out of half of them lol</li>
            <li>Dries quickly.</li>
            <li>My favorite color is the mint blue color. :)</li>
            <li>But with a quick e-mail exchange over a two day period ...</li>
            <li>I contacted the shippers and they responded quickly and apologized for the error.</li>
            <li>She has used it and it doesn&#x27;t chip away quick</li>
            <li>I did.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re opaque and dries quite quickly.  </li>
            <li>[ i used super saver shipping ]</li>
            <li>The  price I paid was pretty cheap for a set of 6 full size</li>
            <li>Low quality ideal for beginners under 10 years old</li>
            <li>Dries quickly (about 3 minutes )</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very pretty colors, my niece loves them.</li>
            <li>Even though the colors are off they are still very pretty.</li>
            <li>Very pretty spring colors.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty.</li>
            <li>Colors are very pretty.</li>

            <li>The polish is long wearing, chip resistant and a good consistency for application.  </li>
            <li>Arrived early, and the colors are just too cool!!</li>
            <li>Product was of higher quality than I figured it would be for such a good price.  </li>
            <li>Kleancolor always has well made polishes that usually only take 1 coat to fully produce a nice full polish on the nail.</li>
            <li>&amp; also it doesn&#x27;t really give off a strong smell.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, drys fast., stays onyour nails.</li>
            <li>Colors are exactly as they appear in the picture!</li>
            <li>Really pretty colors!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to see just how pretty and saturated the colors</li>
            <li>All my friends wants to buy a set now !!</li>
            <li>Colors are so pretty!</li>
            <li>great for little girls</li>
            <li>These polishes are very patchy and the colors are not photo accurate.</li>
            <li>I really thought this would be a cheap polish</li>
            <li>the pastel purple  is actually bright pink, if you want to take a chance, and if you have some cash to spend, then go for these.</li>
            <li>I was very nervous about these, because of the cheap price.</li>
            <li>I like to do the Konad stamping and plan to stamp them with white polish, although they&#x27;re just as nice alone.  </li>
            <li>The colors are worth it</li>
            <li>but I have many nail polishes and know when one is getting old or out of date and the Polish I received was gunky in texture</li>
            <li>The orange is my favorite orange i ever bought, which is unexpected, because I like pinks.</li>
            <li>cute af, although they were more neon-y then expected.</li>
            <li>I do always apply a top clear protective coat, and it&#x27;s done nothing.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27; ve used on several people they all liked thee polish.</li>
            <li>They arrived on time and are sooo worth the money</li>
            <li>Overall, I think they&#x27;re nice nail polish for the price</li>
            <li>When I relayed this to the company they were nice enough to offer replacements and wanted pictures.</li>
            <li>The girls had fun painting nails and hoping winter would come to an end.</li>
            <li>but still testing these out to see if I got my money&#x27;s worth 😕</li>
            <li>I just added some clear top coat to the bottle</li>
            <li>I did purchase a clear top coat just for a bit of shine.  </li>
            <li>The colors were really nice especially the peach and teal.</li>
            <li>The nail polishes dried in 15 minuets at the most, and the brushes are in good condition and paint very well.</li>
            <li>The picture is not accurate to the color, which I was happy about.</li>
            <li>She would just laugh at me.</li>
            <li>Three of the bottles broke in transit, and they were kind enough to refund me.</li>
            <li>The colors are fun, just know that you&#x27;re paying &amp;#60;$2 per bottle and set your expectations accordingly.</li>
            <li>, that I should have searched out more accurate pictures from other sellers and that i bought cheap stuff s</li>
            <li>Takes very long to dry especially as more than one coat is needed.</li>
            <li>Very pretty very soft and very feminine can&#x27;t wait I bought so many from you</li>
            <li>Colors are sharp, bright.</li>
            <li>Pretty much the only good thing bout this.</li>
            <li>this company made everything right within a matter of a couple of days.  </li>
            <li>Come to find out the reviews were right.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t bother keeping, threw it right in the trashcan.</li>
            <li>and they were right.</li>
            <li>The price is certainly right, and I like the color.</li>
            <li>I normally get at least 3 or 4 days of flawless mani before my polish starts to peel</li>
            <li>They came fast and shipping was clean.</li>
            <li>These are cheap and high quality.</li>
            <li>it was semi stringy and did not go on smooth like in the pictures I had to put several layers and a top clear coat to smooth it out for it looked chunky on my nails</li>
            <li>chips easy but just put a clear coat on it!</li>
            <li>These were very nice colors, although they are very sticky and somewhat gooey and never dry completely.</li>
            <li>Not worth all the effort, which is a shame because the colors are gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>They are kind of thick, and do not go on very smooth.</li>
            <li>I was hoping the pastel colors would be a little softer, but overall I am happy with the purchase!</li>
            <li>Super fast arrival.</li>
            <li>it shipped super fast</li>
            <li>They are beautiful and long lasting!</li>
            <li>Some good colors for less money, but you need atleast 3 coats to make it work.</li>
            <li>Beautiful colors long lasting</li>
            <li>However, wow, it is unbelievably strong.</li>
            <li>Just what I expected for a cheap price :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with all the color that I bought, I&#x27;m actually wearing the Darker blue rigth now</li>
            <li>The colors are just what I expected, which I&#x27;m glad!  </li>
            <li>I ordered this polish and first, the shipping was super fast</li>
            <li>like is that they chip very fast</li>
            <li>I recieved these colors earlier then expected which I was super happy about.</li>
            <li>The other four colors apply very well and are super cute colors!</li>
            <li>These nail polish colors are adorable, and dry quickly.  </li>
            <li>, if you have short and square shape nails, they gonna look very pretty!!</li>
            <li>Pretty pastels.</li>
            <li>Pretty color</li>
            <li>but they hold up very well!</li>
            <li>I love them the only thing I dnt</li>
            <li>really enjoyed all the colors even the too very similar blues (pastel teal &amp; pastel</li>
            <li>These colors are really really pretty and pretty pastel too.</li>
            <li>I love them and will be doing my next acrylic set with the peach pastel color.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more Kleancolor brand nail polish.</li>
            <li>And I will DEFINITELY be ordering more kleancolor.</li>
            <li>I also like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t smell like regular nail polish, and that&#x27;s because it tons better than it.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s not too much of an issue for me at all!</li>
            <li>KLEANCOLOR was as nice as I expected</li>
            <li>I got it the day after I ordered it the product came individually wrapped to prevent breaking I love this company &amp; will be ordering again soon.</li>
            <li>The colors are so pretty</li>
            <li>The colors are exactly what they look like in the photo exept the purple and orange.</li>
            <li>I love the colors but the paint started to chip the very next day.</li>
            <li>The nail polishes look so pretty</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly as the picture looks like, and it isn&#x27;t gooey or anything.</li>
            <li>If you want your nail polish to last longer try using a top coat.</li>
            <li>so the color is exactly like it is in the bottle</li>
            <li>I first found out about KleanColor over a year ago</li>
            <li>She liked it, but she told me the color was lighter than she  expected.</li>
            <li>Pretty</li>
            <li>THE COLORS ARE SO PRETTY</li>
            <li>The colors are exact.</li>
            <li>It goes with my blonde hair and complection :)</li>
            <li>I waited until the estimated arrival date to call if it didn&#x27;t get to me, sure enough it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>They came out sooo pretty.</li>
            <li>These chip within the first day of using them--</li>
            <li>or it could show a bit more of the actual color on the nail.</li>
            <li>At some point the polish had cracked, it stayed on my nails but you can visibly see a crackling effect on the polish which is a first for me.  </li>
            <li>its so pretty.</li>
            <li>This is the second time I have bought these first time was for my grand daughter.</li>
            <li>The colors are exactly as shown in the pic</li>
            <li>I particularly love the yellow color.</li>
            <li>so I just took it off, the colors are still really pretty tho.</li>
            <li>The colors are exactly how they are depicted in the picture.</li>
            <li>My granddaughter loves all the pretty colors.</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty.</li>
            <li>Really pretty colors</li>
            <li>The only think that is OK with this nail polish set is the colors.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time buying nail polish from Kleancolor</li>
            <li>The colors look exactly like they do online</li>
            <li>All in all, these nail polishes are time consuming and worth too much effort to use, which the money I saved does not compensate for.</li>
            <li>This polish chips the first day it is</li>
            <li>got for teenage kids and they love.  </li>
            <li>For one, I had to wait like a month for these polishes because my package got lost the first time.</li>
            <li>The colors definitely come out as they look, which I&#x27;m glad about.</li>
            <li>Colors are really pretty, and you get a lot for you pay for.</li>
            <li>I will likely order more colors as well.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m definitely buying more.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves them!  </li>
            <li>This nail polish set is absolutely pretty.</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty.</li>
            <li>Requires few coats and dries in good time.</li>
            <li>but after a few coats it looks good.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend, shipped quickly without issue</li>
            <li>WOW!!!!</li>
            <li>they were all full size new bottles and colors......</li>
            <li>This nail polish is also the most durable and lasting than my collection of NYC Nail Polish, Sally Hansens, Pure Ice, and Sally Hansen&#x27;s Insta Dries.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more than $1 each, which is really cheap, so</li>
            <li>Other than that the colours are nice.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much from these considering how cheap they are, but I was happily surprised.  </li>
            <li>I know a manicure, and with a base coat, and a top coat, and after four days, they still look beautiful!</li>
            <li>with most Kleancolor polished they do take quite a bit to dry, but with a quick dry top coat it doesn&#x27;t really matter.&lt;br</li>
            <li>they have the same colors and they are amazing especially the brand fresh paint</li>
            <li>yellow and orange can&#x27;t even fairly be described as &amp;#34;pastel&amp;#34; and the other colors are either DARK or BRIGHT.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this to any one who wants exact pastel colors.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>I used all the colors but so far they&#x27;re not bad.</li>
            <li>Beautiful colors, the only downside is that the lacquer chips easy on some colors, and is very thick on others.</li>
            <li>I plan to order more in the near future and Eye Candy Cosmetics will certainly get my business!</li>
            <li>, BUT THE ONLY THING IS THAT IT COMES OFF EASY.</li>
            <li>No problems with shipping, but the only thing is Kleancolor polish has a strong aroma..</li>
            <li>The smell is honestly not as bad as a lot of people make it out to be (I have Orly and Sally Hansen that smell worse), and after a good hand wash it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li>Where as the colors in this set are super cute, I did have a little bit of a problem with chipping.</li>
            <li>so what I do is put a couple of drops of pure acetone in it to loosen it up</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m certainly convince this is made for kids.</li>
            <li>One top was loose and I lost some polish.</li>
            <li>The paint is nice and thick and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>I might have tried topping it with a fast dry top coat like Seche Vite</li>
            <li>So they apologized and sent me a new set right away.</li>
            <li>the polish is smooth and it gives my nails a nice thick coat of pastel color!</li>
            <li>The colors are really vibrant and pretty.</li>
            <li>but I put a little tiny non acatone nail polish remover in the bottles and they are perfect now not a big deal to me</li>
            <li>I have huge chips on multiple nails within 24 hours of application.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>As always with kleancolor, the add is very misleading..</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really like it at all.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery...</li>
            <li>Dries fast</li>
            <li>the picture depicts the colors really well.</li>
            <li>The polish is very think.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Absolutely adore these polishes.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t flow very well.</li>
            <li>so much.</li>
            <li>Do not like they peel  out  fast</li>
            <li>I REALLY LIKE THESE PASTEL POLISHES.  </li>
            <li>I bought these not expecting much.</li>
            <li>It arrived and as soon as I opened the bottle, on all of them, it was very gooey, sticky, and clumpy.</li>
            <li>Need four layers to get the color and peels off wayyy too fast.</li>
            <li>It definitely is more in line with the hues of pink, NOT purple.</li>
            <li>I really wanted the pastel purple too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thankfully, there were no broken bottles and spilled nail polish.</li>
            <li>much my nail tec even asked me wher4e</li>
            <li>did I get the because she wants all the colors</li>
            <li>I really like the colors.</li>
            <li>The shipping was quite fast</li>
            <li>These are colors that you don&#x27;t see very often.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the orange pastel colour yet, but from the outside of the bottle, it seems too &#x27;light&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>it is really opaque color on application</li>
            <li>Dries fast with dryer.</li>
            <li>I bought these because I don&#x27;t really have any pastels.</li>
            <li>for the price, i guess i shouldn&#x27;t expect too much from this product.</li>
            <li>Seller is very prompt and in case you have a problem with the product or delay with delivery</li>
            <li>thanks a lot.</li>
            <li>Very gloppy.  </li>
            <li>They also worked really well for stamping designs.</li>
            <li>but it flakes way too fast</li>
            <li>There is a customer image that shows the real colors.</li>
            <li>I put two coats on with a gel type top coat and the next day I was already missing paint from the top part of my nails.  </li>
            <li>Polish is very clumpy no matter how much you shake it.</li>
            <li>Very plastic-ish.</li>
            <li>(filled out the necessary boxes on the return page and everything) but opted to save them to add variety to my collection.</li>
            <li>look very feminine</li>
            <li>These are very opaque and didn&#x27;t chip on me.</li>
            <li>I was very dissapointed with this purchase and will not reccomend it to ANYONE.</li>
            <li>* FAST delivery.&lt;br</li>
            <li>very striky and not pastel at all.</li>
            <li>That said, if the set wasn&#x27;t so cheap I would&#x27;ve left a one-star review.</li>
            <li>every few days add another stroke of top coat to keep your manicure looking fresh and shiny.</li>
            <li>The polishes aren&#x27;t opaque but aren&#x27;t sheer, and the colors were brighter than expected but still good.  </li>
            <li>but I got these in the mail yesterday and the colors are absolutely gorgeous and the polish itself is thick and covers in one coat.</li>
            <li>It tries very quickly too ;)</li>
            <li>But I mean good price for 6  bottles ..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten extremely into nail art here lately, and these are some of the greatest nail polish&#x27;s I have ever bought!</li>
            <li>Shipped fast, Nice colors and last long.</li>
            <li>This polish is not a name I am familiar with, and the price point is very low.</li>
            <li>other colors are good, took several coats to obtain a decent color.</li>
            <li>Also, as long as you paint on about 2 thin coats, you will have no drying problems and a beautiful and opaque polish!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll give it a decent review despite a flaw, because it was really inexpensive.</li>
            <li>might need to coat at least twice to get the opaqueness, rather spend more money get one color with full satisfaction.</li>
            <li>I got the package and was excited to try the colors which turned out to be beauuuuutiful, but I noticed that the bottles have already been used meaning they were smeared with polish on the sides and sine of them were kind of dry a little.</li>
            <li>Not that great one bottle was open very messy..</li>
            <li>Highly recommend and I will be buying again really soon.</li>
            <li>nail polish lids make you think they are screwed on all the way when they aren&#x27;t, they tighten just a little bit more, so make sure the bottles are completely closed before putting away.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just let it dry completely then applied my top gel coat over it.</li>
            <li>but if you let each layer dry all the way, you should be fine.</li>
            <li>I usually use 2-3 coats to get that nice salon look.  </li>
            <li>beautiful color, especially the purple one, however the yellow one makes my hand looks dark</li>
            <li>so they are much shorter than normal.</li>
            <li>The colors are true but I don&#x27;t like the brush, its to big.</li>
            <li>iIt&#x27;s no fun to get a beautiful manicure only to have it chip shortly</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros- color payoff is wonderful of course with a pastel that you can almost get on one coat they will be a little thick</li>
            <li>The colors are absolutely gorgeous and exactly what I wanted, even though the blue and teal and pink and orange are literally the same color.  </li>
            <li>honestly it&#x27;s hard to find nice polishes that are reasonably priced and don&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg for just ONE bottle.</li>
            <li>Love the large bottles with pale colors.</li>
            <li>Even when applying a light coat it takes well over an hour to dry.</li>
            <li>maybe some colors just make it appear thicker (more opaque) or lighter (less opaque) and allowing streaks to be visible</li>
            <li>The yellow color is a tad more sheer than the others but in 2 coats it is opaque.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>These are really nice pastel colors; the pink especially.</li>
            <li>Love the colors, but it takes a few coats to get the real color.</li>
            <li>Vibrant colors.</li>
            <li>While I love the colors, I don&#x27;t see myself using these polishes very often unless I have a few hours set aside to do my nails.</li>
            <li>The shipping was quick and each bottle was individually wrapped in bubble wrap</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s also decent nail polish.</li>
            <li>i just tried the blue and was so impressed there is nothing wrong i recomend this nail polish</li>
            <li>A gripe I do have is that even though I gave my nails a good hour or two before going to bed, when I woke up the next morning I had some molded indentations in a few of my nails I guess from the pressure of my head on my pillow with my hands underneath.  </li>
            <li>The package was received in a decent amount of time (about 3 business days) after ordering.</li>
            <li>Color is not transparent, but the two purple, to spread several layers of color will look plump, overall was OK.</li>
            <li>It comes in 5 colors, pastel blue, pastel orange, pastel yellow, pastel lavender purple and, my favorite....</li>
            <li>the color isn&#x27;t the same as Amazon&#x27;s... but still very pretty...</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these polishes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>They both clump and do not dry right.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that they chip more easily than my Essie and opi polishes.</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy a set for my friends and it will make a nice Christmas gift for the other girls.</li>
            <li>I tried the pink, and that was fine, so I wonder if the peach was not prepared well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love the colors but sometimes the paint gets lumpy after you use it a couple times and you have to shake it up a little.</li>
            <li>Other than that, Some of the colors were cool!</li>
            <li>Goes on very thick but doesn&#x27;t give good coverage.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and arrived early.</li>
            <li>they last long without any chip :)</li>
            <li>though the price is relatively low, I still don&#x27;t think it worth the price, but nail polisher is not so creamy, some even seperate into two layers.</li>
            <li>These colors are really pretty and apply thick to the nail, so it doesn&#x27;t take many coats.</li>
            <li>but it had a green tint to it and most of the colors were translucent</li>
            <li>Normal, matt,matalic, oppque, sented, matalic &amp;matt.</li>
            <li>and they are normal sized nail polish&#x27;s</li>
            <li>It drys kind of slow</li>
            <li>* Kind of thick, but not gloopy.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Takes many coats which would be fine, if it went on smooth :(</li>
            <li>Colors are great but the durability is very poor.</li>
            <li>My only complaint would be that my nails that usually last 2 weeks without chipping only lasted 8 days but for the price I am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li>And my nails seemed fine from then on until the next 2-3 days before I noticed chipping starting to occur.  </li>
            <li>Love the colors, they turn your nails a little yellow like most nonexpensive nail polish, but as long as you use a base coat they are wonderful!</li>
            <li>I normally do two coats, and although some seem a little tricky to get right these polishes are definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>I can live with it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to using nail polish because I was a tomboy all of my life.</li>
            <li>I contacted them and they rushed me a new set</li>
            <li>Polish is thick enough to get good coverage in 2 coats, and didn&#x27;t create air bubbles as a lot of other cheap brands do.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that the purple looks more like a darker pink instead of a lavender.</li>
            <li>The pink one in the middle of the picture in my favorite.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very thinish and chips easily, also colors are not the same as pictured, the orange is like a salmony pink</li>
            <li>I just added glitter on top of the polish so that the thick coating wasn&#x27;t very noticeable.</li>
            <li>The only good thing I can say is that it is pretty thick, and a second coat might not be necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once the top coat is on let dry for three minutes then apply quick dry nail drops to make it dry faster.</li>
            <li>The clear coat over the pastel (purple is the color for this week!)</li>
            <li>But when I painted my nails with them they never dried!</li>
            <li>I open them up and instead of getting rhe pretty teal color that was in the picture</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait the blue is so pretty looking.</li>
            <li>The nail polish colors were pretty and the brushes were bigger</li>
            <li>Their mistake and they quickly fixed it!</li>
            <li>The colors where so pretty ,I only applied one coat,would buy this again.</li>
            <li>The Blue, Teal, and Yellow colors are accurate just like the picture, but the Pink is more of a bubble gum pink.</li>
            <li>Colors were true pictures, but when applied very clumpy like.. not smooth at all.</li>
            <li>These colors are undoubtedly beautiful, unfortunately, it chips in a day!</li>
            <li>Other than that, not bad at all.</li>
            <li>So, it could have possibly been one or more of the previously mentioned things as part of my lifestyle that contributed to the crackling effect.  </li>
            <li>Alright when I got this it was nicely packaged; but when I started applying one color onto my nails it was already very sticky idk if it was from leaving it in the cold to long, but it was how old nail polish gets sticky than you&#x27;d have to add nail polish remover or thinner to smooth it out.</li>
            <li>While the colors are really pretty, and almost accurately represented in the photos - the quality is not good at all.</li>
            <li>Nail Polish was sticky and old.</li>
            <li>well I only really have one and that is on the orange</li>
            <li>I guess I expected this polish to be thin and cheap, but it&#x27;s a much better quality.  </li>
            <li>So far no chipping, but I did add a topcoat of no chipping clear.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just old.</li>
            <li>Very transparent without multiple coats.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 12 year old niece and nearly kept it for myself.  </li>
            <li>AND THEY LASTED PRETTY LONG WITHOUT CHIPPING.</li>
            <li>Only needs 1 coat and dries fast .</li>
            <li>But when they came, i was so hapy surprised.</li>
            <li>I have purchased a few cheap ($1) nail polishes before and the smell can sometimes be unbearable</li>
            <li>nowhere near as orangey as the picture would lead you to believe.</li>
            <li>very pigmented, only needed one coat but used two.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap nail polish and one of the nail polish bottles was missing a brush...</li>
            <li>Cheap but not cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I waited nearly an hour</li>
            <li>This is a gift for my 11 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>but since these were hand wrapped not in a box perhaps filled by machinery, I can only assume someone either wasn&#x27;t paying attention to notice a bottle of bright pink polish in with the pastel purple/lavenders they were wrapping, or someone was color blind...</li>
            <li>&quot; it looks near purple -___- and</li>
            <li>All came wrapped individually and were not broken or leaking.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought these nail polishes to give as a gift to my 9 year old niece.  </li>
            <li>Not only fun but totally wearable.</li>
            <li>I love it, but it&#x27;s too thick.</li>
            <li>If you live in the northern states where winter gets quite long, these are a fun gift for a teenage/college age female.  </li>
            <li>I have several of their metallic polishes and they dry rather quickly.</li>
            <li>This being my first time buying Kleancolor nail polish, I think the colors are great, only bad part was</li>
            <li>Only complaint would be that the \\&quot;pastel purple\\&quot; wasn&#x27;t as light as I thought it would be but nonetheless a pretty shade.</li>
            <li>No mess though.  </li>
            <li>The teal and blue look very similar,  the orange is more of a coral,  the pink is a very cotton candy pink.  </li>
            <li>I like the colors but the orange was the exact same as the yellow</li>
            <li>Super thin, doesn&#x27;t last, I got what I paid for: cheap.</li>
            <li>The polishes seem fine, not old or goopy like other reviews, but my &amp;#34;pastel purple&amp;#34; is NOT the bottle that this picture shows.</li>
            <li>The seller Nail Essential is highly recommended as well.</li>
            <li>The polish is pretty thick and takes a while to dry and chips off easy</li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful but these polishes are really bad quality.</li>
            <li>Lasts a long time on my nails and very resistant to chipping.</li>
            <li>I threw all of the bottles in the trash because the smell was so strong &amp; potent that it have me a headache and made me feel sick.</li>
            <li>I can only use the on my fingernails and only if I&#x27;m quick quick otherwise it drys to fast and comes out a gloppy mess leaving a uneven finish.</li>
            <li>If you can get the same set new</li>
            <li>But they do dry up fast.</li>
            <li>and they dry really fast</li>
            <li>The only way I can extend it at all is to but a thick top coat on, and then dunk my hands in ice water to set them.  </li>
            <li>Like I said, not perfect but good enough.</li>
            <li>The quality is a bit off, the polishes are all a bit thick and flake easily</li>
            <li>Colors are pretty not exactly as picture.</li>
            <li>Bottles were sealed shut and a little hard to open the first time but other then that they are good.</li>
            <li>really love them all although the purple is a little dark</li>
            <li>Non streaky light colors are hard to find.  </li>
            <li>In general I like this polish</li>
            <li>I have just recently made the transition from acrylic to my natural nails</li>
            <li>I guess my nails didn&#x27;t completely cure even by that morning because I actually just used my fingertips to try to flatten out the molding and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s want I really wanted and expected.</li>
            <li>I am uploading a photo to help you understand just what colors these are, with a Sephora by OPI Natural Environ-mint polish next to the &amp;#34;teal&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It was so old and such crappy quality that it was nothing but unusable gunk.</li>
            <li>barely lasts 24 hours - chips and peels</li>
            <li>Polish to thick does not go on smooth</li>
            <li>so I didnt have any broken bottles :)</li>
            <li>These took forever to be delivered and the nail polishes are so thick it does not apply smoothly yo your nails.</li>
            <li>the, purple was dark and sheer and the orange was brown-ish, but I really think little things like that happening are part of the risk when ordering online instead of physically going to the store and picking things yourself, plus you wouldn&#x27;t have known the smell was strong in the store unless you sniff every</li>
            <li>The bottles are regular sized, not little mini bottles.  </li>
            <li>I used the base coat that I normally use (which works great with other polishes) and the usual top coat.</li>
            <li>I prefer the Sally Hansen Lively Lilac from their Insta Dri collection or the Wet N Wild Reject The Mainstream color in their 2015 spring line.</li>
            <li>Chips too easily even w a base and top coat.</li>
            <li>The blue and green are very similar but the colors are great and as with any pastel go over better with a white base coat</li>
            <li>Loved it, i expected a lesser quality but was shocked at the better quality than expected, definitely would buy again</li>
            <li>Colors are very nice but the quality is so bad.</li>
            <li>I added some nail thinner to thin it out, which is fine, but it makes me wonder how old these polishes were.</li>
            <li>colors are beautiful, but this chip very easily not very happy with it, i still use it but even with a nice coat and base coat and all that it still chip too soon.</li>
            <li>it looked different in the picture and the top of the lavender polish was broken.</li>
            <li>I requested to return the polish the seller responded saying they have sold &amp;#34;hundreds, if not thousands&amp;#34; of these sets and have never gotten a complaint saying they weren&#x27;t true to color, and that if I wanted to return them I would have to pay for shipping.</li>
            <li>If you do find that they chips just make sure to clean your nail with alcohol or non acetone nail polish remove before apply your base coat.</li>
            <li>The nail polish is very thick and does NOT go on evenly OR easily.</li>
            <li>to dry &amp; I&#x27;m pretty patient with my nails, but just takes a long time to dry</li>
            <li>I only gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because you do have to apply &#x27;at least&#x27; 2 coats before it gives you full coverage.</li>
            <li>and the pink is HOT PINK.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t even last a full 24 hours before at least one of my nails</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m torn between giving this product a bad review and and a good review.</li>

            <li> :) Anyway, today I used the nail polish and the brush seems to be very good.</li>
            <li> The really good.</li>
            <li> Great item and looks so nice.</li>
            <li> Good opacity.</li>
            <li> I know it was a good price, but</li>
            <li> When I saw these polishes, I loved the colors since I have been looking for good pastels.</li>
            <li> but then i read some reviews saying it was actually good</li>
            <li> So that&#x27;s GOOD.</li>
            <li> The polish is good.</li>
            <li> price was good for this bargain.</li>
            <li> Good nail polish for the price &amp; the colors show well with two coats.</li>
            <li> Good nail polish.</li>
            <li> Go for good quality polishes not Kleancolor.</li>
            <li> Good things:  </li>
            <li> and she loved them.</li>
            <li> good buy</li>
            <li> I bought this set because I loved the colors.  </li>
            <li> My daughter loved the colors</li>
            <li> colors are a described delivery prompt no cracks packes good</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t have words to describe  my happiness</li>
            <li> It then chips on almost every nail by the end of the day, even with a good topcoat.</li>
            <li> Cute colors, good value for the price!</li>
            <li> i gave this a two star rating instead of one because the colors are awesome and look great for the first day or so.</li>
            <li> I love that these came and how beautiful they are.</li>
            <li> These colors are true to the pictures and perfect for Spring.  </li>
            <li> for the most part I mix the two pink/purple pastel colors on one nail and it turns out beautifully.</li>
            <li> I love the colors and it applies beautifully.</li>
            <li> i have so many beautiful colors &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I am VERY pleased with the colour~! :)</li>
            <li> All my colours are beautiful and soft and I love them!!!!</li>
            <li> While I will continue to wear the polish because I love the colors (they work great for spring/summer), it&#x27;s a hassle to have to take off &amp; re-apply the color every day.</li>
            <li> But this purple is still very lovely</li>
            <li> The quality is great and applies on smoothly!</li>
            <li> Before ordering this nail polish I read most of the reviews and thought I was getting a great deal.</li>
            <li> This was a very cute nail polish</li>
            <li> they have good coverage and are nice and popping in color.</li>
            <li> Despite that issue, the product is nice, the brushes are good size, and the thickness is about medium, so it won&#x27;t run all over the place.</li>
            <li> Nice polish, good price</li>
            <li> Really nice color and good nail polish</li>

            <li> so happy with this purchase colors are so pigmented and the polish doesn&#x27;t smell as strong as others polishes do</li>
            <li> Amazing .</li>
            <li> The colors are great but the product seems to be cheap.</li>
            <li> but the finishing resualts a amazing for the price.</li>
            <li> I love the bright colors.</li>
            <li> the color range an the diffrents kinds its amazing.</li>
            <li> i just started using these colors and they are amazing</li>
            <li> Surprisingly nice colors.</li>
            <li> Nice colors,</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t turn out as nice as the rest.</li>
            <li> Takes about three coats to cover nicely.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is so good price too:)</li>
            <li> The color is nice</li>
            <li> or any kind of gift.</li>
            <li> the colours are very summery, and very good for the price!</li>
            <li> It was wrapped fairly nice and the nail polishes did not leak.</li>
            <li> Ships fast and padded up well, so all of the polishes were perfectly intact!</li>
            <li> I really liked the colors.</li>
            <li> You get all the colors and they&#x27;re all good quality :-)</li>
            <li> The colours are just what i like and they have a nice shine.</li>
            <li> the nail polish sticky and comes in clumps and does not apply nicely</li>
            <li> nice surprise</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s what you pay for, and the colors are nice.</li>
            <li> When painting your nails they go on nicely</li>

            <li> The colors are beautiful &amp; the shipping was quick..</li>
            <li> love light orange one that color is so beautiful</li>
            <li> Some of the polishes were kind of clumpy and it chips very easily.</li>
            <li> I love pastel colors and these are very cute.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how these polishes would be, but I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> the colors aren&#x27;t as vibrant as they look, I found if you pair this with their holo counterparts by kleancolor, they do look very nice for springy colors!</li>
            <li> Use in well-ventilated area - they have a VERY strong smell.</li>
            <li> They smell very strong too.</li>
            <li> Chips very easily.</li>
            <li> However they chipped very easily.</li>

            <li> The brush is not the best; I would have like a larger one.  </li>

            <li> Love this set.  </li>
            <li> Some of the colors applied better than others.</li>
            <li> But a cute variety of tones.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE COLORS.</li>
            <li> , MAYBE USING TOP COAT WILL STAY ON LONGER</li>
            <li> glad I didn&#x27;t get any more from this brand.</li>
            <li> I plan to order more sets.  </li>
            <li> was not as impressed when I actually used them.</li>
            <li> The colors are still great in person, but I don&#x27;t see using them very often because of the problems with application.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE the colors the service was AAA+++</li>

            <li> Im planning on buying more.</li>
            <li> Thank you love these colors</li>
            <li> My grand niece just loves to pant her finger nails like a rainbow.</li>
            <li> I love the vibrancy of these polishes!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I absolutely love and recommend these to anyone who paints their nails.</li>
            <li> They are more neon than anything</li>
            <li> but for what I paid for it, I guess it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> and I had to keep putting on more then two coats...</li>
            <li> and it is FABULOUS!</li>
            <li> The colors are cute just need two coats of it</li>
            <li> I love all the colors.  </li>
            <li> They are all extremely cute on my caramel yellowish skin color.  </li>
            <li> I love, love these polishes...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even sure how I found these, but really glad that</li>
            <li> Plan on ordering more soon.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love them.</li>
            <li> So make sure you have the time before using them!&lt;br /&gt;Took</li>
            <li> This is simply the best  brand of nail polish</li>
            <li> The colors are so stylish and they matches with the Spring season.</li>
            <li> I love these nail polishes.</li>
            <li> just a bit more words to be accepted.</li>
            <li> the bottles for the polish are really cute and look like tulips to me.</li>
            <li> the teal color in this set is the perfect tiffany blue imo, and i really love using it for a tiffany themed nail art look.</li>
            <li> Love</li>
            <li> Have to apply 3 coats to get true color, but otherwise, they are very cute colors.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m enjoying the product.</li>
            <li> they are on top of it and you will be satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nevertheless, u can&#x27;t expect more from it since it&#x27;s just $1.81/item&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;U should also apply a top coat to make the colors appear better</li>
            <li> Love the colors but the product is not to my liking.</li>
            <li> they all look lovely on..</li>
            <li> I am giving 2 more sets as gifts.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more colors.</li>
            <li> I put Sally Hansen no chip top coat on but they still would crack.</li>
            <li> Also they are probably the most toxic smelling nail polish I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li> In the end I wouldn&#x27;t buy any more sets but the polish is okay.</li>
            <li> Lovely colors.</li>
            <li> and once I used the polish it was fantastic!</li>
            <li> The polish is the perfect thickness and only took two coats to achieve the desired look!</li>
            <li> I love the colors they come in...</li>
            <li> The colors are really cute, like a matte color</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Most of the colors needed about 2 coats to fully cover the nail.  </li>
            <li> Maybe this set would be okay for a one-day-wear type thing or for a child.</li>
            <li> It really looks great..</li>
            <li> What more can I say.</li>
            <li> these are better than reg.</li>
            <li> Some are thicker than others and the color looks best with two white polish coats and a top coat.</li>
            <li> I love these colors and it delivered within 2 days of purchase.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty cute, all are amazing colors!</li>
            <li> i never did better purchase before i love it</li>
            <li> Love the colors, thank you.</li>
            <li> I love these nail polishes</li>
            <li> I love combining pinks and blues ...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I love Kleancolor.</li>
            <li> my niece will love this</li>
            <li> ....\\&quot; :)</li>
            <li> i love them</li>
            <li> Pretty good and easy to work with polish!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind this too much because the quality of the colors was very nice.</li>
            <li> Really pretty !!!</li>
            <li> The colors are so bright and such nice pastel colors!</li>
            <li> REALLY pretty colors and most of all, she totally loved it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVED the colors when I first saw them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I got them in conjunction with the &#x27;oh yes, I do&#x27; set which has a beautiful clear sparkle polish in it.</li>
            <li> The quality of the nail polish is pretty good.</li>
            <li> Very nice colors and decent quality</li>
            <li> i highly recommend them, you are gonna love them!!</li>
            <li> feel about them, but worth the buy!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited!</li>
            <li> Many people suggest that the polish has a strong scent .</li>
            <li> They came quick in the mail and were packed nicely.</li>
            <li> It does chip easily if u have your hands in water a lot, so be sure to wear gloves when washing dishes.  </li>
            <li> The color is wonderful, but it took over 2 hours for them to dry.</li>
            <li> You get 6 beautiful pastels that wear great alone or would be a perfect base or addition to your collection for nail artists.  </li>
            <li> these dry super fast and are great for stamping, very happy with them and love all my kleancolor polishes</li>
            <li> Large bottles, good cover.</li>
            <li> When I received these Kleancolor pastel nail polishes I was thrilled; the colours are really pretty!</li>
            <li> Very sweet.</li>
            <li> pastel pink is too bright to be considered pastel!!  </li>
            <li> Polish were cheap which is even better.</li>
            <li> packaging was good and they were each wrapped in bubble wrap and looked like it was handled very well</li>
            <li> also fast shipping and good wrapping with them&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> THEY ARE FUN COLORS AND LOOK REALLY NICE ON MY HANDS AND FEET.  </li>
            <li> She loved them so much I had to get a set for myself.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;and is ready for use good quality item , come on time</li>
            <li> I recommend the colors they are very nice, also the price was quite good which made me not return the product it was not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> It might chip fast on natural nails if you don&#x27;t have a good &amp; good top coat.</li>
            <li> Other than that they&#x27;re great!</li>
            <li> Chips too easy.</li>
            <li> And to my fortunate surprise the colors were all as expected and in perfect order.</li>
            <li> I Also heard of some of the reviews stating that they chip easily: they don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> the two blue colors are great my favorite</li>
            <li> Just they chip off so easily and that annoys me because everytime I do my hair, which the polish on, it comes out in my hair.</li>
            <li> Doesnt chip easy, but colors arent correct.</li>
            <li> All of these colors chip easily though</li>
            <li> They do have a strong smell (to my nose anyway).</li>
            <li> Oh and the smell is toooo too strong...</li>
            <li> but gives a strong odor</li>
            <li> Strong chemical smell though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall the product is very good besides those minor set backs.</li>
            <li> These colors are amazing and exactly as shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> However, once all that was done with it lasted about 5 days without a top coat and close to a full week with one.  </li>
            <li> these are absolutely beautiful, however, the picture advertises six separate nail polishes and i have only recieved five.</li>
            <li> Was expecting a beautiful yellow, and got a dingy color.</li>
            <li> is because the color is really nice and pretty</li>
            <li> it takes up to 2-3 coats to produce the fine color.</li>
            <li> but it is fine.</li>
            <li> so I know it will be just fine.  </li>
            <li> Everything shipped just fine too, they used bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> was worried about how &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; they would be, but two coats (which is normal for all polish) and the color is steadfast and bright.</li>
            <li> 2 or 3 coats are fine.  </li>
            <li> and it was fine.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> I will list the polish names so you can look them up to get a more accurate idea of their true colors:</li>
            <li> Came quickly!</li>
            <li> Super cute and cheap.</li>
            <li> I love these colors, and the lacquer goes on and dries smoothly and relatively quickly as well.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and just as important, comes off easily with remover.  </li>
            <li> Beautiful vibrant colors, but chip way too fast.</li>
            <li> The colors are very true to what is shown on Amazon, and the polish bottles are full size, not samples.</li>
            <li> The customer photo lured me in but I am a huge fan of pastel colors</li>
            <li> I read some reviews about colors not being accurate</li>
            <li> There is one color that is really light and pithy</li>
            <li> Sticky nail polish that does not apply smooth and it peel off as soon as it dries.</li>
            <li> But overall its great nailpolish</li>
            <li> This polish doesn&#x27;t apply smoothly</li>
            <li> The colors were bright and soft.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth</li>
            <li> The colors were fantastic.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Pastel&amp;#34; is being thrown around quite freely here.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC SELLER&amp;#62;  </li>
            <li> They do not spread smoothly on the nails and hence leaves a tacky look after they are applied.</li>
            <li> You will never get a smooth coat</li>
            <li> Great price for 6 different looks.  </li>
            <li> Just know, I&#x27;m never ordering from Mighty Gadget AGAIN.</li>
            <li> Over all I am happy with the products and would definitely recommend buying.</li>
            <li> Cheap I throw them out</li>
            <li> This is such a great deal for the price and quality of these polishes.</li>
            <li> These polishes fit the bill and work for me.</li>
            <li> These are great especially for summer toes.</li>
            <li> But if u put on a gel top coat, it will smooth it right out</li>
            <li> Comes off easily easily but not bad for the price</li>
            <li> Wrapped individually in paper.. very nice package presentation.  </li>
            <li> Smooth rich colors.</li>
            <li> Looks very pretty and doesn&#x27;t chip easily.</li>
            <li> I received this product earlier then the delivery date which I was super Happy.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t really respecting much in the way of quality...and was pleasantly surpised.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the colors, and they are exactly what I was hoping for in that aspect.  </li>
            <li> Love the polish, and drys fast!</li>
            <li> I am in love with these colors they are so pretty</li>
            <li> so pretty pastels, I love them 100%  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to get them</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clump, and glides on clean.</li>
            <li> As a licenced beauty professional I really think klean color is a great Polish for your money.  </li>
            <li> The colors are exactly what they look like, they paint on the same way the look in the bottle, one coat came out beautiful.</li>
            <li> just kind of attempt to buff it out - it actually worked OK for me.  </li>
            <li> Another pro is they are wonderful for stamping with and show up very well on either dark or light colors</li>
            <li> I got all the right colors &amp; the price was great for 6 nail polishes, also they do need atleast two coats to get the actual color</li>
            <li> Upon completion, you would still have to give it a good hour to dry, during which time it would smudge extremely easily.</li>
            <li> Tho its kinda hard to apply perfectly on your nails.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s coral and instead of the bright blue</li>
            <li> Use them for nail art instead of full nail, I think.</li>
            <li> but you need 2 to 3 layers before getting the true and homogeneous color.</li>
            <li> it is true, this polish doesn&#x27;t chip it peels...</li>
            <li> I do not think that is true .</li>
            <li> This is a good buy overall.</li>
            <li> So they would be more for doing before you go to bed, and just giving them the whole night.</li>
            <li> For the price these nail polishes were good enough.</li>
            <li> One good thing is that you only need one coat to achieve the color of the bottle.</li>
            <li> yellow was leaking and it didn&#x27;t look good .</li>
            <li> otherwise the others are true to color.</li>
            <li> They look lovely on so much so that my children were begging me ti paint theres as well.</li>
            <li> Love these colors soooooo much .</li>
            <li> The overall product is good, if it is for yourself.</li>
            <li> Also the bottles were full size.</li>
            <li> but it takes two or three coats to cover the nail not such a good polish</li>
            <li> I love the colors very spring like colors.</li>
            <li> Although all of the colors take multiple coats for full coverage, the colors are gorgeous and get lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> The delivery is super fast and I am so satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors easy to use and no more that 2 covers</li>
            <li> the colors are beautiful, although not super pastel.</li>
            <li> Pretty colors but chips easily</li>
            <li> color were very pretty and true.</li>
            <li> (Let&#x27;s face it, we all love trying new colors! )</li>
            <li> Loved it Im actually going to buy it again since I ran out of half of them lol</li>
            <li> Dries quickly.</li>
            <li> My favorite color is the mint blue color. :)</li>
            <li> But with a quick e-mail exchange over a two day period ...</li>
            <li> I contacted the shippers and they responded quickly and apologized for the error.</li>
            <li> She has used it and it doesn&#x27;t chip away quick</li>
            <li> I did.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re opaque and dries quite quickly.  </li>
            <li> [ i used super saver shipping ]</li>
            <li> The  price I paid was pretty cheap for a set of 6 full size</li>
            <li> Low quality ideal for beginners under 10 years old</li>
            <li> Dries quickly (about 3 minutes )</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very pretty colors, my niece loves them.</li>
            <li> Even though the colors are off they are still very pretty.</li>
            <li> Very pretty spring colors.  </li>
            <li> Very pretty.</li>
            <li> Colors are very pretty.</li>
            <li> and I have a nice top polish that doesn&#x27;t chip with other nail polishes.</li>
            <li> The colours are very pretty</li>
            <li> Very pretty colors.</li>
            <li> The polish are very pretty..</li>
            <li> very pretty colors</li>
            <li> Very pretty colors</li>
            <li> The polish is long wearing, chip resistant and a good consistency for application.  </li>
            <li> Arrived early, and the colors are just too cool!!</li>
            <li> Product was of higher quality than I figured it would be for such a good price.  </li>
            <li> Kleancolor always has well made polishes that usually only take 1 coat to fully produce a nice full polish on the nail.</li>
            <li> &amp; also it doesn&#x27;t really give off a strong smell.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, drys fast., stays onyour nails.</li>
            <li> Colors are exactly as they appear in the picture!</li>
            <li> Really pretty colors!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to see just how pretty and saturated the colors</li>
            <li> All my friends wants to buy a set now !!</li>
            <li> Colors are so pretty!</li>
            <li> great for little girls</li>
            <li> These polishes are very patchy and the colors are not photo accurate.</li>
            <li> I really thought this would be a cheap polish</li>
            <li> the pastel purple  is actually bright pink, if you want to take a chance, and if you have some cash to spend, then go for these.</li>
            <li> I was very nervous about these, because of the cheap price.</li>
            <li> I like to do the Konad stamping and plan to stamp them with white polish, although they&#x27;re just as nice alone.  </li>
            <li> The colors are worth it</li>
            <li> but I have many nail polishes and know when one is getting old or out of date and the Polish I received was gunky in texture</li>
            <li> The orange is my favorite orange i ever bought, which is unexpected, because I like pinks.</li>
            <li> cute af, although they were more neon-y then expected.</li>
            <li> I do always apply a top clear protective coat, and it&#x27;s done nothing.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27; ve used on several people they all liked thee polish.</li>
            <li> They arrived on time and are sooo worth the money</li>
            <li> Overall, I think they&#x27;re nice nail polish for the price</li>
            <li> When I relayed this to the company they were nice enough to offer replacements and wanted pictures.</li>
            <li> The girls had fun painting nails and hoping winter would come to an end.</li>
            <li> but still testing these out to see if I got my money&#x27;s worth 😕</li>
            <li> I just added some clear top coat to the bottle</li>
            <li> I did purchase a clear top coat just for a bit of shine.  </li>
            <li> The colors were really nice especially the peach and teal.</li>
            <li> The nail polishes dried in 15 minuets at the most, and the brushes are in good condition and paint very well.</li>
            <li> The picture is not accurate to the color, which I was happy about.</li>
            <li> She would just laugh at me.</li>
            <li> Three of the bottles broke in transit, and they were kind enough to refund me.</li>
            <li> The colors are fun, just know that you&#x27;re paying &amp;#60;$2 per bottle and set your expectations accordingly.</li>
            <li> , that I should have searched out more accurate pictures from other sellers and that i bought cheap stuff s</li>
            <li> Takes very long to dry especially as more than one coat is needed.</li>
            <li> Very pretty very soft and very feminine can&#x27;t wait I bought so many from you</li>
            <li> Colors are sharp, bright.</li>
            <li> Pretty much the only good thing bout this.</li>
            <li> this company made everything right within a matter of a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> Come to find out the reviews were right.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t bother keeping, threw it right in the trashcan.</li>
            <li> and they were right.</li>
            <li> The price is certainly right, and I like the color.</li>
            <li> I normally get at least 3 or 4 days of flawless mani before my polish starts to peel</li>
            <li> They came fast and shipping was clean.</li>
            <li> These are cheap and high quality.</li>
            <li> it was semi stringy and did not go on smooth like in the pictures I had to put several layers and a top clear coat to smooth it out for it looked chunky on my nails</li>
            <li> chips easy but just put a clear coat on it!</li>
            <li> These were very nice colors, although they are very sticky and somewhat gooey and never dry completely.</li>
            <li> Not worth all the effort, which is a shame because the colors are gorgeous.  </li>
            <li> They are kind of thick, and do not go on very smooth.</li>
            <li> I was hoping the pastel colors would be a little softer, but overall I am happy with the purchase!</li>
            <li> Super fast arrival.</li>
            <li> it shipped super fast</li>
            <li> They are beautiful and long lasting!</li>
            <li> Some good colors for less money, but you need atleast 3 coats to make it work.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors long lasting</li>
            <li> However, wow, it is unbelievably strong.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected for a cheap price :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with all the color that I bought, I&#x27;m actually wearing the Darker blue rigth now</li>
            <li> The colors are just what I expected, which I&#x27;m glad!  </li>
            <li> I ordered this polish and first, the shipping was super fast</li>
            <li> like is that they chip very fast</li>
            <li> I recieved these colors earlier then expected which I was super happy about.</li>
            <li> The other four colors apply very well and are super cute colors!</li>
            <li> These nail polish colors are adorable, and dry quickly.  </li>
            <li> , if you have short and square shape nails, they gonna look very pretty!!</li>
            <li> Pretty pastels.</li>
            <li> Pretty color</li>
            <li> but they hold up very well!</li>
            <li> I love them the only thing I dnt</li>
            <li> really enjoyed all the colors even the too very similar blues (pastel teal &amp; pastel</li>
            <li> These colors are really really pretty and pretty pastel too.</li>
            <li> I love them and will be doing my next acrylic set with the peach pastel color.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more Kleancolor brand nail polish.</li>
            <li> And I will DEFINITELY be ordering more kleancolor.</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t smell like regular nail polish, and that&#x27;s because it tons better than it.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s not too much of an issue for me at all!</li>
            <li> KLEANCOLOR was as nice as I expected</li>
            <li> I got it the day after I ordered it the product came individually wrapped to prevent breaking I love this company &amp; will be ordering again soon.</li>
            <li> The colors are so pretty</li>
            <li> The colors are exactly what they look like in the photo exept the purple and orange.</li>
            <li> I love the colors but the paint started to chip the very next day.</li>
            <li> The nail polishes look so pretty</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly as the picture looks like, and it isn&#x27;t gooey or anything.</li>
            <li> If you want your nail polish to last longer try using a top coat.</li>
            <li> so the color is exactly like it is in the bottle</li>
            <li> I first found out about KleanColor over a year ago</li>
            <li> She liked it, but she told me the color was lighter than she  expected.</li>
            <li> Pretty</li>
            <li> THE COLORS ARE SO PRETTY</li>
            <li> The colors are exact.</li>
            <li> It goes with my blonde hair and complection :)</li>
            <li> I waited until the estimated arrival date to call if it didn&#x27;t get to me, sure enough it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> They came out sooo pretty.</li>
            <li> These chip within the first day of using them--</li>
            <li> or it could show a bit more of the actual color on the nail.</li>
            <li> At some point the polish had cracked, it stayed on my nails but you can visibly see a crackling effect on the polish which is a first for me.  </li>
            <li> its so pretty.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have bought these first time was for my grand daughter.</li>
            <li> The colors are exactly as shown in the pic</li>
            <li> I particularly love the yellow color.</li>
            <li> so I just took it off, the colors are still really pretty tho.</li>
            <li> The colors are exactly how they are depicted in the picture.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loves all the pretty colors.</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty.</li>
            <li> Really pretty colors</li>
            <li> The only think that is OK with this nail polish set is the colors.  </li>
            <li> This was my first time buying nail polish from Kleancolor</li>
            <li> The colors look exactly like they do online</li>
            <li> All in all, these nail polishes are time consuming and worth too much effort to use, which the money I saved does not compensate for.</li>
            <li> This polish chips the first day it is</li>
            <li> got for teenage kids and they love.  </li>
            <li> For one, I had to wait like a month for these polishes because my package got lost the first time.</li>
            <li> The colors definitely come out as they look, which I&#x27;m glad about.</li>
            <li> Colors are really pretty, and you get a lot for you pay for.</li>
            <li> I will likely order more colors as well.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m definitely buying more.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves them!  </li>
            <li> This nail polish set is absolutely pretty.</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty.</li>
            <li> Requires few coats and dries in good time.</li>
            <li> but after a few coats it looks good.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend, shipped quickly without issue</li>
            <li> WOW!!!!</li>
            <li> they were all full size new bottles and colors......</li>
            <li> This nail polish is also the most durable and lasting than my collection of NYC Nail Polish, Sally Hansens, Pure Ice, and Sally Hansen&#x27;s Insta Dries.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more than $1 each, which is really cheap, so</li>
            <li> Other than that the colours are nice.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much from these considering how cheap they are, but I was happily surprised.  </li>
            <li> I know a manicure, and with a base coat, and a top coat, and after four days, they still look beautiful!</li>
            <li> with most Kleancolor polished they do take quite a bit to dry, but with a quick dry top coat it doesn&#x27;t really matter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> they have the same colors and they are amazing especially the brand fresh paint</li>
            <li> yellow and orange can&#x27;t even fairly be described as &amp;#34;pastel&amp;#34; and the other colors are either DARK or BRIGHT.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this to any one who wants exact pastel colors.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> I used all the colors but so far they&#x27;re not bad.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors, the only downside is that the lacquer chips easy on some colors, and is very thick on others.</li>
            <li> I plan to order more in the near future and Eye Candy Cosmetics will certainly get my business!</li>
            <li> , BUT THE ONLY THING IS THAT IT COMES OFF EASY.</li>
            <li> No problems with shipping, but the only thing is Kleancolor polish has a strong aroma..</li>
            <li> The smell is honestly not as bad as a lot of people make it out to be (I have Orly and Sally Hansen that smell worse), and after a good hand wash it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> Where as the colors in this set are super cute, I did have a little bit of a problem with chipping.</li>
            <li> so what I do is put a couple of drops of pure acetone in it to loosen it up</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m certainly convince this is made for kids.</li>
            <li> One top was loose and I lost some polish.</li>
            <li> The paint is nice and thick and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> I might have tried topping it with a fast dry top coat like Seche Vite</li>
            <li> So they apologized and sent me a new set right away.</li>
            <li> the polish is smooth and it gives my nails a nice thick coat of pastel color!</li>
            <li> The colors are really vibrant and pretty.</li>
            <li> but I put a little tiny non acatone nail polish remover in the bottles and they are perfect now not a big deal to me</li>
            <li> I have huge chips on multiple nails within 24 hours of application.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> As always with kleancolor, the add is very misleading..</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t really like it at all.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery...</li>
            <li> Dries fast</li>
            <li> the picture depicts the colors really well.</li>
            <li> The polish is very think.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Absolutely adore these polishes.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t flow very well.</li>
            <li> so much.</li>
            <li> Do not like they peel  out  fast</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE THESE PASTEL POLISHES.  </li>
            <li> I bought these not expecting much.</li>
            <li> It arrived and as soon as I opened the bottle, on all of them, it was very gooey, sticky, and clumpy.</li>
            <li> Need four layers to get the color and peels off wayyy too fast.</li>
            <li> It definitely is more in line with the hues of pink, NOT purple.</li>
            <li> I really wanted the pastel purple too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thankfully, there were no broken bottles and spilled nail polish.</li>
            <li> much my nail tec even asked me wher4e</li>
            <li> did I get the because she wants all the colors</li>
            <li> I really like the colors.</li>
            <li> The shipping was quite fast</li>
            <li> These are colors that you don&#x27;t see very often.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the orange pastel colour yet, but from the outside of the bottle, it seems too &#x27;light&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> it is really opaque color on application</li>
            <li> Dries fast with dryer.</li>
            <li> I bought these because I don&#x27;t really have any pastels.</li>
            <li> for the price, i guess i shouldn&#x27;t expect too much from this product.</li>
            <li> Seller is very prompt and in case you have a problem with the product or delay with delivery</li>
            <li> thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> Very gloppy.  </li>
            <li> They also worked really well for stamping designs.</li>
            <li> but it flakes way too fast</li>
            <li> There is a customer image that shows the real colors.</li>
            <li> I put two coats on with a gel type top coat and the next day I was already missing paint from the top part of my nails.  </li>
            <li> Polish is very clumpy no matter how much you shake it.</li>
            <li> Very plastic-ish.</li>
            <li> (filled out the necessary boxes on the return page and everything) but opted to save them to add variety to my collection.</li>
            <li> look very feminine</li>
            <li> These are very opaque and didn&#x27;t chip on me.</li>
            <li> I was very dissapointed with this purchase and will not reccomend it to ANYONE.</li>
            <li> * FAST delivery.&lt;br</li>
            <li> very striky and not pastel at all.</li>
            <li> That said, if the set wasn&#x27;t so cheap I would&#x27;ve left a one-star review.</li>
            <li> every few days add another stroke of top coat to keep your manicure looking fresh and shiny.</li>
            <li> The polishes aren&#x27;t opaque but aren&#x27;t sheer, and the colors were brighter than expected but still good.  </li>
            <li> but I got these in the mail yesterday and the colors are absolutely gorgeous and the polish itself is thick and covers in one coat.</li>
            <li> It tries very quickly too ;)</li>
            <li> But I mean good price for 6  bottles ..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten extremely into nail art here lately, and these are some of the greatest nail polish&#x27;s I have ever bought!</li>
            <li> Shipped fast, Nice colors and last long.</li>
            <li> This polish is not a name I am familiar with, and the price point is very low.</li>
            <li> other colors are good, took several coats to obtain a decent color.</li>
            <li> Also, as long as you paint on about 2 thin coats, you will have no drying problems and a beautiful and opaque polish!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll give it a decent review despite a flaw, because it was really inexpensive.</li>
            <li> might need to coat at least twice to get the opaqueness, rather spend more money get one color with full satisfaction.</li>
            <li> I got the package and was excited to try the colors which turned out to be beauuuuutiful, but I noticed that the bottles have already been used meaning they were smeared with polish on the sides and sine of them were kind of dry a little.</li>
            <li> Not that great one bottle was open very messy..</li>
            <li> Highly recommend and I will be buying again really soon.</li>
            <li> nail polish lids make you think they are screwed on all the way when they aren&#x27;t, they tighten just a little bit more, so make sure the bottles are completely closed before putting away.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just let it dry completely then applied my top gel coat over it.</li>
            <li> but if you let each layer dry all the way, you should be fine.</li>
            <li> I usually use 2-3 coats to get that nice salon look.  </li>
            <li> beautiful color, especially the purple one, however the yellow one makes my hand looks dark</li>
            <li> so they are much shorter than normal.</li>
            <li> The colors are true but I don&#x27;t like the brush, its to big.</li>
            <li> iIt&#x27;s no fun to get a beautiful manicure only to have it chip shortly</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros- color payoff is wonderful of course with a pastel that you can almost get on one coat they will be a little thick</li>
            <li> The colors are absolutely gorgeous and exactly what I wanted, even though the blue and teal and pink and orange are literally the same color.  </li>
            <li> honestly it&#x27;s hard to find nice polishes that are reasonably priced and don&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg for just ONE bottle.</li>
            <li> Love the large bottles with pale colors.</li>
            <li> Even when applying a light coat it takes well over an hour to dry.</li>
            <li> maybe some colors just make it appear thicker (more opaque) or lighter (less opaque) and allowing streaks to be visible</li>
            <li> The yellow color is a tad more sheer than the others but in 2 coats it is opaque.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> These are really nice pastel colors; the pink especially.</li>
            <li> Love the colors, but it takes a few coats to get the real color.</li>
            <li> Vibrant colors.</li>
            <li> While I love the colors, I don&#x27;t see myself using these polishes very often unless I have a few hours set aside to do my nails.</li>
            <li> The shipping was quick and each bottle was individually wrapped in bubble wrap</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s also decent nail polish.</li>
            <li> i just tried the blue and was so impressed there is nothing wrong i recomend this nail polish</li>
            <li> A gripe I do have is that even though I gave my nails a good hour or two before going to bed, when I woke up the next morning I had some molded indentations in a few of my nails I guess from the pressure of my head on my pillow with my hands underneath.  </li>
            <li> The package was received in a decent amount of time (about 3 business days) after ordering.</li>
            <li> Color is not transparent, but the two purple, to spread several layers of color will look plump, overall was OK.</li>
            <li> It comes in 5 colors, pastel blue, pastel orange, pastel yellow, pastel lavender purple and, my favorite....</li>
            <li> the color isn&#x27;t the same as Amazon&#x27;s... but still very pretty...</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these polishes.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> They both clump and do not dry right.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that they chip more easily than my Essie and opi polishes.</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy a set for my friends and it will make a nice Christmas gift for the other girls.</li>
            <li> I tried the pink, and that was fine, so I wonder if the peach was not prepared well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love the colors but sometimes the paint gets lumpy after you use it a couple times and you have to shake it up a little.</li>
            <li> Other than that, Some of the colors were cool!</li>
            <li> Goes on very thick but doesn&#x27;t give good coverage.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and arrived early.</li>
            <li> they last long without any chip :)</li>
            <li> though the price is relatively low, I still don&#x27;t think it worth the price, but nail polisher is not so creamy, some even seperate into two layers.</li>
            <li> These colors are really pretty and apply thick to the nail, so it doesn&#x27;t take many coats.</li>
            <li> but it had a green tint to it and most of the colors were translucent</li>
            <li> Normal, matt,matalic, oppque, sented, matalic &amp;matt.</li>
            <li> and they are normal sized nail polish&#x27;s</li>
            <li> It drys kind of slow</li>
            <li> * Kind of thick, but not gloopy.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Takes many coats which would be fine, if it went on smooth :(</li>
            <li> Colors are great but the durability is very poor.</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that my nails that usually last 2 weeks without chipping only lasted 8 days but for the price I am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> And my nails seemed fine from then on until the next 2-3 days before I noticed chipping starting to occur.  </li>
            <li> Love the colors, they turn your nails a little yellow like most nonexpensive nail polish, but as long as you use a base coat they are wonderful!</li>
            <li> I normally do two coats, and although some seem a little tricky to get right these polishes are definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I can live with it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to using nail polish because I was a tomboy all of my life.</li>
            <li> I contacted them and they rushed me a new set</li>
            <li> Polish is thick enough to get good coverage in 2 coats, and didn&#x27;t create air bubbles as a lot of other cheap brands do.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that the purple looks more like a darker pink instead of a lavender.</li>
            <li> The pink one in the middle of the picture in my favorite.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thinish and chips easily, also colors are not the same as pictured, the orange is like a salmony pink</li>
            <li> I just added glitter on top of the polish so that the thick coating wasn&#x27;t very noticeable.</li>
            <li> The only good thing I can say is that it is pretty thick, and a second coat might not be necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once the top coat is on let dry for three minutes then apply quick dry nail drops to make it dry faster.</li>
            <li> The clear coat over the pastel (purple is the color for this week!)</li>
            <li> But when I painted my nails with them they never dried!</li>
            <li> I open them up and instead of getting rhe pretty teal color that was in the picture</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait the blue is so pretty looking.</li>
            <li> The nail polish colors were pretty and the brushes were bigger</li>
            <li> Their mistake and they quickly fixed it!</li>
            <li> The colors where so pretty ,I only applied one coat,would buy this again.</li>
            <li> The Blue, Teal, and Yellow colors are accurate just like the picture, but the Pink is more of a bubble gum pink.</li>
            <li> Colors were true pictures, but when applied very clumpy like.. not smooth at all.</li>
            <li> These colors are undoubtedly beautiful, unfortunately, it chips in a day!</li>
            <li> Other than that, not bad at all.</li>
            <li> So, it could have possibly been one or more of the previously mentioned things as part of my lifestyle that contributed to the crackling effect.  </li>
            <li> Alright when I got this it was nicely packaged; but when I started applying one color onto my nails it was already very sticky idk if it was from leaving it in the cold to long, but it was how old nail polish gets sticky than you&#x27;d have to add nail polish remover or thinner to smooth it out.</li>
            <li> While the colors are really pretty, and almost accurately represented in the photos - the quality is not good at all.</li>
            <li> Nail Polish was sticky and old.</li>
            <li> well I only really have one and that is on the orange</li>
            <li> I guess I expected this polish to be thin and cheap, but it&#x27;s a much better quality.  </li>
            <li> So far no chipping, but I did add a topcoat of no chipping clear.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just old.</li>
            <li> Very transparent without multiple coats.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 12 year old niece and nearly kept it for myself.  </li>
            <li> AND THEY LASTED PRETTY LONG WITHOUT CHIPPING.</li>
            <li> Only needs 1 coat and dries fast .</li>
            <li> But when they came, i was so hapy surprised.</li>
            <li> I have purchased a few cheap ($1) nail polishes before and the smell can sometimes be unbearable</li>
            <li> nowhere near as orangey as the picture would lead you to believe.</li>
            <li> very pigmented, only needed one coat but used two.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap nail polish and one of the nail polish bottles was missing a brush...</li>
            <li> Cheap but not cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I waited nearly an hour</li>
            <li> This is a gift for my 11 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> but since these were hand wrapped not in a box perhaps filled by machinery, I can only assume someone either wasn&#x27;t paying attention to notice a bottle of bright pink polish in with the pastel purple/lavenders they were wrapping, or someone was color blind...</li>
            <li> &quot; it looks near purple -___- and</li>
            <li> All came wrapped individually and were not broken or leaking.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought these nail polishes to give as a gift to my 9 year old niece.  </li>
            <li> Not only fun but totally wearable.</li>
            <li> I love it, but it&#x27;s too thick.</li>
            <li> If you live in the northern states where winter gets quite long, these are a fun gift for a teenage/college age female.  </li>
            <li> I have several of their metallic polishes and they dry rather quickly.</li>
            <li> This being my first time buying Kleancolor nail polish, I think the colors are great, only bad part was</li>
            <li> Only complaint would be that the \\&quot;pastel purple\\&quot; wasn&#x27;t as light as I thought it would be but nonetheless a pretty shade.</li>
            <li> No mess though.  </li>
            <li> The teal and blue look very similar,  the orange is more of a coral,  the pink is a very cotton candy pink.  </li>
            <li> I like the colors but the orange was the exact same as the yellow</li>
            <li> Super thin, doesn&#x27;t last, I got what I paid for: cheap.</li>
            <li> The polishes seem fine, not old or goopy like other reviews, but my &amp;#34;pastel purple&amp;#34; is NOT the bottle that this picture shows.</li>
            <li> The seller Nail Essential is highly recommended as well.</li>
            <li> The polish is pretty thick and takes a while to dry and chips off easy</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful but these polishes are really bad quality.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time on my nails and very resistant to chipping.</li>
            <li> I threw all of the bottles in the trash because the smell was so strong &amp; potent that it have me a headache and made me feel sick.</li>
            <li> I can only use the on my fingernails and only if I&#x27;m quick quick otherwise it drys to fast and comes out a gloppy mess leaving a uneven finish.</li>
            <li> If you can get the same set new</li>
            <li> But they do dry up fast.</li>
            <li> and they dry really fast</li>
            <li> The only way I can extend it at all is to but a thick top coat on, and then dunk my hands in ice water to set them.  </li>
            <li> Like I said, not perfect but good enough.</li>
            <li> The quality is a bit off, the polishes are all a bit thick and flake easily</li>
            <li> Colors are pretty not exactly as picture.</li>
            <li> Bottles were sealed shut and a little hard to open the first time but other then that they are good.</li>
            <li> really love them all although the purple is a little dark</li>
            <li> Non streaky light colors are hard to find.  </li>
            <li> In general I like this polish</li>
            <li> I have just recently made the transition from acrylic to my natural nails</li>
            <li> I guess my nails didn&#x27;t completely cure even by that morning because I actually just used my fingertips to try to flatten out the molding and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s want I really wanted and expected.</li>
            <li> I am uploading a photo to help you understand just what colors these are, with a Sephora by OPI Natural Environ-mint polish next to the &amp;#34;teal&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It was so old and such crappy quality that it was nothing but unusable gunk.</li>
            <li> barely lasts 24 hours - chips and peels</li>
            <li> Polish to thick does not go on smooth</li>
            <li> so I didnt have any broken bottles :)</li>
            <li> These took forever to be delivered and the nail polishes are so thick it does not apply smoothly yo your nails.</li>
            <li> the, purple was dark and sheer and the orange was brown-ish, but I really think little things like that happening are part of the risk when ordering online instead of physically going to the store and picking things yourself, plus you wouldn&#x27;t have known the smell was strong in the store unless you sniff every</li>
            <li> The bottles are regular sized, not little mini bottles.  </li>
            <li> I used the base coat that I normally use (which works great with other polishes) and the usual top coat.</li>
            <li> I prefer the Sally Hansen Lively Lilac from their Insta Dri collection or the Wet N Wild Reject The Mainstream color in their 2015 spring line.</li>
            <li> Chips too easily even w a base and top coat.</li>
            <li> The blue and green are very similar but the colors are great and as with any pastel go over better with a white base coat</li>
            <li> Loved it, i expected a lesser quality but was shocked at the better quality than expected, definitely would buy again</li>
            <li> Colors are very nice but the quality is so bad.</li>
            <li> I added some nail thinner to thin it out, which is fine, but it makes me wonder how old these polishes were.</li>
            <li> colors are beautiful, but this chip very easily not very happy with it, i still use it but even with a nice coat and base coat and all that it still chip too soon.</li>
            <li> it looked different in the picture and the top of the lavender polish was broken.</li>
            <li> I requested to return the polish the seller responded saying they have sold &amp;#34;hundreds, if not thousands&amp;#34; of these sets and have never gotten a complaint saying they weren&#x27;t true to color, and that if I wanted to return them I would have to pay for shipping.</li>
            <li> If you do find that they chips just make sure to clean your nail with alcohol or non acetone nail polish remove before apply your base coat.</li>
            <li> The nail polish is very thick and does NOT go on evenly OR easily.</li>
            <li> to dry &amp; I&#x27;m pretty patient with my nails, but just takes a long time to dry</li>
            <li> I only gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because you do have to apply &#x27;at least&#x27; 2 coats before it gives you full coverage.</li>
            <li> and the pink is HOT PINK.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t even last a full 24 hours before at least one of my nails</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m torn between giving this product a bad review and and a good review.</li>
            <li> The ones that weren&#x27;t thick did result in a nice even color after two coats and the coats didn&#x27;t feel too thick on my nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes they had a strong smell that lasted longer than normal and yes the purple and orange colors were a bit disappointing</li>
            <li> There were comments about the thickness of the fluid, and I&#x27;m not sure if it really is a difference of formulation or</li>
            <li> However, the black caps are coming off, leaving the clear cap on the brush still in the bottle!</li>
            <li> The purple while not pastel, is the only opaque color and the only one that doesn&#x27;t dry patchy.</li>
            <li> The orange is ugly but the rest are very cute.</li>
            <li> I would be willing to guess that no one with a complaint bothered because of the shipping</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last extremely long</li>
            <li> My package didnt take long to get here, only about 3 days.</li>
            <li> and they last a long time on  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like for my polish to chip, and I want it to last a long time.</li>
            <li> I love the colors but the manufacturer really needs to fix this problem as it cost me 1/3 to 1/2 of the product out of each bottle, not to mention the mess it made in the box and made it very difficult to open the bottles.</li>
            <li> Pretty colors, but a lil thick</li>
            <li> the formula is on the thick side so make sure to apply as thin of coats as possible and allow a long time to dry completely or use drying drops.</li>
            <li> but that is nothing I can&#x27;t work around and not a major deal to me</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> Was afraid of not getting the pastel colors as so many others received completely different colors 😬</li>
            <li> unfortunately they chip out very quick</li>
            <li> it looks weird and its not really pastel but its a cute purple</li>
            <li> The only color that I have a problem with is the lighter pink color and the yellow.</li>
            <li> Yellow, pink, orange, teal, blue and purple.</li>
            <li> I received pastel pink (139), pastel purple (140), pastel blue (141), pastel teal (142), pastel yellow (143) and pastel orange (144).</li>
            <li> and I wore pink and yellow last week.</li>
            <li> Pastel Pink, Pastel Purple, Pastel Teal, Pastel Orange, Pastel Yellow, and Pastel Blue.</li>
            <li> but, the nail polish chips off the next day and does not last long kinda what&#x27;s expected for the price.</li>
            <li> deep red, deep purple, deep gold, deep green, BLACK and deep blue</li>
            <li> I had a nail art scheme planned around pastels  that included purple, I&#x27;m looking around for a purple that matches the same basic tone as my other pastels now.</li>
            <li> It chips off so easily that it is very frustrating.  </li>
            <li> Chipped off easily and the pale peach color and pale yellow color are very watery thin compared to the other colors.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just that using the polishes is unpleasant enough to warrant me giving them away and investing in nail polishes of better quality.</li>
            <li> However there was the slightest chip on the pink bottle which i only noticed when I ran my nail on the edge .&lt;br</li>
            <li> Long wearing nail lacquers that compliment all skin tones.</li>
            <li> The darker blue bottle was partially opened and some of the polish spilled out.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> The pink and yellow are my favorites!</li>
            <li> I end up getting another shade of pink that is very sheer</li>
            <li> I expected pastel mint, but I got 246 Lake Mist(like blue) instead of mint.</li>
            <li> It dried way too soft, however.</li>
            <li> I got 2 pink, 3 blue and a purple.</li>
            <li> As stated above, minimal streaking when being applied.</li>
            <li> Nail polish chipped away after 1 he after applying :-/ love the colors but poor quality</li>
            <li> The base of these pastels is so good that one coat will work.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take long to dry</li>
            <li> Takes long time to dry.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t like how it takes a long time to dry</li>
            <li> For these since the color is more difficult to get on your nails (they&#x27;re pastels!</li>
            <li> Will definitely get the other collection.</li>
            <li> it came earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> The other one was not even one of the colors shown, but a sheer color that was put in as a substitute.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed because like I said, the colors are beautiful.</li>
            <li> i like the colors however they take ages to dry.</li>
            <li> It also took AGES to dry.  </li>
            <li> and thy do take a while to dry.</li>
            <li> This polish takes FOREVER to dry.</li>
            <li> Let fully dry before applying the color.</li>
            <li> I was concerned it would dry out the polish, but if the polish doesn&#x27;t spill, then air might also still be blocked from entering and drying the polish.</li>
            <li> the polish is to sticky and gets all dry with a lot of bubbles.</li>
            <li> It takes a while to dry.</li>
            <li> Once dry, it leaves you with this &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; feeling on your nails that I can&#x27;t stand.</li>
            <li> But because each coat dried very slowly, simple basic nails would take up to two hours.</li>
            <li> A extra bottle of polish was included that was old and thick.</li>
            <li> The teal might as well be called &amp;#34;light blue&amp;#34; seeing as it&#x27;s only slightly greenish when compared to the other blue, which looks awfully grey.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because the pastel orange wasn&#x27;t closed tightly enough and a little spilled out into the bag</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said, the formula is thin and it took several coats to really cover my nails.  </li>
            <li> mine too had the black writing NOT the white as pictured</li>
            <li> and they litterly last less than an hour.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with the pink one, but, all the other colors are pretty too!!</li>
            <li> I like this set, it came without any breakage (which I was afraid of), wrapped up in a small package instead of box like expected, which was nice.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit thick but just make sure you have a base coat on first</li>
            <li> but.... product is not a strong polish, doesn&#x27;t last long before showing wear.  </li>
            <li> the only thing is when you keep using it it gets like gum, you know those little balls all the nail polish have well</li>
            <li> Chipped the same day, not just a little bit,  a lot.</li>
            <li> The colors are definitely pastel, but a little brighter than they look in the picture.</li>
            <li> On opening parcel the pink one had leaked a little, also the peach was not a pastel peach like in the pic but a sheer peach polish.</li>
            <li> It arrived earlier than expected and the colors are amaaaaazzzinngggg!!!</li>
            <li> Expect your nails to be soft for at least 1/2 hour.</li>
            <li> I wanted about an hour and the polish was still wet and rather tacky.</li>
            <li> They all came on time and on one piece, except for my pink.</li>
            <li> The is set is priced as the size of one bottle of opinion roughly. .  </li>
            <li> I expected 6 nail polishes not 5....</li>
            <li> the pink pastel colour</li>
            <li> but it is a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I also do not really like the colors, which are darker than they appear in the photo.</li>
            <li> and they still were fairly wet and tacky.  </li>
            <li> Wish I spent the money on a couple drug store colors instead.</li>
            <li> this items was what i expected</li>
            <li> Polish is actual similar to Essie, it&#x27;s thick and doesn&#x27;t need 2 coats.</li>
            <li> Got these in the mail the other day and waited to do some testing before posting a review</li>
            <li> other four colors were just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> i open my package to a scent of nail polish and one of the pink nail polishes was broken and spilt all over the yellow nail polish...</li>
            <li> All the other colors are comparable to the pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> compared to other kleancolor nailpolishes I&#x27;ve bought from downtown la</li>
            <li> I will buy other collections.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I received the polishes faster than expected!</li>
            <li> The other thing is the nails</li>
            <li> The only problem I found and the reason for 4 stars is the polish is very thick and takes a long time to dry.</li>
            <li> , blue and teal are the same color, pink and orange are the same color, messy, difficult to apply, takes a while to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it&#x27;s quite thick when putting on your skin and takes quite long to dry</li>
            <li> also noticed that a couple of the polishes were very thick compared to the rest, as if they were old or used.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But 5 out of the six bottles were old and gummy and very thick.</li>
            <li> Colors were as shown, which I was worried about due to a previous review stating they were darker.</li>
            <li> The Orange is a dark orange instead of pastel, almost like a carrot orange.</li>
            <li> The purple is to dark for me, I might give it away.</li>
            <li> I only have one complaint</li>
            <li> I opted to keep them because I figure my niece might like them, and it&#x27;s not worth throwing four bucks away to make a point.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that one of the caps came off.</li>
            <li> However I have painted my nails at least 10 times now and the chipping start the next day already.</li>
            <li> If u sandwich them with gel bonding, base and top coat</li>
            <li> I had bought this nail polish set and when I got it I found out one of my pink polishes were missing a brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Aside from that the actual polish is thick..</li>
            <li> polishes are thick enough to use to stamp, so they are just all around</li>
            <li> The price is low for two reasons: it&#x27;s made in China, and it dries painfully slow.</li>
            <li> I did use base and top coat</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ll break it down to pros and cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However along with the drying time i felt it need to be taken down a star.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t look watered down at all (like some of the crappier polishes on the market)</li>
            <li> They sent me the other 3 colors and even let me keep the duplicates!</li>
            <li> It engulfed my dorm room even though I had opened a window and turned on a small fan, and it lingered for a very long time afterwards- not just in the room, but on my hands.</li>
            <li> The polish itself usually needs at least one treatment of OPI Lacquer Thinner as the polish is a little too thick and doesn&#x27;t coat well at first.</li>
            <li> * even application (when dry, don&#x27;t freak over small streaks when applied.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing is that the polish is a little thick</li>
            <li> A couple coats at least will be required and it does take longer than other brands to dry.</li>
            <li> but this was so not worthy</li>
            <li> When they arrived two of them ( the blue and pink) ones caps had broken and spilt all over the others.</li>
            <li> Its like getting&lt;br /&gt;all six for less than a $1.25 each.  </li>
            <li> I made the mistake of painting my nails and finishing about half an hour before dinner, and my friends could smell it at the table while we were eating.</li>
            <li> The purple is dark, dark purple (where did they get their &amp;#34;pastel&amp;#34; definition from?!)</li>
            <li> It came with a little strip down the side as if it has been leaking.</li>
            <li> , sticky clumpy mess</li>
            <li> Way to sheer, not good coverage</li>
            <li> It is not a true pastel color.</li>
            <li> , I have to wash my hands often, and when I shower I start off hot and finish with a cold one.  </li>
            <li> Very thick and gooey and would not dry</li>
            <li> but they won&#x27;t last long unfortunately</li>
            <li> Fingernails were ok but somewhat drabby(DULL).But again,for the price,not bad!</li>
            <li> my brush is a little messed up</li>
            <li> I was a little reluctant to purchase this product based on some of the reviews stating that the colors are not as they appear.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little streaky but nothing another coat can&#x27;t solve.</li>
            <li> a little too thick and takes ages to dry!</li>
            <li> pastel baby pink!!!</li>
            <li> It does not include a green.</li>
            <li> The others were too gooey and thick, no thanks</li>
            <li> so I have a few pros and cons.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unless you like to paint your nails everyday, do not purchase this brand.</li>
            <li> The green and blue colors are basically the same which was disappointing.</li>
            <li> Once dried, expect to wear it a day or so before it starts chipping.</li>
            <li> but if you frequently change colors or have fake nails then this shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
            <li> I ordered this set a few months ago in April...</li>
            <li> I had a bit of trouble with the formula</li>
            <li> Applied clumpy and uneven.</li>
            <li> Just wish there was a green :D.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do want to add that I do use a bit of harsh chemicals for my job</li>
            <li> One of the nail polish was missing the brush</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s always chunky but thin at the same time</li>
            <li> 1 was broken when I open the package.</li>
            <li> waste of money.</li>
            <li> waste of money.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t mind that because I could give a few to my sister.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s not too much wasted if your order incurs equal or worse concerns than mine.</li>
            <li> they still have a slight pastel !</li>
            <li> so I figured I can tolerate it when other reviewers complained of the stench of these nail polishes.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers complained that the colors were off.</li>
            <li> The polishes are thin and require several layers, and dry very slow.</li>
            <li> A LOT of it and packed tightly!</li>
            <li> To bad, because like I said, the colors were so pretty.</li>
            <li> Lots of fun when you have those periods of going color crazy!</li>
            <li> However, the polish is very thick and takes forever to dry.</li>
            <li> bad texture and dried up so fast.</li>
            <li> It seems as though some people get the georgous colors pictured and thers get these half neon attempting to be pastel polishes that are thick and clumpy.</li>
            <li> The only downfall that I have come across is that the polish is too thin for one coat but too thick for two coats...</li>
            <li> After applying the polish, they chip HORRIBLY within the first 24 hours, and continue to chip off until you&#x27;re left with almost nothing within a few days.</li>
            <li> The bad reviews are right at least in my experience....</li>
            <li> It was thick even for the first use &amp; impossible for water marbling.</li>
            <li> Some of the colors were a little clumpy and hard to spread.</li>
            <li> The polish was actually a little thick and gummy.</li>
            <li> A little thick though.</li>
            <li> The orange was a little thick.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t small sample sized or anything.</li>
            <li> The brushes are kinda small.</li>
            <li> There was a small issue with the order</li>
            <li> I have not tried any of this set yet, but have used this brand in the past</li>
            <li> so I am not sure of the quality.</li>
            <li> Im not satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> they are thick and dried out</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> usually purchase Opi or Essie because I know that I am getting quality nail color.</li>
            <li> The purple and darker blue are very thin.</li>
            <li> Additionally, because it spread on very thinly, I often had to paint on three coats to achieve a solid color and get rid of the streakiness.</li>
            <li> All nail polishes have a chemical smell, but Kleancolor&#x27;s is noticeably worse than those of other brands.</li>
            <li> The handing was poor because 2 of the 6 nail polishes were chipped also a few of the colors were a few shades brighter than they look on the picture.</li>
            <li> could not help myself.it will take it least 5 months if not more to try them all</li>
            <li> it is also hard to come</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s kinda dull</li>
            <li> and I could hardly see the color on my nail..</li>
            <li> The colors were dull, besides the purple.</li>
            <li> but it is hard to use</li>
            <li> Hard to paint the nails.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re extremely hard to remove.</li>
            <li> The nail polish is a little bit thin</li>
            <li> /&gt;And as far as this being &amp;#34;quality&amp;#34; polish, it chipped badly within 24 hours.</li>
            <li> worst trash ever, nice colors but totally useless threw it in trash</li>
            <li> TAKES AT LEAST TWO COATS</li>
            <li> I thought it would have at least been a bit deeper</li>
            <li> but it goes on thick, gloppy, and unspreadable.</li>
            <li> The polish also seems thick and gloppy.</li>
            <li> Thin and even after two coats looked uneven and lackluster.</li>
            <li> BUT the Polish was thick and you will have to put nail polish thinner in them.</li>
            <li> The polish is thick and clumpy.  </li>
            <li> mine were really thick gooey.</li>
            <li> The polish is thick and nasty.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> They are a way too thick.</li>
            <li> Too thick to spread on a fingernail.</li>
            <li> The polish is just very thick, and a little hard to spread a even thin coat on your nails.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously worried about my health because it&#x27;s so stinky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> drag the polish into a disastrous mess!  </li>
            <li> Read other reviews that it was extremely thick and was hoping they were slightly exaggerating, turns out I made a crap purchase</li>
            <li> I did my nails Saturday night and they were peeling badly the very next noon.</li>
            <li> send to a female friend as gift, she likes the colors and they do not have bad smell like benzene</li>
            <li> Not good quality at all</li>
            <li> with that being said,the weird part is that when i started removing it,it was so hard to do,i had to rub really hard.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with my purchase the polish was way to thick and took forever to dry.</li>
            <li> Pretty colors but awful quality.</li>
            <li> I had a bad experience with these nail polishes because of the smell, time they took to dry, and thinness.</li>
            <li> I was seriously frustrated with the time it took them to dry though.  </li>
            <li> Very thick over time.</li>
            <li> It is very thick ,even after adding some remover,.</li>
            <li> Also the polish is very thick.  </li>
            <li> And all the colors are thin.</li>
            <li> If want the colors a bit darker just add either a white polish after your base or apply 3 coats.</li>
            <li> Problem is, two of the three polishes where broken.</li>
            <li> However, the peach color felt too thick on my nails and it was difficult to put on my nails without smearing.</li>
            <li> These polishes are a little brighter than they appear in the pricture, which isn&#x27;t a bad thing.  </li>
            <li> Very thick and difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> Although I wouldn&#x27;t recommend ordering nail polish online anyways, just because we don&#x27;t know how old it is, the consistency on these were terrible.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed with that.</li>
            <li> my seller gave me soem weird orange, that was like way</li>
            <li> Order them and you won&#x27;t be sorry.  </li>
            <li> wtf</li>
            <li> Was afraid to order because of the reviews that said the colors were broken</li>
            <li> I ended up throwing these away unfortunately.</li>
            <li> the orange was BIG letdown--it is AWFUL!</li>
            <li> you wont be sorry.</li>
            <li> this was possibly the worst buy ive ever had on amazon.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money on this crap</li>
            <li> However, I am not impressed by the thickness of the nail polish.  </li>
            <li> I gave the product two starts because although it is flawed, it is still usable.</li>
            <li> My nails would look awful the next day.</li>
            <li> My wife says she has to use three coats just to get the color even, and even then it&#x27;s not perfect.</li>
            <li> FALSE!  </li>
            <li> Very thin polish</li>
            <li> Very poor quality.</li>
            <li> but I was afraid it would just smear/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if was just my set, but the formula was terrible.</li>
            <li> and they compare well to some very expensive sets I have seen.  </li>
            <li> And because of this, the nail polish may look bad.</li>
            <li> on the product itself, the colors are not too bad.</li>
            <li> So, that wasn&#x27;t too bad.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think its that bad.</li>
            <li> Bad things though will make me never order this brand again.  </li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t stink really bad</li>
            <li> i didnt get the purple :(</li>
            <li> so disappointed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rather disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was hugely disappointed when my package arrived.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I am extremely disappointed in the product, the seller, and the let-down from my fellow Amazon reviewers.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be buying the sparkly ones anymore.  :(</li>
            <li> This nail polish is not perfect, but isn&#x27;t horrible.</li>
            <li> and I hate that cause</li>
            <li> I always swipe each nail with remover before applying polish and add a base coat.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews before purchasing this product and I got to say that I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> this is but was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m very disappointed</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> But the formula is absolutely awful and a pain to work with.</li>
            <li> But this brand of nail polish smells HORRIBLE..</li>
            <li> but the nail polishes are just horrible.</li>
            <li> This brand is terrible.  </li>
            <li> horrible paint.  </li>
            <li> but they are horrible when u try to Apply it to your nail.</li>
            <li> so nail polish thinners will just make it worst...</li>
            <li> The worst product ever!</li>
            <li> Plus the smell is rank!</li>
            <li> horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Great product! Love it!</li>
            <li> Just got it today!!!! All my colours are beautiful and soft and I love them!!!!</li>
            <li> Super fast arrival. Great spectrum of pastels. It does not include a green. They do have a strong smell (to my nose anyway). For the price I could not pass this up! Glad I came across this set!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the colors, and they are exactly what I was hoping for in that aspect.  The problem, however, is they only last a day, maybe two tops if you don&#x27;t do anything with your hands.  It chips off so easily that it is very frustrating.  The only way I can extend it at all is to but a thick top coat on, and then dunk my hands in ice water to set them.  Even all that only extend it maybe a day.  Not worth all the effort, which is a shame because the colors are gorgeous.  Use them for nail art instead of full nail, I think.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Pretty pastels. Love them! If u sandwich them with gel bonding, base and top coat the color lasts longer!! They are kind of thick, and do not go on very smooth. But if u put on a gel top coat, it will smooth it right out and it looks wonderful!!</li>
            <li> Where as the colors in this set are super cute, I did have a little bit of a problem with chipping.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly nice colors. Colors are sharp, bright. Love them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have any knowledge about nail polish quality, but I can tell you that these colors are beautiful. I am a big fan.</li>
            <li> This is a real good buy. I love the colors and adore how generous KleanColor is. I will buy again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Used them for a baby shower favor and they were a huge hit! Everyone loved them!!</li>
            <li> As always with kleancolor, the add is very misleading..the colors aren&#x27;t as vibrant as they look, I found if you pair this with their holo counterparts by kleancolor, they do look very nice for springy colors!</li>
            <li> i like the colors however they take ages to dry. it is also hard to come off.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: i have just realized i got totally different colors for two of the polishes .. but im not bothered by it because the wrong colors look so cute. instead of orange it&#x27;s coral and instead of the bright blue it&#x27;s kinda dull but it&#x27;s alright.</li>
            <li> These are great... Colors are pretty not exactly as picture. The orange is the only one I don&#x27;t like. And for the price.. The really good.</li>
            <li> Pretty color the only thing is when you keep using it it gets like gum, you know those little balls all the nail polish have well this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> varnishes are very good and I recommend</li>
            <li> Amazing . I love the nail polish</li>
            <li> So buying this again when I run out, in love with this.</li>
            <li> I love every color! Colors are exactly as they appear in the picture! It does take two coats of polish to cover.</li>
            <li> I just got this nail polishes couple of weeks ago. I tried the pink, yellow and orange so far. The colors are great but you need 2 to 3 layers before getting the true and homogeneous color. The brush is not the best; I would have like a larger one.  Once on my nails + top coat they last long without any chip :)</li>
            <li> So So.  Product seems to be OK but it took 2 weeks to receive it.</li>
            <li> These are beautiful colors! They don&#x27;t last extremely long but they hold up very well!</li>
            <li> Awesome formula love it!</li>
            <li> Got it as a gift for my friend and she loves the colors. The pastel colors look great.</li>
            <li> I love the colors their adorable !! I love them the only thing I dnt like is that they chip very fast they dnt even last 2 day!! But I mean good price for 6  bottles .. Oh and the smell is toooo too strong...</li>
            <li> Great item and looks so nice. I was so pleased with this.</li>
            <li> Now this is better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoyed all the colors even the too very similar blues (pastel teal &amp; pastel blue)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it is true, this polish doesn&#x27;t chip it peels... But love it anyway!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very pretty colors, my niece loves them.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this polish set I didn&#x27;t think it would be even close to the quality of Essie nail polish. However the quality is great and the formula is not thin or runny. The yellow color is a tad more sheer than the others but in 2 coats it is opaque.&lt;br /&gt;  My polish was mailed in a bubble mailer and there were no cracked bottles . However there was the slightest chip on the pink bottle which i only noticed when I ran my nail on the edge .&lt;br /&gt;  Many people suggest that the polish has a strong scent . I do not think that is true . The only time I smell the polish is when I put my nose up to the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;  I have been wearing this polish for a week without topcoat and there is no chipping at all .&lt;br /&gt;  This is a great purchase with a great price to match it</li>
            <li> These colors are really really pretty and pretty pastel too. The only thing is that the polish is a little thick so what I do is put a couple of drops of pure acetone in it to loosen it up but for the price you can&#x27;t beat it for some springy summer colors. They work great on acrylic nails but I used the purple pastel with my gel nails. I just let it dry completely then applied my top gel coat over it. It didn&#x27;t take long to dry I think because I thinned it out some before using. It might chip fast on natural nails if you don&#x27;t have a good &amp; good top coat. This is a good buy overall. I love them and will be doing my next acrylic set with the peach pastel color.</li>
            <li> Love this set.  There is one color that is really light and pithy that is why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.  The paint is nice and thick and dries quickly.  I would totally recommend this collection.</li>
            <li> Product was of higher quality than I figured it would be for such a good price.  Great Spring Colors, makes your toes look like a Rainbow !!!</li>
            <li> Nail Polish was sticky and old.</li>
            <li> These are really nice pastel colors; the pink especially. Use in well-ventilated area - they have a VERY strong smell.</li>
            <li> my seller gave me soem weird orange, that was like way sheer.and i didnt get the purple :( but thats okay, the rest of these are extremely pretty and really great pastels for spring</li>
            <li> The colors are great!! The base of these pastels is so good that one coat will work.  The polish is long wearing, chip resistant and a good consistency for application.  One of the best purchases that I have made on Amazon! I will definitely buy more Kleancolor brand nail polish.</li>
            <li> The polish was actually a little thick and gummy. Some of the colors applied better than others.</li>
            <li> Beautiful vibrant colors, but chip way too fast. would be a five star if it wasn&#x27;t for that.</li>
            <li> Good opacity. A little thick though.</li>
            <li> Comes off easily easily but not bad for the price</li>
            <li> The colors are great but the product seems to be cheap. Sticky nail polish that does not apply smooth and it peel off as soon as it dries.</li>
            <li> This nail polish is awesome! The colors in it, I haven&#x27;t been able to find anywhere else, plus it stays on pretty well and looks great.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much from these considering how cheap they are, but I was happily surprised.  As other reviewers have said, the formula is thin and it took several coats to really cover my nails.  It also took AGES to dry.  However, once all that was done with it lasted about 5 days without a top coat and close to a full week with one.  I&#x27;ll definitely be buying polish from Kleancolor again.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors, the only downside is that the lacquer chips easy on some colors, and is very thick on others. But a cute variety of tones. The seller got them to me in 3 days. Way quicker than was origionaly stated.</li>
            <li> Nice colors, but I&#x27;m certainly convince this is made for kids. I can put it on today and tomorrow it&#x27;ll fall off.</li>
            <li> Like the colors great for spring and summer</li>
            <li> Chips too easy. I won&#x27;t buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> I love that these came and how beautiful they are. They came early and i was suprised to fined they were perfectly wrapped so they wouldn&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li> Great price , excellent variety , excellent quality</li>
            <li> only got 5 bottles, it says 6. 1 was busted when I got the package. The others were too gooey and thick, no thanks</li>
            <li> Got these in the mail the other day and waited to do some testing before posting a review so I have a few pros and cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros- color payoff is wonderful of course with a pastel that you can almost get on one coat they will be a little thick but I put a little tiny non acatone nail polish remover in the bottles and they are perfect now not a big deal to me&lt;br /&gt; Another pro is they are wonderful for stamping with and show up very well on either dark or light colors&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was good and they were each wrapped in bubble wrap and looked like it was handled very well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons- well I only really have one and that is on the orange my brush is a little messed up but that is nothing I can&#x27;t work around and not a major deal to me I can live with it</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE COLORS., BUT THE ONLY THING IS THAT IT COMES OFF EASY., MAYBE USING TOP COAT WILL STAY ON LONGER</li>
            <li> When I received these Kleancolor pastel nail polishes I was thrilled; the colours are really pretty! But when I painted my nails with them they never dried! I wanted about an hour and the polish was still wet and rather tacky. I had to remove it and redo my mani with another polish brand. I might have tried topping it with a fast dry top coat like Seche Vite but I was afraid it would just smear/drag the polish into a disastrous mess!  This doesn&#x27;t appear to be an issue with all Kleancolor polishes, however. I have several of their metallic polishes and they dry rather quickly.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews before purchasing this product and I got to say that I&#x27;m very disappointed. The colors were pastel as described. However, these polishes don&#x27;t even last 24 hours. I did my nails Saturday night and they were peeling badly the very next noon. I used the base coat that I normally use (which works great with other polishes) and the usual top coat. I normally get at least 3 or 4 days of flawless mani before my polish starts to peel and it never peels so bad.&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed that a couple of the polishes were very thick compared to the rest, as if they were old or used.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t get any more from this brand.</li>
            <li> I loved these! The colors were all so cute! They applied well and didn&#x27;t chip or peel at all when using one coat. Definitely would buy again.</li>
            <li> I guess I expected this polish to be thin and cheap, but it&#x27;s a much better quality.  I have nail polish of different price points (mac, sally hansen, etc...) and I&#x27;m impressed with this polish and price.  I plan to order more sets.  These colors are true to the pictures and perfect for Spring.  I like to do the Konad stamping and plan to stamp them with white polish, although they&#x27;re just as nice alone.  Order them and you won&#x27;t be sorry.  The seller Nail Essential is highly recommended as well. Enjoy!!</li>
            <li> all except the purple were pastel colors. Happy with my purchase. Came packaged in bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> Takes long time to dry. I needed three coats. Beautiful colors. It does last overtime. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> I did my toes as soon as they arrived! Love these colors!</li>
            <li> I adore this nail polish. It doesn&#x27;t clump, and glides on clean. I coated my toe nails in the orange immediately, and got compliments on my toe nails and asked where I went! Beautiful colors.</li>
            <li> Came even before time. Girl recipient loved it!!!</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness! I&#x27;ve gotten extremely into nail art here lately, and these are some of the greatest nail polish&#x27;s I have ever bought! I gave someone I know a manicure, and with a base coat, and a top coat, and after four days, they still look beautiful! The only thing, is that some of the colors take three coats, some take two. and thy do take a while to dry. So they would be more for doing before you go to bed, and just giving them the whole night. But they&#x27;re just all around amazingly beautiful colors. And I will DEFINITELY be ordering more kleancolor. I also like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t smell like regular nail polish, and that&#x27;s because it tons better than it. Love it!</li>
            <li> Colors are very nice but the quality is so bad. I tried colors teal and pink so far. They both clump and do not dry right. They are a mess.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast, Nice colors and last long. But I don&#x27;t like how it takes a long time to dry and I don&#x27;t really like it at all. I&#x27;ll stick with Sally Hansen.</li>
            <li> Great value for the money.  You get 6 beautiful pastels that wear great alone or would be a perfect base or addition to your collection for nail artists.  Long wearing nail lacquers that compliment all skin tones.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVED the colors when I first saw them.&lt;br /&gt;I was not as impressed when I actually used them. I&#x27;m not sure if was just my set, but the formula was terrible. It was thick even for the first use &amp; impossible for water marbling. The colors are still great in person, but I don&#x27;t see using them very often because of the problems with application.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE the colors the service was AAA+++ but.... product is not a strong polish, doesn&#x27;t last long before showing wear.  But adore the colors.. Shipping and service second to none!  Price was fair for the product!</li>
            <li> Love the colors, but it takes a few coats to get the real color. But that&#x27;s not too much of an issue for me at all! The colors are worth it and I love the bottle designs!</li>
            <li> worst trash ever, nice colors but totally useless threw it in trash, sticky clumpy mess</li>
            <li> My 11-year-old daughter and I love the colors, love the price. However, the black caps are coming off, leaving the clear cap on the brush still in the bottle! I know it was a good price, but geez! This shouldn&#x27;t happen! (We also bought darker Kleancolors, but haven&#x27;t had a problem with those yet.) Watch out!</li>
            <li> Very beautiful colors. Great nail polises</li>
            <li> Pretty good and easy to work with polish! No problems with shipping, but the only thing is Kleancolor polish has a strong aroma..</li>
            <li> Great pastel colors,look good especially on toes! Fingernails were ok but somewhat drabby(DULL).But again,for the price,not bad!</li>
            <li> For the price these nail polishes were good enough. Yes they had a strong smell that lasted longer than normal and yes the purple and orange colors were a bit disappointing the, purple was dark and sheer and the orange was brown-ish, but I really think little things like that happening are part of the risk when ordering online instead of physically going to the store and picking things yourself, plus you wouldn&#x27;t have known the smell was strong in the store unless you sniff every bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The purple bottle was slightly open in shipping, so I lost a bit of polish. No mess though.  WARNING Kleancolor nail polish lids make you think they are screwed on all the way when they aren&#x27;t, they tighten just a little bit more, so make sure the bottles are completely closed before putting away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other four colors were just what I was looking for. My favorite is the pastel teel! The nail polish is a little bit thin but if you let each layer dry all the way, you should be fine. So far no chipping, but I did add a topcoat of no chipping clear. Like I said, not perfect but good enough.</li>
            <li> KLEANCOLOR was as nice as I expected and I would order it again.</li>
            <li> I ordered the kleancolor springtime pastel nail polish collection it shipped super fast I got it the day after I ordered it the product came individually wrapped to prevent breaking I love this company &amp; will be ordering again soon.</li>
            <li> I bought these items through the sellar fixON and oh boy do I regret it. It seems as though some people get the georgous colors pictured and thers get these half neon attempting to be pastel polishes that are thick and clumpy. The bad reviews are right at least in my experience.... mine too had the black writing NOT the white as pictured and they litterly last less than an hour. When I contacted the seller I was told no one else has ever had an issue so I shouldnt either, that I should have searched out more accurate pictures from other sellers and that i bought cheap stuff s what did I expect. Well I expect to recive the product that matches the picture and description in the listing which this does not. DONT buy this.</li>
            <li> As another reviewer mentioned, these arrived with 3 of the 6 bottles leaking.  I love the colors but the manufacturer really needs to fix this problem as it cost me 1/3 to 1/2 of the product out of each bottle, not to mention the mess it made in the box and made it very difficult to open the bottles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m torn between giving this product a bad review and and a good review. So I&#x27;ll break it down to pros and cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: fast delivery, absolutely beautiful colors, great price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Crappy formula (chips within a day), blue and teal are the same color, pink and orange are the same color, messy, difficult to apply, takes a while to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can see my dilemma. The colors are absolutely gorgeous and exactly what I wanted, even though the blue and teal and pink and orange are literally the same color.  But the formula is absolutely awful and a pain to work with.</li>
            <li> My package didnt take long to get here, only about 3 days. It was well package with the bubble wrap around it, no cracks, no nail polish spilled so that was a plus. The Blue, Teal, and Yellow colors are accurate just like the picture, but the Pink is more of a bubble gum pink. The Orange is a dark orange instead of pastel, almost like a carrot orange. And the Purple is way way darker than pictured. Even though the colors are off they are still very pretty. And the orange could be used for Spring, Summer, or Fall. The purple is to dark for me, I might give it away. I&#x27;m uploading two pictures, one with flash and one without. I just painted the colors on the box.</li>
            <li> I find these nail polishes to be my favorite. Kleancolor always has well made polishes that usually only take 1 coat to fully produce a nice full polish on the nail. For these since the color is more difficult to get on your nails (they&#x27;re pastels! they&#x27;re light!) it takes up to 2-3 coats to produce the fine color. The only color that I have a problem with is the lighter pink color and the yellow. They don&#x27;t turn out as nice as the rest. for the most part I mix the two pink/purple pastel colors on one nail and it turns out beautifully. I&#x27;m very happy about these nail polishes because they&#x27;re affordable and they&#x27;re great.</li>
            <li> I love the colors.... what I don&#x27;t like is that the color don&#x27;t last.. The second your nails comes in contact with water,the color start to come off</li>
            <li> Cute colors. Takes about three coats to cover nicely. Dries quickly.</li>
            <li> A couple coats at least will be required and it does take longer than other brands to dry. ok ok</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used some nail polish lets face it I LOVE nail polish and doing my nails but this was so not worthy</li>
            <li> The colors are so pretty but they are not the best quality of nail Polish. However,  I enjoyed them in the spring.</li>
            <li> Great price. Vibrant colors. Regular sized. These aren&#x27;t small sample sized or anything. They are sized just like a bottle you would buy in a store. The only problem I found and the reason for 4 stars is the polish is very thick and takes a long time to dry. Even when applying a light coat it takes well over an hour to dry. They smell very strong too. Use in well ventilated area.</li>
            <li> Polish to thick does not go on smooth</li>
            <li> Prefect color, spring color are amzing for tis time of the year.</li>
            <li> All the colors are nice easy so put on but you need 1 to 2 coats to make it solid. The colors are exactly what they look like in the photo exept the purple and orange. The purple is darker than the picture and the orange is moro of a peachy color. But overall its great nailpolish</li>
            <li> though the price is relatively low, I still don&#x27;t think it worth the price, but nail polisher is not so creamy, some even seperate into two layers.</li>
            <li> I love how these colors look they have good coverage and are nice and popping in color. Yellow, pink, orange, teal, blue and purple. Bottles were sealed shut and a little hard to open the first time but other then that they are good.</li>
            <li> polish didn&#x27;t even last one day before it started to chip off. Unless you like to paint your nails everyday, do not purchase this brand.</li>
            <li> Alright. Very thick over time. Don&#x27;t ombre/gradient well. Does not watermarble.</li>
            <li> Seemed like a great deal and the reviews said they were great quality. The colors are great but it goes on thick, gloppy, and unspreadable. Maybe it&#x27;s just old. I might get polish thinner and see if it helps...</li>
            <li> I love the colors but the paint started to chip the very next day. And the purple is darker than it is depicted in the product pictures.</li>
            <li> Great for the price and quantity. The quality is a bit off, the polishes are all a bit thick and flake easily but i love the selection it provides.</li>
            <li> I love the colors. They go on well. One top was loose and I lost some polish. Otherwise it is working well for me.</li>
            <li> While I love the colors, I don&#x27;t see myself using these polishes very often unless I have a few hours set aside to do my nails. This polish takes FOREVER to dry. One good thing is that you only need one coat to achieve the color of the bottle.</li>
            <li> The nail polishes look so pretty but one was leaking a bit and I hate that cause now it&#x27;s sticky .Save your money .The yellow was leaking and it didn&#x27;t look good .</li>
            <li> Beautiful color. Very sweet. I like it. Tho its kinda hard to apply perfectly on your nails.</li>
            <li> Ordered these for my daughter in law, she loves them.  We just ordered the summer set, can&#x27;t wait to get them!  Good quality at a great price!</li>
            <li> She likes the colors!</li>
            <li> The colors are very nice and arrived on time</li>
            <li> Great product...Fast delivery...An A+ experience!</li>
            <li> I love this set. I have two and I am giving one to a friend.</li>
            <li> I only gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because you do have to apply &#x27;at least&#x27; 2 coats before it gives you full coverage. Other than that, not bad at all.</li>
            <li> Kleancolor makes wonderful products comparable to OPI brand.  These are really quality polishes with beautiful pastel shades.  3 coats is just divine.  Get them!  Lasts a long time on my nails and very resistant to chipping.</li>
            <li> This is the best i have gotten and it is the best nail polish ever. It arrived earlier than expected and the colors are amaaaaazzzinngggg!!! when i run out i am definately gonna keep ordering more and more and more and more.</li>
            <li> Was afraid of not getting the pastel colors as so many others received completely different colors 😬 but I decided to take the risk since the price point couldn&#x27;t be beat. And to my fortunate surprise the colors were all as expected and in perfect order. Love the polish, and drys fast!</li>
            <li> Way to sheer, not good coverage</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing!!!! It&#x27;s exactly as the picture looks like, and it isn&#x27;t gooey or anything. It tries very quickly too ;)</li>
            <li> Used every color all together to create a great ombré gradient on my nails . Love using each color on its own as well.</li>
            <li> They all came on time and on one piece, except for my pink. It came with a little strip down the side as if it has been leaking. The colors are so beautiful. I&#x27;m new to using nail polish because I was a tomboy all of my life. This was a great way to start off. I think that this is a great buy for the price. If you want your nail polish to last longer try using a top coat. Happy Buying 👋👍&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I love this nail polish. It drys kind of slow but the finishing resualts a amazing for the price.</li>
            <li> I love colors and they did great job with packing!!</li>
            <li> Super cute and cheap. Polish is actual similar to Essie, it&#x27;s thick and doesn&#x27;t need 2 coats. Dries fast and I adore the colors, which like I said don&#x27;t need more than one coat so the color is exactly like it is in the bottle</li>
            <li> I was a little reluctant to purchase this product based on some of the reviews stating that the colors are not as they appear. I purchased them anyway since the price was so agreeable. I mostly disagree with the comments stating that the colors are not as shown. My only exception is the purple. It is not a true pastel color. It is on the darker side. I prefer the Sally Hansen Lively Lilac from their Insta Dri collection or the Wet N Wild Reject The Mainstream color in their 2015 spring line. otherwise the others are true to color. I Also heard of some of the reviews stating that they chip easily: they don&#x27;t. If you do find that they chips just make sure to clean your nail with alcohol or non acetone nail polish remove before apply your base coat. Let fully dry before applying the color. Once the top coat is on let dry for three minutes then apply quick dry nail drops to make it dry faster. every few days add another stroke of top coat to keep your manicure looking fresh and shiny.</li>
            <li> As a licenced beauty professional I really think klean color is a great Polish for your money.  The is set is priced as the size of one bottle of opinion roughly. .  The blue and green are very similar but the colors are great and as with any pastel go over better with a white base coat</li>
            <li> I only have one complaint I love the colors a lot but I have many nail polishes and know when one is getting old or out of date and the Polish I received was gunky in texture it was semi stringy and did not go on smooth like in the pictures I had to put several layers and a top clear coat to smooth it out for it looked chunky on my nails</li>
            <li> The green and blue colors are basically the same which was disappointing. They came fast and shipping was clean. If you ignore the fact that I can&#x27;t paint my nails....the picture depicts the colors really well.</li>
            <li> These polishes are an amazing deal! My only complaint is that they chip more easily than my Essie and opi polishes.</li>
            <li> Really pretty colors!</li>
            <li> I expected 6 nail polishes not 5....wtf i open my package to a scent of nail polish and one of the pink nail polishes was broken and spilt all over the yellow nail polish...I waited for this...really-_-</li>
            <li> Colors and cute but it starts cracking and chipping after a day</li>
            <li> I have tried all the colors. And all the colors are thin. You need to put several coats on. And because of this, the nail polish may look bad. But The colors are beautiful and love it! The brushes are kinda small. Wish it was bigger but it is fine. I love how well the handle of the brush is shaped well to hold. That is a plus. The Package arrived on time, no damage. My favorite color is the mint blue color. :)</li>
            <li> Came on time, packed well. The colors are exactly what they look like, they paint on the same way the look in the bottle, one coat came out beautiful.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this set of 6 colors that I purchased.  I first found out about KleanColor over a year ago and I&#x27;m hooked.  They come in all colors to chose from.  I had actually bought this set to replace the Pastel purple I had that ran out, only to find out that the pastel purple was not the same shade as the one I bought in the drug store some months ago but hey! It still works!! I get compliments no matter which color I wear and people are always asking where they can find this brand.  You can beat this price either!  I usually use 2-3 coats to get that nice salon look.  Works for me!!</li>
            <li> colors are beautiful, but this chip very easily not very happy with it, i still use it but even with a nice coat and base coat and all that it still chip too soon.</li>
            <li> I ordered this set of polish and it arrived as I was leaving town.  There was a small issue with the order and I could not address it until I returned.  But with a quick e-mail exchange over a two day period ... this company made everything right within a matter of a couple of days.  I have not tried any of this set yet, but have used this brand in the past so I know it will be just fine.  I plan to order more in the near future and Eye Candy Cosmetics will certainly get my business!</li>
            <li> I bought them for my friend. She liked it, but she told me the color was lighter than she  expected.</li>
            <li> These polishes are very patchy and the colors are not photo accurate. The teal and blue look very similar,  the orange is more of a coral,  the pink is a very cotton candy pink.  The purple while not pastel, is the only opaque color and the only one that doesn&#x27;t dry patchy.</li>
            <li> 3 star rating because-&lt;br /&gt;1. The darker blue bottle was partially opened and some of the polish spilled out.&lt;br /&gt;2. The box containing the nail polishes opened and the polishes were all over inside the box&lt;br /&gt;3. The purple and darker blue are very thin. I have to apply many layers of it.&lt;br /&gt;4. The orange isnt orange. The orange is more of a very light tan color.&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;br /&gt;Overall the product is very good besides those minor set backs. The other four colors apply very well and are super cute colors!</li>
            <li> These colors are the best! They ombré great and also watermarble great! These polishes are a one coat polish. They came quick in the mail and were packed nicely.</li>
            <li> These were very nice colors, although they are very sticky and somewhat gooey and never dry completely.</li>
            <li> Was afraid to order because of the reviews that said the colors were broken but I got these in the mail yesterday and the colors are absolutely gorgeous and the polish itself is thick and covers in one coat. The shipping was quick and each bottle was individually wrapped in bubble wrap so I didnt have any broken bottles :)</li>
            <li> When I saw these polishes, I loved the colors since I have been looking for good pastels. When I get the polishes, I got only got only three colors (two bottles of each of the same colors). I contacted the shippers and they responded quickly and apologized for the error. They sent me the other 3 colors and even let me keep the duplicates! I&#x27;m impressed by the service. My only problem is that instead of Pastel peach, I got sheer peach. Which leads me to give a 4 star rating. But I like the sheer polish as well, so it isn&#x27;t a big issue for me. Overall, I recommend this product to those who are considering purchasing this.</li>
            <li> the colors are beautiful, although not super pastel. Also, as long as you paint on about 2 thin coats, you will have no drying problems and a beautiful and opaque polish!</li>
            <li> I had bought this nail polish set and when I got it I found out one of my pink polishes were missing a brush.</li>
            <li> The pastel colors go on nice, they don&#x27;t chip easy and you don&#x27;t have to apply a coat over and over again. The orange is my favorite orange i ever bought, which is unexpected, because I like pinks. Everything shipped just fine too, they used bubble wrap. The only thing is that the purple looks more like a darker pink instead of a lavender.</li>
            <li> Cute colors, good value for the price! My teenage daughter loves them!</li>
            <li> I used bottom coat and top coat..still didn&#x27;t last a day. Pretty but doesn&#x27;t last. Chipped off easily and the pale peach color and pale yellow color are very watery thin compared to the other colors. Very transparent without multiple coats.</li>
            <li> THE COLORS ARE SO PRETTY</li>
            <li> Lol I don&#x27;t know why but I think these sme like bubble gum! And the reasons I said these were four stars was because you had to put a lot of coats to get the color you want!</li>
            <li> Ordered on 4/24, got them on 4/27!!! Super-quick delivery, as I was anticipating getting them between 4/30 - 5/5. I&#x27;ve used this brand polish before, so even though I have not used these colors yet, I know they&#x27;re great!! Love, love them!!!</li>
            <li> The polish is very think. U probably have to add acetone to losen.</li>
            <li> These are great pastel colors. They are great to add to your collection.</li>
            <li> Loved the colors! I bought these for girls in my family for christmas and everyone loved their colors! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Absolutely adore these polishes. They are beautiful and long lasting!</li>
            <li> The colors cake on the nails.  They don&#x27;t flow very well.</li>
            <li> Very pretty spring colors.  Goes on great.</li>
            <li> Some good colors for less money, but you need atleast 3 coats to make it work. Am glad I ordered them.</li>
            <li> I am in love with these colors they are so pretty I was very happy with them when they came in</li>
            <li> Awesome pastel colors and good polish too!</li>
            <li> The very excellent deal and I am pleased to deal with you again, and I will recommend my friends to this product.</li>
            <li> My daughter LOVES these colors. We were very happy with this purchase. Seller is also very nice and will resolve any problems you have quickly! A+</li>
            <li> Arrived before Easter (this was for my daughter&#x27;s Easter basket). Beautiful colors, perfect for Spring. She has not used the polish yet so I am not sure of the quality. Colors looked just like the picture.</li>
            <li> I love this colors&lt;br /&gt;And also fast shipping and good wrapping with them&lt;br /&gt;I love light orange one that color is so beautiful&lt;br /&gt;This is so good price too:)</li>
            <li> The colors are really vibrant and pretty. However, the polish is very thick and takes forever to dry. Once dried, expect to wear it a day or so before it starts chipping. Buy something else.</li>
            <li> I really thought this would be a cheap polish but then i read some reviews saying it was actually good so i bought it to see for myself. Come to find out the reviews were right. Its not sheer at all &amp; with 2 to 3 coats it looks great ! perfect pastel colors. I ordered this on Sunday and i just got it today on Friday. &amp; also it doesn&#x27;t really give off a strong smell. It actually smells kinda good lol.</li>
            <li> This polish doesn&#x27;t apply smoothly</li>
            <li> Love the large bottles with pale colors. Haven&#x27;t used them yet so don&#x27;t now how the polish goes on.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loved these because the colors look great it&#x27;s also decent nail polish. She has used it and it doesn&#x27;t chip away quick</li>
            <li> I love all the colors and have clothes for every color. The polish is pretty thick and takes a while to dry and chips off easy but if you frequently change colors or have fake nails then this shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
            <li> cute af, although they were more neon-y then expected. love them. so much. The pink one in the middle of the picture in my favorite.</li>
            <li> PRETTY, GREAT PRICE, A NICE COLLECTION.</li>
            <li> Would not buy this again polish was all sticky and could not use!</li>
            <li> beautiful color, especially the purple one, however the yellow one makes my hand looks dark</li>
            <li> The colors are exact. Very pretty. I cannot wait to use the different nail art options. If want the colors a bit darker just add either a white polish after your base or apply 3 coats. You will love it.</li>
            <li> The color is nice but, the nail polish chips off the next day and does not last long kinda what&#x27;s expected for the price.</li>
            <li> Polish goes on nail streaky, texture of polish appears to be dated.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 12 year old niece and nearly kept it for myself.  REALLY pretty colors and most of all, she totally loved it.</li>
            <li> Did not last even a day. Very thick and gooey and would not dry</li>
            <li> Love these pastel colors. The pink and yellow are my favorites! It goes with my blonde hair and complection :)</li>
            <li> Do not like they peel  out  fast</li>
            <li> While the colors are really pretty, and almost accurately represented in the photos - the quality is not good at all. After applying the polish, they chip HORRIBLY within the first 24 hours, and continue to chip off until you&#x27;re left with almost nothing within a few days. I do always apply a top clear protective coat, and it&#x27;s done nothing. While I will continue to wear the polish because I love the colors (they work great for spring/summer), it&#x27;s a hassle to have to take off &amp; re-apply the color every day.</li>
            <li> Bought collection for my daughter and she loves them. Colors were great and pretty opaque. Fast shipping and arrived early. Will definitely get the other collection.</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE THESE PASTEL POLISHES.  THEY ARE FUN COLORS AND LOOK REALLY NICE ON MY HANDS AND FEET.  I WOULD RECOMMEND THEM TO ANYONE.  TAKES AT LEAST TWO COATS AND I USED A TOP COAT ON THE LAST COLOR AND THEY LASTED PRETTY LONG WITHOUT CHIPPING.</li>
            <li> Best nail polish brand ever. I tried many from OPI to sally hansen and many more. Out of them all this was was the best. Only needs 1 coat and dries fast . The color for the spring collection is GREAT!! and i honestly want to buy all they have!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great  colors very good nail polish, I&#x27; ve used on several people they all liked thee polish. It is easy to use, drys fast., stays onyour nails.</li>
            <li> I ordered this set a few months ago in April...I was tracking my shipping and realized that the tracking was not working. I waited until the estimated arrival date to call if it didn&#x27;t get to me, sure enough it didn&#x27;t. So they apologized and sent me a new set right away. I open them up and instead of getting rhe pretty teal color that was in the picture I end up getting another shade of pink that is very sheer..I asked them about it and they said they&#x27;d run out (you&#x27;d think they would tell you that in the description)  but they would e-mail me as soon as they ship one out to me...its been 4 months...seriously&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that the actual polish is thick..a little too thick and takes ages to dry! I&#x27;m never purchasing from this brand ever again..so disappointed</li>
            <li> I have just recently made the transition from acrylic to my natural nails so they are much shorter than normal. I got these since they were pastel. I was so excited to see just how pretty and saturated the colors are.mits like having easter eggs for my hands lol. I got them in conjunction with the &#x27;oh yes, I do&#x27; set which has a beautiful clear sparkle polish in it. The clear coat over the pastel (purple is the color for this week!) makes it pop. I would highly recommend these polishes. Not only fun but totally wearable.</li>
            <li> I bought these not expecting much. But when they came, i was so hapy surprised. The colors were bright and soft. They look lovely on so much so that my children were begging me ti paint theres as well. I recomend to any and everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li> Loved it Im actually going to buy it again since I ran out of half of them lol</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful but these polishes are really bad quality. Although I wouldn&#x27;t recommend ordering nail polish online anyways, just because we don&#x27;t know how old it is, the consistency on these were terrible. It arrived and as soon as I opened the bottle, on all of them, it was very gooey, sticky, and clumpy. I ended up throwing these away unfortunately.</li>
            <li> This nail polish is beutiful i just tried the blue and was so impressed there is nothing wrong i recomend this nail polish</li>
            <li> Love these colors soooooo much . They came out sooo pretty. They arrived on time and are sooo worth the money</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors long lasting</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful &amp; the shipping was quick.. But this brand of nail polish smells HORRIBLE.. I threw all of the bottles in the trash because the smell was so strong &amp; potent that it have me a headache and made me feel sick.</li>
            <li> Dislike it.  Colors are very pretty. Pretty much the only good thing bout this. Need four layers to get the color and peels off wayyy too fast. S***tyyy</li>
            <li> I have purchased a few cheap ($1) nail polishes before and the smell can sometimes be unbearable so I figured I can tolerate it when other reviewers complained of the stench of these nail polishes. However, wow, it is unbelievably strong. I&#x27;m seriously worried about my health because it&#x27;s so stinky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More on the product itself, the colors are not too bad. Other reviewers complained that the colors were off. The only color that is off is the pastel purple. It definitely is more in line with the hues of pink, NOT purple. I&#x27;m rather disappointed. I really wanted the pastel purple too. All the other colors are comparable to the pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, there were no broken bottles and spilled nail polish. However, one of the nail polish wands were cracked. I was concerned it would dry out the polish, but if the polish doesn&#x27;t spill, then air might also still be blocked from entering and drying the polish. I&#x27;m okay with that. I&#x27;ve only tried the yellow, orange, purple, and pastel teal. The orange was a little thick. I added some nail thinner to thin it out, which is fine, but it makes me wonder how old these polishes were. The ones that weren&#x27;t thick did result in a nice even color after two coats and the coats didn&#x27;t feel too thick on my nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can stand the stench, if you&#x27;re okay the pastel purple  is actually bright pink, if you want to take a chance, and if you have some cash to spend, then go for these. It&#x27;s a little more than $1 each, which is really cheap, so I guess it&#x27;s not too much wasted if your order incurs equal or worse concerns than mine.</li>
            <li> I love them so.. much my nail tec even asked me wher4e did I get the because she wants all the colors</li>
            <li> I really like the colors. Im planning on buying more. These will make great stocking stuffers. or any kind of gift.</li>
            <li> These just came in today and I&#x27;m wearing the yellow color! The packaging was great, and they were well protected by a bunch of bubble wrap..A LOT of it and packed tightly! The shipping was quite fast and I got it in about 2 weeks! The colors are so bright and such nice pastel colors! The color isn&#x27;t opaque/watery and it dries fairly well! compared to other kleancolor nailpolishes I&#x27;ve bought from downtown la these are far by the best :)</li>
            <li> These colors are really pretty and apply thick to the nail, so it doesn&#x27;t take many coats. I love the Keancolor line!</li>
            <li> The colors are true but I don&#x27;t like the brush, its to big. The polish also seems thick and gloppy. I would not order again.</li>
            <li> I love the colors and it applies beautifully. My only complaint would be that my nails that usually last 2 weeks without chipping only lasted 8 days but for the price I am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> These chip within the first day of using them-- and I have a nice top polish that doesn&#x27;t chip with other nail polishes. Don&#x27;t do it!</li>
            <li> I love the bright colors.</li>
            <li> The customer photo lured me in but I am a huge fan of pastel colors so I got this. This being my first time buying Kleancolor nail polish, I think the colors are great, only bad part was I had a bit of trouble with the formula so I needed to apply 3 coats for some of the colors but nonetheless, great product and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I like these colors, and was happy to receive them. all of the colors are mostly similar to the colors in the pictures with the exception of the orange. the orange was BIG letdown--it is AWFUL! nowhere near as orangey as the picture would lead you to believe. I didn&#x27;t bother keeping, threw it right in the trashcan. other colors are good, took several coats to obtain a decent color.</li>
            <li> Love the colors but sometimes the paint gets lumpy after you use it a couple times and you have to shake it up a little.</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful and the application is perfect. I definitely recommend. I will buy other collections. This formula is just perfect.</li>
            <li> Very light colors.. I tried one and I could hardly see the color on my nail.. I thought it would have at least been a bit deeper or it could show a bit more of the actual color on the nail.</li>
            <li> These colors are so lovely!! really love them all although the purple is a little dark I&#x27;m fine with it! But don&#x27;t expect a lilac because I know they have a pastel lilac on their website so if u want an off white purple check their website. But this purple is still very lovely</li>
            <li> Colors were true pictures, but when applied very clumpy like.. not smooth at all. Takes many coats which would be fine, if it went on smooth :(</li>
            <li> Thank you love these colors and they last a long time on  your nails thank you!</li>
            <li> Applied clumpy and uneven. Thin and even after two coats looked uneven and lackluster. I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors, but they chip within 24 hours. iIt&#x27;s no fun to get a beautiful manicure only to have it chip shortly after- especially when you do it yourself! Some of the colors were a little clumpy and hard to spread.</li>
            <li> My grand niece just loves to pant her finger nails like a rainbow.</li>
            <li> These colors are undoubtedly beautiful, unfortunately, it chips in a day! I always swipe each nail with remover before applying polish and add a base coat. It made no difference with these! I&#x27;m very disappointed because like I said, the colors are beautiful.</li>
            <li> these are absolutely beautiful, however, the picture advertises six separate nail polishes and i have only recieved five.</li>
            <li> Love the colors!!! Just wish there was a green :D.&lt;br /&gt;As with most Kleancolor polished they do take quite a bit to dry, but with a quick dry top coat it doesn&#x27;t really matter.&lt;br /&gt;These polishes are thick enough to use to stamp, so they are just all around great.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I took off one star was the drying time and the smell. The smell is honestly not as bad as a lot of people make it out to be (I have Orly and Sally Hansen that smell worse), and after a good hand wash it&#x27;s gone. However along with the drying time i felt it need to be taken down a star.</li>
            <li> I love the vibrancy of these polishes!&lt;br /&gt;I was worried about how &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; they would be, but two coats (which is normal for all polish) and the color is steadfast and bright. I absolutely love and recommend these to anyone who paints their nails. you wont be sorry.</li>
            <li> The colors are just what I expected, which I&#x27;m glad!  I read some reviews about colors not being accurate so I was worried about that, but it wasn&#x27;t a problem for me.  There were comments about the thickness of the fluid, and I&#x27;m not sure if it really is a difference of formulation or maybe some colors just make it appear thicker (more opaque) or lighter (less opaque) and allowing streaks to be visible but I didn&#x27;t think it was a big deal either way, I just apply an extra layer or two if need be.  A gripe I do have is that even though I gave my nails a good hour or two before going to bed, when I woke up the next morning I had some molded indentations in a few of my nails I guess from the pressure of my head on my pillow with my hands underneath.  Some of my nails appeared textured like my pillow case.  I guess my nails didn&#x27;t completely cure even by that morning because I actually just used my fingertips to try to flatten out the molding and just kind of attempt to buff it out - it actually worked OK for me.  So, that wasn&#x27;t too bad.  And my nails seemed fine from then on until the next 2-3 days before I noticed chipping starting to occur.  At some point the polish had cracked, it stayed on my nails but you can visibly see a crackling effect on the polish which is a first for me.  I do want to add that I do use a bit of harsh chemicals for my job, I have to wash my hands often, and when I shower I start off hot and finish with a cold one.  So, it could have possibly been one or more of the previously mentioned things as part of my lifestyle that contributed to the crackling effect.  Overall, I think they&#x27;re nice nail polish for the price and I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> Very nice for spring and summer.  Work well for making nail art</li>
            <li> the liquid is too concentrated</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thinish and chips easily, also colors are not the same as pictured, the orange is like a salmony pink</li>
            <li> Really pretty !!! Especially the yellow and teal its so pretty. All my friends wants to buy a set now !!</li>
            <li> I expected pastel mint, but I got 246 Lake Mist(like blue) instead of mint. I was a little disappointed. I got it from KOLORIZE ME.</li>
            <li> the colours are very summery, and very good for the price!</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t pastel colors.  They are more neon than anything but for what I paid for it, I guess it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> There not the best things in the world I thought the yellow would be well..yellow but it had a green tint to it and most of the colors were translucent and I had to keep putting on more then two coats...</li>
            <li> These are colors that you don&#x27;t see very often. Although all of the colors take multiple coats for full coverage, the colors are gorgeous and get lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> I love pastel colors and these are very cute. Hopefully they will not chip off easily, the colors are nice.</li>
            <li> I received my nail polishes within the time period that it said it would be shipped by. It was wrapped fairly nice and the nail polishes did not leak. So that&#x27;s GOOD. :) Anyway, today I used the nail polish and the brush seems to be very good. The colours are very pretty but I must say, the orange pastel colour does not look like the one in the picture. I haven&#x27;t used the orange pastel colour yet, but from the outside of the bottle, it seems too &#x27;light&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;I painted my nails the pink pastel colour and it is FABULOUS! I am VERY pleased with the colour~! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, thumbs up! The quality is great and applies on smoothly! A MUST buy!!</li>
            <li> Great price. Goes on smooth</li>
            <li> Kleancolor is a beautiful brand of colors. The polish itself usually needs at least one treatment of OPI Lacquer Thinner as the polish is a little too thick and doesn&#x27;t coat well at first. But that has no reflection on the seller. Seller is amazing and faster than anticipated in shipping! Kudos.</li>
            <li> The colors are cute just need two coats of it the two blue colors are great my favorite the others are great two</li>
            <li> I like the colors but the orange was the exact same as the yellow it looked different in the picture and the top of the lavender polish was broken.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors, even coverage. In general I like this polish and I&#x27;ll give it a decent review despite a flaw, because it was really inexpensive. The price is low for two reasons: it&#x27;s made in China, and it dries painfully slow. Expect your nails to be soft for at least 1/2 hour. Despite that issue, the product is nice, the brushes are good size, and the thickness is about medium, so it won&#x27;t run all over the place. Those who prefer to use products like OPI and China Glaze will probably want to add a drop or two of polish thinner to achieve the ideal viscosity.</li>
            <li> I love all the colors.  2 or 3 coats are fine.  It does chip easily if u have your hands in water a lot, so be sure to wear gloves when washing dishes.  I would buy them all again.</li>
            <li> Nice polish, good price</li>
            <li> They are all extremely cute on my caramel yellowish skin color.  Just they chip off so easily and that annoys me because everytime I do my hair, which the polish on, it comes out in my hair.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors arrived soon</li>
            <li> The colors didn&#x27;t show up as well. I was a little disappointed with that. Other than that, Some of the colors were cool!</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have bought these first time was for my grand daughter. She loved them so much I had to get a set for myself. When they arrived two of them ( the blue and pink) ones caps had broken and spilt all over the others. When I relayed this to the company they were nice enough to offer replacements and wanted pictures. As soon as my grandson comes to visit he will show me how to get them from my camera to email. I can&#x27;t wait the blue is so pretty looking. Will definitely buy a set for my friends and it will make a nice Christmas gift for the other girls.</li>
            <li> I love, love these polishes...I&#x27;m not even sure how I found these, but really glad that I did.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re opaque and dries quite quickly.  For the price you can&#x27;t beat it.  Its like getting&lt;br /&gt;all six for less than a $1.25 each.  Plan on ordering more soon.</li>
            <li> I have stocked these colors at the upscale salon where I work. The coverage and finish are excellent. I would definitely order this product again.</li>
            <li> One of the nail polish was missing the brush i couldn&#x27;t use it the polish is to sticky and gets all dry with a lot of bubbles.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loves these.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s want I really wanted and expected.💜💜💜💜</li>
            <li> so pretty pastels, I love them 100%  Arrived early, and the colors are just too cool!!</li>
            <li> Amazing deal and adorable colors</li>
            <li> Smooth rich colors. Requires few coats and dries in good time.</li>
            <li> The overall product is good, if it is for yourself. They package them individually. So basically, if you were to give somebody this you would be giving them a handful of nail polishes. Also, they came with paint all over the outside of them, almost as if somebody had used them before. The color is wonderful, but it took over 2 hours for them to dry. So make sure you have the time before using them!&lt;br /&gt;Took about 2.5 weeks to come in.</li>
            <li> this was possibly the worst buy ive ever had on amazon. the polishes came opened and/or cracked with polish everywhere. not one was still in tact</li>
            <li> Ships fast and padded up well, so all of the polishes were perfectly intact!</li>
            <li> The colors were dull, besides the purple. Was expecting a beautiful yellow, and got a dingy color. The polish is good. Doesnt chip easy, but colors arent correct.</li>
            <li> If you live in the northern states where winter gets quite long, these are a fun gift for a teenage/college age female.  The girls had fun painting nails and hoping winter would come to an end.</li>
            <li> The orange is ugly but the rest are very cute. The blues are similar but they&#x27;re not the same color. All of these colors chip easily though</li>
            <li> Colors were as shown, which I was worried about due to a previous review stating they were darker. Polish is thick enough to get good coverage in 2 coats, and didn&#x27;t create air bubbles as a lot of other cheap brands do.</li>
            <li> These colors are amazing and exactly as shown in the picture. I received pastel pink (139), pastel purple (140), pastel blue (141), pastel teal (142), pastel yellow (143) and pastel orange (144). The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because the pastel orange wasn&#x27;t closed tightly enough and a little spilled out into the bag it was shippen in. Other than that they&#x27;re great!</li>
            <li> Pretty colors, but a lil thick</li>
            <li> THIS IS SINFUL NAIL POLISH. I AM CHRISTIAN AND I DONT AGREE WITH THIS SHEEET. I FEEL AS IF I SHOULD REPORT YOU TO JESUS</li>
            <li> These took forever to be delivered and the nail polishes are so thick it does not apply smoothly yo your nails. Read other reviews that it was extremely thick and was hoping they were slightly exaggerating, turns out I made a crap purchase and they were right. The colors are exactly as shown in the pic but the nail polishes are just horrible. Don&#x27;t waste your time and money on this crap</li>
            <li> This is simply the best  brand of nail polish i buy it when im at fairs an stuff in the summer is the only brand i have and the color range an the diffrents kinds its amazing. Normal, matt,matalic, oppque, sented, matalic &amp;matt. Its perfect i have so many beautiful colors &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I give this polish one star for color..It is very thick ,even after adding some remover,. Chips very easily. I would not&lt;br /&gt;recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love love love the colors, nice size bottles of nail polish and the polish is smooth and it gives my nails a nice thick coat of pastel color!</li>
            <li> Great for spring. very pigmented, only needed one coat but used two. price was good for this bargain. like all colors except yellow.</li>
            <li> I got the package and was excited to try the colors which turned out to be beauuuuutiful, but I noticed that the bottles have already been used meaning they were smeared with polish on the sides and sine of them were kind of dry a little. If you can get the same set new I recommend the colors they are very nice, also the price was quite good which made me not return the product it was not worth the hassle. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> It takes a while to dry.</li>
            <li> I will recommend the nail polish to my friends. The colors are so stylish and they matches with the Spring season. I particularly love the yellow color. The delivery is super fast and I am so satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I really liked the colors. Only complaint would be that the \\&quot;pastel purple\\&quot; wasn&#x27;t as light as I thought it would be but nonetheless a pretty shade.</li>
            <li> I love it, but it&#x27;s too thick. I need to buy thinner.....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great! You get all the colors and they&#x27;re all good quality :-)</li>
            <li> Very cute colors, and a great deal</li>
            <li> Great nail polish, very true colors....so happy with them and a great price! Would highly recommend, shipped quickly without issue</li>
            <li> Good nail polish for the price &amp; the colors show well with two coats. I used all the colors but so far they&#x27;re not bad.</li>
            <li> Very pretty colors. Fast shipping. Great price. Great quality.</li>
            <li> I love these nail polishes. They were so inexpensive i decided to go for them and i&#x27;m happy i did! The colours are just what i like and they have a nice shine. I normally do two coats, and although some seem a little tricky to get right these polishes are definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> The colors were fantastic. It dried way too soft, however. Just the lightest touch after 15min of drying time made everything smudge to the side. I&#x27;m sticking to OPI.</li>
            <li> pastel pink is too bright to be considered pastel!!  just a bit more words to be accepted. la la al</li>
            <li> I love these nail polishes! Perfect for any occasion and it made for an amazing Christmas gift to my sister.</li>
            <li> Good nail polish. The finished product looks very solid and shiny. Beautiful. And the colors of course are very nice.</li>
            <li> these nail polishes are very cute colors! perfect for spring! the bottles for the polish are really cute and look like tulips to me. the formula is on the thick side so make sure to apply as thin of coats as possible and allow a long time to dry completely or use drying drops. it is really opaque color on application so 1 coat is usually enough. the teal color in this set is the perfect tiffany blue imo, and i really love using it for a tiffany themed nail art look. all of the colors are creme colors with no shimmer in them.</li>
            <li> Pretty colors but chips easily</li>
            <li> Not that great one bottle was open very messy..</li>
            <li> I guess you get what you pay for. It&#x27;s cheap nail polish and one of the nail polish bottles was missing a brush...hmmmm. I wish I didn&#x27;t spend on this product. Go for good quality polishes not Kleancolor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect! Just what I expected for a cheap price :)</li>
            <li> Awesome colors! Nice,Soft and Springy! I often mix them 4 fingers Pastel orange and my ring Finger Teal..awesome combination!</li>
            <li> very nice selection of colors.  Wrapped individually in paper.. very nice package presentation.  colors are just as shown.</li>
            <li> Before ordering this nail polish I read most of the reviews and thought I was getting a great deal. I was hugely disappointed when my package arrived. The colors are not AT ALL like the picture. &amp;#34;Pastel&amp;#34; is being thrown around quite freely here.&lt;br /&gt;The yellow and orange can&#x27;t even fairly be described as &amp;#34;pastel&amp;#34; and the other colors are either DARK or BRIGHT. The teal might as well be called &amp;#34;light blue&amp;#34; seeing as it&#x27;s only slightly greenish when compared to the other blue, which looks awfully grey. The purple is dark, dark purple (where did they get their &amp;#34;pastel&amp;#34; definition from?!) and the pink is HOT PINK. I am uploading a photo to help you understand just what colors these are, with a Sephora by OPI Natural Environ-mint polish next to the &amp;#34;teal&amp;#34; for reference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as far as this being &amp;#34;quality&amp;#34; polish, it chipped badly within 24 hours. The only good thing I can say is that it is pretty thick, and a second coat might not be necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I requested to return the polish the seller responded saying they have sold &amp;#34;hundreds, if not thousands&amp;#34; of these sets and have never gotten a complaint saying they weren&#x27;t true to color, and that if I wanted to return them I would have to pay for shipping. I opted to keep them because I figure my niece might like them, and it&#x27;s not worth throwing four bucks away to make a point. I would be willing to guess that no one with a complaint bothered because of the shipping charges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am extremely disappointed in the product, the seller, and the let-down from my fellow Amazon reviewers. Save yourself the heartbreak and buy your polish elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Love It Get What You Pay For !</li>
            <li> I didnt like it at all</li>
            <li> Have to apply 3 coats to get true color, but otherwise, they are very cute colors. Dries fast with dryer.</li>
            <li> the nail polish sticky and comes in clumps and does not apply nicely</li>
            <li> The nail polish colors were pretty and the brushes were bigger BUT the Polish was thick and you will have to put nail polish thinner in them.</li>
            <li> I bought these because I don&#x27;t really have any pastels. I do see what people were saying about the color difference. I don&#x27;t think its that bad. If you want to lighten the color up, use a white nail polish under these that show work.</li>
            <li> These polishes are a little brighter than they appear in the pricture, which isn&#x27;t a bad thing.  The only issue I had is with the yello color.  The polish is just very thick, and a little hard to spread a even thin coat on your nails.  Other than that, I&#x27;m enjoying the product.</li>
            <li> for the price, i guess i shouldn&#x27;t expect too much from this product. but it is a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Very thick and difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with my purchase the polish was way to thick and took forever to dry. And I didnt receive the colors that were presented. Im not satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Good things:  The colors are great.  Bad things though will make me never order this brand again.  The polish is thick and clumpy.  The brushes lose their hair almost immediately.  This polish ad says that it is &amp;#34;chip resistant&amp;#34;.  FALSE!  I have huge chips on multiple nails within 24 hours of application.  And I wasn&#x27;t doing anything that should have chipped my nails.  This brand is terrible.  Would not recommend this brand to anyone. To bad, because like I said, the colors were so pretty.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors!!!!!</li>
            <li> Colors are so pretty! I ordered 3 of these sets... and they mistakingly sent me 2 and a different set. I contacted them and they rushed me a new set so I could have them for a baby shower. Their mistake and they quickly fixed it!</li>
            <li> Beautiful spring colors.</li>
            <li> Pretty good product! Seller is very prompt and in case you have a problem with the product or delay with delivery they are on top of it and you will be satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is ok!colors are beautiful,love all of them and especially for this price,but don&#x27;t expect your nails to last longer then 1 day(In the best case) unfortunately they chip out very quick</li>
            <li> i love the colors it gives me!</li>
            <li> Alright when I got this it was nicely packaged; but when I started applying one color onto my nails it was already very sticky idk if it was from leaving it in the cold to long, but it was how old nail polish gets sticky than you&#x27;d have to add nail polish remover or thinner to smooth it out. &amp; it takes FOREVER. to dry &amp; I&#x27;m pretty patient with my nails, but just takes a long time to dry so I just took it off, the colors are still really pretty tho. but still testing these out to see if I got my money&#x27;s worth 😕</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the colors :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it&#x27;s quite thick when putting on your skin and takes quite long to dry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, u can&#x27;t expect more from it since it&#x27;s just $1.81/item&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[ i used super saver shipping ]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After u finish it, it appears to be better&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;U should also apply a top coat to make the colors appear better</li>
            <li> Nail polish chipped away after 1 he after applying :-/ love the colors but poor quality</li>
            <li> I recieved these colors earlier then expected which I was super happy about. The colors are exactly how they are depicted in the picture. The quality of the nail polish is pretty good. This nail polish is deffinently getting me inot the mood for spring. I totally reccommend this polish!</li>
            <li> The colors where so pretty ,I only applied one coat,would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Came in very good condition in a timely manner! Haven&#x27;t tested the polish because it&#x27;s a christmas present but it doesn&#x27;t look watered down at all (like some of the crappier polishes on the market) so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be great!</li>
            <li> This is the last time I bother to buy this product or from this seller. I got the package today and was eager to use the pastel teal color. What I got instead was a nightmare. It was so old and such crappy quality that it was nothing but unusable gunk. Just stay away.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loves all the pretty colors.</li>
            <li> Nice color but chips easily</li>
            <li> WOW!!!! nice surprise when I received these, I was expecting sample size............they were all full size new bottles and colors......FANTASTIC SELLER&amp;#62;  an A+ in my book.........thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> Looks very pretty and doesn&#x27;t chip easily.</li>
            <li> Arrived as promised. Packaged correctly. A extra bottle of polish was included that was old and thick. I just added some clear top coat to the bottle and it was fine.</li>
            <li> Love the colors but the product is not to my liking.</li>
            <li> love the pastel color package, the quality is great for a very reasonable price. Would recommend to anyone! looks awesome on nails</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my sister and she loves the colors. honestly it&#x27;s hard to find nice polishes that are reasonably priced and don&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg for just ONE bottle. this is a great collection. thank you!</li>
            <li> The polish are very pretty.. the color isn&#x27;t the same as Amazon&#x27;s... but still very pretty... they all look lovely on.. they still have a slight pastel !feel about them, but worth the buy!!  Goooooo buy it!! lol</li>
            <li> horrible paint.  bad texture and dried up so fast.</li>
            <li> Very thin polish but after a few coats it looks good. The colors are pretty.</li>
            <li> I love these colors, and the lacquer goes on and dries smoothly and relatively quickly as well. Great for nail art.</li>
            <li> Very gloppy.  Streaked upon application and did not last.  I saw wear and chipping the next day.  I have already thrown all six away.</li>
            <li> Really pretty colors and they compare well to some very expensive sets I have seen.  I did purchase a clear top coat just for a bit of shine.  I am giving 2 more sets as gifts.</li>
            <li> The only think that is OK with this nail polish set is the colors.  However, I am not impressed by the thickness of the nail polish.  They do not spread smoothly on the nails and hence leaves a tacky look after they are applied.</li>
            <li> Very pretty very soft and very feminine can&#x27;t wait I bought so many from you could not help myself.it will take it least 5 months if not more to try them all</li>
            <li> I love it! what you see is what you get the colors are a tad bit lighter then shown.</li>
            <li> Awesome colors, love them!</li>
            <li> I received this product earlier then the delivery date which I was super Happy. It&#x27;s a bit thick but just make sure you have a base coat on first and you&#x27;ll be fine. I will be purchasing more colors.</li>
            <li> great price and colors but they won&#x27;t last long unfortunately</li>
            <li> These are cheap and high quality.</li>
            <li> Really nice color and good nail polish</li>
            <li> Chipped the same day, not just a little bit,  a lot. Super thin, doesn&#x27;t last, I got what I paid for: cheap.</li>
            <li> This nail polish was a value for the price I paid.  It goes on smoothly and just as important, comes off easily with remover.  I was hoping the pastel colors would be a little softer, but overall I am happy with the purchase!</li>
            <li> This was my first time buying nail polish from Kleancolor and I was pretty impressed. The colors were really nice especially the peach and teal. Also the bottles were full size. They also worked really well for stamping designs. However they chipped very easily. I put Sally Hansen no chip top coat on but they still would crack. Also they are probably the most toxic smelling nail polish I&#x27;ve ever purchased. Also the polish is very thick.  In the end I wouldn&#x27;t buy any more sets but the polish is okay.</li>
            <li> the color is well but it is hard to use</li>
            <li> Not good quality at all they are thick and dried out</li>
            <li> very pretty colors but gives a strong odor</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this to any one who wants exact pastel colors.&lt;br /&gt;You might need to coat at least twice to get the opaqueness, rather spend more money get one color with full satisfaction.</li>
            <li> send to a female friend as gift, she likes the colors and they do not have bad smell like benzene</li>
            <li> Do not like this brand of polish at all. Goes on very thick but doesn&#x27;t give good coverage. Takes very long to dry especially as more than one coat is needed. Will not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I was very nervous about these, because of the cheap price. BUT they are great, I love all the colors! Goes on beautifully!</li>
            <li> The package arrived ripped open with nothing inside. I don&#x27;t know who&#x27;s fault this is but was very disappointed. Recieved 0 out of 6.</li>
            <li> The only reason it it got a 2 star is because the color is really nice and pretty but they are horrible when u try to Apply it to your nail. You will never get a smooth coat it&#x27;s always chunky but thin at the same time so nail polish thinners will just make it worst... if u want cheat nail polish go to 5below they have the same colors and they are amazing especially the brand fresh paint</li>
            <li> Received the parcel with these and could smell that one had leaked. On opening parcel the pink one had leaked a little, also the peach was not a pastel peach like in the pic but a sheer peach polish. Other than that the colours are nice.</li>
            <li> I gave these to my niece as a birthday present and she loved them. Wasn&#x27;t really respecting much in the way of quality...and was pleasantly surpised.</li>
            <li> Lovely colors. Cheap but not cheaply made. I recommend, it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
            <li> so happy with this purchase colors are so pigmented and the polish doesn&#x27;t smell as strong as others polishes do</li>
            <li> I ordered this polish and first, the shipping was super fast and once I used the polish it was fantastic! The polish is the perfect thickness and only took two coats to achieve the desired look! Awesome polish!</li>
            <li> The polishes are thin and require several layers, and dry very slow. But that&#x27;s what you pay for, and the colors are nice. Problem is, two of the three polishes where broken.</li>
            <li> color were very pretty and true. good buy</li>
            <li> chips easy but just put a clear coat on it!</li>
            <li> They do the job but it flakes way too fast and you need multiple cotes to cover... I love the colors they come in...</li>
            <li> barely lasts 24 hours - chips and peels</li>
            <li> The colors are great, but the polish chips immediately.  I have tried everything to make it stop chipping off.  It won&#x27;t even last a full 24 hours before at least one of my nails has chipped nail polish.</li>
            <li> I like this set, it came without any breakage (which I was afraid of), wrapped up in a small package instead of box like expected, which was nice.  The polishes aren&#x27;t opaque but aren&#x27;t sheer, and the colors were brighter than expected but still good.  The only thing was that a couple of them are thicker than the others, like they&#x27;ve been sitting on the shelf for a while, but I was thinking of buying some nail polish thinner anyway.  Anyway, I would recommend them, just maybe check them on a piece of paper before you use them to test them.</li>
            <li> Very cute colors! But they do dry up fast. When painting your nails they go on nicely and they don&#x27;t stink really bad but there is a different scent to them for them being nail polish.</li>
            <li> but who doesn&#x27;t do that anyway?  these dry super fast and are great for stamping, very happy with them and love all my kleancolor polishes</li>
            <li> mine were really thick gooey. polish thinner helped but didnt spread evenly</li>
            <li> The colors look exactly like they do online and they are normal sized nail polish&#x27;s I am very happy that I went for the KleanColor nail polish&#x27;s instead of Essie sets.</li>
            <li> I had a bad experience with these nail polishes because of the smell, time they took to dry, and thinness. All nail polishes have a chemical smell, but Kleancolor&#x27;s is noticeably worse than those of other brands. It engulfed my dorm room even though I had opened a window and turned on a small fan, and it lingered for a very long time afterwards- not just in the room, but on my hands. I made the mistake of painting my nails and finishing about half an hour before dinner, and my friends could smell it at the table while we were eating. Additionally, because it spread on very thinly, I often had to paint on three coats to achieve a solid color and get rid of the streakiness. But because each coat dried very slowly, simple basic nails would take up to two hours. Upon completion, you would still have to give it a good hour to dry, during which time it would smudge extremely easily. All in all, these nail polishes are time consuming and worth too much effort to use, which the money I saved does not compensate for. I also do not really like the colors, which are darker than they appear in the photo. There is a customer image that shows the real colors. I gave the product two starts because although it is flawed, it is still usable. It&#x27;s just that using the polishes is unpleasant enough to warrant me giving them away and investing in nail polishes of better quality.</li>
            <li> The colors are really cute, like a matte color but it doesn&#x27;t last very long.  I put two coats on with a gel type top coat and the next day I was already missing paint from the top part of my nails.  I do wash my hands often, so that could be it also.  I won&#x27;t be buying the sparkly ones anymore.  :(</li>
            <li> I got a present. I like a good color and beautiful pastels.  I love it.  I like it.&lt;br /&gt;  Thank you.</li>
            <li> These nail polish colors are adorable, and dry quickly.  Great price for 6 different looks.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The worst product ever! Very poor quality.</li>
            <li> The pastels are great, I was given a lot of compliments on them. Will be great for Easter. The peach was the best.</li>
            <li> I bought this set because I loved the colors.  Most of the colors needed about 2 coats to fully cover the nail.  I was seriously frustrated with the time it took them to dry though.  I waited nearly an hour and they still were fairly wet and tacky.  There&#x27;s nothing more frustrating than painting your nails, waiting an hour, and having them get messed up!</li>
            <li> Do not buy.  Polish is very clumpy no matter how much you shake it.</li>
            <li> Junk! This polish chips the first day it is&lt;br /&gt;applied. The polish is thick and nasty.&lt;br /&gt;Even though the price is low, don&#x27;t waste&lt;br /&gt;your time or money!</li>
            <li> These were great Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It goes on my nails so nicely, and leaves a really nice finish. The only complaint I have is that one of the caps came off. I will definitly by this product again!</li>
            <li> The blues are close in color but haven&#x27;t used them yet.  This is a gift for my 11 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> Colors are nice. One nail polish was leaking. They are a way too thick. Hard to paint the nails. I was so excited to get them but I&#x27;m very disappointed</li>
            <li> Pretty colors but awful quality. I don&#x27;t even use them. Maybe this set would be okay for a one-day-wear type thing or for a child. Once dry, it leaves you with this &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; feeling on your nails that I can&#x27;t stand. Takes alot of coats to get opaque color, then peels and chips. Plus the smell is rank! Very plastic-ish. Wish I spent the money on a couple drug store colors instead.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved the colors</li>
            <li> The polishes seem fine, not old or goopy like other reviews, but my &amp;#34;pastel purple&amp;#34; is NOT the bottle that this picture shows. It&#x27;s a pastel fuschia color...in no way could it be mistaken for a purple. Not even close. I assume it had been mislabeled but since these were hand wrapped not in a box perhaps filled by machinery, I can only assume someone either wasn&#x27;t paying attention to notice a bottle of bright pink polish in with the pastel purple/lavenders they were wrapping, or someone was color blind...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I had a nail art scheme planned around pastels  that included purple, I&#x27;m looking around for a purple that matches the same basic tone as my other pastels now. :/</li>
            <li> It really looks great..The smell is not over whelming. ..even after a second coat . What more can I say.</li>
            <li> got for teenage kids and they love.  They state these are better than reg. nail polish</li>
            <li> For one, I had to wait like a month for these polishes because my package got lost the first time. Second, these colors do not look like how they appear online, especially the \\&quot;pastel pink\\&quot; it looks near purple -___- and the pastel purple looks like its got some stuff in it, like white nail polish...it looks weird and its not really pastel but its a cute purple so whatever. Just know, I&#x27;m never ordering from Mighty Gadget AGAIN.</li>
            <li> The package was received in a decent amount of time (about 3 business days) after ordering. There was no damage to the packaging or to my polishes. However, I ordered them for the spring/summer feel they gave off....PASTEL COLORS. The actual colors I received were metallic. There was not ONE pastel color in the bunch....deep red, deep purple, deep gold, deep green, BLACK and deep blue -_____-. I was so close to returning them (filled out the necessary boxes on the return page and everything) but opted to save them to add variety to my collection. The  price I paid was pretty cheap for a set of 6 full size polishes so I cut my losses and kept them but please be advised that you may not get the pastels!!!</li>
            <li> I received the polishes faster than expected! Some are thicker than others and the color looks best with two white polish coats and a top coat. Over all I am happy with the products and would definitely recommend buying.</li>
            <li> this items was what i expected very good  polishs</li>
            <li> colors are a described delivery prompt no cracks packes good</li>
            <li> I like the colors but it takes two or three coats to cover the nail not such a good polish</li>
            <li> Chips too easily even w a base and top coat.</li>
            <li> I love these colors and it delivered within 2 days of purchase. Highly recommend and I will be buying again really soon. A+ on the packing</li>
            <li> Goes on great, a pretty good polish. :)</li>
            <li> Just received this set of nail Polish and the colors are beautiful however delivery took forever other then that I&#x27;m happy with the colors</li>
            <li> Very pretty colors and i received a ton of compliments on the blue color. The only downfall that I have come across is that the polish is too thin for one coat but too thick for two coats...if that makes any sense. I just added glitter on top of the polish so that the thick coating wasn&#x27;t very noticeable.</li>
            <li> The colors with this Kleancolir nail polish are beautiful, look and feel like spring. Peach, pink,two shades of blue, yellow and an orchid/violet color. The price is certainly right, and I like the color. However, the peach color felt too thick on my nails and it was difficult to put on my nails without smearing. I tried the pink, and that was fine, so I wonder if the peach was not prepared well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually purchase Opi or Essie because I know that I am getting quality nail color. This polish is not a name I am familiar with, and the price point is very low. I opened all the bothies, and except for the Orange/peach, all the colors seem fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisron 02-03-15</li>
            <li> 1 was broken when I open the package. Cheap I throw them out</li>
            <li> The handing was poor because 2 of the 6 nail polishes were chipped also a few of the colors were a few shades brighter than they look on the picture. However my order came faster than they told me. The nail polishes dried in 15 minuets at the most, and the brushes are in good condition and paint very well.</li>
            <li> This nail polish is not perfect, but isn&#x27;t horrible. The colors definitely come out as they look, which I&#x27;m glad about. You only need one or two coats to get a solid color. The quality of the polish just wasn&#x27;t up to par though. Some of the polishes were kind of clumpy and it chips very easily. The polish will only stay on my nails for about a week, after that it&#x27;s all but chipped off. I don&#x27;t mind this too much because the quality of the colors was very nice.</li>
            <li> Very nice colors and decent quality</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with all the color that I bought, I&#x27;m actually wearing the Darker blue rigth now and I wore pink and yellow last week. Perfect color for this season. The other thing is the nails Polish were cheap which is even better.</li>
            <li> Came quickly! It&#x27;s a little streaky but nothing another coat can&#x27;t solve. Colors are really pretty, and you get a lot for you pay for.</li>
            <li> Colors are very good now for the downside I can only use the on my fingernails and only if I&#x27;m quick quick otherwise it drys to fast and comes out a gloppy mess leaving a uneven finish. And even try a different nail brush nope it&#x27;s the polish.😒 would not buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> Great price. Strong chemical smell though.</li>
            <li> these are the nail polishes i love the most from my collection!!!.. they are really really cute!.. look very feminine, if you have short and square shape nails, they gonna look very pretty!!.. i highly recommend them, you are gonna love them!!</li>
            <li> This is such a great deal for the price and quality of these polishes. These are very opaque and didn&#x27;t chip on me. The picture is not accurate to the color, which I was happy about. The colors are definitely pastel, but a little brighter than they look in the picture. I will list the polish names so you can look them up to get a more accurate idea of their true colors: Pastel Pink, Pastel Purple, Pastel Teal, Pastel Orange, Pastel Yellow, and Pastel Blue.</li>
            <li> as i said the colors look great and very pretty. but on the 2nd or 3rd day the polish started to chip:( and i dont even wash dishes or have my hands in the water all day! with that being said,the weird part is that when i started removing it,it was so hard to do,i had to rub really hard. i dont think i will be buying another set of this pilish</li>
            <li> Great price, product, and shipping arrival timing!</li>
            <li> Colors are great but the durability is very poor. I bought these for my girlfriend to surprise her and paint her nails. I didnt know anything about nail polish so i went by the reviews. i gave this a two star rating instead of one because the colors are awesome and look great for the first day or so. will be going with a different product brand next time</li>
            <li> Like the colors however the lacquer does not last</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty cute, all are amazing colors!</li>
            <li> The nail polish is very thick and does NOT go on evenly OR easily. I was very dissapointed with this purchase and will not reccomend it to ANYONE.</li>
            <li> OH MY GLOB!!!! it came earlier than expected! I&#x27;m so excited! (Doing my nails) ^w^</li>
            <li> horrible. cant even put on one coat without clumping. waste of money.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how these polishes would be, but I&#x27;m very satisfied. The colors are very true to what is shown on Amazon, and the polish bottles are full size, not samples. I use 2 coats, but I use 2 coats for almost any polish. I don&#x27;t like for my polish to chip, and I want it to last a long time. These polishes fit the bill and work for me. I will likely order more colors as well.</li>
            <li> Love the colors!  Arrived early too :) Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t have words to describe  my happiness i never did better purchase before i love it</li>
            <li> Color is bright but it never dries!!!!</li>
            <li> Love the colors, thank you.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t even last for 3 days! waste of money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like them at all,</li>
            <li> I love these nail polishes I got all the right colors &amp; the price was great for 6 nail polishes, also they do need atleast two coats to get the actual color but over all this is a great product (:</li>
            <li> Loved it, i expected a lesser quality but was shocked at the better quality than expected, definitely would buy again</li>
            <li> I love the colors very spring like colors.</li>
            <li> Love the colors, they turn your nails a little yellow like most nonexpensive nail polish, but as long as you use a base coat they are wonderful!</li>
            <li> Very nice ! I like the colors .</li>
            <li> Color is not transparent, but the two purple, to spread several layers of color will look plump, overall was OK.</li>
            <li> Non streaky light colors are hard to find.  These are great especially for summer toes.</li>
            <li> Great value and summery colors. The nail colors are the same as you see them. I love combining pinks and blues ...</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors easy to use and no more that 2 covers&lt;br /&gt;and is ready for use good quality item , come on time</li>
            <li> I got 2 pink, 3 blue and a purple. I didn&#x27;t mind that because I could give a few to my sister. However I have painted my nails at least 10 times now and the chipping start the next day already. I did use base and top coat but it wouldn&#x27;t make any difference. My nails would look awful the next day. I didn&#x27;t give any to my sister either. She would just laugh at me.</li>
            <li> Low quality ideal for beginners under 10 years old</li>
            <li> I ordered these polishes 3 days ago and they came today! I literally ripped my package open and I was so happy! I&#x27;m going to list all the pros and con&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* FAST delivery.&lt;br /&gt;* Beautiful colors that only need one coat for gorgeous color.&lt;br /&gt;* All came wrapped individually and were not broken or leaking.&lt;br /&gt;* Dries quickly (about 3 minutes )&lt;br /&gt;* even application (when dry, don&#x27;t freak over small streaks when applied.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* Kind of thick, but not gloopy.&lt;br /&gt;* As stated above, minimal streaking when being applied. Flattens out after dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love Kleancolor. I have 3 of their sets now and I&#x27;m definitely buying more. Try their metallics and mattes! Lots of fun when you have those periods of going color crazy! (Let&#x27;s face it, we all love trying new colors! )</li>
            <li> my niece will love this</li>
            <li> I bought these nail polishes to give as a gift to my 9 year old niece.  She absolutely loves them!  She changes her polish to match her outfits.  The bottles are regular sized, not little mini bottles.  These 6 bottles of nail polish were a very fair price.  I&#x27;d recommend these to anyone who likes to polish their nails.</li>
            <li> This product came well packaged and very beautiful colors.</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed with this product. Polish streaks when applied&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend any to purchase this nail polish</li>
            <li> Great! They look just like the picture!</li>
            <li> This was a very cute nail polish</li>
            <li> very striky and not pastel at all. they&#x27;re extremely hard to remove. don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> This nail polish set is absolutely pretty. It comes in 5 colors, pastel blue, pastel orange, pastel yellow, pastel lavender purple and, my favorite....pastel baby pink!!! This nail polish is also the most durable and lasting than my collection of NYC Nail Polish, Sally Hansens, Pure Ice, and Sally Hansen&#x27;s Insta Dries. I&#x27;m obsessed with the pink one, but, all the other colors are pretty too!! I have even got asked by my friends \\&quot;where did you get your nails done at???\\&quot; My answer: \\&quot;Uhhh...I did them myself....\\&quot; :)</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife for Christmas. Three of the bottles broke in transit, and they were kind enough to refund me. That said, if the set wasn&#x27;t so cheap I would&#x27;ve left a one-star review. My wife says she has to use three coats just to get the color even, and even then it&#x27;s not perfect. It then chips on almost every nail by the end of the day, even with a good topcoat. OPI and Sally Hansen last her 3 days before they get like this. The colors are fun, just know that you&#x27;re paying &amp;#60;$2 per bottle and set your expectations accordingly.</li>
            <li> Kleancolor pastels are beautiful.  Large bottles, good cover.</li>
            <li> great for little girls</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty. But 5 out of the six bottles were old and gummy and very thick. Too thick to spread on a fingernail. It just clumped in a glob on the brush. The other one was not even one of the colors shown, but a sheer color that was put in as a substitute.</li>
            <li> i love them i just started using these colors and they are amazing and they dry really fast i would recommend them to any body..</li>
