            <li>I have now started buying and using more of Andalou products as a result.</li>
            <li>I love Andalou products.</li>
            <li>There is a 200 $$ cream that I tried as a generous sample, which taught me that such products exist, but here is a great one at a good price, and with ingredients that haven&#x27;t sent me running.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this face cream.</li>
            <li>Love this brand.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just OK</li>
            <li>I love it all around.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, I guess.</li>
            <li>looking forward for better skin</li>
            <li>To me it is more of the &#x27;fragrance-free&#x27; type of scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;ve used it once and put on my vanity top where it sits.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Andalou products.  </li>
            <li>think I&#x27;m looking pretty good because of it  &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>This creams feels very good on the skin, absorbs quickly and completely within minutes.  </li>
            <li>It has all of the right ingredients to make it an effective product and it&#x27;s even affordable.</li>
            <li>It had a cooling affect a bit like Aloe Vera Gel and was easily applied without rubbing and stretching the skin.</li>
            <li>This product leaves skin silky smooth, and the feeling lasts all day; it also has a wonderfully fresh, light scent, and the low price on Amazon is a perfect bonus!</li>
            <li>I live in the desert, so a good moisturizer is a must.</li>
            <li>It has a wonderful scent and it goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly, not at all greasy.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a huge difference  since using these products in the texture, glow and clearness of my skin.</li>
            <li>It goes on light and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  </li>
            <li>Goes on with ease and leaves skin smooth.</li>
            <li>Not a miracle, but one of the few products that I was impressed by.  </li>
            <li>The cream melts on your skin, spreads easily and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Since using this line (and this cream along with the night Q10 cream specifically) I&#x27;ve noticed a reduction in the smile lines around my face and eyes!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many de-puffers and lifters, and this one really has produced the effect I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li>I think I see some results in terms of overall tightening, and it feels good going on</li>
            <li>Prone to clogged pores even over 50, I&#x27;m still concerned about mild break-outs....</li>
            <li>DMAE Lift and Firm cream has a light floral/natural fragrance that is a joy to experience.</li>
            <li>I am happy to report no break-outs and my skin feels very soft and smooth to the extent that I developed a habit of touching my face with the back of my hand just the experience the softness.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice regular moisturizer but nothing extraordinary.</li>
            <li>I love how it smells and feels on my 58 year old skin.</li>
            <li>had never heard of Andalou before and knew I was taking a risk in making the purchase, but it was well worth it.</li>
            <li>this product has never caused any rashes as many other top quality brands have given me over just a couple months time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s lightweight; smooths right in.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>She had a 50/50 chance of getting it right</li>
            <li>I can put make up on right after using it.  </li>
            <li>Even so, I will most likely continue to use it in conjunction with Andalou Naturals Super Goji and Peptide Cream.</li>
            <li>It really has tightened up my jowls and chin!</li>
            <li>Makes my skin so soft &amp; smooth and plumps up lines.</li>
            <li>Just started using for a first time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Really, this is the first brand I&#x27;ve tried that has a very high rating on EWG, and also works.</li>
            <li>It has an odd consistency buy goes on nicely.</li>
            <li>I have very fair sensitive skin and am sensitive to excessive fragrance.</li>
            <li>Seems to do a good job of moisturizing and my wife likes it, but as far as defying age, I decided to put it on half my face about six weeks ago, using it once or twice a day on the wrinkles around my eye and on my forehead.  </li>
            <li>I really like this moisturizer, especially for fine lines around the eyes.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I really noticed a difference when I used this.  </li>
            <li>The application is truly a pleasure to gently massage in.</li>
            <li>I use a light scrub for exfoliation and then moisturize so that the cream can absorb properly.</li>
            <li>After 20+ years of selling and using high end skincare as well as drug store brands, studying ingredients and attending many cosmetics schools I finally found a product I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li>Further, the appearance of my skin was improved with the first use and has continued to take on a fresh, well rested look in both smoothness and tone.</li>
            <li>I had previously used the andalou c cream and this one is so much better.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Amazingly, that thick clump that I dug out of the jar literally melted into my skin.</li>
            <li>Skin texture has improved and when I would smile, a wrinkle on the left side of my face would show and STAY -</li>
            <li>I got a sample of this at our local Fresh Thyme market and had to get it.  </li>
            <li>I love it and will continue to use year round.</li>
            <li>Of course the jury was still out until I made sure I wasn&#x27;t let with a greasy after-feel and that my pores didn&#x27;t clog up after a few days of use.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin due to strong medication I take yet</li>
            <li>It leaves a very soft feel yet invigorating sensation.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin very soft and not greasy or slimey.</li>
            <li>My skin is healthier and has less fine lines.</li>
            <li>In the case of Andalou Hyaluronic DMAE Lift and Firm cream, I was pleasantly surprised to find the good stuff (active ingredients) listed as the first several.  </li>
            <li>Am very happy to have found this product as it can be very difficult to find products that don&#x27;t contain a bunch of garbage ingredients that actually work.</li>
            <li>and I really can tell the difference in overall improvements to my neck and decollete.  </li>
            <li>It has a natural fruity smell.</li>
            <li>Product doesn&#x27;t really justify the extra cost.</li>
            <li>I am a &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; woman that has very oily skin and occasional breakouts but the product works for me.</li>
            <li>This cream really works with overall lifting and firming on the face and neck.</li>
            <li>I have used a number of &#x27;natural&#x27; creams.</li>
            <li>It may have contributed to some recent blemish problems, but I can&#x27;t tell which product might be responsible.</li>
            <li>It is completely non-greasy.</li>
            <li>I chose this particular cream based on the ingredients list on the back of the box.  </li>
            <li>It feels dry, I didn&#x27;t see much improvement in my skin texture.</li>
            <li>Since I have dry skin on my face, I don&#x27;t particularly like having to spread this cream on my face.</li>
            <li>I am 62 years old and regularly hear that I don&#x27;t look it.</li>
            <li>But would highly recommend for anyone with dry, non-acne prone skin!</li>

            <li> But would highly recommend for anyone with dry, non-acne prone skin!</li>
            <li> Due to an excessively busy time in my life, I had been neglecting my skin for several months and the signs were showing.  </li>
            <li> Not sure it really lifts and firms...</li>
            <li> I am not sure that it really does any lifting and firming, though.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used long enough.</li>
            <li> and hopefully it will benefit the skin in the long run</li>
            <li> However, the texture of the cream feels dryish, like Noxema used to feel a long time ago.</li>
            <li> This cream felt so soothing going on, and actually made a noticeable difference in my skin as far as small wrinkles and tightening loose skin.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, but I do wish they made bigger jars of this because I recently started using it on my ab area to tighten my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it daily for the past few weeks now, but I don&#x27;t see much of a difference yet.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this one, just don&#x27;t let the thick consistency scare you away.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Was looking for Hyaluronic acid &amp; DMAE cream.  Love this!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s lightweight; smooths right in.&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;m looking pretty good because of it  &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this line. I&#x27;ve seen a little bit of difference in my skin.  It goes on light and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  I recommend this product</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff! It really has tightened up my jowls and chin! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!! Would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Love it!! Noticed a difference after just a week! Am very happy to have found this product as it can be very difficult to find products that don&#x27;t contain a bunch of garbage ingredients that actually work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 6 months and I really can tell the difference in overall improvements to my neck and decollete.  It leaves a very soft feel yet invigorating sensation.  When I use my home humidifier it seems to intensify the effects.  I have sensitive skin due to strong medication I take yet this product has never caused any rashes as many other top quality brands have given me over just a couple months time. I have now started buying and using more of Andalou products as a result.</li>
            <li> I love Andalou products.</li>
            <li> This is an impressive product which lifts, tightens and moisturizes. I&#x27;ve tried so many de-puffers and lifters, and this one really has produced the effect I&#x27;m looking for. There is a 200 $$ cream that I tried as a generous sample, which taught me that such products exist, but here is a great one at a good price, and with ingredients that haven&#x27;t sent me running. Andalou is a great line.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this face cream. Noticeable difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Smells and feels good notice a difference in one week.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot BUT when I started using it twice a day, my skin began to get very dry and rough...Once a day is fine.&lt;br /&gt;Really, this is the first brand I&#x27;ve tried that has a very high rating on EWG, and also works. Seems to have a filling effect on those unattractive lines around my mouth. Lifting and firming, as advertised.</li>
            <li> This creams feels very good on the skin, absorbs quickly and completely within minutes.  It has a natural fruity smell. It does require some blotting as it is somewhat oily. Gives skin a nice glow.  Not sure it really lifts and firms...may be I haven&#x27;t used long enough.</li>
            <li> My wife purchased the Andalou Naturals Age Defying Hyaluronic DMAE Lift and Firm Fruit Stem Cell Science cream. Sounds impressive. Seems to do a good job of moisturizing and my wife likes it, but as far as defying age, I decided to put it on half my face about six weeks ago, using it once or twice a day on the wrinkles around my eye and on my forehead.  Today I asked my wife which side I had been applying it to and she picked the wrong side. She had a 50/50 chance of getting it right so it was not hugely obvious. $18.00 for less than two ounces would be OK if it worked, but there are much less expensive moisturizing creams.</li>
            <li> Love this brand. Have the serum, daily defense cream with SPF 18 and the night cream. Looking forward for the eye cream.</li>
            <li> I really noticed a difference when I used this.  After 2 jars, I tried something different &amp; immediately saw the wrinkles deepening again.  I will be going back to this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it daily for the past few weeks now, but I don&#x27;t see much of a difference yet.</li>
            <li> Goes on with ease and leaves skin smooth.</li>
            <li> Very good ingredients and hopefully it will benefit the skin in the long run</li>
            <li> Jury is still out ....</li>
            <li> It feels dry, I didn&#x27;t see much improvement in my skin texture. It&#x27;s just OK</li>
            <li> This is a nice regular moisturizer but nothing extraordinary. I like Burts Bee&#x27;s moisturizer equally and it&#x27;s less expensive. Product doesn&#x27;t really justify the extra cost.</li>
            <li> It is too soon to give 5stars to this kind of product, however Andalou never disappoints me. The product is not overly greasy with very light fragrance. I am a &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; woman that has very oily skin and occasional breakouts but the product works for me.</li>
            <li> This cream really works with overall lifting and firming on the face and neck. I have been using it for 2 weeks and am getting compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li> Been using for this for a few weeks and I&#x27;m already noticing/feeling a difference. For a while I had been bouncing back and forth between different creams, none of which worked and which only exacerbated my problem prone skin (lots of allergies!). Since using this line (and this cream along with the night Q10 cream specifically) I&#x27;ve noticed a reduction in the smile lines around my face and eyes! BINGO! I hope this company doesn&#x27;t go away anytime soon. I&#x27;m sticking to this from now on. Non-greasy, no breakouts or hives, no overpowering scent that makes me sneeze or my eyes water. Skin texture has improved and when I would smile, a wrinkle on the left side of my face would show and STAY - but now my skin bounces back. It truly is really pleasant. I will say that my skin itches a LITTLE bit, but with my experience in using hyaluronic creams..I attribute it to the cream penetrating the deeper layers of my skin to fight those present /smaller wrinkles before they show. I was also please with the ingredients.</li>
            <li> This product leaves skin silky smooth, and the feeling lasts all day; it also has a wonderfully fresh, light scent, and the low price on Amazon is a perfect bonus!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for about 6 weeks. I am on my second jar now.  I thought l I&#x27;d try it because Andalou Rose Body Lotion is the best.  I use the Rose foam face wash followed by the Rose spray toner and then this cream nightly.  My skin is healthier and has less fine lines.</li>
            <li> I love it all around. Takes away dullness without that greasy look and feeling. Also takes any swelling out of my face.I can tell a difference each time I use it.  A little goes a long way, but I do wish they made bigger jars of this because I recently started using it on my ab area to tighten my skin. I was ordering it on another site but will start getting here because the price is lower on amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, I guess. When I opened the jar my first thought was, &amp;#34; Oh my, did they switch this with Noxema cold cream?&amp;#34; Cuz it looks just like it!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick with my coconut oil and moroccan argon oil stuff.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this at our local Fresh Thyme market and had to get it.  I love how it smells and feels on my 58 year old skin. It makes my skin very soft and not greasy or slimey.</li>
            <li> This is a miracle cream. Makes my skin so soft &amp; smooth and plumps up lines. My husband is even using it. The scent is very light. We have been using it for about 9 months and are on our second jar. I had previously used the andalou c cream and this one is so much better. I&#x27;m 34 and prone to breakouts and although this cream appears thick and heavy it actually has prevented breakouts in my case and helped control oiliness! I love it and will continue to use year round. In summer I use the age defying beauty balm spf30 over it. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Loves this range of skin care. It just works brilliantly and so superb in doing what it is supposed to do - SKIN CARE!</li>
            <li> Just started using for a first time. great ingredients . looking forward for better skin</li>
            <li> My face doe s feel firmer with the cream.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cream from the randomness of skin care products at TJ Maxx (paid $10.00). Due to an excessively busy time in my life, I had been neglecting my skin for several months and the signs were showing.  I chose this particular cream based on the ingredients list on the back of the box.  The hyaluronic acid, DMAE and the newer, likely less studied, plant stem cell properties caught my attention. However, I always check the actual ingredient list before purchasing such a product.  In the case of Andalou Hyaluronic DMAE Lift and Firm cream, I was pleasantly surprised to find the good stuff (active ingredients) listed as the first several.  When I tried it the first time, I was a little hesitant because it felt thick as in having to sort of dig in with my fingertip. Prone to clogged pores even over 50, I&#x27;m still concerned about mild break-outs....but what the heck, I paid for, might as well try it. Amazingly, that thick clump that I dug out of the jar literally melted into my skin. It had a cooling affect a bit like Aloe Vera Gel and was easily applied without rubbing and stretching the skin. It felt wonderful. Of course the jury was still out until I made sure I wasn&#x27;t let with a greasy after-feel and that my pores didn&#x27;t clog up after a few days of use.  I am happy to report no break-outs and my skin feels very soft and smooth to the extent that I developed a habit of touching my face with the back of my hand just the experience the softness.  Further, the appearance of my skin was improved with the first use and has continued to take on a fresh, well rested look in both smoothness and tone. Others have commented on a pleasant, fruity scent which I have not noticed. To me it is more of the &#x27;fragrance-free&#x27; type of scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had never heard of Andalou before and knew I was taking a risk in making the purchase, but it was well worth it. I look forward to trying other products in this line. I highly recommend this one, just don&#x27;t let the thick consistency scare you away.  The application is truly a pleasure to gently massage in.</li>
            <li> I have used a number of &#x27;natural&#x27; creams. This is the best one I&#x27;ve found yet. It has a wonderful scent and it goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly, not at all greasy. I can put make up on right after using it.  I have noticed a brightness to my skin after using it. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because it contains DMAE. However, the texture of the cream feels dryish, like Noxema used to feel a long time ago. Since I have dry skin on my face, I don&#x27;t particularly like having to spread this cream on my face. It just feels like I am pulling on my skin to spread it. So, I&#x27;ve used it once and put on my vanity top where it sits.&lt;br /&gt;I think if it was reconfigured to have a creamier texture, I would try it again. But as it is, I will not try it again.</li>
            <li> I live in the desert, so a good moisturizer is a must. I really like this moisturizer, especially for fine lines around the eyes.</li>
            <li> I have been using it about a month. It has an odd consistency buy goes on nicely. Using it as a moisturizer. Not seeing any great &#x27;lifting and firming&#x27; results.</li>
            <li> Wanted an all-natural moisturizer that will balance my skin and it did the trick.  I got the toner and the night cream as well.</li>
            <li> This cream has a very nice fragrance and feels good going on.  I am not sure that it really does any lifting and firming, though.  Even so, I will most likely continue to use it in conjunction with Andalou Naturals Super Goji and Peptide Cream.</li>
            <li> I like this cream, and don&#x27;t mind the stiffish texture. I think I see some results in terms of overall tightening, and it feels good going on although I&#x27;m not sure how moisturizing it is. It may have contributed to some recent blemish problems, but I can&#x27;t tell which product might be responsible. For now, I&#x27;ve gone back to my standby, coconut oil, and my skin has cleared up. So the jury is still out. Weighing the benifits.</li>
            <li> After 20+ years of selling and using high end skincare as well as drug store brands, studying ingredients and attending many cosmetics schools I finally found a product I can&#x27;t live without. I have very fair sensitive skin and am sensitive to excessive fragrance. DMAE Lift and Firm cream has a light floral/natural fragrance that is a joy to experience. The cream melts on your skin, spreads easily and dries quickly. It is completely non-greasy. It makes your skin feel like velvet. I use a light scrub for exfoliation and then moisturize so that the cream can absorb properly. It does not have sunscreen in it so it is for useI look forward to cleansing every day just so I can treat myself to this product. It has all of the right ingredients to make it an effective product and it&#x27;s even affordable. I am 62 years old and regularly hear that I don&#x27;t look it. Thank you Andalou!</li>
            <li> This cream felt so soothing going on, and actually made a noticeable difference in my skin as far as small wrinkles and tightening loose skin.  Not a miracle, but one of the few products that I was impressed by.  Unfortunately, it made me break out, so I had to stop using it.  But would highly recommend for anyone with dry, non-acne prone skin!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Andalou products.  I have spent so much $$$ on expensive products and now realize I don&#x27;t need to.  These products are just as good and some better.  I have extremely sensitive skin often have irritation with some of the expensive products.  I have noticed a huge difference  since using these products in the texture, glow and clearness of my skin.</li>
