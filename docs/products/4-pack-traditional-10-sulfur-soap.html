            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m much happier using this plain old sulfur soap (that works) instead of a little bit of sulfur mixed in with a bunch of who-knows-what chemicals</li>

            <li> There is a faint smell of sulfur, but by morning(I use it in the evening)</li>
            <li> four bars of soap for your dirty, dirty, body mind and soul.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not noticed a sulphur odor nor has my son commented on any unpleasant sulphur smell.</li>
            <li> it isnt so bad.</li>
