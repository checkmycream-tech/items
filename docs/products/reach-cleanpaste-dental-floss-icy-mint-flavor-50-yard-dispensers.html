    <ol>
            <li>It is wonderful!</li>
            <li>Like I said, this stuff is so awesome</li>
            <li>&quot; what was formerly an excellent product.</li>
            <li>For me, this is best floss on the market!</li>
            <li>It does an excellent job of removing inter-dental debris.</li>
            <li>Best price online.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this floss!!!</li>
            <li>It has xylitol embedded in it, which is very very good for your teeth.</li>
            <li>Not as good as it used to be, but still a very good floss.  </li>
            <li>b) Great taste.</li>
            <li>It would be great if Amazon shows a close up photo of this floss.  </li>
            <li>But happily I can get it here, altho the postage expense hurts.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m happy to buy it in bulk at Amazon.</li>
            <li>It also has a great flavor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy to find it here at a good price.  </li>
            <li>I suspect you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gary</li>
            <li>The powder that they put on it is NOT the reason that I loved this product before; it was the fluffiness.. almost like embroidery thread.  </li>
            <li>I was never one to floss, but found this product superior to waxed floss and have been using it ever since.  </li>
            <li>good.    </li>
            <li>I have never found anything quite as good.</li>
            <li>Happy to be able to get this on-line.</li>
            <li>When I saw it on Amazon, I was very pleased.  </li>
            <li>Glad they selll it here!</li>
            <li>When I run out I will buy more!</li>
            <li>This stuff is absolutely the best.  </li>
            <li>I liked it.</li>
            <li>/&gt; Since it&#x27;s now gone (wth), I&#x27;m going to try making my own with that floss from the fabric store..</li>
            <li>Everyone has their own tastes for dental floss, but for mine, this is the very best floss by far.  </li>
            <li>It had a pleasant and lightly minty taste.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clearly the best out there:    </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>My kids love it though.</li>
            <li>Much better than flavored floss.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite floss, but I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.  </li>
            <li>It pains me that it&#x27;s not carried in stores any more.  </li>
            <li>Love woven floss:[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I really love this dental floss.</li>
            <li>This floss is more like a waxed floss.</li>
            <li>so I ordered it in bulk to make sure I didn&#x27;t run out for a while.</li>
            <li>I love the idea of this product, but my teeth shredded it to pieces.  </li>
            <li>This product works even better than the woven, and can get between my teeth</li>
            <li>Why* does it happen when you find a product you LOVE</li>
            <li>And because it was more fabric-y, it covered more area for a cleaner floss.  </li>
            <li>you know, that comes in many colours..</li>
            <li>Most floss breaks when I floss.</li>
            <li>We love the clean paste floss, you can&#x27;t find it in the stores &amp; nothing on the shelf compares to it; so I was Sooo glad to find it on Amazon in a 6 pk!</li>
            <li>Sometimes mint just doesn&#x27;t taste good right after I&#x27;ve eaten something... like an orange.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, this stuff is gentle, and tastes good, and after two uses is OK by me.</li>
            <li>It does a great job cleaning between my teeth and makes my whole mouth feel minty and clean.  </li>
            <li>The waxed ones slip in and out easily</li>
            <li>The floss is made up of woven fibers, looking almost like a rope, picking up all the yucky stuff easily.</li>
            <li>Never thought I would have a strong opinion on floss, but here I am.  </li>
            <li>It is much better than waxed floss, but it is not as good as the apparently discontinued variety they used to sell.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find it on amazon and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Fits comfortably and snuggly around the teeth.  </li>
            <li>My dental hygenist always comments on how easy my teeth are to clean because there&#x27;s no plaque.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;paste\\&quot; leaves a clean feeling in my mouth that seems to benefit my gums.</li>
            <li>It actually has some resistance when you floss, and it is perfect for sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>Cleanpaste is like the dental hygienist&#x27;s paste that scrubs the tooth clean, clean, clean.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s why we use microfiber cloths to clean with..</li>
            <li>In my opinion, this floss is clearly superior to the many other brands I have been using over the years.</li>
            <li>floss is / was so very special in that it was more like soft material instead of string or tape to slice your gums.  </li>
            <li>I love this floss so much.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good enough to order in bulk.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used glide and similar silicone flosses, but I never feel as though they are doing a good job cleaning my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Love the toothpaste embedded and the soft yet strong weave of this stuff.</li>
            <li>cuz I want to try/find new better floss</li>
            <li>In addition, my four year old love it.  </li>
            <li>And fresh breath.</li>
            <li>feel fresh.  </li>
            <li>The toothpaste powder is refreshing, minty and makes my mouth feel extra clean.</li>
            <li>The others are right.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the right thickness for my teeth</li>
            <li>This, because it was dry, served really well to rub off the surface of my teeth in a good way when I flossed and bent it around the tooth edge.</li>
            <li>I used to use the Reach &#x27;tarter control&#x27; floss which was woven and had a kind of dry powder on it.</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure this will be the only floss that will be used in my household from now on.</li>
            <li>Willing to stock up on the stuff by the case.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m glad to have finally found it!</li>
            <li>That being said, it&#x27;s still so much better than traditional floss, and gets all the goop out.</li>
            <li>But this product needs much improvement!</li>
            <li>Really?!?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll let you know how the homemade deal works.  ; )</li>
            <li>A word of advice - my mother does not like this floss particularly because she has large spacing between her teeth and prefers special floss that I can&#x27;t stand, so this will work for you if it is within your preferences.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it is no longer available at my local Target or Wal-Mart.  </li>
            <li>This floss is wonderful--even though it is many strands thick, it goes between my teeth easily</li>
            <li>So, it&#x27;s still a decent, pretty run-of-the-mill floss, but not at all</li>
            <li>He wants to floss all the time.  </li>
            <li>I probably sound like a commercial, but I couldn&#x27;t do without it!</li>
            <li>It may or may not be responsible, but I floss often and haven&#x27;t had a cavity for decades.  </li>
            <li>B001E96QJK Reach Gentle Gum Care Woven Dental Floss, Fluoride, 50-Yard Dispensers (</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve got medium size gaps) and glides very well but not slippery.</li>
            <li>This floss slides between my teeth AND cleans really thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>In any case, it cleans my teeth better than any other.</li>
            <li>This is not the same as the original cleanpaste floss.  </li>
            <li>I was very excited to find this product here at amazon because all the stores near me stopped carrying it a long time ago.  </li>
            <li>better-- especially after a recent crown where the gap is much tighter.  </li>
            <li>In any case, the Reach ties easily and the knot doesn&#x27;t slip nearly as much as with my other brands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite particular about my floss and flossing.  </li>
            <li>Pack of 6)]] is good, but has flouride, which seems to make my teeth hurt (dumb, I know, but it does).</li>
            <li>The coating is not dry and powdery and keep the the woven floss more like just one single strand.</li>
            <li>But, it&#x27;s better than plain floss, so we&#x27;re keeping it.</li>
            <li>This my favorite floss and the only one that works on my tightly spaced teeth without causing a lot of bleeding.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;d clear some misconceptions.  </li>
            <li>I had to tie knots in my old floss and rip it through my teeth...</li>
            <li>I frequent.  </li>
            <li>Much much better than a waxed floss, but not really a woven floss due to the coating.</li>
            <li>I hunted high and low for this floss.  </li>
            <li>This was a good find because it seems that any similar product in my little town is not available.  </li>
            <li>The mint flavor is pretty minimal.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite dental floss, but it has been next to impossible to fine in drug stores.</li>
            <li>The threads peels off between your teeth, and was very weak and can break easily if flossed a certain way.</li>
            <li>It is woven much more tightly, with a slightly waxed texture.  </li>
            <li>Also because of all those little fibers, it grabs and pulls the yucky stuff right out.  </li>
            <li>It is a positive trying a string-like texture instead of the conventional plastic-like texture.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not quite as soft and is a bit more difficult to slide between teeth.  </li>
            <li>The shipment was returned and duly refunded, but apparently this was not communicated within the organization well enough to prevent request for a review to be sent to me.</li>
            <li>I liked as much as I like this one and kept getting disappointed.</li>
            <li>Not to sound too gross, but I have a hard time with meat getting stuck up by my gums and NOTHING will get it out!</li>
            <li>If you rub yarn over a slick item it will get it clean..</li>

            <li> I had to tie knots in my old floss and rip it through my teeth...</li>
            <li> I frequent.  </li>
            <li> Much much better than a waxed floss, but not really a woven floss due to the coating.</li>
            <li> I hunted high and low for this floss.  </li>
            <li> This was a good find because it seems that any similar product in my little town is not available.  </li>
            <li> The mint flavor is pretty minimal.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite dental floss, but it has been next to impossible to fine in drug stores.</li>
            <li> The threads peels off between your teeth, and was very weak and can break easily if flossed a certain way.</li>
            <li> It is woven much more tightly, with a slightly waxed texture.  </li>
            <li> Also because of all those little fibers, it grabs and pulls the yucky stuff right out.  </li>
            <li> It is a positive trying a string-like texture instead of the conventional plastic-like texture.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not quite as soft and is a bit more difficult to slide between teeth.  </li>
            <li> The shipment was returned and duly refunded, but apparently this was not communicated within the organization well enough to prevent request for a review to be sent to me.</li>
            <li> I liked as much as I like this one and kept getting disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not to sound too gross, but I have a hard time with meat getting stuck up by my gums and NOTHING will get it out!</li>
            <li> If you rub yarn over a slick item it will get it clean..</li>
            <li> It had a strange blue/green color and seemed to squash flat in use.</li>
            <li> Never liked flossing much before this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I always cut a piece of floss a foot long and then tie the ends together to make a loop.</li>
            <li> Instead of an almost fluffy floss that really grabs anything lingering between the teeth, this new Cleanpaste is thin and not that different from other flosses.  </li>
            <li> What I received was several intertwined pieces of fluffy strings that I can only compare to what you would get if you snagged your polyester pant-suit, and pulled the thread off to floss your teeth.  </li>
            <li> The packages are very small - it seems that the manufacturer has reduced the length of the floss and the number of strands from previous packages, so you&#x27;re not getting as much for your money.  </li>
            <li> if this Cleanpaste stuff used to be fluffy: Try Spry Sponge Floss (don&#x27;t seem to have it on Amazon), which I bought in a local health food store.</li>
            <li> I did order Reach Cleanpaste Dental Floss, Icy Mint Flavor, 50-Yard Dispensers (Pack of 6)</li>
            <li> When you bring it up to the gumline, it won&#x27;t cut the gums because it&#x27;s stringy instead of sharp.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, although sold under the same name, it&#x27;s not the same product as when I last purchased this floss.  </li>
            <li> Ever since I stumbled upon this product, I do not care to use any other floss.  </li>
            <li> It slid easily between my tightly spaced teeth and seemed to cause much less cutting of the gum during use.</li>
            <li> My teeth are tough, except for this product, I&#x27;d have to go with the plastic stuff or the very fine (painful) regular floss.</li>
            <li> I have tightly spaced teeth and other flosses catch and shred or</li>
            <li> This cleanpaste stuff is made up of a bunch of thin fibers twisted together, and they can slip between teeth easily.  </li>
            <li> I have tight spacing between my teeth, so I&#x27;ve never liked regular floss because it shreds</li>
            <li> the waxed flat floss will cut my gums after being forced between my teeth.  </li>

            <li> I have some tight teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d put a little pressure on the floss to get it in</li>
            <li> Thank you for having a source for this as it is very hard to find in our local drug stores.</li>
            <li> However, my biggest complaint is that it is no longer the same thick, somewhat fluffy floss that it was previously.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one reason I disliked flossing.  </li>
            <li> This one, 50 yards, is not the heavy woven floss I had hoped for.  </li>
            <li> pull a few strands away, run it through some toothpaste &amp; see what happens.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent floss; it doesn&#x27;t tear, split, or get stuck, but it is too minty, leaving an artificial mint flavor in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s not good for getting the plaque and other \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; off the tooth surface.</li>
            <li> walgreen&#x27;s drugs used to carry it, but no more</li>
            <li> It cleans and glides so well, but why is it so hard to find in the stores???</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> At least that&#x27;d help me</li>
            <li> almost impossible to locate at local stores.</li>
            <li> it shreds, the thick floss is too thick and hurts and the thin doesn&#x27;t get anything out.</li>
            <li> Very confusing.  </li>
            <li> I prefer this shape to the thin tape style.</li>
            <li> They just seem to leave a coating of wax behind.  </li>
            <li> Was unable to find this product in stores anymore, the replacement was weak.</li>
            <li> A bit expensive but whatever.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, Amazon sent me a wrong item.</li>
            <li> I have always preferred the woven floss but am having a difficult time finding it.  </li>
            <li> The Glide is useless too..</li>
            <li> I got a sample from my hygenist and I am so afraid I&#x27;m going to run out</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s painful to use.  </li>
            <li> but it got everything stuck between the teeth out.. very unhappy.  </li>
            <li> It hurts sooooo bad!</li>
            <li> Feels terrible.</li>
            <li> Outrageous loss. &#x3D;</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This my favorite floss and the only one that works on my tightly spaced teeth without causing a lot of bleeding.  I was thrilled to find it on amazon and at a reasonable price. almost impossible to locate at local stores.</li>
            <li> We love the clean paste floss, you can&#x27;t find it in the stores &amp; nothing on the shelf compares to it; so I was Sooo glad to find it on Amazon in a 6 pk!</li>
            <li> I never thought dental floss would move me to do a review, but that was all before I tried Reach Cleanpaste Dental Floss! It is wonderful! Try it!  I am pretty sure this will be the only floss that will be used in my household from now on.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Never liked flossing much before this stuff.  The waxy, slippery floss sort of slides over the junk I&#x27;m trying to get out of my teeth and leaves it there.  I also have some tighter teeth and the waxy floss is all waxed together in a thicker clump.  I&#x27;d put a little pressure on the floss to get it in and sometimes it would \\&quot;SNAP!\\&quot; and hit the gums.  Ouch!  It&#x27;s one reason I disliked flossing.  This cleanpaste stuff is made up of a bunch of thin fibers twisted together, and they can slip between teeth easily.  Also because of all those little fibers, it grabs and pulls the yucky stuff right out.  I only wish they made one without the minty powder all over it.  Sometimes mint just doesn&#x27;t taste good right after I&#x27;ve eaten something... like an orange.  My kids love it though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this floss for over 3 years.  It&#x27;s clearly the best out there:    a) Fits comfortably and snuggly around the teeth.  When you bring it up to the gumline, it won&#x27;t cut the gums because it&#x27;s stringy instead of sharp.  You&#x27;ll never accidentally cut yourself with this floss.    b) Great taste.</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely the best.  Never thought I would have a strong opinion on floss, but here I am.  Willing to stock up on the stuff by the case.</li>
            <li> I love this floss so much.  It has a lot of texture and a toothpaste like substance (I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s actually toothpaste or not) built into the floss.  It does a great job cleaning between my teeth and makes my whole mouth feel minty and clean.  In addition, my four year old love it.  He wants to floss all the time.  Yay!!  Unfortunately, it is no longer available at my local Target or Wal-Mart.  I&#x27;m really happy to find it here at a good price.  It&#x27;s good enough to order in bulk.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this floss!!! It cleans and glides so well, but why is it so hard to find in the stores??? REACH, please don&#x27;t discontinue this product. I want no others but this!!!</li>
            <li> Was unable to find this product in stores anymore, the replacement was weak. Happy to be able to get this on-line. Much better than flavored floss. I prefer this shape to the thin tape style. The \\&quot;paste\\&quot; leaves a clean feeling in my mouth that seems to benefit my gums.</li>
            <li> my husband has fairly narrow spaces between his teeth and this floss really cleans without shredding or breaking. walgreen&#x27;s drugs used to carry it, but no more and amazon is the only place you can still get it. thank heavens for amazon.</li>
            <li> Yup, just like the rest of the reviewers, I too did not see myself as a &#x27;floss pusher&#x27;. However, this stuff is the bomb!! I can&#x27;t use regular floss b/c it shreds, the thick floss is too thick and hurts and the thin doesn&#x27;t get anything out. I got a sample from my hygenist and I am so afraid I&#x27;m going to run out I keep it for emergency use only! Glad they selll it here! Not to sound too gross, but I have a hard time with meat getting stuck up by my gums and NOTHING will get it out! It hurts sooooo bad! I had to tie knots in my old floss and rip it through my teeth... no longer! Like I said, this stuff is so awesome I will probably use it forever!!!</li>
            <li> It would be great if Amazon shows a close up photo of this floss.  That&#x27;d clear some misconceptions.  At least that&#x27;d help me cuz I want to try/find new better floss and I want to see it before I buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read the reviews of this dental floss (which I never used) and it SOUNDS like this is the floss you want, if this Cleanpaste stuff used to be fluffy: Try Spry Sponge Floss (don&#x27;t seem to have it on Amazon), which I bought in a local health food store. It has xylitol embedded in it, which is very very good for your teeth. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> This dental floss if used after meals gives the feeling of flossed and brushed teeth.  And fresh breath. You can only get in on the internet now.  When the stores stopped selling it last year, I kept trying all the others hoping to find one   I liked as much as I like this one and kept getting disappointed. Thats when a store clerk  told me to get it off the &#x27;net, So I buy the 6 pack from Amazon and it is cheaper than I  used to pay at the store.</li>
            <li> I hunted high and low for this floss.  It wasn&#x27;t at Target, Walmart, CVS, RiteAid, or any of the grocery stores I frequent.  When I saw it on Amazon, I was very pleased.  I&#x27;m quite particular about my floss and flossing.  Unfortunately, although sold under the same name, it&#x27;s not the same product as when I last purchased this floss.  The color of the container is different as well.  It&#x27;s a decent floss; it doesn&#x27;t tear, split, or get stuck, but it is too minty, leaving an artificial mint flavor in your mouth.  However, my biggest complaint is that it is no longer the same thick, somewhat fluffy floss that it was previously.  It is woven much more tightly, with a slightly waxed texture.  So, it&#x27;s still a decent, pretty run-of-the-mill floss, but not at all what I thought I was getting.</li>
            <li> There seem to be several Reach Cleanpaste floss products. Very confusing.  This one, 50 yards, is not the heavy woven floss I had hoped for.  But, it&#x27;s better than plain floss, so we&#x27;re keeping it. I&#x27;ll bet the 35 yard floss, with the same name, is the product I was looking for. I hope this helps future purchasers of same.</li>
            <li> This was a good find because it seems that any similar product in my little town is not available.  A bit expensive but whatever.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite dental floss, but it has been next to impossible to fine in drug stores. It doesn&#x27;t slip off your tooth as the glide-type flosses do. It actually has some resistance when you floss, and it is perfect for sensitive gums. The packages are very small - it seems that the manufacturer has reduced the length of the floss and the number of strands from previous packages, so you&#x27;re not getting as much for your money.  Not as good as it used to be, but still a very good floss.  I wish manufacturers would increase the cost to consumers rather than \\&quot;cheapen\\&quot; what was formerly an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to find this product here at amazon because all the stores near me stopped carrying it a long time ago.  I would have given it five stars if it had been what I used to buy under the same name, but when I ordered it, what arrived was not the same at all.  Instead of an almost fluffy floss that really grabs anything lingering between the teeth, this new Cleanpaste is thin and not that different from other flosses.  The powder that they put on it is NOT the reason that I loved this product before; it was the fluffiness.. almost like embroidery thread.  Hmmmmmm... maybe I&#x27;ll slap some toothpaste on embroidery thread instead!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using various types of dental floss ever since I can remember. Then one day my wife called my attention to Reach Dental Floss. It had a strange blue/green color and seemed to squash flat in use. I liked it. It slid easily between my tightly spaced teeth and seemed to cause much less cutting of the gum during use. It had a pleasant and lightly minty taste. I always cut a piece of floss a foot long and then tie the ends together to make a loop. I prefer this method to wrapping the floss around my fingers. In any case, the Reach ties easily and the knot doesn&#x27;t slip nearly as much as with my other brands. In my opinion, this floss is clearly superior to the many other brands I have been using over the years. Give it a try and see what you think. I suspect you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gary Peterson</li>
            <li> This is my favorite floss, but I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.  So I&#x27;m glad to have finally found it!</li>
            <li> This floss definitely makes a difference in plaque build-up versus standard type floss.  My dental hygenist always comments on how easy my teeth are to clean because there&#x27;s no plaque.  I probably sound like a commercial, but I couldn&#x27;t do without it!</li>
            <li> Everyone has their own tastes for dental floss, but for mine, this is the very best floss by far.  It pains me that it&#x27;s not carried in stores any more.  Why&#x27;s that??????  But happily I can get it here, altho the postage expense hurts.  In any case, it cleans my teeth better than any other. The waxed ones slip in and out easily but that&#x27;s not good for getting the plaque and other \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; off the tooth surface. They just seem to leave a coating of wax behind.  Cleanpaste is like the dental hygienist&#x27;s paste that scrubs the tooth clean, clean, clean.  It may or may not be responsible, but I floss often and haven&#x27;t had a cavity for decades.  Yay.</li>
            <li> Love woven floss:[[ASIN:B001E96QJK Reach Gentle Gum Care Woven Dental Floss, Fluoride, 50-Yard Dispensers (Pack of 6)]] is good, but has flouride, which seems to make my teeth hurt (dumb, I know, but it does). Anyway, this stuff is gentle, and tastes good, and after two uses is OK by me. Hope it doesn&#x27;t have flouride... or if it does, I hope I never find out or then my teeth will hurt.</li>
            <li> The others are right.  This is not the same as the original cleanpaste floss.  It&#x27;s not quite as soft and is a bit more difficult to slide between teeth.  That being said, it&#x27;s still so much better than traditional floss, and gets all the goop out.</li>
            <li> I really love this dental floss. It has been discontinued at stores in my area so I&#x27;m happy to buy it in bulk at Amazon. The floss is made up of woven fibers, looking almost like a rope, picking up all the yucky stuff easily. It&#x27;s just the right thickness for my teeth (I&#x27;ve got medium size gaps) and glides very well but not slippery. The toothpaste powder is refreshing, minty and makes my mouth feel extra clean.</li>
            <li> It is a positive trying a string-like texture instead of the conventional plastic-like texture. But this product needs much improvement! The threads peels off between your teeth, and was very weak and can break easily if flossed a certain way. Sometimes you&#x27;ll have to floss a 2nd or 3rd time to get rid of the floss between your teeth!!! Feels terrible.</li>
            <li> I used to use the Reach &#x27;tarter control&#x27; floss which was woven and had a kind of dry powder on it. This, because it was dry, served really well to rub off the surface of my teeth in a good way when I flossed and bent it around the tooth edge. This floss is more like a waxed floss. The coating is not dry and powdery and keep the the woven floss more like just one single strand. It is much better than waxed floss, but it is not as good as the apparently discontinued variety they used to sell. The mint flavor is pretty minimal. Much much better than a waxed floss, but not really a woven floss due to the coating.</li>
            <li> For me, this is best floss on the market! When I run out I will buy more!</li>
            <li> Ever since I stumbled upon this product, I do not care to use any other floss.  In fact, I had difficulty finding any in the stores so I ordered it in bulk to make sure I didn&#x27;t run out for a while.</li>
            <li> My teeth are tough, except for this product, I&#x27;d have to go with the plastic stuff or the very fine (painful) regular floss. Love the toothpaste embedded and the soft yet strong weave of this stuff. Can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore so buy it online. Hope they keep manufacturing it.</li>
            <li> This product is like a toothbrush for between the teeth. It does an excellent job of removing inter-dental debris.</li>
            <li> I was given a sample of this when I had by teeth cleaned four years ago.  I was never one to floss, but found this product superior to waxed floss and have been using it ever since.  Reach has come out with a product that has similar packaging and the merchants in my area have stopped carrying this.</li>
            <li> From the reviews I&#x27;ve read, it sounds like the product has changed over time.  What I received was several intertwined pieces of fluffy strings that I can only compare to what you would get if you snagged your polyester pant-suit, and pulled the thread off to floss your teeth.  I love the idea of this product, but my teeth shredded it to pieces.  Bummer.</li>
            <li> I have tightly spaced teeth and other flosses catch and shred or the waxed flat floss will cut my gums after being forced between my teeth.  This floss is wonderful--even though it is many strands thick, it goes between my teeth easily and I think the paste in it has helped to keep my dental check-ups good.    Thank you for having a source for this as it is very hard to find in our local drug stores.</li>
            <li> I did order Reach Cleanpaste Dental Floss, Icy Mint Flavor, 50-Yard Dispensers (Pack of 6) (Purchased on 03/09/2011)from Amazon, and Amazon later asked me to review the product. (I know the product, I bought it elsewhere previously, hence the 5-star value.) Unfortunately, Amazon sent me a wrong item. The shipment was returned and duly refunded, but apparently this was not communicated within the organization well enough to prevent request for a review to be sent to me. I cannot give Amazon any \\&quot;stars\\&quot; for this...  Have you noticed how incompetence increasingly penetrates our society?</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t understand for the life of me why they stopped selling this type of floss.  I have never found anything quite as good.</li>
            <li> I have always preferred the woven floss but am having a difficult time finding it.  I ordered this, since it appeared to be the closest thing.  This product works even better than the woven, and can get between my teeth better-- especially after a recent crown where the gap is much tighter.  It also has a great flavor.</li>
            <li> Really?!?  *Why* does it happen when you find a product you LOVE they discontinue it? Oh, why??&lt;br /&gt;This floss is / was so very special in that it was more like soft material instead of string or tape to slice your gums.  And because it was more fabric-y, it covered more area for a cleaner floss.  It was impregnated with toothpaste so it made even between your teeth feel fresh.  Fantastic product.  Outrageous loss. &#x3D;(&lt;br /&gt; Since it&#x27;s now gone (wth), I&#x27;m going to try making my own with that floss from the fabric store.. you know, that comes in many colours.. pull a few strands away, run it through some toothpaste &amp; see what happens.  I purchased like, 20 of these when it was on its way out, but when it&#x27;s gone, I&#x27;m not going back to string floss without a fight.  It won&#x27;t be pretty.&lt;br /&gt;But&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ll let you know how the homemade deal works.  ; )</li>
            <li> I have tight spacing between my teeth, so I&#x27;ve never liked regular floss because it shreds and it&#x27;s painful to use.  I&#x27;ve used glide and similar silicone flosses, but I never feel as though they are doing a good job cleaning my teeth.  This floss slides between my teeth AND cleans really thoroughly.  A word of advice - my mother does not like this floss particularly because she has large spacing between her teeth and prefers special floss that I can&#x27;t stand, so this will work for you if it is within your preferences.</li>
            <li> WHY DID THEY STOP MAKING THIS FLOSS ??  Can&#x27;t find it anywhere but it got everything stuck between the teeth out.. very unhappy.  I noticed that the current Reach floss products are thinner now too.  My dental tech told me this the last time she cleaned my teeth.  The Glide is useless too.. just think about it a moment...If you rub yarn over a slick item it will get it clean.. that&#x27;s why we use microfiber cloths to clean with.. NOT wax paper.  Same concept goes for floss.. This may not even get posted as the product is no longer listed.</li>
            <li> I have some tight teeth. Most floss breaks when I floss. Not this works great!&lt;br /&gt;I use this floss in conjuction with an electric tooth brush. Haven&#x27;t had any cavities for the last 4 Dentist visits. Best price online. Hard to find in stores.</li>
