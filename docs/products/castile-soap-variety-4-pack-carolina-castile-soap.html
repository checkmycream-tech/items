            <li>Price is amazing, and the smells are devine!&lt;br</li>
            <li>OK smell but not as good as Dr bronners.</li>
            <li>Bought these to make my own soap.  </li>
            <li>They work well for making my own shampoo, though..with thickener.</li>
            <li>Nice smelling....</li>
            <li>I love Castile soap and this is a good brand of Castile soap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the rest are equally as good as</li>
            <li>Use for cleaning nice variety</li>
            <li>The fragrances are nice, except for the Tea Tree one that smells too medicinal for use as a shower gel or&lt;br /&gt;hand soap.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to make my own cleaners.</li>
            <li>But nice scents.</li>
            <li>I love this product and am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Excellent natural shampoo!</li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE these healthy soaps,!</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>I love tea tree oil</li>
            <li>I will buy more.</li>
            <li>but :)</li>
            <li>Great, but try do dilute with water, it is very concentrated to my taste.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>Love the fragrances.</li>
            <li>This is a great variety of fragrances and were gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>this is one-stop healthy living in your home.</li>
            <li>love love love it</li>
            <li>They are so healthy and makes my house, body, skin, hair, hangs, dishes, and dog</li>
            <li>favorite is the orange and tangerine..  </li>
            <li>I love the Dr woods and dr bronner.</li>
            <li>I plan on buying more of this product.</li>
            <li>love it nice clean feeling and scent</li>
            <li>These are great i always love castile soap and use it on everything but getting the different kinds to try is amazing...</li>
            <li>oil and water in a spray bottle clean up m dog&#x27;s oil unlike anything I have found,!</li>
            <li>However, if you think DB&#x27;s is a bit &#x27;over the top&#x27;, you will probably love the more mild scents of Carolina&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The possibilities are endless with these soaps and awesome oils!</li>
            <li>There was a packaging error and the seller resolved the issue very quickly.</li>
            <li>one of the things I love about DB&#x27;s Peppermint soap is the cool sensation on your skin-</li>
            <li>so nice on a hot day.</li>
            <li>I add a few drops of Cinnamon and a drop or two of Clove oil to the Orange and end up with a wonderful Orange Spice hand soap.  </li>
            <li>WTG and keep up the great work!&lt;br /&gt;Great personal customer services too!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was excited to find a variety pack</li>
            <li>Not overwhelming, just perfect.</li>
            <li>First, I LOVE Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps, every scent I have tried.</li>
            <li>And I do feel clean after using it.  </li>
            <li>no store seems to sell this which is okay by me,cause more likely they&#x27;re over price it anyhow.</li>
            <li>I purchased these to make my own shampoo, and while they work, they leave more of a residue than previous brands.</li>
            <li>/&gt;price was right</li>
            <li>However, you have to use a bit more volume to get the same cleaning effect.</li>
            <li>Scents were consistent with expectations.</li>
            <li>The others are fine, especially the Orange.  </li>
            <li>I found this product to be very high quality.</li>
            <li>I would get great lather with only a little bit.  </li>
            <li>the rich suds, smooth feel, and clean rinse of other castile soaps is definitely there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the real deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but since I haven&#x27;t used those really can&#x27;t say.</li>
            <li>fast delivery...arrived as described</li>
            <li>I really did;t like this product doesn&#x27;t seem as concentrated  with the oils they say it has.</li>
            <li>, I do feel like other brands work a bit better.  </li>
            <li>ready to place a new order!  </li>
            <li>Each is used for a different purpose: Peppermint and tea tree for shavong and showers, lavender to bathe the baby, orange to clean the house.  </li>
            <li>I love it your skin is soft all day long</li>
            <li>love that the only ingredients are olive oil, lye (for saponification), and the essential oils for</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this soap</li>
            <li>gentle not harsh and leaves skin feeling vibrant and alive.</li>
            <li>Both are very nearly odorless compared to what I was used to from Dr. Bronners.</li>
            <li>Nice smell, but the lack of suds and being watered down so much - not worth it.</li>
            <li>I can use the same amount on a poof full strength and still not get the same lather.  </li>
            <li>far, I have tried the Tea Tree and Peppermint versions.</li>
            <li>As per other reviews, the soaps are a more watery consistency than other castile soap brands I&#x27;ve tried and the scents are fainter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had them for a long time and still haven&#x27;t gone through one whole bottle.  </li>
            <li>A little more watery than I expected.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more expensive, but when I am able to only use it 1/3 strength, I&#x27;m still saving money over this stuff.</li>
            <li>Castile Soap - as I remember - is a bit thicker generally.  </li>
            <li>I use it for everything like washing dishes, bathing my children, and general cleaning.</li>
            <li>The only reason I give it a 2 star is because I have notice that this doesn&#x27;t make as much bubbles as the other one I buy.</li>

            <li> I would fill the bottle with 1/3 of Doc Bronner&#x27;s and 2/3 water because the soap can be a little harsh on my skin full strength.  </li>
            <li> Does not strip paint (even flat paint!)&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> It seems like it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find REAL Castile soap that&#x27;s made with Olive Oil and not Palm Oil or other</li>
            <li> Less drying, easier on sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Thin consistency, good fragrance too thin to use in shower.</li>
            <li> The only reason I tried these was that I got a scent assortment for about the same price as 32oz of the other</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last as long as I had expected</li>
            <li> It really is watered down and you get very little suds.</li>
            <li> a little bit goes a very long way and the scent is simply luscious.</li>
            <li> Not as expected.</li>
            <li> so I could sample a few different scents.  </li>
            <li> Product worked as expected.</li>
            <li> No more skin or hand moisturizers since these do not dry out my skin, even in the winter</li>
            <li> I started to use these as other soaps/ detergents make my hands break out.  </li>
            <li> The other scents while they truly do smell like what they are supposed to, the scent is not very strong at all</li>
            <li> This is quite watered down.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit let down by the fragrances.</li>
            <li> I water it down for use in the hand pump in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To watered down.</li>
            <li> And it is slightly cheaper than Doctor Bronner&#x27;s soaps.</li>
            <li> Very little suds</li>
            <li> no more buying reg detergent or household cleaning supplies.</li>
            <li> but this is ridiculous!  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ll finish using this stuff because I hate to waste money.  </li>
            <li> Trust me, it stinks.  </li>
            <li> so you have to use a lot at one time &amp; the scents are very faint.</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the warning I read in another review about how bad it smelled.</li>
            <li> I used it as a base Tomane laundry detergent.</li>
            <li> OMG this is the WORST smelling tea tree soap I have EVER smelled.  </li>

            <li> I love it your skin is soft all day long it has a tingleling sensation to it that i like</li>
            <li> smells are great&lt;br /&gt;price was right</li>
            <li> gentle not harsh and leaves skin feeling vibrant and alive.</li>
            <li> OK smell but not as good as Dr bronners.</li>
            <li> Bought these to make my own soap.  Love the smell.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t fully finished my comparison but I do like it.</li>
            <li> LOVE this variety pack!! These soaps provide a wonderful lather and fragrance!</li>
            <li> Excellent natural shampoo! Good for the environment, your body, and your wallet!</li>
            <li> Not as expected. Thin consistency, good fragrance too thin to use in shower. Might make good liquid hand soap if not diluted.&lt;br /&gt;Will not buy again</li>
            <li> This is quite watered down.  Castile Soap - as I remember - is a bit thicker generally.  This seems almost 50% water.  It does smell quite good though.  And I do feel clean after using it.  However, you have to use a bit more volume to get the same cleaning effect.</li>
            <li> All smell great! Love this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> I was excited to find a variety pack so I could sample a few different scents.  And it is slightly cheaper than Doctor Bronner&#x27;s soaps. I gave it 2 stars because I like the variety of scents.  Unfortunately that&#x27;s where the greatness stops.  I love tea tree oil so I was very happy to see it offered as part of the variety pack.  OMG this is the WORST smelling tea tree soap I have EVER smelled.  In fact I would be embarrassed to call it Tea Tree.  It smells like a cross between chemicals and tar.  I should have listened to the warning I read in another review about how bad it smelled. Trust me, it stinks.  The other scents while they truly do smell like what they are supposed to, the scent is not very strong at all-why bother even calling it scented.  As for the lather-Normally with Doc Bronner&#x27;s I have a picnic type condiment squirt bottle, that holds about 9 oz.  I would fill the bottle with 1/3 of Doc Bronner&#x27;s and 2/3 water because the soap can be a little harsh on my skin full strength.  Using a bath poof I would get great lather with only a little bit.  Not with this stuff.  I can use the same amount on a poof full strength and still not get the same lather.  I realize castile soap doesn&#x27;t suds as much as regular soap but this is ridiculous!  I&#x27;ll finish using this stuff because I hate to waste money.  After that, I&#x27;ll stick with Doc Bronner&#x27;s.  It&#x27;s a little more expensive, but when I am able to only use it 1/3 strength, I&#x27;m still saving money over this stuff.</li>
            <li> castile soap is good for your skin and hair</li>
            <li> I love this soap! I use it for everything like washing dishes, bathing my children, and general cleaning. I found this product to be very high quality. I would recommend it to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I purchased this 4 pack a year ago and have been extremely happy.  The scents are wonderful and make fantastic foaming hand soaps.  I add a few drops of Cinnamon and a drop or two of Clove oil to the Orange and end up with a wonderful Orange Spice hand soap.  We use the Peppermint in the Kitchen and Lavender in the Powder Room.  We only have a bit of the Tea Tree oil one left....ready to place a new order!  Definitely recommend these products!</li>
            <li> As per other reviews, the soaps are a more watery consistency than other castile soap brands I&#x27;ve tried and the scents are fainter. They work well for making my own shampoo, though..with thickener.</li>
            <li> Each is used for a different purpose: Peppermint and tea tree for shavong and showers, lavender to bathe the baby, orange to clean the house.  The scents are wonderful.  Not overwhelming, just perfect.</li>
            <li> Nice smelling....but didn&#x27;t realize it was not concentrate!  Didn&#x27;t last as long as I had expected but that was my fault.</li>
            <li> First, I LOVE Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps, every scent I have tried. The only reason I tried these was that I got a scent assortment for about the same price as 32oz of the other stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I have tried the Tea Tree and Peppermint versions. As soaps, they worked perfectly well- the rich suds, smooth feel, and clean rinse of other castile soaps is definitely there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As replacements for Dr. Bronners... I was a bit let down by the fragrances. Both are very nearly odorless compared to what I was used to from Dr. Bronners. However, if you think DB&#x27;s is a bit &#x27;over the top&#x27;, you will probably love the more mild scents of Carolina&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally- one of the things I love about DB&#x27;s Peppermint soap is the cool sensation on your skin- so nice on a hot day. Carolina Castile&#x27;s delivers this same sensation, but to a noticeably lesser degree.</li>
            <li> I think these are the best castile soaps I&#x27;ve found.  Less drying, easier on sensitive skin.  I will buy more.</li>
            <li> I love Castile soap and this is a good brand of Castile soap. I used it as a base Tomane laundry detergent.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Great but :)</li>
            <li> Great, but try do dilute with water, it is very concentrated to my taste.</li>
            <li> I have use all of them. I did use the tea tree and I love it.</li>
            <li> What a great way to discover new uses for this wonderful type of soap!  I use the lavender at night to wash my face, the orange or the peppermint in the mornings, and all go into various cleaning products that I make on the spot.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I use Castile soap for everything--in the shower, on the dishes, in the wash, on the floors, and even sometimes on my hair.  It seems like it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find REAL Castile soap that&#x27;s made with Olive Oil and not Palm Oil or other fillers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the real deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap smells great and leave a silky feel on my skin and hands.  I water it down for use in the hand pump in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that the only ingredients are olive oil, lye (for saponification), and the essential oils for the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cheaper than Bronner&#x27;s, too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give this five stars but I&#x27;m rather hedging my bets as we&#x27;re  only using and that&#x27;s the lavender. love it. I&#x27;m sure the rest are equally as good as but since I haven&#x27;t used those really can&#x27;t say. a little bit goes a very long way and the scent is simply luscious. arrived in good time and in excellent shape. so based on that alone, five stars it is.</li>
            <li> Great for all my pinterest ideas!</li>
            <li> love it nice clean feeling and scent</li>
            <li> Love the fragrances. Use for cleaning nice variety</li>
            <li> The fragrances are nice, except for the Tea Tree one that smells too medicinal for use as a shower gel or&lt;br /&gt;hand soap. The others are fine, especially the Orange.  I would only buy the variety pack again if another&lt;br /&gt;fragrance could be switched for the Tea Tree.</li>
            <li> I love these soaps, they are great!!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy again. Very little suds so you have to use a lot at one time &amp; the scents are very faint.</li>
            <li> Awesome Product! Great Seller! Recommended!</li>
            <li> Product worked as expected. Scents were consistent with expectations. Packed and shipped in solid material. Good product, would buy again</li>
            <li> Met all expectations. Cleans without harm to your body and had tons of uses.</li>
            <li> fast delivery...arrived as described</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to make my own cleaners.</li>
            <li> I love these soaps! This is a great variety of fragrances and were gentle on my skin. I used these to make homemade bath products.</li>
            <li> The number in the description is correct but the picture has 5 this leads to confusion about what should have come</li>
            <li> excellent product! and literally good for EVERYTHING! no more buying reg detergent or household cleaning supplies. this is one-stop healthy living in your home. Good Stuff!!</li>
            <li> These are great i always love castile soap and use it on everything but getting the different kinds to try is amazing...love love love it</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this soap but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again. It really is watered down and you get very little suds. I use it in a shower and also for hand washing sweaters. Nice smell, but the lack of suds and being watered down so much - not worth it. I am not returning them, I&#x27;ll use them up but I&#x27;ll try something else next time.</li>
            <li> A little more watery than I expected. But nice scents.</li>
            <li> I started to use these as other soaps/ detergents make my hands break out.  The castile soap doesn&#x27;t affect my skin and I like the fragrances of this brand.</li>
            <li> These are great.  I&#x27;ve had them for a long time and still haven&#x27;t gone through one whole bottle.  I use some mixed with water as hand wash, and then sometimes use as a face or body wash.  Nice product, good price.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE these healthy soaps,! After cancer, I dutchgrd everything chemical in my life and these have been a godsend! They are so healthy and makes my house, body, skin, hair, hangs, dishes, and dog so happy!&lt;br /&gt;No more fancy shampoos! No more skin or hand moisturizers since these do not dry out my skin, even in the winter time!&lt;br /&gt;The oil and water in a spray bottle clean up m dog&#x27;s oil unlike anything I have found,! Does not strip paint (even flat paint!)&lt;br /&gt;My favorite is the orange and tangerine..  Second fav is peppermint... Thinking of using unscented to add frankincense and myrrh too... The possibilities are endless with these soaps and awesome oils! And make great gifts!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you! A forever customer here! WTG and keep up the great work!&lt;br /&gt;Great personal customer services too!&lt;br /&gt;(The only places I have not used these soaps is my dishwasher and HE washer)</li>
            <li> To watered down. Smells great though.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy with these. My opinion is they have a paste like smell to them. The cleaning quality not as good. I love the Dr woods and dr bronner.</li>
            <li> The only reason I give it a 2 star is because I have notice that this doesn&#x27;t make as much bubbles as the other one I buy. Which is Dr Bronner. I like to see the bubbles in my hand wash and body wash..I really did;t like this product doesn&#x27;t seem as concentrated  with the oils they say it has.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the customer service! There was a packaging error and the seller resolved the issue very quickly. The soaps are great! They smell wonderful, leave your skin very soft, and lather very good. I look forward to using them all for a variety of uses!</li>
            <li> Oh Yeah! I plan on buying more of this product. no store seems to sell this which is okay by me,cause more likely they&#x27;re over price it anyhow. I love this product and am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Not anything like dr. Bronners. The soap is oily and doesn&#x27;t ckean as well.</li>
            <li> Price is amazing, and the smells are devine!&lt;br /&gt;But, I do feel like other brands work a bit better.  I purchased these to make my own shampoo, and while they work, they leave more of a residue than previous brands.</li>
