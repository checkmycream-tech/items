            <li>Works great.  </li>
            <li>The adjustable trimming head is great - to be able to adjust it the length through the wheel on the grip, a great idea.</li>

            <li>Very pleased with this purchase.</li>

            <li>Love Amazon.com!  </li>
            <li>I bought the predecessor to this beard trimmer more than three years ago, and loved it.</li>
            <li>If I could give the MB-200 more stars I would.  </li>
            <li>I had one of it&#x27;s predecessors for more than 10 years, this one is so underpowered</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I was able to get what I needed</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I bought this one.</li>
            <li>this is definitely the best</li>
            <li>It does seem to require a lot of attention to make sure no stray longer beard hairs are missed.  </li>
            <li>This is a great replacement for the 20 yr old Conair that I had been using.  </li>
            <li>The item arrived very quickly and unopened.  </li>
            <li>B004DZ003K Remington Mb-200 Titanium Mustache and Beard Trimmer Easy to Use Zoom Wheel Adjusts to Create 9 Length Settings Lube for Life Blades</li>
            <li>LOve it, easy to use ,and clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost like it doesn&#x27;t quite fit.  </li>
            <li>It can catch on my beard sometimes, but overall, its great.</li>
            <li>I have a mustache and goatee and this razor does a great job trimming it short.  </li>
            <li>the top guard comes off for a very close shave job.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s plugged in and has a full charge it&#x27;s groaning by the time I&#x27;m 1/2 done.</li>
            <li>After years of hearing complaints about beard trimmers from my husband, I finally took matters into my own hands and ordered this Remington razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;2 or 3 settings, a few passes and the whole face is as good as I was ever able to do with scissors and time.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would have liked regarding this trimmer would have been a stand or holder for it.  </li>
            <li>It does trim my mustache nicely, which is why I gave it the rating above.</li>
            <li>I returned two other trimmers, because this one is so good.  </li>
            <li>You do have to learn the angles to trim the right way</li>
            <li>This thing is great, just doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>Has used three other models in the last 3 yrs and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I had a previous version of this product that I liked very much and wanted it again.  </li>
            <li>great.\\&quot;  Mission accomplished.</li>
            <li>much quicker then a scissors.</li>
            <li>The blade and motor are definitely of better quality than the previous version.  </li>
            <li>I love this little trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I would still buy this product again, but I think it needs to go past the engineers and customer testing a couple more times.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve only had to charge the battery the first time, so</li>
            <li>The first trimmer I was interested in, because of previous reviews.  </li>
            <li>I was greatly surprised by the ease and convenience, even then.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is powerful seems to stay sharp and holds a stron charge.  </li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY recommend, especially if you trim a mustache and goatee.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how long it will last on one charge, but then as I&#x27;ve hinted, the trimmer is not &amp;#34;ON&amp;#34; much at all.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I am pleased that the packages are not damaged-nothing is broken or mis-placed.</li>
            <li>Always get what I want-always arrives much faster than expected!  </li>
            <li>BUY THIS if you&#x27;ve ever spent more than $30 on those clunky electric razors with cords and the 50 different attachments and that tiny little bottle of oil that spills all over everything except the blades which eventually lock up!!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This razor is hands-down the best one I&#x27;ve ever owned and it was dirt cheap price-wise!! Never needs oils, cordless (with cord for recharge) and has one touch adjustable settings for trimming beards and the top guard comes off for a very close shave job. BUY THIS if you&#x27;ve ever spent more than $30 on those clunky electric razors with cords and the 50 different attachments and that tiny little bottle of oil that spills all over everything except the blades which eventually lock up!!</li>
            <li> If I could give the MB-200 more stars I would.  This thing is wonderful.  I returned two other trimmers, because this one is so good.  The height button locks well and the guide depth does not shift when you press hard on your face.</li>
            <li> After years of hearing complaints about beard trimmers from my husband, I finally took matters into my own hands and ordered this Remington razor. After two days of use, he said from the bathroom door \\&quot;this razor is great.\\&quot;  Mission accomplished.</li>
            <li> Love Amazon.com!  Always get what I want-always arrives much faster than expected!  Very happy customer!  I am pleased that the packages are not damaged-nothing is broken or mis-placed.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I had a previous version of this product that I liked very much and wanted it again.  The blade and motor are definitely of better quality than the previous version.  I&#x27;m hoping the battery is also.  My old one had a bad battery.  I especially love the adjustable guard which is why I bought this model again.  I just have two complaints about this model 1) the numbers on the guard adjust are small and difficult to read.  I&#x27;m no geriatric.  So if I&#x27;m having trouble, so is someone else.  2) the guard is difficult to remove and put back on.  It&#x27;s almost like it doesn&#x27;t quite fit.  But once you have it on, it works beautifully.  I would still buy this product again, but I think it needs to go past the engineers and customer testing a couple more times.</li>
            <li> The item arrived very quickly and unopened.  It is a Christmas gift so i can not comment on it&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> I like this trimmer a lot. have it a couple of years, probably recharged it less than ten times and now the battery no longer hold a charge. if I can recharge my phone or laptop hundreds of times why not these batteries?? very disappointed it&#x27;s no longer cordless!</li>
            <li> I had one of it&#x27;s predecessors for more than 10 years, this one is so underpowered it&#x27;s unusable.  I have a tough beard that needs trimming once a week. If it&#x27;s plugged in and has a full charge it&#x27;s groaning by the time I&#x27;m 1/2 done. On battery with a full charge it&#x27;s dead in 3 minutes and unplugged the battery is useless in 48 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yuk!</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer! You do have to learn the angles to trim the right way but it still works great. I&#x27;m glad I was able to get what I needed</li>
            <li> I bought the predecessor to this beard trimmer more than three years ago, and loved it. After carelessly dropping my old one I broke it, and am back for another.   [[ASIN:B004DZ003K Remington Mb-200 Titanium Mustache and Beard Trimmer Easy to Use Zoom Wheel Adjusts to Create 9 Length Settings Lube for Life Blades Never Need Oiling]]</li>
            <li> The first trimmer I was interested in, because of previous reviews.  I was greatly surprised by the ease and convenience, even then.&lt;br /&gt;2 or 3 settings, a few passes and the whole face is as good as I was ever able to do with scissors and time. (OH, lots of time.)&lt;br /&gt;The longest part of the initial experience was a certain anxiety that I felt about cutting off too much.  I started off at the highest setting and continued on to the next and next until I found the one that suited me.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had to charge the battery the first time, so I don&#x27;t know how long it will last on one charge, but then as I&#x27;ve hinted, the trimmer is not &amp;#34;ON&amp;#34; much at all.&lt;br /&gt;This was/is a good investment!</li>
            <li> LOve it, easy to use ,and clean. much quicker then a scissors. like that it doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of attachments to change for different settings.</li>
            <li> So I was skeptical about such an inexpensive razor.. but I&#x27;m glad I bought this one. It can catch on my beard sometimes, but overall, its great. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> The adjustable trimming head is great - to be able to adjust it the length through the wheel on the grip, a great idea. The titanium blades are perfect!&lt;br /&gt;I have had several beard trimmers up to now this is definitely the best, it is light, handy, ergonomic and it gives superb results.&lt;br /&gt;Strongly recommended!</li>
            <li> My husband is very happy with this product..Has used three other models in the last 3 yrs and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would have liked regarding this trimmer would have been a stand or holder for it.  It does trim my mustache nicely, which is why I gave it the rating above.</li>
            <li> I only used this for two cycles of the battery before it stopped holding a charge. This thing is great, just doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I love this little trimmer.  Was a gift from my wife.  Works great.  Just have to realize you can pull the depth gauge off comepletely for &amp;#34;close&amp;#34; and edge trimming.</li>
            <li> Would buy again. The remmington-200 titanium beard &amp; mustache trimmer was a purchase due to an allery to nickle blade in another brand.</li>
            <li> This is a great replacement for the 20 yr old Conair that I had been using.  It is powerful seems to stay sharp and holds a stron charge.  It does seem to require a lot of attention to make sure no stray longer beard hairs are missed.  Overall, I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I must admit, I was very skeptical over a $20 trimmer. But I am VERY happy with the face trim this MB-200 gives. I&#x27;m just annoyed I didn&#x27;t throw out my old one that&#x27;s annoyed me for years much much sooner. I would HIGHLY recommend, especially if you trim a mustache and goatee.</li>
            <li> I had one before, it worked well for years.  The battery stopped taking a charge, so i bought another on line.</li>
            <li> I have a mustache and goatee and this razor does a great job trimming it short.  Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
