            <li>The make up is very nice if I can get the machine to work.</li>
            <li>very nicely packaged and with some added freebies.</li>
            <li>The set itself is very nice.  </li>
            <li>Amazon did help me with the return and the customer service was very nice an efficient.</li>
            <li>I love this machine it is wonderful, however my dissatisfaction is with the makeup itself.</li>
            <li>There is a good range of medium colors in the kit - my daughter has fair skin and the lightest color looked great on her</li>
            <li>Beautifully packaged really nice as a gift.</li>
            <li>So easy to use and my makeup looks flawless and not a pore in sight!</li>
            <li>It was easy to learn to use and the make up goes on flawless.  </li>
            <li>so you get a spot on your face nothing good about the products</li>
            <li>, girls - sets up your face for the painting) and 6-8 caps of the color that best fit my face and a drop or two of the lighter shade.</li>
            <li>she would tell me how good i looked that day or that i was &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>However, every time I used the airbrush makeup she told me how good i looked that day.</li>
            <li>Good thing</li>
            <li>Good thing</li>
            <li>It looks good to me but complements</li>
            <li>Works good.</li>
            <li>I bought this because of the good reviews.</li>
            <li>I try to give the benefit of the doubt because not everyone has a good experience with everything.</li>
            <li>I have to get the FAIR shade one now.  </li>
            <li>I bought his because my daughter has a set and when she applied it for me, it looked good, however I&#x27;m still working at this and hope to get an even finish.</li>
            <li>So...lots of choices to match for a perfect fit.  </li>
            <li>But I do still think this is a good value at $170</li>
            <li>The makeup: the colors were good.</li>
            <li>It lasts, even after 10 hours I still feel my skin looks good.  </li>
            <li>My skin tone is fair but going into the summer months I decided to purchase the medium shade foundations;</li>
            <li>Good Luck to you</li>
            <li>Makes skin look smooth and flawless!!</li>
            <li>My wife is delighted with this Christmas gift.</li>
            <li>all in all the compressor and the gun work great, it is very easy to use</li>
            <li>At one point she even asked if i was pregnant and not telling her lol!!</li>
            <li>this is a great kit that is about the cost of luminess and works just at good and their makeup is a better quality</li>
            <li>the quality on the make up and tools are excellent, I bought this kit for use it on my wedding on me and 2 more cousins, they love it too</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>In love with it works great</li>
            <li>I wish it came with more product, but I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li>Very good i love it.......:)</li>
            <li>so having to clean out a tool every morning is not my ideal</li>
            <li>so having to clean out a tool every morning is not my ideal</li>
            <li>I absolotely love this!  </li>
            <li>I like it, but Luminess is better!</li>
            <li>I am sooooo glad that I bought this product!</li>
            <li>Turned on the airbrush machine today to make sure everything worked and let me tell you.... it is SO NOISY!</li>
            <li>First use was great!</li>
            <li>My face looked so much better!  </li>
            <li>I love this airbrush kit!</li>
            <li>I love it, it works well!</li>
            <li>And you better not get caught in the rain!</li>
            <li>My fianc&amp;eacute; loves this thing, it works great and Is easy to take apart.</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use you own makeup it will clog the machine.  </li>
            <li>I was concerned about not being able to get good coverage or splotchy coverage using it on myself</li>
            <li>I wanted to make sure it was good before I posted a review.  </li>
            <li>You end up with a really nice matte finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She liked the product and the results, however after 6 months it stopped working.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m headed about dinair and luminess air and to be honest</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this set 2 stars because the machine seems nice.  </li>
            <li>The case is nice</li>
            <li>I realized it had a mind of it&#x27;s own</li>
            <li>I think you have to have a pro makeup artist use this on you to get any kind of results at all.</li>
            <li>I eventually spoke with someone who worked with airbrushes and got a set of replacement needles and the unit works sporadically; sometime I get a nice spray out of it, sometime I get nothing.</li>
            <li>I liked it.</li>
            <li>I already own this.</li>
            <li>I did some searching foe reviews and this brand has more good reviews than the one on the infomercial .</li>
            <li>It goes on so easy and looks amazing!  </li>
            <li>Very easy to apply,,,,,feels nice  and stays on till you take it off.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s everything plus more .after long days of work it does a great job of giving me a flawless face to go out at nice .</li>
            <li>Everything was new and in excellent condition.  </li>
            <li>covers good like it said easy to use  ad</li>
            <li>and it is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I have mild rosacea and when i use this makeup/system it covers it very nicely but doesnt looked caked on like the bottle foundation i used to use.</li>
            <li>Worked beautifully when I first got it in the mail.</li>
            <li>The makeup goes on so light and coverage is good.  </li>
            <li>its the most amazing airbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>and I thought that for what you got, it was a great value and worth the try.  </li>
            <li>But all in all, the makeup is nice &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>feels so good light  </li>
            <li>It is so easy to use!  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use and so much better for your skin.</li>
            <li>The make up looked great after the first use.</li>
            <li>Great product fast shipping!</li>
            <li>It worked Great the first 5 times I used it but on try number six</li>
            <li>First, the compressor works great.</li>
            <li>The makeup colors are good, it was pretty easy to find/blend a good shade for my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>I will go a darker shade because it is very light even the tan and beige.</li>
            <li>Felt very cheap.</li>
            <li>By day three I was very comfortable with the color and application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>very light.  </li>
            <li>I had to return it, but got great customer service and full refund and return shipping free.</li>
            <li>I love spray on make up, it really makes your skin look Beautiful</li>
            <li>Easy to use, nice colors</li>
            <li>The very first time applying turned out good.</li>
            <li>Easy, perfect, natural.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, I found that running the airbrush under warm water for a couple of seconds cleaned it fine without the recommended dis-assembly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does a very good job of evening my skin tone and covering old acne scars and age spots.  </li>
            <li>After many youtubes, emails and calls I could not get it to work.</li>
            <li>LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>And the price is even better.  </li>
            <li>Buy this, and when you want to buy more makeup, then buy it.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>but it still works, I use it and love it.</li>
            <li>It did not come with maintenance care instructions however, but I was able to find a video from another company online.  </li>
            <li>The coverage is fantastic!</li>
            <li>and she fell in love.</li>
            <li>I took it apart and made sure the needle was not occluded.  </li>
            <li>I had to spray my face many times and it still did not cover anything&#x27;</li>
            <li>Please be sure you read the UPDATE at the end!!!**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I really love the look of it.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s actually OK.  </li>
            <li>8 is more like it.  </li>
            <li>You probably want more if you want to do more layers.  </li>
            <li>It seems the medium is better.  </li>
            <li>because I got better at it or what.  </li>
            <li>but OK.  </li>
            <li>but OK.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many foundation.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>But the pic shows so much more than what&#x27;s included.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, it takes more product than the recommended 6-8 drops to get the level of coverage I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Love the simplicity of machine and airbrush.</li>
            <li>I would expect better for the money I paid.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I get much better coverage with Temptu.</li>
            <li>I love this compressor.  </li>
            <li>The more I used this makeup, the clearer my skin became.</li>
            <li>When I started using this airbrushing method, it took me about 20 min or more.  </li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>It had better still be under manufacturers warranty</li>
            <li>: I gave this one two more stars....</li>
            <li>More like 20-25 drops.  </li>
            <li>, they are going to use it more than me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I have it.in makeup brushes and in the makeup when it&#x27;s frequenlty touched by those brushes, so</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I have it.</li>
            <li>glad I didn&#x27;t wait until Christmas day to do so...</li>
            <li>I love this system.</li>
            <li>I love all the make up</li>
            <li>I knew Belloccio was a much better quality system.</li>
            <li>Very happy with the unit, it works really well, easy to clean</li>
            <li>When it is in working mode, the applied makeup looks Marvelous; there are enough colors to find a match and the makeup looks like velvet.</li>
            <li>So, all in all, this is an okay item and it serves its purpose.</li>
            <li>a out being able Tom aster</li>
            <li>I just wish the makeup was a bit more affordable.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this makeup..</li>
            <li>I love this airbrush.</li>
            <li>I am in love with Airbrushing.</li>
            <li>so I took my time and made sure I kept the air gun at an appropriate distance and sprayed in continuous circular motions.</li>
            <li>but I have to use more than what they said to use.  </li>
            <li>LOVE the system.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure it was even on.</li>
            <li>I love the  highlighter.</li>
            <li>, they give you a fair amount of product to use right off the bat.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>All the hype is exactly that...hype!!!</li>
            <li>how much it made my skin look flawless until I washed my face that first night.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s is great love the filling looks very natural I would recommend this.</li>
            <li>it was a good working airbrush for the first couple times i used it</li>
            <li>I enjoyed using Belloccio because it was easy to assembly and use.  </li>
            <li>The set comes with so many colors of foundations and blushes which make is such a good value!  </li>
            <li>Not to loud, works great for makeup.  </li>
            <li>properly packed, it&#x27;s easy to use and clean, very satisfied with this purchase, thank you amazon!!</li>
            <li>I tend to have sensitive skin and haven&#x27;t experienced a problem with breakouts.</li>
            <li>It was way easier than expected and awesome results.</li>
            <li>i did everything the way the instructions said, and cleaned it every time,(which was not a speedy process) and my cheap makeup from cvs worked better.</li>
            <li>and it was clogging up on me and wasn&#x27;t spraying out that good, but it might had been cause I had too much makeup in there?</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really give you any info if it&#x27;s good or not.  </li>
            <li>so now i have to buy the fair shades because the ones i have are not for my skin tone all in all though i really like my airbrush</li>
            <li>The airbrush equipment (machine and parts etc.) are good quality and work really well.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and care for too!  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need as many drops of liquid makeup as I originally thought to get the coverage I was looking for.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I had ordered the Medium kit, but after playing with those colors, I ordered a bottle of the Blanc colored foundation and with a little more playing, found a perfect color for me.</li>
            <li>The down side is unless you are young with perfect skin you are not going to get great coverage.</li>
            <li>This was really easy to use.  </li>
            <li>but it is so easy.</li>
            <li>It gives good coverage and looks so much better and natural than the mineral make up I have been wearing for years.</li>
            <li>how easy it was to apply!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Talk about easy peasy.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use,</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>so returning it was easy</li>
            <li>Plus the airbrush is really easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, but yes there are steps.  </li>
            <li>It came very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Once I got it going it was so easy.  </li>
            <li>Its built well and easy to understand the directions.  </li>
            <li>It is quite easy to use.</li>
            <li>and it does the job just as good and even a little better!!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended good quality you wont regret it.</li>
            <li>I really liked this system when i first started using it.</li>
            <li>It was easy to assemble, easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Love this set- affordable and showed up quickly.</li>
            <li>This was a SUPER buy!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear makeup that much but after using this machine, I will its easy to use and the finishing outcome is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Ultra fine mist, easy clean up and a variety of shades to mix for match.  </li>
            <li>I had a huge sigh of relief.  </li>
            <li>But the spray, when done correctly, is even and accurate.</li>
            <li>Machine did not work smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the recommended amount is for light coverage</li>
            <li>easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Since I have started using it, friends and strangers have told me what a smooth complexion and skin I have.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling light.</li>
            <li>so I followed the instructions precisely...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not so light...</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s what makes it feel light.  </li>
            <li>The foundations were orange and the machine was cheap.</li>
            <li>Way to light.</li>
            <li>I bought this because it was available on Prime</li>
            <li>it really is light on your skin</li>
            <li>The compressor will light up, but DOES NOT WORK.</li>
            <li>i recieved my kit was very sceptical about it, but will have to say it is vey nice  </li>
            <li>The makeup is so light</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light</li>
            <li>i think i just need to find the right color and get more practice on how to use</li>
            <li>the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was not due to any defect, I just felt that the whole thing would have benifited greatly by having  more instructions for use.</li>
            <li>The return was super easy though..</li>
            <li>Its also quick and easy to put on and clean the machine after.</li>
            <li>Excited about receiving it I went to use it immediately</li>
            <li>First of all, the instructions are more of a pamphlet.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this airbrush set.  </li>
            <li>It is powerful!  </li>
            <li>I was really excited when I recieved this.  </li>
            <li>I use a Q-tip to clean the bowl and tip.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, the angle I found to be most effective was the opposite of what was recommended.  </li>
            <li>I clean the system after each use</li>
            <li>It sprayed when it wanted too, and then on top of that I noticed that when it would spray the makeup was doing absolutely nothing to cover light freckles on my face or even the smallest blemishes.</li>
            <li>Took me 15min to apply the foundation, blush and clean the machine.  </li>
            <li>so you can easily rinse it out when you are done or else it will get mucked up and not work right.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like doing the blush a bit to hard to make perfect</li>
            <li>I have had a hard time deciding which shade works the best with my skin tone because they all work so well without a hint of orange.</li>
            <li>and I am happy that it also had a wide selection of make up that you can order.</li>
            <li>and I mixed 2 to get a good shade for myself.</li>
            <li>so I really haven&#x27;t been able to use it.</li>
            <li>Any more than that is too much.  </li>
            <li>.Waiting for a full refund.</li>
            <li>and I work full time</li>
            <li>and I work full time</li>
            <li>It says full year warranty, but how can I contact them to get a replacement compressor?</li>
            <li>so when I tried this for the first time I was supprised at how easy it was to use.</li>
            <li>Seems to be good quality, but the carrying case could be a little bit more durable.</li>
            <li>All in all,  not bad for my very first air brush machine.</li>
            <li>when I first got the machine everything was working fine</li>
            <li>If you want more coverage- use a different concealer and get a better Makeup for airbrush.</li>
            <li>Lucky for me</li>
            <li>I went into my orders on Amazon and clicked on &amp;#34;return or replace items&amp;#34; - I would have liked to exchange/replace it to try again, but maybe I&#x27;ll do a little more research on airbrushes first to see if there is a better brand.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend :)</li>
            <li>I tried it first and did not do it smoothly.</li>
            <li>The highlighter was very pretty though.</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time, which is good, but the feel of it takes some getting used to.  </li>
            <li>A great value compared to some other kits I looked into buying!  </li>
            <li>it works very well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Just go easy with the application, go light and let it dry a moment before adding more if you feel the need to.  </li>
            <li>Just go easy with the application, go light and let it dry a moment before adding more if you feel the need to.  </li>
            <li>At $120ish it was no small purchase, but more of an investment I believe.  </li>
            <li>It is easy, but figuring out what colors to use, how many drops to use, and how many times to go over one area with the airbrush just takes a little trial and error.  </li>
            <li>Great little product.</li>
            <li>But I also like looking nice, and I do think this makeup is better coverage without looking caked on or heavy.</li>
            <li>But I also like looking nice, and I do think this makeup is better coverage without looking caked on or heavy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually started using my old powder blush, then applying the foundation over it, which works great.  </li>
            <li>is truly a one of a kind product (the compressor / air tool is made by the same company that has contracts with NASA).  </li>
            <li>The set is well worth the money</li>
            <li>but I would recommend it to anyone wishing for a more natural look.</li>
            <li>It is the best feeling knowing that I don&#x27;t have a dirty brush or sponge touching my face ever again.</li>
            <li>The product itself is well worth the price</li>
            <li>tried to use it without much success</li>
            <li>but I thought the look I would get would be worth it.  </li>
            <li>but I thought the look I would get would be worth it.  </li>
            <li>(The lighter the color, the more natural I look.)&lt;br /&gt;  2.</li>
            <li>So if you have the money, I still think this product is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I have olive skin (mixed asian/caucasian) and it gets oily about three hours after I use any makeup, no matter what kind.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to use, cuz I like being a girl and playing with makeup.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to use, cuz I like being a girl and playing with makeup.  </li>
            <li>Vary worth the money</li>
            <li>The money is worth it on this system.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a lot of fun.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth the money I paid for.</li>
            <li>This really I&#x27;d worth it.</li>
            <li>This product was definitely a great buy, I&#x27;ve researched all the other brands out there and bought this because I was ready to try an airbrush makeup.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, the product arrived quickly, and was exactly as promised.  </li>
            <li>Other than that I loved the system</li>
            <li>Did not expect perfection right away, was just gonna try it out for practice.</li>
            <li>so you can find the right shde or mix 2.  </li>
            <li>let me know I&#x27;m right.  </li>
            <li>Plugged up right away when my wife tried to use it.</li>
            <li>Right out of the box</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t get it to work right.  </li>
            <li>it did contain a  small booklet, but I would have liked to have had more information or parhaps a dvd to go with it.</li>
            <li>If you use the blush, apply it first, rinse, then use the foundation; you get a more natural look</li>
            <li>If you use the blush, apply it first, rinse, then use the foundation; you get a more natural look</li>
            <li>I just got this (reason for only giving 4 stars instead of 5) and have only used it 3 times, but so far I am very impressed.</li>
            <li>I was using mineral makeup before this, and I liked that coverage and weight, but it just didn&#x27;t hold up well for a long day.  </li>
            <li>It definitely was A WHOLE Lot better than the original one I purchased with the kit.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised that it was easy.</li>
            <li>I spent $120 on my kit, so I expected things to be in perfect working condition.</li>
            <li>and I wanted to buy an airbrush system that is portable and easy to use as oppose to carrying I huge bag filled with the usual airbrush professional kits (most compressors are just too big).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>also do not like the foundation very much</li>
            <li>The makeup is weightless and natural looking and doesn&#x27;t show any of my huge blemishes.  </li>
            <li>However, after the first cleaning no makeup would come out of the tip (just air).</li>
            <li>Fingers crossed that I have better luck with the next one.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>And I do like the results when I&#x27;m willing to take the time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;About actually using the airbrush - OK - here&#x27;s the deal -</li>
            <li>When you apply, start with the airbrush up higher.  </li>
            <li>When you first turn it on, it defaults to medium speed.  </li>
            <li>The first one was a gift, I would like to get one for myself.</li>
            <li>not as happy with their liquid makeup...gets thick and clogs airbrush after 2 weeks .  </li>
            <li>I had this thing for a month and first the stylus stopped working then the machine.</li>
            <li>It would be my first airbrush purchase</li>
            <li>I actually looked more airbrushed with my Studio Fix then with the airbrush makeup.  </li>
            <li>Maybe you will have better luck and smaller pores!</li>
            <li>The more I used it, I noticed several things about it (and me):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really does what they claim!</li>
            <li>So for the price, it&#x27;s worth it to get the whole package.</li>
            <li>Its better than having big hug one</li>
            <li>When I began using it, for the FIRST TIME I might add...</li>
            <li>This is my first Airbrush System, if you don&#x27;t count the one I had for a day.</li>
            <li>This was my first time ever buying and using airbrush makeup.  </li>
            <li>The second time even better.</li>
            <li>The first order, the airbrush was defective.</li>
            <li>I now know to spend the extra money on the top line.</li>
            <li>The first 2 times i had used it</li>
            <li>I love the look and feel of airbrushing and purchased this system despite the mixed reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can say it&#x27;s pretty, and does airbrush the makeup evenly on my face.</li>
            <li>It took me forever to apply makeup the first time I tried it because I was so scared it wasn&#x27;t going to apply evenly</li>
            <li>I tried it out today for the first time.  </li>
            <li>and I felt confident enough to use it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll write more later after I&#x27;ve used it for a while.  </li>
            <li>The Belloccio Airbrush System is easy to use and is the epitome of professional cosmetics that really work.</li>
            <li>It does such a great job until you actually have to clean the entire unit.  </li>
            <li>When I first started using this system, I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d use it for the long term.  </li>
            <li>The entire system was great but the makeup was weak had to buy better quality makeup.</li>
            <li>i like my airbrush so far because its better to use for my face only problem i have is that i should have gotten the fair shade kit and not the medium the medium is a bit to dark for me</li>
            <li>My favorite and completely unexpected benefit of this product is that after a few or more hours of wear, my face doesn&#x27;t become shinny.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Belloccio&#x27;s Professional Airbrush make up goes on smooth and</li>
            <li>It looks good and is still above average on the entire makeup spectrum, but for airbrush it doesn&#x27;t really give the super flawless coverage of other products (I personally like Belletto).</li>
            <li>It is easy to learn and takes just a short time to do.  </li>
            <li>Maybe you will have better luck and smaller pores!brush makeup or if I&#x27;m going to stick with my normal liquid foundation.  </li>
            <li>The system is easy to use and clean-up is a breeze, easy enough for daily use.</li>
            <li>You have to wash after every use and I love the dry makeup.</li>
            <li>I have to put it on low because it was so strong.  </li>
            <li>They give you a large bottle of cleaner.  </li>
            <li>i and im sure other people want it BRAND NEW not used!!!</li>
            <li>I have religiously cleaned each unit after every use with hot water, cleaning solution and Q-tips but after only a couple of months of use, each of the units have experienced the same malfunctions.</li>
            <li>It takes a little getting used to like all of them, so it&#x27;s best to get a few practice sprays on your arm before going to your face.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why on such a nice little gun that they use a cheap plastic</li>
            <li>Does not work very well.</li>
            <li>It took me 15 minutes and a burning forearm to get very blotchy coverage</li>
            <li>So all in all I really disapointed.</li>
            <li>Amazon was very accomodating with the return and prompt credit.</li>
            <li>e it really works.</li>
            <li>But really, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any need of anything else.  </li>
            <li>I figured this one out because if you don&#x27;t, before you know it you will have moved the airbrush very close to your face</li>
            <li>but it really doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I really hope it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE - so I am ready to buy refills for the foundation and primer.  </li>
            <li>I really hope it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE - so I am ready to buy refills for the foundation and primer.  </li>
            <li>Very.</li>
            <li>not so much.</li>
            <li>To much maintenance...</li>
            <li>So now I had an orange face with very enlarged looking pores.  </li>
            <li>And my pores looked much much smaller...and</li>
            <li>The recommended 6-8 drops really is enough!&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I l brushike the whole Air system</li>
            <li>And I am very meticulous about cleaning too</li>
            <li>It took me about three tries/days to really get the hang of it.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t give me the coverage I need when I have some blemishes or during the winter when my skin tone is very uneven.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>But as far as quality and value for the money, I think this product is worth it</li>
            <li>this is a much cleaner way of applying makeup.  </li>
            <li>But as far as quality and value for the money, I think this product is worth it</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work very well for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m returning it and will see what the real pro&#x27;s use...</li>
            <li>So fast and skin looks clearer and silky with no oil.</li>
            <li>I spent another $50 on a replacement compressor and won&#x27;t be able to try this out until Monday night.</li>
            <li>Never ordered another airbrush makeup set, so I can&#x27;t really make a contribution with comparisons.</li>
            <li>I really like this make up and</li>
            <li>you really don&#x27;t feel like there is anything on your skin  </li>
            <li>I was very please when I received the air system.  </li>
            <li>and I really like the blush.</li>
            <li>really.</li>
            <li>I have another one but different brand and this one is by far better.  </li>
            <li>I was going to give it 3 stars because I find that I need at least twice the recommended amount of foundation to get the coverage I want, but to be fair</li>
            <li>but I figured going through Amazon was at least a good idea.  </li>
            <li>My friend purchased the big named one and mine is by far a much better quality machine.</li>
            <li>I got this one because &#x60;the other one&#x27; costs more and didn&#x27;t have all the goodies with it.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought a different well</li>
            <li>This is because of my age and the condition of my skin, but other than that I love it.  </li>
            <li>When it did work properly, only twice, the results were amazing, however, that was only twice;  Returned the machine and ordered a new one hoping the 1st one was just defective.  </li>
            <li>I recommend a few more minutes the first time you use it.</li>
            <li>no hassle of having to clean out the various parts of an airbrush system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like it especially for a special occasion and during the summer</li>
            <li>Do not plan to use it for the first time right before a big day or event.  </li>
            <li>This will bring you the result for what you want sheer coverage to full coverage.  </li>
            <li>I have heard you can buy one from Harbor Freight or other types of stores, we&#x27;ll see what I find! :)</li>
            <li>I paid for a new system!</li>
            <li>But to me, I know that germs and bacteria that can cause acne live in makeup brushes and in the makeup when it&#x27;s frequenlty touched by those brushes, so this is a much cleaner way of applying makeup.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use the tanner since I live in AZ and really don&#x27;t have a need for it.</li>
            <li>(Which I think led to my ability to use less of the makeup, because I didn&#x27;t have as many blemishes to cover.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>main thing about the airbrush is to keep it moving.  </li>
            <li>I thought I got the more expensive brand because it would be better quality...</li>
            <li>After two weeks, my skin overall actually looks better than it has in a while</li>
            <li>After two weeks, my skin overall actually looks better than it has in a while</li>
            <li>I almost boxed it up right then and there to send back, but I really wanted this to work.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this product, it arrived on time and  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this system.  </li>
            <li>They send a cute little carrying case to go with the airbrush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They send a cute little carrying case to go with the airbrush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The makeup itself leaves a little more wanting.</li>
            <li>I had to wash my face again and start from scratch with my normal makeup.  </li>
            <li>At this point, I am unsure if I am going to try another brand of airbrush makeup or if I&#x27;m going to stick with my normal liquid foundation.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to get a missing part since I purchased it, but have not been able to reach anyone.</li>
            <li>i though it might have been normal.</li>
            <li>Literally one minute the machine is working, leave the room, come back to finish and the thing doesn&#x27;t work right.</li>
            <li>so she said she&#x27;ll just ship me a new one....</li>
            <li>The machine is easy to clean and the entire process takes me about the same time as other foundations.</li>
            <li>Very natural coverage when used as instructed.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty simple to use, but I think it takes a while to do your face and neck.</li>
            <li>so I use my regular concealer first, then the foundation.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly the same thing.  </li>
            <li>And wow!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how to use it, and I was too lazy to pop in the DVD that comes with it.</li>
            <li>But the foundation doesn&#x27;t last very long, and it rubs off way to easily.  </li>
            <li>I found on the internet that you can totally take the system apart to clean and put it back together in working condition.  </li>
            <li>For the price, I am wondering if an airbrush system intended for models would work the same or better at about half the cost.</li>
            <li>less is more though don&#x27;t apply it multiple times!</li>
            <li>I was only able to spray half of my face with that amount.  </li>
            <li>Makeup shades in medium are a little light for me</li>
            <li>guess those two strikes are reason enough to return this pricey system and go back to store brand makeup - really wish it had worked as it promised!!</li>
            <li>Clearly exceeded her expectations.</li>
            <li>Not being one to wear much makeup, especially foundations, I took my time to do the research.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>WOW WOW and not one person would think I was wearing any.  </li>
            <li>theOk, so this was my first time airbrushing, and I read up on how you&#x27;re supposed to go in circular motion and not hesitate in one place for too long.</li>
            <li>and wow, it covered.</li>
            <li>so I use my old fashion brush for the blush.  </li>
            <li>What I really like about having all the extra colors is that when your skin color changes with the seasons you can tweak the color as you need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have had no trouble with mine at all.  </li>
            <li>I have had no trouble with mine at all.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 55 years old with combination skin.  </li>
            <li>The goal is to look natural.</li>
            <li>The machine is sturdy and isn&#x27;t too loud.</li>
            <li>In my research I also considered another airbrush makeup system that started with an \\&quot;L,\\&quot; but found more negative reviews and problems with that system than with the Belloccio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m throwing out my old kabuki brush and some of the others.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m throwing out my old kabuki brush and some of the others.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My Husband fixed it, and once I tried it again</li>
            <li>This product completely activates between 2 to 4 hours.</li>
            <li>I gather I am going to have to order a different makeup that they offer that is not in the kit but is much stronger.</li>
            <li>When I received the product one of the pieces was bent, I called the company and they fixed the airbrush in a timely manner and</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing makeup, and it really does last, no need for concealers either.</li>
            <li>Yes, it took me a little while to get it right, but it covered my problem areas very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, despite following the needle-cleaning instructions and using the cleaner, the inconsistency of the stream (sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn&#x27;t - and often when it does work the stream isn&#x27;t consistent enough for smooth application) makes it time consuming and less than the professional look</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, no going back to old foundation!</li>
            <li>and it was supposed to be open box like new!</li>
            <li>not as easy to apply on face to complicated and did not cover up my aging lines and uses to much drops to fast</li>
            <li>and I replaced with a nice little air compressor and gravity feed brush for about half the price.  </li>
            <li>It barely has enough pressure on high to push makeup.</li>
            <li>The new one came the next day!</li>
            <li>It has everything that you need and didn&#x27;t really take very long to put on.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a busy social life like my cousins and is why I decided to giving to them</li>
            <li>I have done airbrush makeup for years for pageants, tanning, cheerleaders and special effects for Halloween events and while the makeup itself is great, the compressor is by far the worst I have ever used.</li>
            <li>when I first tried it, I blasted it on where I need it most (under eyes).  </li>
            <li>The makeup is very sheer and natural</li>
            <li>I have been using Bare Minerals for years.  </li>
            <li>The compressor is not heavy enough to do the job.  </li>
            <li>Instead of holding the airbrush near my chin and pointing it up I preferred to apply it by holding it above my head and pointing it downward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The makeup is thin to be able to go through the airbrush.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It takes a little longer, but less makeup and more coverage?</li>
            <li>It was only $130 when I ordered it just prior to the New Year.  </li>
            <li>but now I really don&#x27;t want to use that other stuff anymore.  </li>
            <li>but now I really don&#x27;t want to use that other stuff anymore.  </li>
            <li>I live in Nevada where my face is sooo dry.  </li>
            <li>so finding the right make up is not easy.  </li>
            <li>-- it does not conceal an active breakout very well.  </li>
            <li>When I finally told her about my &amp;#34;findings&amp;#34; she was surprised and the next time i visited</li>
            <li>The only thing I still have trouble with is getting the blush on right.  </li>
            <li>This makeup does hold up well for a long busy day.  </li>
            <li>I think overall using the airbrush has added about 2-4 mins to my makeup application time, from before when I was using Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li>I think overall using the airbrush has added about 2-4 mins to my makeup application time, from before when I was using Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li>I received this a few days ago and tried it tonight for the first time.</li>
            <li>The airbrush itself seems pretty heavy duty.  </li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s a plus in itself since I have sensitive skin and typically break out with new products.  </li>
            <li>The product will not dry out your skin, will be there to stay and does not come off on clothes or your hands once dry and is also nearly undetectable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lastly, due to the stickiness factor of the makeup, the well was not easy to clean, even with the cleaner that comes with it.</li>
            <li>so fast.&lt;br /&gt;I end up using it only on rare occasions because it&#x27;s hard to get over that it takes 12 minutes to do what I can do in 30 seconds with a tinted moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I love this machine it is wonderful, however my dissatisfaction is with the makeup itself.</li>

            <li> so you get a spot on your face nothing good about the products</li>
            <li> , girls - sets up your face for the painting) and 6-8 caps of the color that best fit my face and a drop or two of the lighter shade.</li>
            <li> she would tell me how good i looked that day or that i was &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> However, every time I used the airbrush makeup she told me how good i looked that day.</li>
            <li> Good thing</li>
            <li> Good thing</li>
            <li> It looks good to me but complements</li>
            <li> Works good.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the good reviews.</li>
            <li> I try to give the benefit of the doubt because not everyone has a good experience with everything.</li>
            <li> I have to get the FAIR shade one now.  </li>
            <li> I bought his because my daughter has a set and when she applied it for me, it looked good, however I&#x27;m still working at this and hope to get an even finish.</li>
            <li> So...lots of choices to match for a perfect fit.  </li>
            <li> But I do still think this is a good value at $170</li>
            <li> The makeup: the colors were good.</li>
            <li> It lasts, even after 10 hours I still feel my skin looks good.  </li>
            <li> My skin tone is fair but going into the summer months I decided to purchase the medium shade foundations;</li>
            <li> Good Luck to you</li>
            <li> Makes skin look smooth and flawless!!</li>
            <li> My wife is delighted with this Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> all in all the compressor and the gun work great, it is very easy to use</li>
            <li> At one point she even asked if i was pregnant and not telling her lol!!</li>
            <li> this is a great kit that is about the cost of luminess and works just at good and their makeup is a better quality</li>
            <li> the quality on the make up and tools are excellent, I bought this kit for use it on my wedding on me and 2 more cousins, they love it too</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>

            <li> Very good i love it.......:)</li>
            <li> so having to clean out a tool every morning is not my ideal</li>
            <li> so having to clean out a tool every morning is not my ideal</li>
            <li> I absolotely love this!  </li>
            <li> I like it, but Luminess is better!</li>
            <li> I am sooooo glad that I bought this product!</li>
            <li> Turned on the airbrush machine today to make sure everything worked and let me tell you.... it is SO NOISY!</li>
            <li> First use was great!</li>
            <li> My face looked so much better!  </li>
            <li> I love this airbrush kit!</li>
            <li> I love it, it works well!</li>
            <li> And you better not get caught in the rain!</li>
            <li> My fianc&amp;eacute; loves this thing, it works great and Is easy to take apart.</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use you own makeup it will clog the machine.  </li>
            <li> I was concerned about not being able to get good coverage or splotchy coverage using it on myself</li>
            <li> I wanted to make sure it was good before I posted a review.  </li>
            <li> You end up with a really nice matte finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She liked the product and the results, however after 6 months it stopped working.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m headed about dinair and luminess air and to be honest</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this set 2 stars because the machine seems nice.  </li>
            <li> The case is nice</li>
            <li> I realized it had a mind of it&#x27;s own</li>
            <li> I think you have to have a pro makeup artist use this on you to get any kind of results at all.</li>
            <li> I eventually spoke with someone who worked with airbrushes and got a set of replacement needles and the unit works sporadically; sometime I get a nice spray out of it, sometime I get nothing.</li>
            <li> I liked it.</li>
            <li> I already own this.</li>
            <li> I did some searching foe reviews and this brand has more good reviews than the one on the infomercial .</li>
            <li> It goes on so easy and looks amazing!  </li>
            <li> Very easy to apply,,,,,feels nice  and stays on till you take it off.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s everything plus more .after long days of work it does a great job of giving me a flawless face to go out at nice .</li>
            <li> Everything was new and in excellent condition.  </li>
            <li> covers good like it said easy to use  ad</li>
            <li> and it is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I have mild rosacea and when i use this makeup/system it covers it very nicely but doesnt looked caked on like the bottle foundation i used to use.</li>
            <li> Worked beautifully when I first got it in the mail.</li>
            <li> The makeup goes on so light and coverage is good.  </li>
            <li> its the most amazing airbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> and I thought that for what you got, it was a great value and worth the try.  </li>
            <li> But all in all, the makeup is nice &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> feels so good light  </li>
            <li> It is so easy to use!  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use and so much better for your skin.</li>
            <li> The make up looked great after the first use.</li>
            <li> Great product fast shipping!</li>
            <li> It worked Great the first 5 times I used it but on try number six</li>
            <li> First, the compressor works great.</li>
            <li> The makeup colors are good, it was pretty easy to find/blend a good shade for my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> I will go a darker shade because it is very light even the tan and beige.</li>
            <li> Felt very cheap.</li>
            <li> By day three I was very comfortable with the color and application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> very light.  </li>
            <li> I had to return it, but got great customer service and full refund and return shipping free.</li>
            <li> I love spray on make up, it really makes your skin look Beautiful</li>
            <li> Easy to use, nice colors</li>
            <li> The very first time applying turned out good.</li>
            <li> Easy, perfect, natural.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, I found that running the airbrush under warm water for a couple of seconds cleaned it fine without the recommended dis-assembly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does a very good job of evening my skin tone and covering old acne scars and age spots.  </li>
            <li> After many youtubes, emails and calls I could not get it to work.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li> And the price is even better.  </li>
            <li> Buy this, and when you want to buy more makeup, then buy it.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> but it still works, I use it and love it.</li>
            <li> It did not come with maintenance care instructions however, but I was able to find a video from another company online.  </li>
            <li> The coverage is fantastic!</li>
            <li> and she fell in love.</li>
            <li> I took it apart and made sure the needle was not occluded.  </li>
            <li> I had to spray my face many times and it still did not cover anything&#x27;</li>
            <li> Please be sure you read the UPDATE at the end!!!**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I really love the look of it.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s actually OK.  </li>
            <li> 8 is more like it.  </li>
            <li> You probably want more if you want to do more layers.  </li>
            <li> It seems the medium is better.  </li>
            <li> because I got better at it or what.  </li>
            <li> but OK.  </li>
            <li> but OK.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many foundation.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> But the pic shows so much more than what&#x27;s included.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, it takes more product than the recommended 6-8 drops to get the level of coverage I wanted.  </li>
            <li> Love the simplicity of machine and airbrush.</li>
            <li> I would expect better for the money I paid.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I get much better coverage with Temptu.</li>
            <li> I love this compressor.  </li>
            <li> The more I used this makeup, the clearer my skin became.</li>
            <li> When I started using this airbrushing method, it took me about 20 min or more.  </li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> It had better still be under manufacturers warranty</li>
            <li> : I gave this one two more stars....</li>
            <li> More like 20-25 drops.  </li>
            <li> , they are going to use it more than me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I have it.in makeup brushes and in the makeup when it&#x27;s frequenlty touched by those brushes, so</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I have it.</li>
            <li> glad I didn&#x27;t wait until Christmas day to do so...</li>
            <li> I love this system.</li>
            <li> I love all the make up</li>
            <li> I knew Belloccio was a much better quality system.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the unit, it works really well, easy to clean</li>
            <li> When it is in working mode, the applied makeup looks Marvelous; there are enough colors to find a match and the makeup looks like velvet.</li>
            <li> So, all in all, this is an okay item and it serves its purpose.</li>
            <li> a out being able Tom aster</li>
            <li> I just wish the makeup was a bit more affordable.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup..</li>
            <li> I love this airbrush.</li>
            <li> I am in love with Airbrushing.</li>
            <li> so I took my time and made sure I kept the air gun at an appropriate distance and sprayed in continuous circular motions.</li>
            <li> but I have to use more than what they said to use.  </li>
            <li> LOVE the system.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure it was even on.</li>
            <li> I love the  highlighter.</li>
            <li> , they give you a fair amount of product to use right off the bat.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> All the hype is exactly that...hype!!!</li>
            <li> how much it made my skin look flawless until I washed my face that first night.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s is great love the filling looks very natural I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> it was a good working airbrush for the first couple times i used it</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using Belloccio because it was easy to assembly and use.  </li>
            <li> The set comes with so many colors of foundations and blushes which make is such a good value!  </li>
            <li> Not to loud, works great for makeup.  </li>
            <li> properly packed, it&#x27;s easy to use and clean, very satisfied with this purchase, thank you amazon!!</li>
            <li> I tend to have sensitive skin and haven&#x27;t experienced a problem with breakouts.</li>
            <li> It was way easier than expected and awesome results.</li>
            <li> i did everything the way the instructions said, and cleaned it every time,(which was not a speedy process) and my cheap makeup from cvs worked better.</li>
            <li> and it was clogging up on me and wasn&#x27;t spraying out that good, but it might had been cause I had too much makeup in there?</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really give you any info if it&#x27;s good or not.  </li>
            <li> so now i have to buy the fair shades because the ones i have are not for my skin tone all in all though i really like my airbrush</li>
            <li> The airbrush equipment (machine and parts etc.) are good quality and work really well.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and care for too!  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need as many drops of liquid makeup as I originally thought to get the coverage I was looking for.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I had ordered the Medium kit, but after playing with those colors, I ordered a bottle of the Blanc colored foundation and with a little more playing, found a perfect color for me.</li>
            <li> The down side is unless you are young with perfect skin you are not going to get great coverage.</li>
            <li> This was really easy to use.  </li>
            <li> but it is so easy.</li>
            <li> It gives good coverage and looks so much better and natural than the mineral make up I have been wearing for years.</li>
            <li> how easy it was to apply!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Talk about easy peasy.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use,</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> so returning it was easy</li>
            <li> Plus the airbrush is really easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, but yes there are steps.  </li>
            <li> It came very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Once I got it going it was so easy.  </li>
            <li> Its built well and easy to understand the directions.  </li>
            <li> It is quite easy to use.</li>
            <li> and it does the job just as good and even a little better!!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended good quality you wont regret it.</li>
            <li> I really liked this system when i first started using it.</li>
            <li> It was easy to assemble, easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Love this set- affordable and showed up quickly.</li>
            <li> This was a SUPER buy!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup that much but after using this machine, I will its easy to use and the finishing outcome is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Ultra fine mist, easy clean up and a variety of shades to mix for match.  </li>
            <li> I had a huge sigh of relief.  </li>
            <li> But the spray, when done correctly, is even and accurate.</li>
            <li> Machine did not work smoothly.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the recommended amount is for light coverage</li>
            <li> easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Since I have started using it, friends and strangers have told me what a smooth complexion and skin I have.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling light.</li>
            <li> so I followed the instructions precisely...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so light...</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s what makes it feel light.  </li>
            <li> The foundations were orange and the machine was cheap.</li>
            <li> Way to light.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was available on Prime</li>
            <li> it really is light on your skin</li>
            <li> The compressor will light up, but DOES NOT WORK.</li>
            <li> i recieved my kit was very sceptical about it, but will have to say it is vey nice  </li>
            <li> The makeup is so light</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so light</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so light</li>
            <li> i think i just need to find the right color and get more practice on how to use</li>
            <li> the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was not due to any defect, I just felt that the whole thing would have benifited greatly by having  more instructions for use.</li>
            <li> The return was super easy though..</li>
            <li> Its also quick and easy to put on and clean the machine after.</li>
            <li> Excited about receiving it I went to use it immediately</li>
            <li> First of all, the instructions are more of a pamphlet.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this airbrush set.  </li>
            <li> It is powerful!  </li>
            <li> I was really excited when I recieved this.  </li>
            <li> I use a Q-tip to clean the bowl and tip.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, the angle I found to be most effective was the opposite of what was recommended.  </li>
            <li> I clean the system after each use</li>
            <li> It sprayed when it wanted too, and then on top of that I noticed that when it would spray the makeup was doing absolutely nothing to cover light freckles on my face or even the smallest blemishes.</li>
            <li> Took me 15min to apply the foundation, blush and clean the machine.  </li>
            <li> so you can easily rinse it out when you are done or else it will get mucked up and not work right.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like doing the blush a bit to hard to make perfect</li>
            <li> I have had a hard time deciding which shade works the best with my skin tone because they all work so well without a hint of orange.</li>
            <li> and I am happy that it also had a wide selection of make up that you can order.</li>
            <li> and I mixed 2 to get a good shade for myself.</li>
            <li> so I really haven&#x27;t been able to use it.</li>
            <li> Any more than that is too much.  </li>
            <li> .Waiting for a full refund.</li>
            <li> and I work full time</li>
            <li> and I work full time</li>
            <li> It says full year warranty, but how can I contact them to get a replacement compressor?</li>
            <li> so when I tried this for the first time I was supprised at how easy it was to use.</li>
            <li> Seems to be good quality, but the carrying case could be a little bit more durable.</li>
            <li> All in all,  not bad for my very first air brush machine.</li>
            <li> when I first got the machine everything was working fine</li>
            <li> If you want more coverage- use a different concealer and get a better Makeup for airbrush.</li>
            <li> Lucky for me</li>
            <li> I went into my orders on Amazon and clicked on &amp;#34;return or replace items&amp;#34; - I would have liked to exchange/replace it to try again, but maybe I&#x27;ll do a little more research on airbrushes first to see if there is a better brand.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend :)</li>
            <li> I tried it first and did not do it smoothly.</li>
            <li> The highlighter was very pretty though.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time, which is good, but the feel of it takes some getting used to.  </li>
            <li> A great value compared to some other kits I looked into buying!  </li>
            <li> it works very well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Just go easy with the application, go light and let it dry a moment before adding more if you feel the need to.  </li>
            <li> Just go easy with the application, go light and let it dry a moment before adding more if you feel the need to.  </li>
            <li> At $120ish it was no small purchase, but more of an investment I believe.  </li>
            <li> It is easy, but figuring out what colors to use, how many drops to use, and how many times to go over one area with the airbrush just takes a little trial and error.  </li>
            <li> Great little product.</li>
            <li> But I also like looking nice, and I do think this makeup is better coverage without looking caked on or heavy.</li>
            <li> But I also like looking nice, and I do think this makeup is better coverage without looking caked on or heavy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually started using my old powder blush, then applying the foundation over it, which works great.  </li>
            <li> is truly a one of a kind product (the compressor / air tool is made by the same company that has contracts with NASA).  </li>
            <li> The set is well worth the money</li>
            <li> but I would recommend it to anyone wishing for a more natural look.</li>
            <li> It is the best feeling knowing that I don&#x27;t have a dirty brush or sponge touching my face ever again.</li>
            <li> The product itself is well worth the price</li>
            <li> tried to use it without much success</li>
            <li> but I thought the look I would get would be worth it.  </li>
            <li> but I thought the look I would get would be worth it.  </li>
            <li> (The lighter the color, the more natural I look.)&lt;br /&gt;  2.</li>
            <li> So if you have the money, I still think this product is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I have olive skin (mixed asian/caucasian) and it gets oily about three hours after I use any makeup, no matter what kind.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun to use, cuz I like being a girl and playing with makeup.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun to use, cuz I like being a girl and playing with makeup.  </li>
            <li> Vary worth the money</li>
            <li> The money is worth it on this system.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a lot of fun.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s worth the money I paid for.</li>
            <li> This really I&#x27;d worth it.</li>
            <li> This product was definitely a great buy, I&#x27;ve researched all the other brands out there and bought this because I was ready to try an airbrush makeup.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, the product arrived quickly, and was exactly as promised.  </li>
            <li> Other than that I loved the system</li>
            <li> Did not expect perfection right away, was just gonna try it out for practice.</li>
            <li> so you can find the right shde or mix 2.  </li>
            <li> let me know I&#x27;m right.  </li>
            <li> Plugged up right away when my wife tried to use it.</li>
            <li> Right out of the box</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t get it to work right.  </li>
            <li> it did contain a  small booklet, but I would have liked to have had more information or parhaps a dvd to go with it.</li>
            <li> If you use the blush, apply it first, rinse, then use the foundation; you get a more natural look</li>
            <li> If you use the blush, apply it first, rinse, then use the foundation; you get a more natural look</li>
            <li> I just got this (reason for only giving 4 stars instead of 5) and have only used it 3 times, but so far I am very impressed.</li>
            <li> I was using mineral makeup before this, and I liked that coverage and weight, but it just didn&#x27;t hold up well for a long day.  </li>
            <li> It definitely was A WHOLE Lot better than the original one I purchased with the kit.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised that it was easy.</li>
            <li> I spent $120 on my kit, so I expected things to be in perfect working condition.</li>
            <li> and I wanted to buy an airbrush system that is portable and easy to use as oppose to carrying I huge bag filled with the usual airbrush professional kits (most compressors are just too big).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> also do not like the foundation very much</li>
            <li> The makeup is weightless and natural looking and doesn&#x27;t show any of my huge blemishes.  </li>
            <li> However, after the first cleaning no makeup would come out of the tip (just air).</li>
            <li> Fingers crossed that I have better luck with the next one.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> And I do like the results when I&#x27;m willing to take the time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;About actually using the airbrush - OK - here&#x27;s the deal -</li>
            <li> When you apply, start with the airbrush up higher.  </li>
            <li> When you first turn it on, it defaults to medium speed.  </li>
            <li> The first one was a gift, I would like to get one for myself.</li>
            <li> not as happy with their liquid makeup...gets thick and clogs airbrush after 2 weeks .  </li>
            <li> I had this thing for a month and first the stylus stopped working then the machine.</li>
            <li> It would be my first airbrush purchase</li>
            <li> I actually looked more airbrushed with my Studio Fix then with the airbrush makeup.  </li>
            <li> Maybe you will have better luck and smaller pores!</li>
            <li> The more I used it, I noticed several things about it (and me):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really does what they claim!</li>
            <li> So for the price, it&#x27;s worth it to get the whole package.</li>
            <li> Its better than having big hug one</li>
            <li> When I began using it, for the FIRST TIME I might add...</li>
            <li> This is my first Airbrush System, if you don&#x27;t count the one I had for a day.</li>
            <li> This was my first time ever buying and using airbrush makeup.  </li>
            <li> The second time even better.</li>
            <li> The first order, the airbrush was defective.</li>
            <li> I now know to spend the extra money on the top line.</li>
            <li> The first 2 times i had used it</li>
            <li> I love the look and feel of airbrushing and purchased this system despite the mixed reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can say it&#x27;s pretty, and does airbrush the makeup evenly on my face.</li>
            <li> It took me forever to apply makeup the first time I tried it because I was so scared it wasn&#x27;t going to apply evenly</li>
            <li> I tried it out today for the first time.  </li>
            <li> and I felt confident enough to use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll write more later after I&#x27;ve used it for a while.  </li>
            <li> The Belloccio Airbrush System is easy to use and is the epitome of professional cosmetics that really work.</li>
            <li> It does such a great job until you actually have to clean the entire unit.  </li>
            <li> When I first started using this system, I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d use it for the long term.  </li>
            <li> The entire system was great but the makeup was weak had to buy better quality makeup.</li>
            <li> i like my airbrush so far because its better to use for my face only problem i have is that i should have gotten the fair shade kit and not the medium the medium is a bit to dark for me</li>
            <li> My favorite and completely unexpected benefit of this product is that after a few or more hours of wear, my face doesn&#x27;t become shinny.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Belloccio&#x27;s Professional Airbrush make up goes on smooth and</li>
            <li> It looks good and is still above average on the entire makeup spectrum, but for airbrush it doesn&#x27;t really give the super flawless coverage of other products (I personally like Belletto).</li>
            <li> It is easy to learn and takes just a short time to do.  </li>
            <li> Maybe you will have better luck and smaller pores!brush makeup or if I&#x27;m going to stick with my normal liquid foundation.  </li>
            <li> The system is easy to use and clean-up is a breeze, easy enough for daily use.</li>
            <li> You have to wash after every use and I love the dry makeup.</li>
            <li> I have to put it on low because it was so strong.  </li>
            <li> They give you a large bottle of cleaner.  </li>
            <li> i and im sure other people want it BRAND NEW not used!!!</li>
            <li> I have religiously cleaned each unit after every use with hot water, cleaning solution and Q-tips but after only a couple of months of use, each of the units have experienced the same malfunctions.</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to like all of them, so it&#x27;s best to get a few practice sprays on your arm before going to your face.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why on such a nice little gun that they use a cheap plastic</li>
            <li> Does not work very well.</li>
            <li> It took me 15 minutes and a burning forearm to get very blotchy coverage</li>
            <li> So all in all I really disapointed.</li>
            <li> Amazon was very accomodating with the return and prompt credit.</li>
            <li> e it really works.</li>
            <li> But really, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any need of anything else.  </li>
            <li> I figured this one out because if you don&#x27;t, before you know it you will have moved the airbrush very close to your face</li>
            <li> but it really doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I really hope it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE - so I am ready to buy refills for the foundation and primer.  </li>
            <li> I really hope it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE - so I am ready to buy refills for the foundation and primer.  </li>
            <li> Very.</li>
            <li> not so much.</li>
            <li> To much maintenance...</li>
            <li> So now I had an orange face with very enlarged looking pores.  </li>
            <li> And my pores looked much much smaller...and</li>
            <li> The recommended 6-8 drops really is enough!&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I l brushike the whole Air system</li>
            <li> And I am very meticulous about cleaning too</li>
            <li> It took me about three tries/days to really get the hang of it.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t give me the coverage I need when I have some blemishes or during the winter when my skin tone is very uneven.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> But as far as quality and value for the money, I think this product is worth it</li>
            <li> this is a much cleaner way of applying makeup.  </li>
            <li> But as far as quality and value for the money, I think this product is worth it</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work very well for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m returning it and will see what the real pro&#x27;s use...</li>
            <li> So fast and skin looks clearer and silky with no oil.</li>
            <li> I spent another $50 on a replacement compressor and won&#x27;t be able to try this out until Monday night.</li>
            <li> Never ordered another airbrush makeup set, so I can&#x27;t really make a contribution with comparisons.</li>
            <li> I really like this make up and</li>
            <li> you really don&#x27;t feel like there is anything on your skin  </li>
            <li> I was very please when I received the air system.  </li>
            <li> and I really like the blush.</li>
            <li> really.</li>
            <li> I have another one but different brand and this one is by far better.  </li>
            <li> I was going to give it 3 stars because I find that I need at least twice the recommended amount of foundation to get the coverage I want, but to be fair</li>
            <li> but I figured going through Amazon was at least a good idea.  </li>
            <li> My friend purchased the big named one and mine is by far a much better quality machine.</li>
            <li> I got this one because &#x60;the other one&#x27; costs more and didn&#x27;t have all the goodies with it.  </li>
            <li> I originally bought a different well</li>
            <li> This is because of my age and the condition of my skin, but other than that I love it.  </li>
            <li> When it did work properly, only twice, the results were amazing, however, that was only twice;  Returned the machine and ordered a new one hoping the 1st one was just defective.  </li>
            <li> I recommend a few more minutes the first time you use it.</li>
            <li> no hassle of having to clean out the various parts of an airbrush system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like it especially for a special occasion and during the summer</li>
            <li> Do not plan to use it for the first time right before a big day or event.  </li>
            <li> This will bring you the result for what you want sheer coverage to full coverage.  </li>
            <li> I have heard you can buy one from Harbor Freight or other types of stores, we&#x27;ll see what I find! :)</li>
            <li> I paid for a new system!</li>
            <li> But to me, I know that germs and bacteria that can cause acne live in makeup brushes and in the makeup when it&#x27;s frequenlty touched by those brushes, so this is a much cleaner way of applying makeup.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use the tanner since I live in AZ and really don&#x27;t have a need for it.</li>
            <li> (Which I think led to my ability to use less of the makeup, because I didn&#x27;t have as many blemishes to cover.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> main thing about the airbrush is to keep it moving.  </li>
            <li> I thought I got the more expensive brand because it would be better quality...</li>
            <li> After two weeks, my skin overall actually looks better than it has in a while</li>
            <li> After two weeks, my skin overall actually looks better than it has in a while</li>
            <li> I almost boxed it up right then and there to send back, but I really wanted this to work.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this product, it arrived on time and  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this system.  </li>
            <li> They send a cute little carrying case to go with the airbrush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They send a cute little carrying case to go with the airbrush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The makeup itself leaves a little more wanting.</li>
            <li> I had to wash my face again and start from scratch with my normal makeup.  </li>
            <li> At this point, I am unsure if I am going to try another brand of airbrush makeup or if I&#x27;m going to stick with my normal liquid foundation.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to get a missing part since I purchased it, but have not been able to reach anyone.</li>
            <li> i though it might have been normal.</li>
            <li> Literally one minute the machine is working, leave the room, come back to finish and the thing doesn&#x27;t work right.</li>
            <li> so she said she&#x27;ll just ship me a new one....</li>
            <li> The machine is easy to clean and the entire process takes me about the same time as other foundations.</li>
            <li> Very natural coverage when used as instructed.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty simple to use, but I think it takes a while to do your face and neck.</li>
            <li> so I use my regular concealer first, then the foundation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly the same thing.  </li>
            <li> And wow!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how to use it, and I was too lazy to pop in the DVD that comes with it.</li>
            <li> But the foundation doesn&#x27;t last very long, and it rubs off way to easily.  </li>
            <li> I found on the internet that you can totally take the system apart to clean and put it back together in working condition.  </li>
            <li> For the price, I am wondering if an airbrush system intended for models would work the same or better at about half the cost.</li>
            <li> less is more though don&#x27;t apply it multiple times!</li>
            <li> I was only able to spray half of my face with that amount.  </li>
            <li> Makeup shades in medium are a little light for me</li>
            <li> guess those two strikes are reason enough to return this pricey system and go back to store brand makeup - really wish it had worked as it promised!!</li>
            <li> Clearly exceeded her expectations.</li>
            <li> Not being one to wear much makeup, especially foundations, I took my time to do the research.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> WOW WOW and not one person would think I was wearing any.  </li>
            <li> theOk, so this was my first time airbrushing, and I read up on how you&#x27;re supposed to go in circular motion and not hesitate in one place for too long.</li>
            <li> and wow, it covered.</li>
            <li> so I use my old fashion brush for the blush.  </li>
            <li> What I really like about having all the extra colors is that when your skin color changes with the seasons you can tweak the color as you need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had no trouble with mine at all.  </li>
            <li> I have had no trouble with mine at all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 55 years old with combination skin.  </li>
            <li> The goal is to look natural.</li>
            <li> The machine is sturdy and isn&#x27;t too loud.</li>
            <li> In my research I also considered another airbrush makeup system that started with an \\&quot;L,\\&quot; but found more negative reviews and problems with that system than with the Belloccio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m throwing out my old kabuki brush and some of the others.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m throwing out my old kabuki brush and some of the others.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My Husband fixed it, and once I tried it again</li>
            <li> This product completely activates between 2 to 4 hours.</li>
            <li> I gather I am going to have to order a different makeup that they offer that is not in the kit but is much stronger.</li>
            <li> When I received the product one of the pieces was bent, I called the company and they fixed the airbrush in a timely manner and</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing makeup, and it really does last, no need for concealers either.</li>
            <li> Yes, it took me a little while to get it right, but it covered my problem areas very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, despite following the needle-cleaning instructions and using the cleaner, the inconsistency of the stream (sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn&#x27;t - and often when it does work the stream isn&#x27;t consistent enough for smooth application) makes it time consuming and less than the professional look</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, no going back to old foundation!</li>
            <li> and it was supposed to be open box like new!</li>
            <li> not as easy to apply on face to complicated and did not cover up my aging lines and uses to much drops to fast</li>
            <li> and I replaced with a nice little air compressor and gravity feed brush for about half the price.  </li>
            <li> It barely has enough pressure on high to push makeup.</li>
            <li> The new one came the next day!</li>
            <li> It has everything that you need and didn&#x27;t really take very long to put on.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a busy social life like my cousins and is why I decided to giving to them</li>
            <li> I have done airbrush makeup for years for pageants, tanning, cheerleaders and special effects for Halloween events and while the makeup itself is great, the compressor is by far the worst I have ever used.</li>
            <li> when I first tried it, I blasted it on where I need it most (under eyes).  </li>
            <li> The makeup is very sheer and natural</li>
            <li> I have been using Bare Minerals for years.  </li>
            <li> The compressor is not heavy enough to do the job.  </li>
            <li> Instead of holding the airbrush near my chin and pointing it up I preferred to apply it by holding it above my head and pointing it downward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The makeup is thin to be able to go through the airbrush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes a little longer, but less makeup and more coverage?</li>
            <li> It was only $130 when I ordered it just prior to the New Year.  </li>
            <li> but now I really don&#x27;t want to use that other stuff anymore.  </li>
            <li> but now I really don&#x27;t want to use that other stuff anymore.  </li>
            <li> I live in Nevada where my face is sooo dry.  </li>
            <li> so finding the right make up is not easy.  </li>
            <li> -- it does not conceal an active breakout very well.  </li>
            <li> When I finally told her about my &amp;#34;findings&amp;#34; she was surprised and the next time i visited</li>
            <li> The only thing I still have trouble with is getting the blush on right.  </li>
            <li> This makeup does hold up well for a long busy day.  </li>
            <li> I think overall using the airbrush has added about 2-4 mins to my makeup application time, from before when I was using Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li> I think overall using the airbrush has added about 2-4 mins to my makeup application time, from before when I was using Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li> I received this a few days ago and tried it tonight for the first time.</li>
            <li> The airbrush itself seems pretty heavy duty.  </li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s a plus in itself since I have sensitive skin and typically break out with new products.  </li>
            <li> The product will not dry out your skin, will be there to stay and does not come off on clothes or your hands once dry and is also nearly undetectable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lastly, due to the stickiness factor of the makeup, the well was not easy to clean, even with the cleaner that comes with it.</li>
            <li> so fast.&lt;br /&gt;I end up using it only on rare occasions because it&#x27;s hard to get over that it takes 12 minutes to do what I can do in 30 seconds with a tinted moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It could break down and I would order a new one.</li>
            <li> I am an avid researcher and I could hardly find any type of review of this set on the internet, good or bad.  </li>
            <li> I opted to keep the unit and I only use it for very special occasions - allowing for LOTS of time, Just In Case it chooses to fail.</li>
            <li> , My only complaint is the plastic handle broke the first day ( it screws in)</li>
            <li> Usually when we put on powder blush, we start low and go high.  </li>
            <li> I can see this becoming expensive as the bottles are only 1/4 of an ounce and when you purchase the foundation a single 1/2 ounce bottle is almost $16.</li>
            <li> A couple of spots on my face looked cakey probably due to over applying the foundation in those areas but in general my face did not look airbrushed at all.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this set as a back up to my other compressor and to try a different water based foundation.</li>
            <li> Only thing that turned me off was the fact I could not really contour my face or cover up my blemished skin.</li>
            <li> tried it on a long weekend so that I could get plenty of practice.  </li>
            <li> Maybe on another long weekend I&#x27;ll give it a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried to return this item , but I had waited too long to return it.  </li>
            <li> Start around the middle of the area and don&#x27;t go down as low as you would with powder blush</li>
            <li> Within the first few uses, the little lever which controls the flow became loose and did not work.</li>
            <li> At least with other airbrush systems, you may not have such an intense type of cleaning process as with this one.  </li>
            <li> At least with other airbrush systems, you may not have such an intense type of cleaning process as with this one.  </li>
            <li> So now i know why the cost was so low verses other brands.</li>
            <li> I let it dry, (do your eye makeup and concealer at this time) then put on the foundation.  </li>
            <li> It does not leave my skin feeling dry either.</li>
            <li> However, what a gross, wet mess it left on my face!  </li>
            <li> Not good coverage and very orange.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that the make up is dark...</li>
            <li> I was using Bare Minerals for a few years but</li>
            <li> The makeup seems so thin at first</li>
            <li> Overall,  I really like the makeup that comes with the airbrush kit, however, the actual airbrush seems to be made a little poorly.</li>
            <li> I was having issues with adult acne and hoped this would be less oily than typical foundations, and it is.</li>
            <li> By the third time - I had it down</li>
            <li> I use this on a daily basis now and I wouldn&#x27;t have it any other way!</li>
            <li> after using this product for about a month now, I&#x27;m not sure I will ever go back to using regular foundation makeup again.</li>
            <li> I used it today and at first I thought it wasn&#x27;t working, but then realized the tube was twisted and not enough air was coming through.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I notice about the makeup is that it feels a little chalky once it&#x27;s on and set.  </li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;re done - fill up the cup with cleaner, spray a little through it, put your finger on the tip to let it back bubble and spray it again.  </li>
            <li> Life gets in the way.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it was a great and expensive disappointment.</li>
            <li> It looks great, but makes my face breaks out horribly!</li>
            <li> it says it only takes a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been curious about airbrushing for years.  </li>
            <li> A prior review said they had uneven spots and it looked cakey.</li>
            <li> I cleaned it a few times to make sure I wasn&#x27;t missing anything, going over the directions again, though, they aren&#x27;t complicated.</li>
            <li> I cleaned the unit after each use and was careful to follow all the directions.  </li>
            <li> Just a couple of tries</li>
            <li> If you have your eyes closed, you won&#x27;t do that.  </li>
            <li> Hint - be careful when you unscrew the needle holder.  </li>
            <li> Hint - be careful when you unscrew the needle holder.  </li>
            <li> This product took a couple of tries for me to figure out the tricks</li>
            <li> And it stopped working and the couple of times it did work there was not much noticeable difference over all save your time and money.</li>
            <li> The air brush gun never really worked like it should have.</li>
            <li> And the sad thing is that its not even worth the trouble to send it back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nature, not much you can do about that.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Yeah, be careful with this.</li>
            <li> had dried makeup around the outside and on the screw part.</li>
            <li> But the makeup was wet on my face and was blotchy.  </li>
            <li> A few days later when I was cleaning the system the trigger fell off</li>
            <li> Not much assembly</li>
            <li> On my third try, the little lever you press down, separated.</li>
            <li> Then at the third time, the thing started putting out little to no make up!</li>
            <li> Those infomercials end up charging $400 to $600 for those other brands, with monthly auto ships too.  </li>
            <li> I will still keep my other makeup for travel</li>
            <li> I will still keep my other makeup for travel</li>
            <li> Too small and too sheer for my needs as makeup artist.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think they have any other choices...</li>
            <li> the speed controls work unlike some of the other brands.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be aware that if anything is wrong with your unit - YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed can&#x27;t wait to get more colors..</li>
            <li> I should have gone with one of the other companies.</li>
            <li> I experimented with one side of my face with one color, then the other side.</li>
            <li> So be very careful when thinking of buying this.</li>
            <li> Broke after 3 months,  was very careful with cleaning and use...disappointed</li>
            <li> figured if I was treated as if I were a Moron when asking a simple question about a possible defect and a possible, simple request for a low cost replacement needle - then I would not bother with a request for return.</li>
            <li> Only received really small .2ml sized foundations (3) and (3) little creams.</li>
            <li> and I have had no success in doing so.  </li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t have prime, it&#x27;s not worth the gamble.</li>
            <li> I could tell immediately that they were going to be too dark for my skin.  </li>
            <li> This sucks big time...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve invested over $180 into this kit (shipping costs included), not worth the stress, hassle, or money.</li>
            <li> The front part of the nozzle (sprayer) fell off and went down the drain after about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> It can come off and try to go down your drain.  </li>
            <li> It can come off and try to go down your drain.  </li>
            <li> I researched airbrush make up, from brushes to application for about a month and a half.</li>
            <li> and I have less blemishes..</li>
            <li> and I have less blemishes..</li>
            <li> Compressor broke after less than one month.  </li>
            <li> The Belloccio makeup is lower quality and the Belloccio airbrush has less control.</li>
            <li> and I had to move the trigger back and forth the entire time and it barely sprayed. :(</li>
            <li> and you will have a mess of a face.</li>
            <li> Medium is not a true medium</li>
            <li> thing about this is that it takes a little practice.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the system for two weeks, and my skin seems a little healthier/fresh than with the minerals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Though I may touch up once or twice with a little Mineral Veil to blot up the oil, because even with this makeup my face get oily,  </li>
            <li> The bronzer/brushes are can apply too dark, if you don&#x27;t change the pressure!</li>
            <li> Refills are a little pricey.</li>
            <li> The entire system, and makeup was an utter disappointment.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money ...</li>
            <li> I got this because of my acne and my uneven skin tone and am so used to wearing the thickest foundation that is out</li>
            <li> so I gave up, cleaned it and took a few days off.</li>
            <li> kit was missing the foundation  </li>
            <li> Moving it slower over trouble areas will not do the job.  </li>
            <li> see where others have had trouble with their unit breaking.  </li>
            <li> see where others have had trouble with their unit breaking.  </li>
            <li> Did not wrk properly the needle keeps getn stuck the machine is poorly made.</li>
            <li> I just wasted money that I cannot  afford.</li>
            <li> Waited a few days and tried again.</li>
            <li> The compressor is sleek and silver and the airbrush pen is substantial in weight and not cheap looking or feeling at all.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> it broke, it is only taking space in a corner of my closet because what can i do with a broken airbrush  </li>
            <li> The pen had makeup in it, it was missing pieces the airbrush compressed</li>
            <li> I ordered this seriously a few days ago.  </li>
            <li> Something in the primer makes my skin feel firm.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very disappointing because I was so excited.</li>
            <li> Either they do not spray or when they do, they sprays out in drops, not a fine mist.</li>
            <li> This product was not easy to use and the makeup was not what I needed.&#x60;</li>
            <li> But for special occasions I recommend the base, blush and highlighter.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if it was my cleaning skills or a defective unit.</li>
            <li> These airbrush makeup kits are too expensive to leave lying around collecting dust because it doesn&#x27;t work properly.  </li>
            <li> have acne scarring, rosacea and a small age spot.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied at all....</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s somewhat sticky so errors are really difficult to fix, especially once you&#x27;re in the blush stage.</li>
            <li> Usually I use Dinair.</li>
            <li> to much trouble to use!</li>
            <li> /&gt;a while later after i bought the airbrush system,&lt;br /&gt;i have had my airbrush since i think december i am  very disappointed because i paid so much money for it and by january 15</li>
            <li> When it arrived the whole package was open and USED it was disgusting!</li>
            <li> no coverage and the gun sucks</li>
            <li> Such a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> At least for me.</li>
            <li> Anything of this price, I research like crazy and this was no different.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the makeup line, but u can use the big name makeup in this machine....</li>
            <li> Such a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Too close or too slow</li>
            <li> From primer application and drying (eye makeup time - even though the primer dries in seconds) through foundation, blush and cleaning - just under 6 minutes, and I was moving slow for a Monday morning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> From primer application and drying (eye makeup time - even though the primer dries in seconds) through foundation, blush and cleaning - just under 6 minutes, and I was moving slow for a Monday morning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased the system a few months ago used it maybe 10 times and its already broken.  </li>
            <li> I was using the wrong color all along with other foundations.</li>
            <li> My only con is I am lazy and hate cleaning everyday!</li>
            <li> I might not have bought it at $170, because there are less expensive brands.  </li>
            <li> Yikes, not good.  </li>
            <li> BUT, if the makeup is no good then the quality of the machine isn&#x27;t going to help any.  </li>
            <li> control on the wand worked the first time - the coverage of the makeup was horrible on my skin</li>
            <li> but I did receive the wrong color and the company gave me a hard way to go when I try to change the color</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy</li>
            <li> For day time I sometimes use the foundation base only.  </li>
            <li> Not happy with this product at all.</li>
            <li> but I need to thin out the makeup</li>
            <li> So annoyed.  </li>
            <li> so i have to stay with the broken airbrush system that i cant even use</li>
            <li> But if you want to hide imperfections or mold trouble zones its very difficult.</li>
            <li> , I live in Florida and the moment that you start sweating the foundation starts to run, I also found that the coverage is terrible on age spots, I am 50 and have some age spots from sun damage.</li>
            <li> Not a good product!</li>
            <li> I was a little frustrated</li>
            <li> But i was very disappointed when just the third time i used it the compressor just stopped working!</li>
            <li> Piece of crap, sorry I ordered this and wasted my money.</li>
            <li> The product clogged in the applicator and we were unable to get support to match skin tone</li>
            <li> Scary.  </li>
            <li> Expensive for makeup</li>
            <li> Expensive for makeup</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t use this air brush makeup every time I apply make up as it is expensive.  </li>
            <li> but they are too expensive.</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I received it today and</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I won&#x27;t be ordering this brand ever again.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical</li>
            <li> there was this weird smell coming from it,</li>
            <li> used nasty product back before I can receive my refund then reorder the package!</li>
            <li> Sorry,</li>
            <li> too expensive.  </li>
            <li> Are they crazy???  </li>
            <li> Are they crazy???  </li>
            <li> wtf?!</li>
            <li> THAT WOULD BE FALSE!!</li>
            <li> I never would have thought I &#x27;d have gotten a bad one...</li>
            <li> but then I guess I just had a bad airbrush tool</li>
            <li> Also do NOT use this if you are going to be sweating as it runs really badly</li>
            <li> even sitting on a foam base.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a load of crap.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed</li>
            <li> so i am very disappointed with this purchase</li>
            <li> I was so very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed and warehouse deals INC</li>
            <li> This product is TERRIBLE!</li>
            <li> Well, this is one time I should have paid heed to the horrible reviews.</li>
            <li> So disappointing!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Worked beautifully when I first got it in the mail. However, after the first cleaning no makeup would come out of the tip (just air). After many youtubes, emails and calls I could not get it to work. I had to return it, but got great customer service and full refund and return shipping free. The make up looked great after the first use. I am not sure if it was my cleaning skills or a defective unit. I may try again, but really had trouble finding anyone to help me resolve the issue, except to offer the refund.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money ...nothing comes out of the gun if it dose its all t once so you get a spot on your face nothing good about the products no coverage and the gun sucks I&#x27;m going to send mine back..</li>
            <li> This was really easy to use.  The only thing I still have trouble with is getting the blush on right.  I&#x27;ve actually started using my old powder blush, then applying the foundation over it, which works great.  The makeup colors are good, it was pretty easy to find/blend a good shade for my skin tone.  The only thing I notice about the makeup is that it feels a little chalky once it&#x27;s on and set.  It lasts a long time, which is good, but the feel of it takes some getting used to.  Overall, I like the system.</li>
            <li> This product is TERRIBLE! Excited about receiving it I went to use it immediately, the makeup was way to watery and doesn&#x27;t cover up ANYTHING... I was very disappointed so I contacted the seller, who couldn&#x27;t help me and said he would transfer me to a voicemail of someone who never called be back... I am out almost $200... wtf?!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended good quality you wont regret it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup every day so when I tried this for the first time I was supprised at how easy it was to use.</li>
            <li> Very natural coverage when used as instructed.  Newbies should definitely watch the instruction videos and read the troubleshooting on the enclosed card.  The DVD didn&#x27;t work, so I just went to the company&#x27;s website to watch the videos.  I practiced lots before using for a wedding I was attending, and even after about an hour of dancing, my makeup was great.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to counter makeup again!  Easy, perfect, natural.  LOVE this product.  Easy to clean and care for too!  And the price is even better.  Those infomercials end up charging $400 to $600 for those other brands, with monthly auto ships too.  Buy this, and when you want to buy more makeup, then buy it.</li>
            <li> Does not work very well. Not a good product!</li>
            <li> I bought this in January hoping to use for a wedding last month.  I hooked everything up only to find it didn&#x27;t work.  Such a disappointment.  What is the return policy on this?</li>
            <li> This was bought for me as a Christmas present and I absolutely love it. I have another one but different brand and this one is by far better.  The sprayer is great and you get the blush spray on with this one.</li>
            <li> Machine did not work smoothly.  Had to keep pulling the trigger to make the makeup flow from the pen which in turn made the makeup look blotchy.  When it did work properly, only twice, the results were amazing, however, that was only twice;  Returned the machine and ordered a new one hoping the 1st one was just defective.  We will see.  If it works the same way then I will need to send that one back as well.  These airbrush makeup kits are too expensive to leave lying around collecting dust because it doesn&#x27;t work properly.  Fingers crossed that I have better luck with the next one.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I received this a few days ago and tried it tonight for the first time. Did not expect perfection right away, was just gonna try it out for practice. The front part of the nozzle (sprayer) fell off and went down the drain after about 3 minutes. Piece of crap, sorry I ordered this and wasted my money.</li>
            <li> We got this and only couple of months later it stopped working and we had to throw it out.</li>
            <li> I do like it.  The makeup is very sheer and natural which is great.&lt;br /&gt;But it says it only takes a few minutes.  Um....  NO it does not.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a matter of getting used to it; it&#x27;s the process.  The makeup can only go through the machine so fast.&lt;br /&gt;I end up using it only on rare occasions because it&#x27;s hard to get over that it takes 12 minutes to do what I can do in 30 seconds with a tinted moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does work well though.  And I do like the results when I&#x27;m willing to take the time.</li>
            <li> I just got this and have tried it twice.  I was going to give it 3 stars because I find that I need at least twice the recommended amount of foundation to get the coverage I want, but to be fair I don&#x27;t know if the recommended amount is for light coverage and I like medium coverage so I gave it 4 stars. Once I achieved the coverage I like I was very happy with the product, looks great.  I can see this becoming expensive as the bottles are only 1/4 of an ounce and when you purchase the foundation a single 1/2 ounce bottle is almost $16.</li>
            <li> The product clogged in the applicator and we were unable to get support to match skin tone</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s is great love the filling looks very natural I would recommend this. That is all u have to say.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been curious about airbrushing for years.  Not being one to wear much makeup, especially foundations, I took my time to do the research.&lt;br /&gt;This is truly a one of a kind product (the compressor / air tool is made by the same company that has contracts with NASA).  Ultra fine mist, easy clean up and a variety of shades to mix for match.  I had no idea how much it made my skin look flawless until I washed my face that first night.  WOW WOW WOW and not one person would think I was wearing any.  Simply flawless.</li>
            <li> theOk, so this was my first time airbrushing, and I read up on how you&#x27;re supposed to go in circular motion and not hesitate in one place for too long. I got this because of my acne and my uneven skin tone and am so used to wearing the thickest foundation that is out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I set up the product, put 3-5 caps of the primer (the white bottle - it has to be used each time, girls - sets up your face for the painting) and 6-8 caps of the color that best fit my face and a drop or two of the lighter shade. I began to use it and wow, it covered. Yes, it took me a little while to get it right, but it covered my problem areas very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning was a breeze, too, if you follow the simple directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a little longer, but less makeup and more coverage? I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> So easy to use and my makeup looks flawless and not a pore in sight! Set comes with plenty of shades so you can find the right shde or mix 2.  A prior review said they had uneven spots and it looked cakey. That will happen if you hold the brush closer than 6 inches to your skin .</li>
            <li> My wife loves this kit. She threw away a TON of makup she has collected over the year. I would buy it again just to re-gain the cabinet space.</li>
            <li> so I recieved my belloccio airbrush system just now opened it an this is what I found. Everything thrown in a bag! Put together mind you. Qtips???? A belly ring?!?? I paid for a new system! This is used! An the liquid for the makeup has been used! I&#x27;m not happy an want this handled ASAP</li>
            <li> always wanted an airbrush, although I had no idea what I was doing. It&#x27;s pretty simple to use, but I think it takes a while to do your face and neck. and it was clogging up on me and wasn&#x27;t spraying out that good, but it might had been cause I had too much makeup in there? idk. but it still works, I use it and love it.</li>
            <li> So, this is not a deal.  I had to return it after just using it for my personal self for a couple weeks.  The make up is not all that great either.  Also, it is not quiet.  even sitting on a foam base.  I would not recommend it.  The return was super easy though.. and I replaced with a nice little air compressor and gravity feed brush for about half the price.  Then bought make up in larger bottles in groups of 3 by a different company.</li>
            <li> The set is well worth the money and it is very easy to use.  It did not come with maintenance care instructions however, but I was able to find a video from another company online.  The coverage is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Great product fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using Belloccio because it was easy to assembly and use.  There were several choices of foundation to choose from.  I have never used an Airbrush before but I would recommend it to anyone wishing for a more natural look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s everything plus more .after long days of work it does a great job of giving me a flawless face to go out at nice . Feels like your not wearing makeup</li>
            <li> This was the second system I got (for my mom). I have mild rosacea and when i use this makeup/system it covers it very nicely but doesnt looked caked on like the bottle foundation i used to use. every time i would send my mom pictures she would tell me how good i looked that day or that i was &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34;. At one point she even asked if i was pregnant and not telling her lol!! So, i conducting sort of an &amp;#34;experiment&amp;#34; over about 2 months. The days that I had to rush out and just put bottled foundation on and sent the pictures (snapchat) nothing was said. However, every time I used the airbrush makeup she told me how good i looked that day. When I finally told her about my &amp;#34;findings&amp;#34; she was surprised and the next time i visited i tested it out on her and she fell in love. Now we both have one and absolutely love it!!</li>
            <li> I bought this model after watching a TV infomercial.  I didn&#x27;t want to get tied up in a recurring month shipment.  This unit is awesome!!  The makeup goes on so light and coverage is good.  I didn&#x27;t like doing the blush a bit to hard to make perfect so I use my old fashion brush for the blush.  Don&#x27;t use you own makeup it will clog the machine.  I highly recommend this product, no going back to old foundation!</li>
            <li> I just got this (reason for only giving 4 stars instead of 5) and have only used it 3 times, but so far I am very impressed. It is so easy to use!  I was concerned about not being able to get good coverage or splotchy coverage using it on myself but it is so easy. There is a good range of medium colors in the kit - my daughter has fair skin and the lightest color looked great on her and I mixed 2 to get a good shade for myself. The airbrush itself seems pretty heavy duty.  A great value compared to some other kits I looked into buying!  I have acne scars and age spots so I use my regular concealer first, then the foundation. It gives good coverage and looks so much better and natural than the mineral make up I have been wearing for years.</li>
            <li> I researched airbrush make up, from brushes to application for about a month and a half. After finding that the individual brush and the individual compressor I chose were both Belloccio, I decided to get the kit with the make up and carrying case. I must say I was 100% impressed and VERY VERY happy with my coverage and how easy it was to apply!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have acne scarring, rosacea and a small age spot. I took before and after photos and posted them online - people were amazed! After use, I thoroughly cleaned the airbrush with the cleaning solution. On day 2, it wasn&#x27;t spraying like it should. I cleaned it a few times to make sure I wasn&#x27;t missing anything, going over the directions again, though, they aren&#x27;t complicated. On my third attempt, day 3, I constantly had to move the trigger back and forth to get it to spray. I was a little frustrated so I gave up, cleaned it and took a few days off. I tried to use it again and I had to move the trigger back and forth the entire time and it barely sprayed. :( It took me 15 minutes and a burning forearm to get very blotchy coverage and then I had to touch up with my mineral powder. It&#x27;s very disappointing because I was so excited. I went into my orders on Amazon and clicked on &amp;#34;return or replace items&amp;#34; - I would have liked to exchange/replace it to try again, but maybe I&#x27;ll do a little more research on airbrushes first to see if there is a better brand. I have heard you can buy one from Harbor Freight or other types of stores, we&#x27;ll see what I find! :)</li>
            <li> I absolotely love this!  I just got it yesterday and I used it this morning.  Talk about easy peasy.  I have been using Bare Minerals for years.  I live in Nevada where my face is sooo dry.  My face feeels so moist and wish I would have bought this years ago.  Easy to use, easy to clean.  Yippeee!  I so recommend it.  It goes on so easy and looks amazing!  A must buy!  I recommend a few more minutes the first time you use it.</li>
            <li> I was so happg when I recived the air brush system. I went threw everything in the box&lt;br /&gt;my kit was missing the foundation  so I really haven&#x27;t been able to use it. So all in all I really disapointed.</li>
            <li> when I first got the machine everything was working fine and then it stopped working and now the air comes out by the trigger instead of through the tip where its supposed to. any suggestions?</li>
            <li> Emailed the seller and hasnt returned my email. The spraygun is defective and i need to return or replace it.</li>
            <li> The compressor is not heavy enough to do the job.  I used it for a week with no difficulty.  I cleaned the unit after each use and was careful to follow all the directions.  After 7 days, no air was pushing out of the wand.  I took it apart and made sure the needle was not occluded.  The directions to do this are included.  It did not help and I had to return the unit.  Amazon was very accomodating with the return and prompt credit.</li>
            <li> I had to spray my face many times and it still did not cover anything&#x27;</li>
            <li> I just got it.  The stylist does not work... I am going to have to call the company. I love spray on make up, it really makes your skin look Beautiful so I will give you an up date when the company responds to me. The make up is very nice if I can get the machine to work.</li>
            <li> Amazing. It was very good purchase. Easy to use, nice colors e it really works.</li>
            <li> The foundation pallet was perfect. Only thing that turned me off was the fact I could not really contour my face or cover up my blemished skin. The bronzer and highlighter help to pop up your bone structure. But if you want to hide imperfections or mold trouble zones its very difficult. There might be additional products that can be used to achieve this but they do not come with the starter kit.</li>
            <li> I like it, but Luminess is better!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, do pay attention parts tend to loosen but just tighten up and it works awesome</li>
            <li> Overall,  I really like the makeup that comes with the airbrush kit, however, the actual airbrush seems to be made a little poorly. Within the first few uses, the little lever which controls the flow became loose and did not work. I had to take the pen apart and tighten it up to get it working again. Also, I attempted contacting Belloccio customer service but never heard back.</li>
            <li> **Please be sure you read the UPDATE at the end!!!**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this every day for almost a month.  I wanted to make sure it was good before I posted a review.  I got this one because &#x60;the other one&#x27; costs more and didn&#x27;t have all the goodies with it.  This one has everything you see in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing about this is that it takes a little practice.  It&#x27;s not the same as slapping on foundation.  By the third time - I had it down and I really love the look of it.  Here&#x27;s some things I know about it.  Maybe it will help another customer make a decision about their purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on a long weekend so that I could get plenty of practice.  First of all, the instructions are more of a pamphlet.  But really, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any need of anything else.  So - I put in 6 drops of foundation as suggested and let her rip.  Well - I was horrified at the results!!!  It was all blotchy and it looked like I just dumped a bottle of foundation on my face.  I almost boxed it up right then and there to send back, but I really wanted this to work.  The second time - I used the primer.  8 drops does the job for me.  I let it dry, (do your eye makeup and concealer at this time) then put on the foundation.  Just a couple of tries and I found my perfect color.  8 drops of that seems to be a perfect amount.  3 drops of blush and I&#x27;m out the door.  What I really like about having all the extra colors is that when your skin color changes with the seasons you can tweak the color as you need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of things:&lt;br /&gt;You HAVE to use the primer.  You will not get the results you want without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottles of makeup, etc are not as big as they seem on the ad.  But it&#x27;s actually OK.  The makeup is thin to be able to go through the airbrush.  I have been using it a month and am only ½ way through just one of the foundation and the primer bottles.  You use it sparingly.  The directions say 6-8 drops.  8 is more like it.  You probably want more if you want to do more layers.  But do it as layers and not all at one time or it will be a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About actually using the airbrush - OK - here&#x27;s the deal - when I first tried it, I blasted it on where I need it most (under eyes).  That was a mistake!  Yikes!  You should have seen me!  Scary.  Anyway - Load up the airbrush, put it about 8 inches away from your face, then CLOSE YOUR EYES and let it go.  I figured this one out because if you don&#x27;t, before you know it you will have moved the airbrush very close to your face and then the makeup is all runny.  If you have your eyes closed, you won&#x27;t do that.  BTW - it doesn&#x27;t get in your eyes, hair etc.  I thought it would but it really doesn&#x27;t.  You end up with a really nice matte finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the blush - 3 drops.  Any more than that is too much.  When you apply, start with the airbrush up higher.  Usually when we put on powder blush, we start low and go high.  Start around the middle of the area and don&#x27;t go down as low as you would with powder blush otherwise it sprays too low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main thing about the airbrush is to keep it moving.  Moving it slower over trouble areas will not do the job.  (Think of the way you spray paint.  It&#x27;s exactly the same thing.  Too close or too slow and it gets gloppy and runs.)  Dab your concealer then use the airbrush.  When you first turn it on, it defaults to medium speed.  I&#x27;ve been using the low speed and only just changed to medium speed.  It seems the medium is better.  I don&#x27;t know if its because I got better at it or what.  I haven&#x27;t used the tanner yet.  I don&#x27;t use tanner so I can&#x27;t really give you any info if it&#x27;s good or not.  Maybe on another long weekend I&#x27;ll give it a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleanup is a snap.  They give you a large bottle of cleaner.  Once you&#x27;re done - fill up the cup with cleaner, spray a little through it, put your finger on the tip to let it back bubble and spray it again.  I use a Q-tip to clean the bowl and tip.  The end you unscrew and wipe off the needle.  Hint - be careful when you unscrew the needle holder.  It can come off and try to go down your drain.  Good thing I caught it in time!  Anyway - the cleaning process literally takes maybe 10 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I timed myself this morning from beginning to end.  From primer application and drying (eye makeup time - even though the primer dries in seconds) through foundation, blush and cleaning - just under 6 minutes, and I was moving slow for a Monday morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see where others have had trouble with their unit breaking.  I have had no trouble with mine at all.  I really hope it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give this airbrush a try.  A little patience and you will be hooked. I will still keep my other makeup for travel but now I really don&#x27;t want to use that other stuff anymore.  Maybe I don&#x27;t have to!  They send a cute little carrying case to go with the airbrush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - so I am ready to buy refills for the foundation and primer.  I went to their web site.  I wanted to get the 2oz primer and 2 ounces (4 bottles) of foundation.  The total was 88 bucks.  Expensive for makeup but OK.  I went to check out and they put on $34 for shipping!!!!  $122!!  Are they crazy???  (The checkout is through Amazon on their site)  And that&#x27;s without insurance or anything else.  No way.  I&#x27;m not buying it.  It&#x27;s not gold.  So I went to Amazon and they are only charging $4.95 here!  The primer has a shipping charge added but the makeup doesn&#x27;t.  Go figure.  BTW - if you click on 2 day shipping just to see what it is - the price jumps from $4.95 to almost $39!!  I just wanted to add this so people know this BEFORE they buy it.  I still give 5 stars for the unit, though.  It&#x27;s great!wl and tip.  The end you unscrew and wipe off the needle.  Hint - be careful when you unscrew the needle holder.

            <li> I am sooooo glad that I bought this product! It works great and came with all that was pictured. It is the best feeling knowing that I don&#x27;t have a dirty brush or sponge touching my face ever again. I use this on a daily basis now and I wouldn&#x27;t have it any other way!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 55 years old with combination skin.  I don&#x27;t use make up daily and I don&#x27;t use this air brush makeup every time I apply make up as it is expensive.  But for special occasions I recommend the base, blush and highlighter.  For day time I sometimes use the foundation base only.  It does not break my skin out and that&#x27;s a plus in itself since I have sensitive skin and typically break out with new products.  I had no issues with any breakouts.  I woukd recommend this kit and I have purchased extra bottles.  Walmart online carries the additional bottles and beats Amazon price by about a $1 per bottle.  The con is I&#x27;ve not found a place locally that sells the make up or any make up that could be used in the air brush.  Maybe one day as I woukd like to go into a store to see colors firsthand but this kit gives you a very good sampling.</li>
            <li> Turned on the airbrush machine today to make sure everything worked and let me tell you.... it is SO NOISY! I think my neighbors could hear me testing it out this morning. The make up however did stay all day without smudging. The only downfall is the compressor. I think I will he buying a different one.</li>
            <li> I have tried many foundation.  This will bring you the result for what you want sheer coverage to full coverage.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Would like to buy another one but they are too expensive. The first one was a gift, I would like to get one for myself.</li>
            <li> This has to be the greatest product!!! I love it. Next time I order the foundation I will go a darker shade because it is very light even the tan and beige. Just for you information!!!!</li>
            <li> Only received really small .2ml sized foundations (3) and (3) little creams. But the pic shows so much more than what&#x27;s included. Have to order more stuff now!!!! Not what I ordered!!</li>
            <li> Did not wrk properly the needle keeps getn stuck the machine is poorly made. I would not buy this product again</li>
            <li> I was so looking forward to getting this system and had hoped it would provide the type of coverage I have been seeking - boy was I disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The control on the wand worked the first time - the coverage of the makeup was horrible on my skin though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought maybe it was user error (me!) so tried it a second time and the valve that controls the flow of the makeup did not work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess those two strikes are reason enough to return this pricey system and go back to store brand makeup - really wish it had worked as it promised!!</li>
            <li> This product took a couple of tries for me to figure out the tricks but once I did I was very happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it takes more product than the recommended 6-8 drops to get the level of coverage I wanted.  Once I achieved the level of coverage desired the finish is flawless but not cakey. The product will not dry out your skin, will be there to stay and does not come off on clothes or your hands once dry and is also nearly undetectable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the angle I found to be most effective was the opposite of what was recommended.  Instead of holding the airbrush near my chin and pointing it up I preferred to apply it by holding it above my head and pointing it downward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I found that running the airbrush under warm water for a couple of seconds cleaned it fine without the recommended dis-assembly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish you all the best!</li>
            <li> Not happy with this product at all. At least for me. Sorry.</li>
            <li> Only used it a couple of times. And it stopped working and the couple of times it did work there was not much noticeable difference over all save your time and money.</li>
            <li> this product arrived on time  and was all that it was advertised as. very nicely packaged and with some added freebies. it works very well and is easy to use. the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was not due to any defect, I just felt that the whole thing would have benifited greatly by having  more instructions for use. it did contain a  small booklet, but I would have liked to have had more information or parhaps a dvd to go with it. The product itself is well worth the price and I would recommend it to anyone wanting to buy an airbrush makeup kit.</li>
            <li> I tried to return this item , but I had waited too long to return it.  I cannot get this thing to work like it is advertised.  I am still trying to make it work and I have had no success in doing so.  I just wasted money that I cannot  afford.</li>
            <li> not as happy with their liquid makeup...gets thick and clogs airbrush after 2 weeks .  I clean the system after each use but I need to thin out the makeup</li>
            <li> this is a great kit that is about the cost of luminess and works just at good and their makeup is a better quality</li>
            <li> Love this set- affordable and showed up quickly. The &amp;#34;coverage&amp;#34; of the makeup is SHEER. Very. If you want more coverage- use a different concealer and get a better Makeup for airbrush. Love the simplicity of machine and airbrush. Makeup? not so much. teeny teeny bottles come with the kit, I will not be re-ordering the makeup. Too small and too sheer for my needs as makeup artist.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a Christmas gift for my wife. She liked the product and the results, however after 6 months it stopped working. she probably used it about 10 to 12 times - that&#x27;s all. I would expect better for the money I paid. Based on the durability I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it....</li>
            <li> Broke after my third try of it. I tried it first and did not do it smoothly. Waited a few days and tried again. Same thing happened. On my third try, the little lever you press down, separated. I did attempt to fix it.&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, my father passed away, and I let time get in my way of calling their tech dept. Then my mother suffered a stroke. Life gets in the way.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it was a great and expensive disappointment.</li>
            <li> I saw that the product got mixed reviews but decided to try it anyway. It worked Great the first 5 times I used it but on try number six it didn&#x27;t dispense the makeup. I took it apart cleaned it and tightened everything as instructed, only then to have it spray All the makeup in one spot in my face in under two seconds. I wanted to love this but it does not work. Only get this if you like gambling and don&#x27;t mind losing. Lucky for me I have amazon prime so returning it was easy if you don&#x27;t have prime, it&#x27;s not worth the gamble.</li>
            <li> takes a while to get used to using it.  I still look like I have makeup on when I&#x27;ve used it.  The goal is to look natural.</li>
            <li> Love it. Arrived on time and it works great</li>
            <li> It is easy to learn and takes just a short time to do.  Since I have started using it, friends and strangers have told me what a smooth complexion and skin I have.  It looks good to me but complements let me know I&#x27;m right.  In my mid 60&#x27;s and never had such attention to how my face/skin  looked.  Now I know why actresses use it.  Can&#x27;t wait to use tanning makeup this summer.</li>
            <li> I purchased the system a few months ago used it maybe 10 times and its already broken.  The air brush gun never really worked like it should have.</li>
            <li> Bought this for myself and I love it. I will no longer put regular foundation on my face. It leaves my skin feeling light. The colors are wonderful and I mix and match to find my skin tone. The machine is sturdy and isn&#x27;t too loud. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> In love with it works great</li>
            <li> COULD NOT GET IT TO WORK</li>
            <li> Works good. I did have some questions about the airbrush and called the support line number they provided and they were so helpful and so nice awesome customer service. Plus the airbrush is really easy to use.</li>
            <li> Was not for me. Not good coverage and very orange. Felt very cheap. I get much better coverage with Temptu.</li>
            <li> not as easy to apply on face to complicated and did not cover up my aging lines and uses to much drops to fast</li>
            <li> Still have to blend into face because it lands on facial fuzz.</li>
            <li> The best bargain on a pro airbrush kit,  great quality foundation , I use this for my brides always</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the good reviews. I try to give the benefit of the doubt because not everyone has a good experience with everything. Well, this is one time I should have paid heed to the horrible reviews. I had this thing for a month and first the stylus stopped working then the machine. Literally one minute the machine is working, leave the room, come back to finish and the thing doesn&#x27;t work right. I have to hold the on/off button and even then it is not even bothering with. And the sad thing is that its not even worth the trouble to send it back. So be very careful when thinking of buying this. Remember, I gave them the benefit of the doubt!</li>
            <li> Not satisfied at all.... First use was great! I followed all of the instructions (including cleaning) that came with...it continuously would get clogged, the needle and trigger would stick and not function properly. I even tried additional instructions for troubleshooting these problems. To much maintenance...</li>
            <li> tried to use it without much success</li>
            <li> I love this machine it is wonderful, however my dissatisfaction is with the makeup itself. It looks great, but makes my face breaks out horribly! I don&#x27;t think they have any other choices...has anyone else has this issue? If so, what did you do?</li>
            <li> I am a make up artist and I wanted to buy an airbrush system that is portable and easy to use as oppose to carrying I huge bag filled with the usual airbrush professional kits (most compressors are just too big).&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on my and my god its the most amazing airbrush I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;m headed about dinair and luminess air and to be honest they&#x27;re all the same to me. but this one, you get alot for the price. I just absolutely love it and will buy another even!!!</li>
            <li> Plugged up right away when my wife tried to use it. She returned it. She ahd tried another one also and same problem.</li>
            <li> I returned this product, because I did not like it. .Waiting for a full refund. This product was not easy to use and the makeup was not what I needed.&#x60;</li>
            <li> Very good i love it.......:)</li>
            <li> If you are gong airbrush you must go Bellaccio. My only con is I am lazy and hate cleaning everyday!</li>
            <li> I love this compressor.  Not to loud, works great for makeup.  I also have the tanning pen for it.  Makeup shades in medium are a little light for me but I wil mix with the next level up for summer.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this airbrush set.  It would be my first airbrush purchase and I thought that for what you got, it was a great value and worth the try.  I am an avid researcher and I could hardly find any type of review of this set on the internet, good or bad.  That concerned me but I figured going through Amazon was at least a good idea.  The set itself is very nice.  The compressor is sleek and silver and the airbrush pen is substantial in weight and not cheap looking or feeling at all.  The set comes with so many colors of foundations and blushes which make is such a good value!  I watched airbrush videos on youtube and read blogs so I kinda knew how I should use it.  I chose the lightest shades from this medium set.  I could tell immediately that they were going to be too dark for my skin.  The lightest shades also made my face orange.  I can deal with the fact that I need a lighter shade but the quality of the foundation was not acceptable for me.  After airbrushing my face, I could see every pore on my cheeks and nose!  Yikes, not good.  So now I had an orange face with very enlarged looking pores.  A couple of spots on my face looked cakey probably due to over applying the foundation in those areas but in general my face did not look airbrushed at all.  I manage a team at a corporate office so I could not go into work looking like I was.  I had to wash my face again and start from scratch with my normal makeup.  Once I got my MAC Studio Fix liquid back on my face I had a huge sigh of relief.  My face looked so much better!  I actually looked more airbrushed with my Studio Fix then with the airbrush makeup.  And my pores looked much much smaller...and no hassle of having to clean out the various parts of an airbrush system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m giving this set 2 stars because the machine seems nice.  BUT, if the makeup is no good then the quality of the machine isn&#x27;t going to help any.  At this point, I am unsure if I am going to try another brand of airbrush makeup or if I&#x27;m going to stick with my normal liquid foundation.  At least with other airbrush systems, you may not have such an intense type of cleaning process as with this one.  I am a mommy of 2 little ones and I work full time so having to clean out a tool every morning is not my ideal but I thought the look I would get would be worth it.  I hope this review helps others out there who are contemplating this set.  Maybe you will have better luck and smaller pores!brush makeup or if I&#x27;m going to stick with my normal liquid foundation.

            <li> Very easy to apply,,,,,feels nice  and stays on till you take it off.  Now all I need is eye shadow and i will be set!</li>
            <li> When I first started using this system, I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d use it for the long term.  The more I used it, I noticed several things about it (and me):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  1. I was using the wrong color all along with other foundations. (The lighter the color, the more natural I look.)&lt;br /&gt;  2. I didn&#x27;t need as many drops of liquid makeup as I originally thought to get the coverage I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;  3. The amount of makeup I used is dependent on mastering the correct level of spray.  (for me, it&#x27;s the lowest speed and the lightest touch on the spray nozzle.) The recommended 6-8 drops really is enough!&lt;br /&gt;  4. The more I used this makeup, the clearer my skin became. My face wasn&#x27;t as oily, I had no acne breakouts, my pores became smaller, and my skin smoother.  (Which I think led to my ability to use less of the makeup, because I didn&#x27;t have as many blemishes to cover.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now after using this product for about a month now, I&#x27;m not sure I will ever go back to using regular foundation makeup again. When I started using this airbrushing method, it took me about 20 min or more.  Now it doesn&#x27;t even take me 5 minutes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to get a missing part since I purchased it, but have not been able to reach anyone.</li>
            <li> I l brushike the whole Air system but I did receive the wrong color and the company gave me a hard way to go when I try to change the color and they made me pay for my return fee in their return fee . I felt like they could have covered  sending it back although  Amazon offered to cover it</li>
            <li> Love this. Flawless makeup and works great.</li>
            <li> Got it, opened it after a week or two, then worked 2 times.  Then at the third time, the thing started putting out little to no make up! And I am very meticulous about cleaning too so I followed the instructions precisely...I never would have thought I &#x27;d have gotten a bad one...What in the world?!?!  This sucks big time...Today is Sunday so I will be calling Monday....It had better still be under manufacturers warranty and I hope I don&#x27;t have to pay for anything!  Ugh! So annoyed.  I thought I got the more expensive brand because it would be better quality...I was soooooo WRONG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I gave this one two more stars....So I called Bellocio (Monday) about it and the girl I was speaking with was trying to be helpful but then I guess I just had a bad airbrush tool so she said she&#x27;ll just ship me a new one....The new one came the next day! hehehe.  And wow! It is powerful!  It definitely was A WHOLE Lot better than the original one I purchased with the kit.  I have to put it on low because it was so strong.  But I do hope it stays like this forever!! Because now I am happy with it.  The only thing is that the make up is dark...I&#x27;m not so light...And I got the medium complexion, but the lightest one makes me look so tanned.  I have to get the FAIR shade one now.  But all in all, the makeup is nice &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> The Belloccio Airbrush System is easy to use and is the epitome of professional cosmetics that really work. It really does what they claim!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Belloccio&#x27;s Professional Airbrush make up goes on smooth and the speed controls work unlike some of the other brands.</li>
            <li> I bought his because my daughter has a set and when she applied it for me, it looked good, however I&#x27;m still working at this and hope to get an even finish. Be prepared to practice.</li>
            <li> The info commercial said use 4-5 drops of makeup for coverage.  That&#x27;s a load of crap.  More like 20-25 drops.  Doesn&#x27;t cover at all.  And you can feel the make up on.  Not alone that when you do put it on, it gets in your eyes and burns like I placed bleach in the machine.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Ugh!!!</li>
            <li> First, the compressor works great. It takes a little getting used to like all of them, so it&#x27;s best to get a few practice sprays on your arm before going to your face. But the spray, when done correctly, is even and accurate. So for the price, it&#x27;s worth it to get the whole package. The makeup itself leaves a little more wanting. It looks good and is still above average on the entire makeup spectrum, but for airbrush it doesn&#x27;t really give the super flawless coverage of other products (I personally like Belletto). Also, it&#x27;s somewhat sticky so errors are really difficult to fix, especially once you&#x27;re in the blush stage. The highlighter was very pretty though. Lastly, due to the stickiness factor of the makeup, the well was not easy to clean, even with the cleaner that comes with it. I ended up using a qtip between fillings because there was always residue. Overall,  I recommend buying the system for the compressor but going with another water based product.</li>
            <li> I like it especially for a special occasion and during the summer</li>
            <li> Broke after 3 months,  was very careful with cleaning and use...disappointed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a lengthy review on a product I&#x27;ve purchased through Amazon, but this product has inspired me to do just that.  I deliberated over this product for about a year.  At $120ish it was no small purchase, but more of an investment I believe.  In my research I also considered another airbrush makeup system that started with an \\&quot;L,\\&quot; but found more negative reviews and problems with that system than with the Belloccio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the product arrived quickly, and was exactly as promised.  Everything was new and in excellent condition.  All the items shown in the picture were included.  I ordered the medium color kit, and am happy with the colors.  It also came with primer, blush colors and some shimmer/tan bottles.  So...lots of choices to match for a perfect fit.  But, there is a learning curve!  Do not plan to use it for the first time right before a big day or event.  It took me about three tries/days to really get the hang of it.  It is easy, but figuring out what colors to use, how many drops to use, and how many times to go over one area with the airbrush just takes a little trial and error.  By day three I was very comfortable with the color and application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does a very good job of evening my skin tone and covering old acne scars and age spots.  I am a 45 year old mom of boys, so I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time in the sun at sporting events.  One thing I would note -- it does not conceal an active breakout very well.  I like how it feels on my skin...very light.  I was using mineral makeup before this, and I liked that coverage and weight, but it just didn&#x27;t hold up well for a long day.  This makeup does hold up well for a long busy day.  I&#x27;ve been using the system for two weeks, and my skin seems a little healthier/fresh than with the minerals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am happy with this purchase and would do it again.</li>
            <li> Great little product. Beautifully packaged really nice as a gift. Beautiful presentation all around. Seems to be good quality, but the carrying case could be a little bit more durable. I like the 3 settings</li>
            <li> the quality on the make up and tools are excellent, I bought this kit for use it on my wedding on me and 2 more cousins, they love it too and I gave it to them after the wedding they were so happy with this gift. I don&#x27;t have a busy social life like my cousins and is why I decided to giving to them, they are going to use it more than me.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product, it arrived on time and  properly packed, it&#x27;s easy to use and clean, very satisfied with this purchase, thank you amazon!!</li>
            <li> i like my airbrush so far because its better to use for my face only problem i have is that i should have gotten the fair shade kit and not the medium the medium is a bit to dark for me makes me look orange and like my friend said he called me an ompa lompa i was not that orange but i gave the idea of it so now i have to buy the fair shades because the ones i have are not for my skin tone all in all though i really like my airbrush i just wish they had sent me a video with some tips on how to use it i think i just need to find the right color and get more practice on how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a while later after i bought the airbrush system,&lt;br /&gt;i have had my airbrush since i think december i am  very disappointed because i paid so much money for it and by january 15 which is on my birthday the airbrush broke,  if i could i would return it for a refund but i cant so i have to stay with the broken airbrush system that i cant even use anymore couse it broke, it is only taking space in a corner of my closet because what can i do with a broken airbrush  i only got to use it for about 2 or 3 weeks before it broke and i only used it like one or 2 times a week so i am very disappointed with this purchase, i no longer recomend that anyone pay for this product it was a good working airbrush for the first couple times i used it</li>
            <li> Anything of this price, I research like crazy and this was no different. I&#x27;ll spare you the reading and try and keep it to facts&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;ve had this product about two weeks and used it around 7-10 times.&lt;br /&gt;- The airbrush equipment (machine and parts etc.) are good quality and work really well. The case is nice and I think comparatively, they give you a fair amount of product to use right off the bat.&lt;br /&gt;- It was only $130 when I ordered it just prior to the New Year.  I might not have bought it at $170, because there are less expensive brands.  But I do still think this is a good value at $170, I just might not have taken the chance to find that out though because $170 would have scared me off. So if you have the money, I still think this product is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;- I have olive skin (mixed asian/caucasian) and it gets oily about three hours after I use any makeup, no matter what kind. I was using Bare Minerals for a few years but it doesn&#x27;t give me the coverage I need when I have some blemishes or during the winter when my skin tone is very uneven.&lt;br /&gt;- The makeup: the colors were good. I had ordered the Medium kit, but after playing with those colors, I ordered a bottle of the Blanc colored foundation and with a little more playing, found a perfect color for me. The makeup seems so thin at first but that&#x27;s what makes it feel light.  It lasts, even after 10 hours I still feel my skin looks good.  Though I may touch up once or twice with a little Mineral Veil to blot up the oil, because even with this makeup my face get oily,  It&#x27;s nature, not much you can do about that.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s easy to use, but yes there are steps.  It&#x27;s an airbrush, there are parts to rinse out when you are done so if you can&#x27;t do your makeup by a sink, get a paper cup of water or something so you can easily rinse it out when you are done or else it will get mucked up and not work right. To some, this may seem a hassle. But to me, I know that germs and bacteria that can cause acne live in makeup brushes and in the makeup when it&#x27;s frequenlty touched by those brushes, so this is a much cleaner way of applying makeup.  After two weeks, my skin overall actually looks better than it has in a while and I have less blemishes..so I&#x27;m throwing out my old kabuki brush and some of the others.&lt;br /&gt;- I think overall using the airbrush has added about 2-4 mins to my makeup application time, from before when I was using Bare Minerals. It&#x27;s fun to use, cuz I like being a girl and playing with makeup.  But I also like looking nice, and I do think this makeup is better coverage without looking caked on or heavy. Just go easy with the application, go light and let it dry a moment before adding more if you feel the need to.  If you use the blush, apply it first, rinse, then use the foundation; you get a more natural look that way.&lt;br /&gt;- This is makeup; it&#x27;s not going to suit everyone.  But as far as quality and value for the money, I think this product is worth it and I&#x27;m glad I have it.in makeup brushes and in the makeup when it&#x27;s frequenlty touched by those brushes, so this is a much cleaner way of applying makeup.

            <li> I love this airbrush kit! Its better than having big hug one and it does the job just as good and even a little better!! Vary worth the money</li>
            <li> Compressor broke after less than one month.  Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I couldn&#x27;t give it no stars and still be able to write a review. The company advertises coverage...THAT WOULD BE FALSE!! My husband bought this for me for Christmas. I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out, glad I didn&#x27;t wait until Christmas day to do so... The entire system, and makeup was an utter disappointment. All the hype is exactly that...hype!!! When I began using it, for the FIRST TIME I might add...It stopped spraying out the foundation. So disappointing!!! My Husband fixed it, and once I tried it again I realized it had a mind of it&#x27;s own (not literally....I am just saying.) It sprayed when it wanted too, and then on top of that I noticed that when it would spray the makeup was doing absolutely nothing to cover light freckles on my face or even the smallest blemishes. Needless to say I received it today and it will be on it&#x27;s way back tomorrow as soon as I can get to the UPS store. If you want to take your chances, go ahead... But I wouldn&#x27;t want anyone to have such dissatisfaction that I have towards this product.</li>
            <li> I love this system. It was easy to learn to use and the make up goes on flawless.  I love all the make up it comes with and I am happy that it also had a wide selection of make up that you can order. The money is worth it on this system. This was a great buy for me.</li>
            <li> cleaning.  What a joke. It does such a great job until you actually have to clean the entire unit.  Pieces fall out and are not possible to get back in.&lt;br /&gt;NEER buy this product</li>
            <li> I originally bought a different well know brand Airbrush System that starts with an &amp;#34;L&amp;#34;. I only had to use it once before I sent it back. The foundations were orange and the machine was cheap. I did some research and decided to give this system a try. Right out of the box I knew Belloccio was a much better quality system. My skin tone is fair but going into the summer months I decided to purchase the medium shade foundations; great choice. I have had a hard time deciding which shade works the best with my skin tone because they all work so well without a hint of orange. The system is easy to use and clean-up is a breeze, easy enough for daily use. This is my first Airbrush System, if you don&#x27;t count the one I had for a day. My favorite and completely unexpected benefit of this product is that after a few or more hours of wear, my face doesn&#x27;t become shinny. My face stays flawless all day; I don&#x27;t have to apply a touch-up powder. It does not leave my skin feeling dry either. I tend to have sensitive skin and haven&#x27;t experienced a problem with breakouts. In addition to the foundations, you also receive some of their Opulence Tanning Solution. This product completely activates between 2 to 4 hours. I tend to freckle so I keep my face and hands out of the sun. The tanning solution allows me to tan my hands and face and I don&#x27;t have to worry about freckling, hence having a tan all over. My only regret is that I thought about making this purchase for several years before I did; I wish I would have purchased it sooner.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;m on my 3rd machine. I have religiously cleaned each unit after every use with hot water, cleaning solution and Q-tips but after only a couple of months of use, each of the units have experienced the same malfunctions. Either they do not spray or when they do, they sprays out in drops, not a fine mist. For the price, I am wondering if an airbrush system intended for models would work the same or better at about half the cost. Any thoughts?</li>
            <li> Very happy with the unit, it works really well, easy to clean, My only complaint is the plastic handle broke the first day ( it screws in) and it got stripped, it would happen to anyone as it&#x27;s not made well at all. I don&#x27;t know why on such a nice little gun that they use a cheap plastic handle.&lt;br /&gt;I also do not like the foundation very much, I live in Florida and the moment that you start sweating the foundation starts to run, I also found that the coverage is terrible on age spots, I am 50 and have some age spots from sun damage. I was hoping that this would cover the spots but no way. I gather I am going to have to order a different makeup that they offer that is not in the kit but is much stronger. I am hoping that this is going to solve my problem. Now if only they would sell something that does not run when you sweat.&lt;br /&gt;So all in all the compressor and the gun work great, it is very easy to use and it&#x27;s a lot of fun. The down side is unless you are young with perfect skin you are not going to get great coverage. Also do NOT use this if you are going to be sweating as it runs really badly and you will have a mess of a face.</li>
            <li> I think you have to have a pro makeup artist use this on you to get any kind of results at all. It didn&#x27;t work very well for me.</li>
            <li> This was my first time ever buying and using airbrush makeup.  The very first time applying turned out good. I was surprised that it was easy. The second time even better. I should have bought this sooner it rocks! The makeup is weightless and natural looking and doesn&#x27;t show any of my huge blemishes.  Every woman needs one.</li>
            <li> Yeah, be careful with this. My airbrush didn&#x27;t work, the needle was bent in my unit when I received it. I called the phone number given with the product packaging and was told I didn&#x27;t know what I was doing, then I was told that someone would call me back--never happened. I eventually spoke with someone who worked with airbrushes and got a set of replacement needles and the unit works sporadically; sometime I get a nice spray out of it, sometime I get nothing. I read all the instructions before attempting use and re-read as I tried the unit out, so I truly do believe I got a defective / possibly returned unit...When it is in working mode, the applied makeup looks Marvelous; there are enough colors to find a match and the makeup looks like velvet. Again, it is the UNIT that I have problems with&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be aware that if anything is wrong with your unit - YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN&lt;br /&gt;I figured if I was treated as if I were a Moron when asking a simple question about a possible defect and a possible, simple request for a low cost replacement needle - then I would not bother with a request for return. I opted to keep the unit and I only use it for very special occasions - allowing for LOTS of time, Just In Case it chooses to fail. So, all in all, this is an okay item and it serves its purpose. Good Luck to you</li>
            <li> Way to light. Medium is not a true medium</li>
            <li> I ordered this set as a back up to my other compressor and to try a different water based foundation. I used it TWICE and the compressor died. Needless to say, I won&#x27;t be ordering this brand ever again.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical a out being able Tom aster the airbrushing. It was way easier than expected and awesome results. Colors matched with no issues. I vary the amount neede depending on the coverage. No chalkiness, streaks or such. Great buy. I just wish the makeup was a bit more affordable.</li>
            <li> The first order, the airbrush was defective. Second one arived, and it to was.  So i bought a third and the product clogged.So now i know why the cost was so low verses other brands. I now know to spend the extra money on the top line. Lesson learned. So my luminous system is on its way.</li>
            <li> I just got my airbrush machine yesterday.  It came very quickly.  I used it today and at first I thought it wasn&#x27;t working, but then realized the tube was twisted and not enough air was coming through.  Once I got it going it was so easy.  Took me 15min to apply the foundation, blush and clean the machine.  I can&#x27;t wait to use it tomorrow.  I have oily skin and acne scars from teenage years so finding the right make up is not easy.  This gives me great coverage without looking caked on.  It stays on all day without looking oily.</li>
            <li> My fianc&amp;eacute; loves this thing, it works great and Is easy to take apart.</li>
            <li> This was a SUPER buy! I had been wanting a Luminess machine for some time, however the price always stopped me. This was the perfect solution. My friend purchased the big named one and mine is by far a much better quality machine. Hers ended up breaking and she ended up buying this one too! I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the makeup line, but u can use the big name makeup in this machine....that&#x27;s what I do. I would recommend this to anyone. GREAT BUY!</li>
            <li> I have had this system for about a month and I love it. The makeup looks great and stays on well. I wear surgical masks at work and the makeup never comes off on the masks. When I received the product one of the pieces was bent, I called the company and they fixed the airbrush in a timely manner and w/out hassle.  I would definitely recommend this system to anyone.  Its also quick and easy to put on and clean the machine after.</li>
            <li> I have done airbrush makeup for years for pageants, tanning, cheerleaders and special effects for Halloween events and while the makeup itself is great, the compressor is by far the worst I have ever used. It barely has enough pressure on high to push makeup. I would not recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> Worked amazing!! less is more though don&#x27;t apply it multiple times! Makes skin look smooth and flawless!! Highly recommend :)</li>
            <li> I love this makeup..it makes you look flawless. You won&#x27;t be disappointed can&#x27;t wait to get more colors..The eyes shadows look like they could be just what I need to finish my  look.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was available on Prime and I needed a replacement airbrush immediately while away from home. Usually I use Dinair. The Belloccio makeup is lower quality and the Belloccio airbrush has less control.</li>
            <li> I really liked this system when i first started using it. But i was very disappointed when just the third time i used it the compressor just stopped working! Such a disappointment. The first 2 times i had used it there was this weird smell coming from it, i though it might have been normal. Also i feel as if the makeup had been used by someone else before i had purchased it some of the blushes and foundations had dried makeup around the outside and on the screw part. I think they just gave me someone else&#x27;s that the had returned! Gross! If im paying for something i and im sure other people want it BRAND NEW not used!!!</li>
            <li> Did not work, returned it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup that much but after using this machine, I will its easy to use and the finishing outcome is amazing.  Its built well and easy to understand the directions.  I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing makeup, and it really does last, no need for concealers either.</li>
            <li> I love the look and feel of airbrushing and purchased this system despite the mixed reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, despite following the needle-cleaning instructions and using the cleaner, the inconsistency of the stream (sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn&#x27;t - and often when it does work the stream isn&#x27;t consistent enough for smooth application) makes it time consuming and less than the professional look I want and deserve at any price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m returning it and will see what the real pro&#x27;s use...</li>
            <li> I ordered this and it was supposed to be open box like new! When it arrived the whole package was open and USED it was disgusting! The pen had makeup in it, it was missing pieces the airbrush compressed had finger prints all over it! I was so very disappointed. Amazon did help me with the return and the customer service was very nice an efficient. I&#x27;m upset I have to wait for them to get there used nasty product back before I can receive my refund then reorder the package! Very disappointed and warehouse deals INC you should be ashamed to try and sell that box like that!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this airbrush. You have to wash after every use and I love the dry makeup. It could break down and I would order a new one. So fast and skin looks clearer and silky with no oil. I will always have one.</li>
            <li> My wife is delighted with this Christmas gift. Clearly exceeded her expectations.</li>
            <li> not only did the makeup itself not work like it was supposed , but the air compressor stopped working , only after 4 uses.  i did everything the way the instructions said, and cleaned it every time,(which was not a speedy process) and my cheap makeup from cvs worked better.</li>
            <li> The entire system was great but the makeup was weak had to buy better quality makeup. Other than that I loved the system it really is light on your skin</li>
            <li> I received this kit last night, April 1st, and plugged everything up just to see if everything worked properly. The compressor will light up, but DOES NOT WORK. I spent $120 on my kit, so I expected things to be in perfect working condition. I tried to email the return&#x27;s belloccio email and the technical support email. Neither of them worked. It says full year warranty, but how can I contact them to get a replacement compressor? I spent another $50 on a replacement compressor and won&#x27;t be able to try this out until Monday night. I&#x27;ve invested over $180 into this kit (shipping costs included), not worth the stress, hassle, or money. The bottles that come with are very tiny. I should have gone with one of the other companies.</li>
            <li> The Machine is great! I bought this just about two weeks ago. The reason why I give this 4 Stars is because I do no like the makeup, I mixed it Every which way possible but it was not for me,  (but the primer is fabulous!!!! ) was going to send the machine back. But before I did,  I ended up ordering M.A.C HD Airbrush makeup  (Just call or go to a Mac Pro Store if you&#x27;re not a member) the  makeup I know was my perfect color and  WALA... I am in love with Airbrushing. You could buy the compressor and the airbrush gun and order M.A.C. HD Airbrush makeup, but it will only save you a couple of dollars. But for anyone who does not like the way Airbrush looks, it may just be your makeup... try another. I have been wearing Mac Makeup and know my colors spot on with it. One thing you must know. The M.A.C Makeup is silicone based, the Belloccio makeup is Waterbased. The Belloccio Primer is Water and Silicone Based - just an FYI it works great with the machine.</li>
            <li> I got this for my birthday, not a surprise, and couldn&#x27;t be happier. It is quite easy to use. It is a quality product and the makeup covers well and looks great. I was having issues with adult acne and hoped this would be less oily than typical foundations, and it is. I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use the tanner since I live in AZ and really don&#x27;t have a need for it. The machine is easy to clean and the entire process takes me about the same time as other foundations. I would recommend this to friends and family.</li>
            <li> I was really excited when I recieved this.  However, what a gross, wet mess it left on my face!  The directions say to use 6-8 drops.... I was only able to spray half of my face with that amount.  But the makeup was wet on my face and was blotchy.  Sorry, but it&#x27;s going back.</li>
            <li> Never ordered another airbrush makeup set, so I can&#x27;t really make a contribution with comparisons. I can say it&#x27;s pretty, and does airbrush the makeup evenly on my face. It does take some time to get used to. It took me forever to apply makeup the first time I tried it because I was so scared it wasn&#x27;t going to apply evenly so I took my time and made sure I kept the air gun at an appropriate distance and sprayed in continuous circular motions. The bronzer/brushes are can apply too dark, if you don&#x27;t change the pressure! Great product. I liked it.</li>
            <li> I really like this make up and the machine to put it on with. Refills are a little pricey. I am hoping to get a larger size refill.</li>
            <li> too expensive.  I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li> i recieved my kit was very sceptical about it, but will have to say it is vey nice  covers good like it said easy to use  ad feels so good light  you really don&#x27;t feel like there is anything on your skin  I would recromend this product</li>
            <li> I love it, it works well! But the foundation doesn&#x27;t last very long, and it rubs off way to easily.  And you better not get caught in the rain!</li>
            <li> This product was definitely a great buy, I&#x27;ve researched all the other brands out there and bought this because I was ready to try an airbrush makeup. This was the only product in amazon that has a 30day warranty so I went for it. I&#x27;m so happy to have made the plunge!  It was easy to assemble, easy to use and easy to clean. This is the only airbrush makeup that I&#x27;ve tried and so I can only speak of this product. It has everything that you need and didn&#x27;t really take very long to put on. I am so happy with the outcome. I went to an evening wedding in San Diego, CA and put on my makeup at 8am. My makeup didn&#x27;t budge even after the heat and dancing the night away. I think it&#x27;s worth the money I paid for.</li>
            <li> I already own this. Purchased as gift for a friend. YOU NEED THIS PRODUCT!!! Very easy to use and so much better for your skin.</li>
            <li> Does work with my skin, I look like a clown when I use this.</li>
            <li> I was very please when I received the air system.  A few days later when I was cleaning the system the trigger fell off and I actually was going to send it back.  I then got on the internet and found how the air brush was put together and could fix it.  From then on I was totally please with the system and the makeup.  The makeup is so light but I have to use more than what they said to use.  This is because of my age and the condition of my skin, but other than that I love it.  I trying different shades and I really like the blush. I would highly recommend this system.  The only thing I think  the company should add to their system is instructions on how the system is put together and how it works internally.  I found on the internet that you can totally take the system apart to clean and put it back together in working condition.  LOVE the system.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t get it to work right.  Refunded $$.  The ad makes it look so simple.</li>
            <li> I ordered this seriously a few days ago.  Very impressed.  I tried it out today for the first time.  I wasn&#x27;t sure how to use it, and I was too lazy to pop in the DVD that comes with it. So I just looked on you tube and found belloccio&#x27;s channel and I watched it a couple times and I felt confident enough to use it. In the video it said to use 3 or 4 drops of foundation.  It&#x27;s so light I ended up going over it 3 times. It&#x27;s so light I wasn&#x27;t sure it was even on. But it was. I love the  highlighter. I wish it came with more product, but I&#x27;m happy with it. I&#x27;ll write more later after I&#x27;ve used it for a while.  All in all,  not bad for my very first air brush machine.</li>
            <li> perfect for even foundation</li>
            <li> Just got it, waited until I fed hubby then slipped away to try this system out. It was so simple to put together.Not much assembly really. I watched a video the company has in the internet the night before. I experimented with one side of my face with one color, then the other side. What a surprise. It looked great. Something in the primer makes my skin feel firm. I was using mineral makeup and it no longer covers the way it use to. This really I&#x27;d worth it. I did some searching foe reviews and this brand has more good reviews than the one on the infomercial .</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it. to much trouble to use! makeup didn&#x27;t stay on well enough for me.</li>
