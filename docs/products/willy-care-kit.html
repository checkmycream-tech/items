            <li>set of grooming tools is perfect when you need to rein in that errant foreskin.</li>
            <li>Every Sunday before I go into church, I like to make my dandy diddle look perfect for the Lord Jesus Christ.</li>
            <li>I thought the medallion would look great on him</li>
            <li>The sense of empowerment that it gives you is amazing!</li>
            <li>I bought this as a joke gift for my husband and he loved it though he said he&#x27;s never wearing the bracelet.</li>
            <li>Makes a good gift.</li>
            <li>Good quality.  </li>
            <li>I thought I was getting a grooming kit for my beloved coyote friend, Wile.  </li>
            <li>And an adjustable size would be nice for the evening wear.</li>
            <li>The bracelet is a nice touch.</li>
            <li>After many hours of experimentation and documentation, I have concluded that the trimming shears are for keeping the landing pad tidy and not for use on the helmet.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>, why would she think she&#x27;d be able to find it NOW?</li>
            <li>(for the most part)</li>
            <li>I fancy myself as a man who has the world by the short and curlies and I want to look my best in pubic.</li>
            <li>and I was really pleased at how easy it was to use.</li>
            <li>Also, the mirror fogs up way too easily.</li>

            <li>It feels so good to finally outsmart her.    </li>
            <li>I wore it and pretended my wife&#x27;s super foxy OBGYN snipped my bit.    </li>
            <li>but now I can proudly show off me trim Willy and not feel like a wanker when I&#x27;m pulling out me meat and two veggies for a little bit of how&#x27;s yer father.</li>

            <li>Being married to a were-wolf has its problems.</li>
            <li>With all of the hair shaved off, we were able to fashion a toupee for my cousin Vivian&#x27;s fourth husband.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend a warning about removal of the medallion before engaging in adult activities.</li>
            <li>, I decided to allow the bracelet (and my business) free range to show off the dynamic facets and diamond(ette) studded glory that made me feel like a man of wealth and taste.</li>
            <li>Shipping wasn&#x27;t as fast as he was used to, either, but it was there in the two days promised and they wouldn&#x27;t drop it at his home, just at his work place.  </li>

            <li>Thanks to Amazon</li>
            <li>My suggestion to the manufacturer of this kit is to produce a special set for Irish and Jewish men that comes equipped with a magnifying glass or a pair of strong reading glasses.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super quick and it&#x27;s everything I expected.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t begin tell you how amazing this little kit is and how it&#x27;s changed my life!</li>
            <li>one caveat I have for this affordable and simply chic set is that there should be some sort of a warning about the special \\&quot;evening wear\\&quot; bracelet.</li>

            <li>Everytime I got excited it was like dry humping a bear trap.</li>

            <li>but it&#x27;s just a little bitty thing, might fit a road runner</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please: Ladies deserve this much attention toward our female parts as the men do toward theirs!</li>
            <li>This is quite the gift for someone if you want a little laugh.</li>
            <li>It hard sometimes to remember to STOP grooming with those soft bristles ... like little loving tongues... &lt;</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s such a busy guy and never spends anything on himself, always work, work, work for that coyote.  </li>
            <li>The mirror is no where near big enough.</li>
            <li>I only wish it came with some sutures as well, but hey, little bits of TP work for a guy&#x27;s beard, and this isn&#x27;t much different, right?</li>
            <li>While Bruce Banners shirts may tear away easily when he &amp;#34;Hulks&amp;#34; out, alas, this bracelet does not.</li>

            <li> After the \\&quot;head\\&quot; nurse took the razor and cut down my \\&quot;rain-forest\\&quot;, the doctor stitched me up and told me not to have \\&quot;relations\\&quot; with my wife for at least a week.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I spent the night in the local constabulary, where Pedro and Shaquille were not nearly as impressed with my manhood&#x27;s come-hither attitude.</li>

            <li> Arrived promptly and is as advertised.</li>
            <li> What an abysmally stupid Idea. Grow up.</li>
            <li> As a wife of a man who has the hair of a Yeti, I was so excited to buy this. Being married to a were-wolf has its problems. Although he gets hit on at our Walmart all the time (I guess the women of Wally-world like hairy guys), I get quite angry at the looks I get when people think I am into intraspecies mating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Willy Care Kit for this. With all of the hair shaved off, we were able to fashion a toupee for my cousin Vivian&#x27;s fourth husband. Saved a bunch of money for Viv.</li>
            <li> False advertising. Gave this to Willy for Christmas last year. He still doesn&#x27;t care about me.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend a warning about removal of the medallion before engaging in adult activities. It could save others from a trip to the ER.</li>
            <li> After many hours of experimentation and documentation, I have concluded that the trimming shears are for keeping the landing pad tidy and not for use on the helmet.  Remember to remove the bracelet before the evenings activities get heated.  While Bruce Banners shirts may tear away easily when he &amp;#34;Hulks&amp;#34; out, alas, this bracelet does not. 1 breakaway link was have saved me an embarrassing trip to the ER. Perhaps in Willy Care Kit 2.0 this will be a feature.</li>
            <li> Only for the sorry few who don&#x27;t already have their own personal Knob Butler.</li>
            <li> I am quite upset. Where is your Wilma Grooming Kit? Must I contact the ACLU?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please: Ladies deserve this much attention toward our female parts as the men do toward theirs!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a joke gift for my husband and he loved it though he said he&#x27;s never wearing the bracelet. :) Shipping was super quick and it&#x27;s everything I expected.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this for prom. I thought it came with a straightening iron, so I ended up with fluffy pubes. It looked like I had Jonah hill in a leg lock. Also, the mirror fogs up way too easily. And an adjustable size would be nice for the evening wear. Everytime I got excited it was like dry humping a bear trap. Makes a good gift.</li>
            <li> Snip, snip, drip, drip. I cut off the tip :(</li>
            <li> What was my wife thinking when she gave me this Willy Care Kit for Hanukkah? So what if she couldn&#x27;t find my little snake because the grass was too high? She couldn&#x27;t find it on our wedding night, why would she think she&#x27;d be able to find it NOW? She knew all about Jewish men, but I guess it was a step up from all the Irish guys she dated before me! Anyway... I took advantage of the this present this morning, and started \\&quot;landscaping\\&quot; and wouldn&#x27;t you know it - I stabbed my \\&quot;beans\\&quot; with the scissors! Blood was gushing out all over the bathroom floor and my wife had to rush me to the emergency room! Imagine my humiliation when all the nurses surrounded me and I had to show them my do-dads? They all had a bit of a snicker looking for the entry point in my \\&quot;man forest\\&quot; that had no \\&quot;redwood\\&quot; to be found! They all had a good laugh when the emergency room doctor examined me and asked if this was my first period? After the \\&quot;head\\&quot; nurse took the razor and cut down my \\&quot;rain-forest\\&quot;, the doctor stitched me up and told me not to have \\&quot;relations\\&quot; with my wife for at least a week. I asked the doctor if he was kidding me? I guess he didn&#x27;t realize that my wife is Jewish also and that we stopped having \\&quot;relations\\&quot; the day she said, \\&quot;I do!\\&quot;  I am happy to report that completely healed now, except for my ego. My suggestion to the manufacturer of this kit is to produce a special set for Irish and Jewish men that comes equipped with a magnifying glass or a pair of strong reading glasses. Wait... forget the magnifying glass! I can just see some poor guy trimming himself in his backyard on a sunny day and starting a \\&quot;brush\\&quot; fire in his pubic area! Imagine going to the emergency room explaining THAT injury?</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t begin tell you how amazing this little kit is and how it&#x27;s changed my life! Now, with just five minutes before those hectic business meetings, I can walk in and know that MY business is the tidiest and coolest-looking at that table. The sense of empowerment that it gives you is amazing! Knowing everyone else in the room has unruly and probably diseased junk puts me on my game better than a power tie!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set of grooming tools is perfect when you need to rein in that errant foreskin. I only wish it came with some sutures as well, but hey, little bits of TP work for a guy&#x27;s beard, and this isn&#x27;t much different, right? Oh, and the fluffer brush lives up to it&#x27;s name. It hard sometimes to remember to STOP grooming with those soft bristles ... like little loving tongues... &lt;sigh&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one caveat I have for this affordable and simply chic set is that there should be some sort of a warning about the special \\&quot;evening wear\\&quot; bracelet. It&#x27;s so shiny and sparkly that it will seem a damn shame to keep it hidden in your tuxedo trousers. But do that. I know at the last (and I mean THE last) fancy dinner party I went to, I decided to allow the bracelet (and my business) free range to show off the dynamic facets and diamond(ette) studded glory that made me feel like a man of wealth and taste. Needless to say, I spent the night in the local constabulary, where Pedro and Shaquille were not nearly as impressed with my manhood&#x27;s come-hither attitude. My community service ends next week and I then hope to start using the Willy Care Kit again as my secret weapon for success!</li>
            <li> Good quality.  This is the only nipple hair and sideburn groomer that I would recommend.  Wait, it&#x27;s for trimming what????</li>
            <li> My topiary business has been in steady decline and I was looking for a career change anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then I saw the Willy Care Kit.  Bingo.  And, honestly, I could never really express my artistic vision in leaves.  But now.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And no more ladders!  (for the most part)</li>
            <li> The mirror is no where near big enough.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as advertised so I guess the mistake was mine. It&#x27;s not big enough to do the job.  I thought I was getting a grooming kit for my beloved coyote friend, Wile.  He&#x27;s such a busy guy and never spends anything on himself, always work, work, work for that coyote.  Shipping wasn&#x27;t as fast as he was used to, either, but it was there in the two days promised and they wouldn&#x27;t drop it at his home, just at his work place.  I thought the medallion would look great on him but it&#x27;s just a little bitty thing, might fit a road runner but I think it would choke a chicken.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend bought me one of these for Christmas and I was really pleased at how easy it was to use. Every Sunday before I go into church, I like to make my dandy diddle look perfect for the Lord Jesus Christ. I believe cleanliness is next to Godliness!!!. I just take a a few moments to trim and snip the hair. I got a small mini cross to dangle from the chain as well! I love the mirror, it really helps me to see my handiwork! I do feel everyone should get this product! (Only flaw is.. I wish it came with small plastic waste bags for my pubic hair)</li>
            <li> I was once afraid of presenting me bait and tackle to the birds at Paddington yeah,but now I can proudly show off me trim Willy and not feel like a wanker when I&#x27;m pulling out me meat and two veggies for a little bit of how&#x27;s yer father.</li>
            <li> what, no bronzer? Outrageous omission!</li>
            <li> This is quite the gift for someone if you want a little laugh. It is packaged well and the box and items inside are quality products. I would deffjnately recommend to anyone who wants a good laugh!</li>
            <li> Even though I really wanted to spend my holiday bonus on something else (pinball machine), my wife had been nagging me to get a circumcision for months.    Thanks to Amazon I got both. It feels so good to finally outsmart her.    The kit brings a mirror to see what you&#x27;re doing, a brush to tame your curlies, scissors to snip your foreskin and a bracelet, all in a handsome leather box. The bracelet is a nice touch. I wore it and pretended my wife&#x27;s super foxy OBGYN snipped my bit.    I found a pair of gloves and some Orajel laying around the house, which were helpful (but not necessary). Everything else was included in this kit.</li>
            <li> I fancy myself as a man who has the world by the short and curlies and I want to look my best in pubic. The Willy Care Kit is my second most important package. The grooming sheers are nimble and precise, easily negotiating the tough to reach spots of my nether regions. The sprucing mirror and fluffing brush add panache and style. And if my lady and I are stepping out on the town or hitting a members only club, my evening wear gives me flair! Give that special man a leg up on the competition. Let him know you care with Willy Care!</li>
            <li> I breathed a sigh of relief when I saw there were no &amp;#34;used&amp;#34; ones for sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Wowzers! I used Willy Care Kit once and got two boners!</li>
