            <li>Had read good reviews about this product.  </li>
            <li>I Loved that this mascara was organic and no animal testing</li>
            <li>Good mascara</li>
            <li>I got good volume, length and definition</li>
            <li>I love this mascara!</li>
            <li>Love this mascara!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>Better!</li>
            <li>Call me old-fashioned, but the plastic manufactured brushes that seem to have become popular do not work well for me.</li>
            <li>Kind of clumpy..</li>
            <li>I own the organic tinted moisturizer and bronzer.  </li>
            <li>It also leaves flakes and runs very easily...</li>
            <li>and I actually liked it better than what I was using before.  </li>
            <li>All in all, this is an amazing mascara, and I am sure I will be re-purchasing it when I use this tube up.</li>
            <li>Best and most natural mascara I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li>So it really makes your lashes look great.</li>
            <li>I used loreal voluminous for years and wanted to make a switch to something more eco-friendly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using only natural/organic beauty products for about a year and this is the best mascara I&#x27;ve found, rivaling non organic mascaras I remember.  </li>
            <li>, I have a budget, so there may be something better</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t be able to justify the price.  </li>
            <li>It makes the product even better that it is organic.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, there are too many downsides for me to purchase this again, even though it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li>They do not allow for precision in application and tend to lead to more clumping.</li>
            <li>Just okay in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I bought it because I really do love Physicians Formula</li>
            <li>was just okay.</li>
            <li>But as of now, it&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
            <li>i love the results.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m being 100% truthful about my experience because we girls have to stick together</li>
            <li>This product is an ok mascara.</li>
            <li>I bought this yesterday and was so excited because, though I don&#x27;t own a lot of Physicians Formula stuff, what I do have I love.  </li>
            <li>and it does DRY and makes lashes look longer,thicker and perfect.</li>
            <li>I was told that this brand was really good, and while intitally the lash effect was nice, it never really dried and</li>
            <li>I loved the description and I really wanted an organic mascara.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to apply and makes the lashes look very nice and long.</li>
            <li>I would compare it to Cover Girl Lash Blast (original, orange tube, non-waterproof), but drier and with more volume.</li>
            <li>Flakes off very quickly</li>
            <li>However, it also smudges and runs REALLY easily.</li>
            <li>This mascara runs easily and burns like chemicals in my eyes.  </li>
            <li>In terms of packaging I find the shape of the packaging cute and comfortable to hold but it has a cheap feeling in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and easy to wear.</li>
            <li>I have been using this mascara for about 6 months and my eyes are fine.</li>
            <li>But I decided to give the mascara just one more try and luckily, things worked out fine after that.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been working just fine.</li>
            <li>I read the label on this one and was impressed that it didn&#x27;t contain many of the irritating ingredients in most mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Finally i found a great mascara and Never thought it would be from PF.</li>
            <li>I thought maybe I&#x27;d just gotten an older package, or that maybe it being kind of clumpy was a trade off</li>
            <li>The only good thing is that it washes off easily.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to get this Mascara, I had done a lot of web research and this seemed like the mascara I had been waiting for....  </li>
            <li>The only nice thing I can say is the packaging is cute.  </li>
            <li>I have to be attentive to my eyes throughout the day to make sure there&#x27;s no bleeding/smudging, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me that much.</li>
            <li>I expected more for something with the name &amp;#34;FakeOut&amp;#34; and I usually love Physicians Formula, their BB Beauty Balm Powder is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Extends my lashes, makes them full looking, and does not clump.</li>
            <li>I feel so much prettier now :)</li>
            <li>my eye lashes look full and long&lt;</li>
            <li>Goes on with a great brush to plump volume and doesn&#x27;t flake which is my biggest issue with other mascaras</li>
            <li>I have tried nearly every mascara that&#x27;s out at the drug store, and this is hands down one of the best.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>WORTH the $12.00 i paid at Walmart.</li>
            <li>but this one smudges right away and doesn&#x27;t add volume or lengthen lashes.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m feeling super energetic, I repeat the application process for a second time, and BAM!</li>
            <li>Apparently this stuff is safe.</li>
            <li>first time I used it, it was sort of dry coming out of the container, and so went on kind of clumpy.</li>
            <li>And I found the best effect with what I usually do - put on foundation and powder first (also powdering my lashes), put on a coat of the mascara, wait about a minute and put on a second coat.  </li>
            <li>(Note, I only put it on my top lashes, but if I rub them, or tear up, then it will be all over.)</li>
            <li>When I use a different brush to apply the mascara, I really love the way it looks.</li>
            <li>I have hot flashes.</li>
            <li>Ok, so I&#x27;ve been your human tester.</li>
            <li>Ok ladies of a certain age, victory is finally ours!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve found it to be true to it&#x27;s claims of 24-hr wear (no raccoon eyes, so far).  </li>
            <li>, I was impressed enough with the product to try a different Physician&#x27;s Formula mascara: Organic wearÂ®100% Natural Origin BB Bigger!</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>Tried this cuz I have SUPER sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>Washes off extremely easy with whichever facial cleanser I use.</li>
            <li>Overall, i would definitely recommend it, and love the product!</li>
            <li>I will forever be on the lookout for a decent hypoallergenic mascara!</li>
            <li>That since my eyes water so much, an organic product would help.</li>
            <li>I really dislike them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One thing for you to know is that it has a big brush, but is not annoying.</li>
            <li>My lashes are much healthier and thicker since switching to this mascara.</li>
            <li>but this mascara wasn&#x27;t really anything to write home about for me.</li>
            <li>It lengthens my lashes really well but doesn&#x27;t really thicken.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really liking this mascara.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sweaty or really doing anything but sitting on a boat in the evening.  </li>
            <li>And organic (whatever that really means now).</li>
            <li>and I was really hesitating spending the money.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>will continue my search for a non-toxic, long wear, soy/glutten free mascara that&#x27;s priced under $15, meanwhile, I will continue using this product.  </li>
            <li>I actually like it quite a lot, as it gives a really full lash effect without clumping or being flaky.</li>
            <li>But 3 times is a charm and this new Gem is FAB!</li>
            <li>The 100% recycled mascara wand is wide and easy to use.</li>
            <li>this mascara smudges more than any mascara Ive worn and personally I could only get some volume- no length.</li>
            <li>Beautiful, thick, curling, long eyelashes.</li>
            <li>to the mascara itself, the comments made by other users about it&#x27;s lack of water resistance is very true.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I had high hopes because the description led me to believe there might be fibers or a thickness to this mascara.  </li>
            <li>The mascara is priced too high for the quality.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fine in my case, but on rainy days you have to be careful.</li>
            <li>Not hard to apply</li>
            <li>I just switched to Physicians Formula from a high end line at a specialty store and I am pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bulbous and the bristles are neither fine nor numerous enough to cover well without clumping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No clumps, runs smoothly, eye lashes don&#x27;t stick to each other.</li>
            <li>I could live if it didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li>Last November I began paying attention and suddenly it became important for me to not put anything harmful in or on my body.  </li>
            <li>A few swipes created thick, beautiful lashes.</li>
            <li>I touched my lashes and, sure enough, black fingertips.</li>
            <li>The only downside is u will have to buy it more often than typical mascaras.</li>
            <li>While my eyes only mildly sting, I looked in the mirror to see a raccoon staring back at me within the hour.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to have to use my old one until I can go shopping again.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really do anything different.</li>
            <li>and I could not wash it off fast enough.  </li>
            <li>and it is natural.</li>
            <li>It also is a pretty dry formula, which I like,  </li>
            <li>My complaint is that this seems to dry out pretty quickly, which saddens me because I really do like it.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t notice that it really volumizes (other than kind of clumping) or lengthens my lashes, but since my lashes are mostly blonde, it at least makes them visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only had to use 3 coats when normally I use 6.</li>
            <li>Now I have a full tube I can&#x27;t use and can&#x27;t afford to waste money on another brand.</li>
            <li>I do see some length and some volume; however, I  find that it is more charcoal than black, not the blackest black that I prefer from my mascara.</li>
            <li>(this mascara is only 70% natural,</li>
            <li>It is Better than Loreal&#x27;s Voluminous false fiber lashes.</li>
            <li>I really like other products of ORGANIC.</li>
            <li>and....you know....help each other do things like find our eyelashes that we miss so much.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, this mascara did burn my eyes a little after they watered up</li>
            <li>, I can never get much product on the brush and having to put on 20 coats just for my eye lashes to look like they have a bit of mascara on them is not worth my time.</li>
            <li>I noticed this at first when I started crying</li>
            <li>However, most of my recent purchases of new mascaras (the new ones from Revlon and Covergirl) have left me sadly disappointed, so I was searching for something different.</li>

            <li> Ok ladies of a certain age, victory is finally ours!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve found it to be true to it&#x27;s claims of 24-hr wear (no raccoon eyes, so far).  </li>
            <li> , I was impressed enough with the product to try a different Physician&#x27;s Formula mascara: Organic wearÂ®100% Natural Origin BB Bigger!</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> Tried this cuz I have SUPER sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> Washes off extremely easy with whichever facial cleanser I use.</li>
            <li> Overall, i would definitely recommend it, and love the product!</li>
            <li> I will forever be on the lookout for a decent hypoallergenic mascara!</li>
            <li> That since my eyes water so much, an organic product would help.</li>
            <li> I really dislike them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One thing for you to know is that it has a big brush, but is not annoying.</li>
            <li> My lashes are much healthier and thicker since switching to this mascara.</li>
            <li> but this mascara wasn&#x27;t really anything to write home about for me.</li>
            <li> It lengthens my lashes really well but doesn&#x27;t really thicken.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really liking this mascara.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sweaty or really doing anything but sitting on a boat in the evening.  </li>
            <li> And organic (whatever that really means now).</li>
            <li> and I was really hesitating spending the money.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> will continue my search for a non-toxic, long wear, soy/glutten free mascara that&#x27;s priced under $15, meanwhile, I will continue using this product.  </li>
            <li> I actually like it quite a lot, as it gives a really full lash effect without clumping or being flaky.</li>
            <li> But 3 times is a charm and this new Gem is FAB!</li>
            <li> The 100% recycled mascara wand is wide and easy to use.</li>
            <li> this mascara smudges more than any mascara Ive worn and personally I could only get some volume- no length.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, thick, curling, long eyelashes.</li>
            <li> to the mascara itself, the comments made by other users about it&#x27;s lack of water resistance is very true.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I had high hopes because the description led me to believe there might be fibers or a thickness to this mascara.  </li>
            <li> The mascara is priced too high for the quality.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s fine in my case, but on rainy days you have to be careful.</li>
            <li> Not hard to apply</li>
            <li> I just switched to Physicians Formula from a high end line at a specialty store and I am pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bulbous and the bristles are neither fine nor numerous enough to cover well without clumping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No clumps, runs smoothly, eye lashes don&#x27;t stick to each other.</li>
            <li> I could live if it didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> Last November I began paying attention and suddenly it became important for me to not put anything harmful in or on my body.  </li>
            <li> A few swipes created thick, beautiful lashes.</li>
            <li> I touched my lashes and, sure enough, black fingertips.</li>
            <li> The only downside is u will have to buy it more often than typical mascaras.</li>
            <li> While my eyes only mildly sting, I looked in the mirror to see a raccoon staring back at me within the hour.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to have to use my old one until I can go shopping again.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really do anything different.</li>
            <li> and I could not wash it off fast enough.  </li>
            <li> and it is natural.</li>
            <li> It also is a pretty dry formula, which I like,  </li>
            <li> My complaint is that this seems to dry out pretty quickly, which saddens me because I really do like it.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t notice that it really volumizes (other than kind of clumping) or lengthens my lashes, but since my lashes are mostly blonde, it at least makes them visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only had to use 3 coats when normally I use 6.</li>
            <li> Now I have a full tube I can&#x27;t use and can&#x27;t afford to waste money on another brand.</li>
            <li> I do see some length and some volume; however, I  find that it is more charcoal than black, not the blackest black that I prefer from my mascara.</li>
            <li> (this mascara is only 70% natural,</li>
            <li> It is Better than Loreal&#x27;s Voluminous false fiber lashes.</li>
            <li> I really like other products of ORGANIC.</li>
            <li> and....you know....help each other do things like find our eyelashes that we miss so much.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, this mascara did burn my eyes a little after they watered up</li>
            <li> , I can never get much product on the brush and having to put on 20 coats just for my eye lashes to look like they have a bit of mascara on them is not worth my time.</li>
            <li> I noticed this at first when I started crying</li>
            <li> However, most of my recent purchases of new mascaras (the new ones from Revlon and Covergirl) have left me sadly disappointed, so I was searching for something different.</li>
            <li> I tend to be sensitive to other mascaras, and this has been wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Lasts all day - gives full, thick lash look!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long at all.  </li>
            <li> I recently started a search to find a mascara that wouldn&#x27;t irritate my already dry eyes.</li>
            <li> I can wear it all day (and sometimes forget to take it off at night) without it making my eyes extra dry and itchy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Unlike with other mascaras, it tends to get on my upper lid just above my lash line.  </li>
            <li> Certainly it doesn&#x27;t help that I live in a humid environment, but it runs worse than any other mascara I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Lashes look voluminous, long, and luxurious.</li>
            <li> The wand is strangely shaped, the mascara itself is dry.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product, but it failed me.  </li>
            <li> You have to wait a bit for it to dry before swabbing a q-tip across</li>
            <li> Just remember it&#x27;s not waterproof, and you need to give it a bit of a chance to dry, and yes it will come off if you cry</li>
            <li> (not really of course, but they look that long!)</li>
            <li> Typical mascaras last me 2 to 3 months.</li>
            <li> like every single other organic mascara will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It never really dries so my lashes clump together throughout the day.</li>
            <li> and it was still wet before bed.</li>
            <li> My only gripe is, I have gotten the product in my eyes when washing it off and it stings super bad.</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers-</li>
            <li> I have never had a problem with any other mascara.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use any other mascara.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Go Curl Eyelash Curler, Pink]]), and BAM!</li>
            <li> but I could see this meaning it would need to be replaced sooner than other mascaras.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the brush shape.  </li>
            <li> The only real complaint that I have is that I don&#x27;t like the leaf design of the tube, but that doesn&#x27;t have any bearing on the actual effectiveness of the product</li>
            <li> This mascara is really average.</li>
            <li> Not a fun experience.</li>
            <li> I bought the Organic Wear, black organics &amp; it</li>
            <li> I cannot help but make a mess applying mascara with this brush.</li>
            <li> It was pretty embarrassing because I had no idea and people were like what&#x27;s wrong!  </li>
            <li> Environmental Working Group (EWG) became my bible and so began my little adventure.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When the formula starts to get a little dry or thick, I add a few drops of water or contact lens solution, and it extends the life of the mascara.</li>
            <li> 10 bucks down the drain!</li>
            <li> Sticky; never really dries making it hard to not look clumpy</li>
            <li> expect it to be waterproof as it absolutely isn&#x27;t, but it doesn&#x27;t just run like crazy as soon as a drop of water hits.</li>
            <li> waste of money.</li>
            <li> I ran out of my Honeybee Gardens mascara and was too impatient to order online and wait</li>
            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> but you would have thought I had been crying, balling my eyes out, if you saw me.  </li>
            <li> make my eye lashes stiff</li>
            <li> and it DIDN&#x27;T MAKE A MESS!</li>
            <li> Maybe it works for a cold and dry climate but definitely not in Summer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I just had to get used to it or something, but I&#x27;ve now been using this mascara for a few months</li>
            <li> It clumps bad, runs a lot, and does not make my eye lashes look much longer or fuller than if I weren&#x27;t wearing any makeup at all.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this mascara!  </li>
            <li> I looked like I had been crying!</li>
            <li> I do not think I will buy this mascara again unfortunately as I am also not a very big fan of these style brushes.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> Call it a mid-life crisis, but I&#x27;ve recently become obsessed with my optimal health.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite the cons (raccoon eyes are SO not sexy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to apply.  </li>
            <li> its hard to apply</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t clump for me at least.  </li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor, and at least try this method.</li>
            <li> I like the thick brush</li>
            <li> I had previously given this product a bad review since it had burned my eyes badly the first time I used it, but I&#x27;ve changed my mind.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay on your lashes but rather smears onto your lower eyelids making you look tired and haggard.</li>
            <li> Gives me the look of false lashes without clumping and smudging.</li>
            <li> but it runs worse than any mascara I have ever put on!</li>
            <li> Boy was I was wrong..</li>
            <li> literally ask me where I bought my fake eyelashes.</li>
            <li> So, I am sorry to say I didn&#x27;t like it though I wanted to.</li>
            <li> But I have a secret weapon, and it is this mascara!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it contains soy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wearing false eyelashes!</li>
            <li> I tried the green tube Organic Wear mascara from Physician&#x27;s Formula a couple of years ago and absolutely hated it.</li>
            <li> Useless!</li>
            <li> That said, it&#x27;s absolutely impossible for Summer in NY.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to have a natural/organic mascara that is waterproof, they will ALL smudge as the chemicals that make mascara waterproof are not organic.  </li>
            <li> Not too bad - didn&#x27;t hold the curl</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had one smudge that badly.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, it runs, really bad.  </li>
            <li> Really disappointed.  </li>
            <li> --flakes end up under my eyes :(</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> This runs so bad!</li>
            <li> I was shocked!</li>
            <li> This is probably one of the worst mascaras I have tried.</li>
            <li> Worst mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I Do Not use physicians formula and the 2 products i did buy were horrible.  </li>
            <li> terrible product!</li>
            <li> Worst Mascara I have ever bought.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product can cause some irritation by the end of the day. But I like the ingredients and the feel, so it&#x27;s worth it. I have super sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> This mascara literally never dries. You blink and it gets everywhere! waste of money.</li>
            <li> So it really makes your lashes look great. It doesn&#x27;t clump, lengthens &amp; defines. The problem is that it starts running within 2 hours. Certainly it doesn&#x27;t help that I live in a humid environment, but it runs worse than any other mascara I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this mascara!  I&#x27;m going to have to use my old one until I can go shopping again.  I feel ripped off for $9.00.  The wand is strangely shaped, the mascara itself is dry.  It&#x27;s hard to apply.  By the end of one hour, I had raccoon eyes.  The only nice thing I can say is the packaging is cute.  Repeat -- DO NOT BUY</li>
            <li> This is great for the price too!  Goes on with a great brush to plump volume and doesn&#x27;t flake which is my biggest issue with other mascaras</li>
            <li> I just switched to Physicians Formula from a high end line at a specialty store and I am pleasantly surprised! I am paying about 1/4 of what I used to pay and I am 4 times happier..  Great find!!</li>
            <li> Mascara is great.  I used loreal voluminous for years and wanted to make a switch to something more eco-friendly.  I wish it was waterproof, but it stays on all day for me without any smudging.  My only complaint is the brush shape.  Unlike with other mascaras, it tends to get on my upper lid just above my lash line.  You have to wait a bit for it to dry before swabbing a q-tip across or it will clump your lashes.</li>
            <li> Not too bad - didn&#x27;t hold the curl the best but minimum flaking during the day</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, it goes on well and looks great! It enhances my lashes without looking bulky and weird, and my favorite part is that it doesn&#x27;t make my eyes itch. I tend to be sensitive to other mascaras, and this has been wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect it to be waterproof as it absolutely isn&#x27;t, but it doesn&#x27;t just run like crazy as soon as a drop of water hits.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to apply and makes the lashes look very nice and long. That said, it&#x27;s absolutely impossible for Summer in NY. It&#x27;s the runniest mascara I have ever bought. Maybe it works for a cold and dry climate but definitely not in Summer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to have a natural/organic mascara that is waterproof, they will ALL smudge as the chemicals that make mascara waterproof are not organic.  So I wasn&#x27;t expecting that.  I ran out of my Honeybee Gardens mascara and was too impatient to order online and wait so picked this up at Rite Aid... and I actually liked it better than what I was using before.  I have thin light lashes and it definitely thickened and extended to a degree.  Didn&#x27;t clump for me at least.  And I found the best effect with what I usually do - put on foundation and powder first (also powdering my lashes), put on a coat of the mascara, wait about a minute and put on a second coat.  I&#x27;ve been using only natural/organic beauty products for about a year and this is the best mascara I&#x27;ve found, rivaling non organic mascaras I remember.  Just remember it&#x27;s not waterproof, and you need to give it a bit of a chance to dry, and yes it will come off if you cry/etc... like every single other organic mascara will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you care about the organic factor like I do this is one of the best at the best price.  I haven&#x27;t tried the $30 organic mascaras out there, I have a budget, so there may be something better but I wouldn&#x27;t be able to justify the price.  It&#x27;s mascara.  It works.</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers- this mascara smudges more than any mascara Ive worn and personally I could only get some volume- no length.</li>
            <li> I tried the green tube Organic Wear mascara from Physician&#x27;s Formula a couple of years ago and absolutely hated it. However, most of my recent purchases of new mascaras (the new ones from Revlon and Covergirl) have left me sadly disappointed, so I was searching for something different. A YouTuber whose videos I watch used this one and raved about it, so I figured I had nothing to lose. I actually like it quite a lot, as it gives a really full lash effect without clumping or being flaky. I have tried nearly every mascara that&#x27;s out at the drug store, and this is hands down one of the best. I would compare it to Cover Girl Lash Blast (original, orange tube, non-waterproof), but drier and with more volume. All in all, this is an amazing mascara, and I am sure I will be re-purchasing it when I use this tube up. The only real complaint that I have is that I don&#x27;t like the leaf design of the tube, but that doesn&#x27;t have any bearing on the actual effectiveness of the product so i don&#x27;t count off for that.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product, but it failed me.  This is probably one of the worst mascaras I have tried. It seemed like there was just a drop of product in mine, I can never get much product on the brush and having to put on 20 coats just for my eye lashes to look like they have a bit of mascara on them is not worth my time.</li>
            <li> Tried this cuz I have SUPER sensitive eyes. When Maybelline stopped making my mascara almost a decade ago, I had to stop wearing makeup. I have tried every drug store brand to no avail. I&#x27;m always in pain within 2 hours. I tried this in hopes that it might work. While my eyes only mildly sting, I looked in the mirror to see a raccoon staring back at me within the hour. I touched my lashes and, sure enough, black fingertips. I&#x27;ve never had one smudge that badly. Save your money.</li>
            <li> Worst mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. I have been trying organic mascaras in the market- I understand that organic mascaras don&#x27;t work as well but this one smudges right away and doesn&#x27;t add volume or lengthen lashes. What a waste. I threw it out.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! It&#x27;s light and easy to wear. A few swipes created thick, beautiful lashes. The 100% recycled mascara wand is wide and easy to use. It makes the product even better that it is organic. I&#x27;ll never use anything else.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long at all.  Really disappointed.  Had read good reviews about this product.  Flakes off very quickly--flakes end up under my eyes :(</li>
            <li> That since my eyes water so much, an organic product would help. It didn&#x27;t really do anything different. My eyes still watered. The brush is very nice.</li>
            <li> I bought this mascara because of its &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; contents. (this mascara is only 70% natural, whatever that means) It clumps bad, runs a lot, and does not make my eye lashes look much longer or fuller than if I weren&#x27;t wearing any makeup at all. The only good thing is that it washes off easily. I will forever be on the lookout for a decent hypoallergenic mascara!</li>
            <li> I recently started a search to find a mascara that wouldn&#x27;t irritate my already dry eyes. I read the label on this one and was impressed that it didn&#x27;t contain many of the irritating ingredients in most mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;This mascara DOESN&#x27;T irritate my eyes like several of the others I&#x27;ve tried. I can wear it all day (and sometimes forget to take it off at night) without it making my eyes extra dry and itchy.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t notice that it really volumizes (other than kind of clumping) or lengthens my lashes, but since my lashes are mostly blonde, it at least makes them visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, it was sort of dry coming out of the container, and so went on kind of clumpy. I thought maybe I&#x27;d just gotten an older package, or that maybe it being kind of clumpy was a trade off I could live if it didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes. However, it also smudges and runs REALLY easily. I&#x27;m constantly having to check in the mirror to see if I have any under my eyes. (Note, I only put it on my top lashes, but if I rub them, or tear up, then it will be all over.) I never use waterproof mascara and yet I&#x27;ve never used one that smudges so easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, there are too many downsides for me to purchase this again, even though it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> I really like other products of ORGANIC.</li>
            <li> Call me old-fashioned, but the plastic manufactured brushes that seem to have become popular do not work well for me. They do not allow for precision in application and tend to lead to more clumping. I really dislike them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been a PF mascara fan for years, but I have come to increasingly dislike the adjustments they&#x27;ve made to brushes. (The best brush they had came with the Eye Brightener years ago. It&#x27;s been downhill since.) I cannot help but make a mess applying mascara with this brush. It&#x27;s bulbous and the bristles are neither fine nor numerous enough to cover well without clumping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the mascara itself, the comments made by other users about it&#x27;s lack of water resistance is very true. I have to be attentive to my eyes throughout the day to make sure there&#x27;s no bleeding/smudging, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me that much. When I use a different brush to apply the mascara, I really love the way it looks. Lashes look voluminous, long, and luxurious. When the formula starts to get a little dry or thick, I add a few drops of water or contact lens solution, and it extends the life of the mascara.</li>
            <li> This mascara runs easily and burns like chemicals in my eyes.  I couldn&#x27;t even wash it off without burning my eyes in the process.  I noticed this at first when I started crying and I could not wash it off fast enough.  I have never had a problem with any other mascara.  Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Sticky; never really dries making it hard to not look clumpy</li>
            <li> It clumped up thoroughout the day</li>
            <li> This mascara is amazing and gives a lot of volume! I only had to use 3 coats when normally I use 6. It does not irritate my eyes either. Overall, i would definitely recommend it, and love the product! It is a staple now! One thing for you to know is that it has a big brush, but is not annoying.</li>
            <li> I Loved that this mascara was organic and no animal testing but it runs worse than any mascara I have ever put on! I literally put it on, put my make up away, put my shoes on, stopped at the front door to look in the foyer mirror before going out, as I always do, and I was shocked! I looked like I had been crying! 10 bucks down the drain! Useless!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this Mascara, I had done a lot of web research and this seemed like the mascara I had been waiting for....  Boy was I was wrong.. The brush is stubby and doesn&#x27;t even spread to all of your lashes... its hard to apply and it actually made my lashes look shorter and thinner.  It also leaves flakes and runs very easily... by the end of a simple work day (sitting at a desk) it was gone.</li>
            <li> Just okay in my opinion. I expected more for something with the name &amp;#34;FakeOut&amp;#34; and I usually love Physicians Formula, their BB Beauty Balm Powder is my favorite. I do not think I will buy this mascara again unfortunately as I am also not a very big fan of these style brushes.</li>
            <li> Best and most natural mascara I&#x27;ve used! My lashes are much healthier and thicker since switching to this mascara. Gives me the look of false lashes without clumping and smudging. I won&#x27;t use any other mascara.</li>
            <li> This mascara is really average. I bought it because I really do love Physicians Formula but this mascara wasn&#x27;t really anything to write home about for me. It lengthens my lashes really well but doesn&#x27;t really thicken. It never really dries so my lashes clump together throughout the day. Like I said, I didn&#x27;t mind it, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t spend $9 (after shipping) on it again.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara! I had a customer at my work literally ask me where I bought my fake eyelashes. And another friend ask about it, she went out to buy it &amp; loves it. No clumps, runs smoothly, eye lashes don&#x27;t stick to each other. Fans out perfectly! I bought the Organic Wear, black organics &amp; it was just okay. Kind of clumpy.. But this one is so great! Totally recommend it!</li>
            <li> Been wearing this for 2 months. I&#x27;m really liking this mascara. Extends my lashes, makes them full looking, and does not clump. Washes off extremely easy with whichever facial cleanser I use. My only gripe is, I have gotten the product in my eyes when washing it off and it stings super bad. I&#x27;m also wondering what will happen once summer comes and the weather is humid or I get sweaty...will the product bleed? We will see! But as of now, it&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes look longer &amp; fuller. No watery eyes like I get w/regular mascara.</li>
            <li> Good mascara i love the results. The only downside is u will have to buy it more often than typical mascaras. I have to replace mine every 5 to 6 weeks. Typical mascaras last me 2 to 3 months. Other than that i like the result and it is natural.</li>
            <li> I bought this yesterday and was so excited because, though I don&#x27;t own a lot of Physicians Formula stuff, what I do have I love.  I own the organic tinted moisturizer and bronzer.  Anyway, I had high hopes because the description led me to believe there might be fibers or a thickness to this mascara.  There wasn&#x27;t. Furthermore, it runs, really bad.  Yes, it was 90 and a bit humid yesterday when I wore it but you would have thought I had been crying, balling my eyes out, if you saw me.  I wasn&#x27;t sweaty or really doing anything but sitting on a boat in the evening.  It was pretty embarrassing because I had no idea and people were like what&#x27;s wrong!  Lol.  Anyway, I went to try to take some of it off and, as another reviewer indicated, the stuff STINGS. If you get it in your eyes.  So, I am sorry to say I didn&#x27;t like it though I wanted to.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great for me. I curl my eyelashes, and it keeps them curled. However, know what you&#x27;re getting into: this stuff is not waterproof in the slightest. That&#x27;s fine in my case, but on rainy days you have to be careful. My complaint is that this seems to dry out pretty quickly, which saddens me because I really do like it.</li>
            <li> WORTH the $12.00 i paid at Walmart. This is the most Expensive drug store mascara i have ever bought. I saw a review by Grav3yard girl on youtube so,i wanted to try it for myself I always use my falsies by Maybelline. But this will definitely be my go to mascara from now on.  I like the thick brush and it does DRY and makes lashes look longer,thicker and perfect. It is Better than Loreal&#x27;s Voluminous false fiber lashes. I can truly say this is the BEST mascara for me! I Do Not use physicians formula and the 2 products i did buy were horrible.  The bronzer i bought was all shimmer and no color pay off and the eyeshadow was not glitter,it was all flakey and cakey flecks of shimmer. But 3 times is a charm and this new Gem is FAB! Finally i found a great mascara and Never thought it would be from PF.</li>
            <li> terrible product! It doesn&#x27;t stay on your lashes but rather smears onto your lower eyelids making you look tired and haggard. Waste of money!</li>
            <li> LOVE&amp;#60; LOVE&amp;#62; LOVE!!</li>
            <li> I was told that this brand was really good, and while intitally the lash effect was nice, it never really dried and so mascara was getting everywhere all the time. Not a fun experience.</li>
            <li> Ok ladies of a certain age, victory is finally ours! I can&#x27;t speak for the 20- and 30-somethings, but if you are menopausal (or probably even post-menopausal), listen up my friends. The hair on my head is thinning. I have hot flashes. And something happened to my eyelashes. They used to be darker. They used to be thicker. They used to be curlable with a eyelash curler. Not so anymore. But I have a secret weapon, and it is this mascara! This stuff gives me eyelashes again. Beautiful, thick, curling, long eyelashes. This mascara has lengthening/thickening fibers in it. This is not the fiber mascara of yesteryear though. Apparently this stuff is safe. And organic (whatever that really means now). I have been using this mascara for about 6 months and my eyes are fine. It doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes or anything like that. Ok, so I&#x27;ve been your human tester. Here is how I use this. I put one coat of mascara on each eye and let it sit for about 30 seconds. Then I do a second coat, and wait 30 seconds. Then I curl my eyelashes with the Japonesque eyelash curler ([[ASIN:B002UXRE4U JAPONESQUE Go Curl Eyelash Curler, Pink]]), and BAM! I have the eyelashes of a 20 year-old again! If I&#x27;m feeling super energetic, I repeat the application process for a second time, and BAM! I&#x27;m wearing false eyelashes! (not really of course, but they look that long!) I haven&#x27;t been this happy since Spanx was invented. Do yourself a favor, and at least try this method. I feel so much prettier now :) And I&#x27;m being 100% truthful about my experience because we girls have to stick together and....you know....help each other do things like find our eyelashes that we miss so much.</li>
            <li> I had previously given this product a bad review since it had burned my eyes badly the first time I used it, but I&#x27;ve changed my mind. The first time I used it, this mascara did burn my eyes a little after they watered up and the product ran into them. But I decided to give the mascara just one more try and luckily, things worked out fine after that. I&#x27;m not sure if I just had to get used to it or something, but I&#x27;ve now been using this mascara for a few months and it&#x27;s been working just fine.</li>
            <li> Love this! Lasts all day - gives full, thick lash look! Didn&#x27;t have to reapply at all!! Not hard to apply and it DIDN&#x27;T MAKE A MESS!</li>
            <li> Worst Mascara I have ever bought. I feel like I was ripped off. I loved the description and I really wanted an organic mascara. I wear make up every day and I was in need. Do not buy this product!!! This runs so bad! Never drys at all. I put it on in the morning and it was still wet before bed. Slightest touch and it went everywhere. I can&#x27;t afford makeup and I was really hesitating spending the money. Now I have a full tube I can&#x27;t use and can&#x27;t afford to waste money on another brand. So disappointed.</li>
            <li> Call it a mid-life crisis, but I&#x27;ve recently become obsessed with my optimal health.  For years I ignored the talk about the harmful chemicals in products we use every day (especially cosmetics and personal hygiene products).  Last November I began paying attention and suddenly it became important for me to not put anything harmful in or on my body.  Environmental Working Group (EWG) became my bible and so began my little adventure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side:&lt;br /&gt;EWG score: 1&lt;br /&gt;Organic/natural ingredients&lt;br /&gt;excellent, buildable coverage&lt;br /&gt;made my eye lashes look full and long&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t make my eye lashes stiff&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;it does have a tendency to bleed onto my under eye area&lt;br /&gt;it contains soy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the cons (raccoon eyes are SO not sexy ~ lol), I was impressed enough with the product to try a different Physician&#x27;s Formula mascara: Organic wearÂ®100% Natural Origin BB Bigger! Better! Lashes Mascara.  I got good volume, length and definition and I&#x27;ve found it to be true to it&#x27;s claims of 24-hr wear (no raccoon eyes, so far).  Unfortunately, it contains soy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue my search for a non-toxic, long wear, soy/glutten free mascara that&#x27;s priced under $15, meanwhile, I will continue using this product.  It&#x27;s almost perfect.</li>
            <li> Purchased this mascara because of a cash back coupon.  The mascara is priced too high for the quality.  I really don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> This product is an ok mascara. I do see some length and some volume; however, I  find that it is more charcoal than black, not the blackest black that I prefer from my mascara. It also is a pretty dry formula, which I like,  but I could see this meaning it would need to be replaced sooner than other mascaras. In terms of packaging I find the shape of the packaging cute and comfortable to hold but it has a cheap feeling in my opinion. Overall I will probably use up this mascara wearing it day to day, but I do not see myself repurchasing it.</li>
