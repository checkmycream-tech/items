    <ol>
            <li>Always an excellent product</li>
            <li>Wonderful coverage</li>
            <li>Your product is awesome,  make it easier for people to buy it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and it still the best ever!</li>
            <li>Perfect size just like in the store.</li>
            <li>I found that for my oily skin, this isn&#x27;t the best product.  </li>
            <li>Keep up the good work, bareMinerals!</li>
            <li>what a splendid surprise.</li>
            <li>This foundation is great and feels like I am not wearing any makeup.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not that great a deal.</li>
            <li>what great coverage and texture you get</li>
            <li>I thought I was getting it at a great price</li>
            <li>Great product</li>
            <li>Great.</li>
            <li>it works great except the shipping took almost a month</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>It truly is amazing!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t come even close to having perfect skin, but with this product, my skin looks so much better.  </li>
            <li>The product isn&#x27;t as awesome as I thought it would be, but it was OK.</li>
            <li>This stuff has amazing coverage, and creates a beautiful glow.</li>
            <li>Great product...have used for years and love it!</li>
            <li>Did not feel treated fairly as a customer.</li>
            <li>I thought I was getting a good price.  </li>
            <li>So the price wasn&#x27;t all that good.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this makeup!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Love the feel on my face!</li>
            <li>Love baremineral!</li>
            <li>After using this lines makeup, it is amazing</li>
            <li>kind of deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Amazon, don&#x27;t let this kind of practice continue...</li>
            <li>Because of my age, my skin variation tone etc.. the concealer and this foundation gives a nice finish.</li>
            <li>this is a great product, however, this cost $21 for a 2g container (I thought I was getting the full size 8 g container that I get at ulta for $27).</li>
            <li>Bare Minerals are the best</li>
            <li>I was thinking the price was too good to be true</li>
            <li>My fault for not reading the fine print, but still!</li>
            <li>It looks beautiful and does not look as though you are wearing a mask, which is very important with high coverage.</li>
            <li>I love the bareminerals makeup.  </li>
            <li>Love the makeup...</li>
            <li>I thought It was better priced</li>
            <li>I am 65 and most people guess my age at 50.  </li>
            <li>Should have paid more attention to the described volume.</li>
            <li>My favorite foundation out there.</li>
            <li>and here they are more affordable</li>
            <li>I love how it covers imperfections and redness.</li>
            <li>I love the make-up, but the fact that this is a SAMPLE size needs to be posted.</li>
            <li>The sifter top was not connected to the container, so if you tip it at all, the top comes off and all the powder goes everywhere.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought $18 would buy a bit more.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>My wife love this make-up</li>
            <li>I love bareMinerals</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I was very happy to finally get more of my foundation.  </li>
            <li>This has the best coverage and stays the longest as long as I&#x27;m using a primer and the mineral veil.</li>
            <li>These are more like the sample containers you get in the kits but priced as full size!  </li>
            <li>This was perfect- brand new, sealed, and exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>The make-up itself is fine, but its packaging has to be able to work for the purpose, and this one doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, and this may have just been me:  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping and good price.  </li>
            <li>I have mild rosacea so covering it up and keeping it covered is very important to me.</li>
            <li>This product is a favorite of mine, but this is a trial size being sold as full size.</li>
            <li>Light easy make-up that does not have toxic chemicals.</li>
            <li>Product itself is fine.</li>
            <li>It covers well as long as you have a good concealer to use!</li>
            <li>I apply it with a very dense, large powder brush and get great results.</li>
            <li>Huge rip off.</li>
            <li>I know this never made me break out, which is a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li>It feels so light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light</li>
            <li>Still the same great product though.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use any liquid foundation, just a light covering of my bareMinerals</li>
            <li>and the coverage is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>so the Fairly Light fits my skin tone.</li>
            <li>Maybe good for teens and young 20yr olds</li>
            <li>so if you are wanting to try Bare Minerals this would be a good choice.</li>
            <li>This is 2 grams, the full size is 8 grams.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m blonde and fair skinned</li>
            <li>Also, Bare minerals is an AMAZING PROUDUCT.</li>
            <li>My favorite foundation by far</li>
            <li>Might be three day&#x27;s worth of make-up.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s by far my favorite</li>
            <li>This stuff is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It is amazing how much coverage it gives, and it always looks super natural - almost undetectable, really.</li>
            <li>I may be old and fat but my skin looks marvelous thanks to Bare Escentuals Bare Minerals products.  </li>
            <li>Great product, but small amount.</li>
            <li>I love Bare Escentuals.</li>
            <li>Everything thing they claim is absolute true.  </li>
            <li>I used to love Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li>I saw this and thought it was a good deal because the regular price for a standard foundation from bareminerals is about $24, and, because it was on Prime, shipping was free.</li>
            <li>Will buy online again and more bare minerals products.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Very very very shimmery.</li>
            <li>This was simple and quick, not heavy felt nice.</li>
            <li>First of all, I received a thank you note from the seller a couple of days before getting my product.</li>
            <li>Not only does it reduce shine and even pigment tone, but also has sunscreen built into the product. :-)</li>
            <li>The key to using this product is being able to sprinkle some out into the cap and use the brush in the cap to apply it.  </li>
            <li>The item came quickly and sealed up brand new.</li>
            <li>mentioned in my title, if anyone from Bare Escentuals is reading, I specifically went looking elsewhere to find this product because the website&#x27;s ordering process is a huge PITA.  </li>
            <li>Love this foundation and will use it for a very long time.</li>
            <li>Waste of money when I could have paid $5 more for a full size.</li>
            <li>SIZE feel ripped off could get 8oz for a few dollars more!</li>
            <li>As usual this product is fantastic, it is a smaller pack that I get in the stores but still good.</li>
            <li>but overall the product is fine and the convenience of amazon can not be beat.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I&#x27;ve always loved Bare Minerals, but the seller can&#x27;t take credit for that.</li>
            <li>BareMinerals foundation is very high coverage, very high-quality, and will make your skin problems disappear.</li>
            <li>This is very misleading.</li>
            <li>This is VERY misleading.</li>
            <li>I want to have the chose to buy when I am ready to buy (when I have the money) and what I want to buy.</li>
            <li>Thanks for this product, and</li>
            <li>While the &amp;#34;grams&amp;#34; of product is accurately stated, this is not something I pay attention to, and I was very surprised to receive this tiny size.</li>
            <li>While the &amp;#34;grams&amp;#34; of product is accurately stated, this is not something I pay attention to, and I was very surprised to receive this tiny size.  </li>
            <li>I have been using bareMinerals for many years, and it has never let me down.  </li>
            <li>but how little it needs touching up during the day.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not an everyday foundation for me, as I preferred to let more of my skin show-</li>
            <li>This is not the normal size you would buy from BareMinerals.</li>
            <li>Please be aware this is the sample size, not the regular size which is just a few dollars more.</li>
            <li>Be aware that this is for sample size of the foundation, not the regular size.</li>
            <li>Looks natural on!</li>
            <li>At listed price for the sample size, it&#x27;s not quite the deal it seems; it works out to be expensive than paying slightly more for the full size item.</li>
            <li>This product is being sold at at the same price as the full size versions even though it is much smaller.</li>
            <li>Complete RIP OFF.</li>
            <li>I really wear &#x27;facial&#x27; make up.</li>
            <li>As the old saying goes, &amp;#34;Try</li>
            <li>It covers well and is not heavy at all.</li>
            <li>But I had several big events right in a row.</li>
            <li>Obviously this is my own fault for not knowing the difference in sizes but very frustrating that the seller has priced their sample at the same price as a full size product.</li>
            <li>Because it looked like it was being sold by the actual company, I trusted that it was a decent sale price.</li>
            <li>Note that this is a smaller size, so pricing is high.</li>
            <li>My own fault, I didn&#x27;t read the description carefully enough, but I really wouldn&#x27;t have expected such a small container compared to what I buy at Ulta or Sephora.</li>
            <li>this isn&#x27;t the normal size, it&#x27;s much smaller.  </li>
            <li>For a few more dollars would have had the regular size not this tiny package.</li>
            <li>I returned these because I thought I was getting the 8g/.028 size; these were much smaller; ordered larger size from Ulta for a few bucks more.</li>
            <li>smaller and older version of bare minerals foundation</li>
            <li>In the past I tried some &amp;#34;wannabees&amp;#34; but there is nothing that can compare with the original.  </li>
            <li>It is also astounding at how little makeup is actually required and how little comes off when you take it off.  </li>
            <li>This is not the full-size 8g Bare Minerals foundation.</li>
            <li>I buy it from amazon instead of Bare Escentuals web site because I get charged every month for products I do not want.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if my skin has since dried out a little bit over the years, but I find much better coverage from a BB cream that I use.</li>
            <li>The seller uses the same image as the Bare Escentuals site uses for their full-size foundation.</li>
            <li>and I keep coming back to Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li>It is a sample size product that is about 1/3 the size of the normal product -- and the normal size is usually in this price range.</li>
            <li>It is a sample size product that is about 1/3 the size of the normal product -- and the normal size is usually in this price range.  </li>
            <li>Read the reviews, less than half the original size.</li>
            <li>crazy amazing coverage</li>

            <li> SIZE feel ripped off could get 8oz for a few dollars more!</li>
            <li> As usual this product is fantastic, it is a smaller pack that I get in the stores but still good.</li>
            <li> but overall the product is fine and the convenience of amazon can not be beat.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I&#x27;ve always loved Bare Minerals, but the seller can&#x27;t take credit for that.</li>
            <li> BareMinerals foundation is very high coverage, very high-quality, and will make your skin problems disappear.</li>
            <li> This is very misleading.</li>
            <li> This is VERY misleading.</li>
            <li> I want to have the chose to buy when I am ready to buy (when I have the money) and what I want to buy.</li>
            <li> Thanks for this product, and</li>
            <li> While the &amp;#34;grams&amp;#34; of product is accurately stated, this is not something I pay attention to, and I was very surprised to receive this tiny size.</li>
            <li> While the &amp;#34;grams&amp;#34; of product is accurately stated, this is not something I pay attention to, and I was very surprised to receive this tiny size.  </li>
            <li> I have been using bareMinerals for many years, and it has never let me down.  </li>
            <li> but how little it needs touching up during the day.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an everyday foundation for me, as I preferred to let more of my skin show-</li>
            <li> This is not the normal size you would buy from BareMinerals.</li>
            <li> Please be aware this is the sample size, not the regular size which is just a few dollars more.</li>
            <li> Be aware that this is for sample size of the foundation, not the regular size.</li>
            <li> Looks natural on!</li>
            <li> At listed price for the sample size, it&#x27;s not quite the deal it seems; it works out to be expensive than paying slightly more for the full size item.</li>
            <li> This product is being sold at at the same price as the full size versions even though it is much smaller.</li>
            <li> Complete RIP OFF.</li>
            <li> I really wear &#x27;facial&#x27; make up.</li>
            <li> As the old saying goes, &amp;#34;Try</li>
            <li> It covers well and is not heavy at all.</li>
            <li> But I had several big events right in a row.</li>
            <li> Obviously this is my own fault for not knowing the difference in sizes but very frustrating that the seller has priced their sample at the same price as a full size product.</li>
            <li> Because it looked like it was being sold by the actual company, I trusted that it was a decent sale price.</li>
            <li> Note that this is a smaller size, so pricing is high.</li>
            <li> My own fault, I didn&#x27;t read the description carefully enough, but I really wouldn&#x27;t have expected such a small container compared to what I buy at Ulta or Sephora.</li>
            <li> this isn&#x27;t the normal size, it&#x27;s much smaller.  </li>
            <li> For a few more dollars would have had the regular size not this tiny package.</li>
            <li> I returned these because I thought I was getting the 8g/.028 size; these were much smaller; ordered larger size from Ulta for a few bucks more.</li>
            <li> smaller and older version of bare minerals foundation</li>
            <li> In the past I tried some &amp;#34;wannabees&amp;#34; but there is nothing that can compare with the original.  </li>
            <li> It is also astounding at how little makeup is actually required and how little comes off when you take it off.  </li>
            <li> This is not the full-size 8g Bare Minerals foundation.</li>
            <li> I buy it from amazon instead of Bare Escentuals web site because I get charged every month for products I do not want.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if my skin has since dried out a little bit over the years, but I find much better coverage from a BB cream that I use.</li>
            <li> The seller uses the same image as the Bare Escentuals site uses for their full-size foundation.</li>
            <li> and I keep coming back to Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li> It is a sample size product that is about 1/3 the size of the normal product -- and the normal size is usually in this price range.</li>
            <li> It is a sample size product that is about 1/3 the size of the normal product -- and the normal size is usually in this price range.  </li>
            <li> Read the reviews, less than half the original size.</li>
            <li> crazy amazing coverage</li>
            <li> I love bareMinerals foundation, but this packaging was disappointing.</li>
            <li> The color was as expected but it was a smaller jar size.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize the size, this is a lot smaller size than I expected to receive.</li>
            <li> I paid the price for a large container and these were very small......</li>
            <li> So I paid only 5 less for something that is less that half the size of the large one I would have gotten down at the store.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that it was so small.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, when I got it in the mail it was the sample size, Not the full size.</li>
            <li> I can apply a little for daily wear or a lot for evening wear!</li>
            <li> It seems expensive at first, but it lasts FOREVER because just a llittle goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The item came within a couple of days and it was exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> Had way too much shine within an hour, and it clogged my pores to where I broke out worse.</li>
            <li> This is a smaller version than what you typically buy in the stores or at Ulta!</li>
            <li> For this price I was expecting to receive my usual 8g purchase, but this is only 1/4 of that at 2g.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting such a small size.</li>
            <li> Much smaller than what I d received in the past.</li>
            <li> Did not realize I was purchasing the small sample size until the order actually arrived.</li>
            <li> I am not pleased that I received 1/4 of the amount of product for the same price.</li>
            <li> For $28, the 6 G size is availabe online at other retailers.</li>
            <li> Be careful when puchasing!</li>
            <li> The amount of make up was less than I had expected.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to believe the seller isn&#x27;t taking advantage of buyers who are expecting the standard size product, which I&#x27;ve just learned is 8g.</li>
            <li> not worth my bother to buy such a small little bit of this powder.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price when you get a sample size container.</li>
            <li> This is a sample size - definitely NOT worth the price.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> a little chalky ish in appearance.</li>
            <li> This was The little size.</li>
            <li> The little insert in the cap was not well-attached, and keeps falling out.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I stupidly read the .07 oz as being almost the same size as my old one, which was 8 grams, not ounces.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know it came in this small container.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know they could sell foundation this small.</li>
            <li> Beware - SMALL SIZE.</li>
            <li> Seems like the use of the visual lack of scale was used to maximize profit unfairly.</li>
            <li> Didnt notice when I was ordering this for the price and prime availability, this is the small size (like the concealer size jar).</li>
            <li> Beware, this is the 2 G size which is small.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t look like I dunked my face in powder or like I had an inch thick like &amp;#34;I</li>
            <li> This is a very small foundation for this price.</li>
            <li> This looks cakey on, even if I apply over moisturizer and do just a very a small amount of powder.</li>
            <li> but this is ridiculously overpriced for the size I received.</li>
            <li> not a good price for the size</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that this is about 1/3 the regular size</li>
            <li> So your skin has broken out?</li>
            <li> Definitely not a great price for the size.  </li>
            <li> Turns out to be a very bad buy financially.</li>
            <li> But this is not a full size container :-(</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t read the reviews before purchase and was extremely disappointed to see that it wasn&#x27;t the full-size product.</li>
            <li> WRONG color!</li>
            <li> I hate the feel and the &#x27;fake look&#x27;</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the size.</li>
            <li> Stupid me, if I would have taken just a minute to read the reviews I would have realized</li>
            <li> I hate going to the mall to get my make up.</li>
            <li> so that was annoying.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed compared to Mary Kay or Tarte brands</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This foundation is great and feels like I am not wearing any makeup.</li>
            <li> I love the bareminerals makeup.  It is like not having anything on your face.  It feels so light.</li>
            <li> The amount of make up was less than I had expected.  Didn&#x27;t know it came in this small container.</li>
            <li> Complete RIP OFF. For this price I was expecting to receive my usual 8g purchase, but this is only 1/4 of that at 2g.</li>
            <li> Coverage is lacking and the staying power just isn&#x27;t there. Very disappointed compared to Mary Kay or Tarte brands</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t read the reviews before purchase and was extremely disappointed to see that it wasn&#x27;t the full-size product. For another $5 I could have gotten three times the makeup. This is very misleading.</li>
            <li> First of all, I received a thank you note from the seller a couple of days before getting my product. what a splendid surprise. The item came within a couple of days and it was exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> Love the makeup...I use it all the time. But this is not a full size container :-( Waste of money when I could have paid $5 more for a full size. My fault for not checking! I won&#x27;t make that mistake a again.</li>
            <li> I hate going to the mall to get my make up. It&#x27;s easier to just buy it online. This was perfect- brand new, sealed, and exactly what I was looking for. Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I really wear &#x27;facial&#x27; make up. I hate the feel and the &#x27;fake look&#x27; it gives me. But I had several big events right in a row. This was simple and quick, not heavy felt nice. It didn&#x27;t look like I dunked my face in powder or like I had an inch thick like &amp;#34;I just want world peace, Miss America&amp;#34; kind of deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took away the shiny, queasy look in pictures but I still looked like me in person.</li>
            <li> Always an excellent product</li>
            <li> Read the reviews, less than half the original size. Huge rip off.</li>
            <li> Light easy make-up that does not have toxic chemicals. Also has spf. I recommend if you don&#x27;t like caked on make-up.</li>
            <li> So your skin has broken out? This is going to be your savior. BareMinerals foundation is very high coverage, very high-quality, and will make your skin problems disappear. It&#x27;s not an everyday foundation for me, as I preferred to let more of my skin show-but when I&#x27;m having issues, this is always what I lean towards. It looks beautiful and does not look as though you are wearing a mask, which is very important with high coverage. Overall I will repurchase again and again</li>
            <li> a little chalky ish in appearance.</li>
            <li> Size has gotten way smaller.</li>
            <li> I should have looked at the ounces in this thing.  It&#x27;s tiny!  I compared the price for a bigger size so it&#x27;s not that great a deal.</li>
            <li> This is not the full-size 8g Bare Minerals foundation. It&#x27;s only 2g. It&#x27;s a quarter of the size, but definitely not a quarter of the price. The seller uses the same image as the Bare Escentuals site uses for their full-size foundation. This is VERY misleading. What a rip off!</li>
            <li> I was not expecting such a small size. I didn&#x27;t know they could sell foundation this small. I thought it would be standard sized, which I have since learned is 8g, regularly about $27. This is a very small foundation for this price.</li>
            <li> The color was as expected but it was a smaller jar size. I thought It was better priced but it is not the standard size.  but overall the product is fine and the convenience of amazon can not be beat.</li>
            <li> Beware - SMALL SIZE. I guess it&#x27;s my fault for not reading and understanding the product weight but this is ridiculously overpriced for the size I received. It&#x27;s hard to believe the seller isn&#x27;t taking advantage of buyers who are expecting the standard size product, which I&#x27;ve just learned is 8g.</li>
            <li> Note that this is a smaller size, so pricing is high.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 9 years.  I am 65 and most people guess my age at 50.  After using this lines makeup, it is amazing what great coverage and texture you get but how little it needs touching up during the day.  I only carry lip gloss in my purse.  It is also astounding at how little makeup is actually required and how little comes off when you take it off.  I would not go back to liquid makeup if you paid me.</li>
            <li> ONLY 2oz. SIZE feel ripped off could get 8oz for a few dollars more!</li>
            <li> I like the bareMinerals product, and I would give the product itself 4 or 5 stars. But this product should NOT be sold for $19.99. It is a sample size product that is about 1/3 the size of the normal product -- and the normal size is usually in this price range. While the &amp;#34;grams&amp;#34; of product is accurately stated, this is not something I pay attention to, and I was very surprised to receive this tiny size. Amazon should not permit sellers to engage in this type of practice.</li>
            <li> This was a sample size for a regular size price. There was only 2g or .07 oz of product. My own fault, I didn&#x27;t read the description carefully enough, but I really wouldn&#x27;t have expected such a small container compared to what I buy at Ulta or Sephora.</li>
            <li> This was The little size. Should have paid more attention to the described volume. This is the one that comes in their starter packs.</li>
            <li> only foundation I use</li>
            <li> Much smaller than what I d received in the past.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the size. I just assumed it was the standard size that I have always bought. I thought I was getting it at a great price but when I received it I saw why.</li>
            <li> Product itself is fine. Did not realize I was purchasing the small sample size until the order actually arrived. Turns out to be a very bad buy financially. If you do not mind paying extra for a &amp;#34;travel size,&amp;#34; then go for it.</li>
            <li> My favorite foundation out there. I&#x27;ve used it all over the years and I keep coming back to Bare Minerals. This has the best coverage and stays the longest as long as I&#x27;m using a primer and the mineral veil.</li>
            <li> Buyer beware! This is a smaller version than what you typically buy in the stores or at Ulta! That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s cheaper.</li>
            <li> This stuff has amazing coverage, and creates a beautiful glow. However, if not used correctly, it can be cakey.</li>
            <li> not a good price for the size</li>
            <li> Bare Minerals are the best and here they are more affordable</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this makeup! It&#x27;s so light it feels like nothing at all! I can apply a little for daily wear or a lot for evening wear! It truly is amazing! If you haven&#x27;t tried it you should!</li>
            <li> Be aware that this is for sample size of the foundation, not the regular size. I did not look closely and made that mistake, as I&#x27;ve ordered the regular size from Amazon before for a similar price. At listed price for the sample size, it&#x27;s not quite the deal it seems; it works out to be expensive than paying slightly more for the full size item.</li>
            <li> Love this foundation and will use it for a very long time. I love how it covers imperfections and redness.</li>
            <li> I love the make-up, but the fact that this is a SAMPLE size needs to be posted.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get what all the hype is! Excentuates wrinkles. Maybe good for teens and young 20yr olds</li>
            <li> Seems like the use of the visual lack of scale was used to maximize profit unfairly. Did not feel treated fairly as a customer. Add visual scale next time. not worth my bother to buy such a small little bit of this powder. I count on it to last me for months</li>
            <li> As usual this product is fantastic, it is a smaller pack that I get in the stores but still good.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Been using it for years - and ordering it from Amazon for years. Around $20 for 0.28oz. I didn&#x27;t think to check the size on this one, but it was 0.07oz for the same price. I am not pleased that I received 1/4 of the amount of product for the same price. Still the same great product though.</li>
            <li> Great product, but small amount.</li>
            <li> works to make my face look even and somewhat brighter.</li>
            <li> I love bareMinerals foundation, but this packaging was disappointing. The sifter top was not connected to the container, so if you tip it at all, the top comes off and all the powder goes everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the terrible packaging, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> this is a great product, however, this cost $21 for a 2g container (I thought I was getting the full size 8 g container that I get at ulta for $27). Not worth the price when you get a sample size container.</li>
            <li> I love Bare Escentuals. I buy it from amazon instead of Bare Escentuals web site because I get charged every month for products I do not want. I want to have the chose to buy when I am ready to buy (when I have the money) and what I want to buy.</li>
            <li> My favorite foundation by far</li>
            <li> The container is teeny weeny. I thought $18 would buy a bit more. Might be three day&#x27;s worth of make-up.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and good price.  Love this product.  I have tried others but keep coming back to this one.  Keep up the good work, bareMinerals!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since their debut and I wouldn&#x27;t consider using anything else.  In the past I tried some &amp;#34;wannabees&amp;#34; but there is nothing that can compare with the original.  Everything thing they claim is absolute true.  I may be old and fat but my skin looks marvelous thanks to Bare Escentuals Bare Minerals products.  As the old saying goes, &amp;#34;Try it...You&#x27;ll like it&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> This is not the normal size you would buy from BareMinerals.</li>
            <li> My wife love this make-up</li>
            <li> Wonderful coverage; I&#x27;ve found nothing else like it, and can&#x27;t even feel it on.  I have rosacea and no reactions or anything like that.... Great product I hope to use for years to come!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As mentioned in my title, if anyone from Bare Escentuals is reading, I specifically went looking elsewhere to find this product because the website&#x27;s ordering process is a huge PITA.  Your product is awesome,  make it easier for people to buy it!</li>
            <li> Great. Looks natural on!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that this is about 1/3 the regular size</li>
            <li> Why didn&#x27;t I check the reviews?!! Because it looked like it was being sold by the actual company, I trusted that it was a decent sale price. NOPE.</li>
            <li> I love bareMinerals it works great except the shipping took almost a month and it said it was supposed to take a week so that was annoying. I had no make up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used BM for a while and saw this and was drawn in by the price.  Stupid me, if I would have taken just a minute to read the reviews I would have realized this isn&#x27;t the normal size, it&#x27;s much smaller.  Definitely not a great price for the size.  For a few more dollars would have had the regular size not this tiny package.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize the size, this is a lot smaller size than I expected to receive. It is not the standard size.</li>
            <li> Please be aware this is the sample size, not the regular size which is just a few dollars more. Other than that, I&#x27;ve always loved Bare Minerals, but the seller can&#x27;t take credit for that. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> WRONG color! I can&#x27;t even use this.</li>
            <li> I have been using bareMinerals for many years, and it has never let me down.  I don&#x27;t use any liquid foundation, just a light covering of my bareMinerals and the coverage is fantastic.  I don&#x27;t come even close to having perfect skin, but with this product, my skin looks so much better.  Thanks for this product, and I hope it is NEVER discontinued!</li>
            <li> Love the feel on my face! Not only does it reduce shine and even pigment tone, but also has sunscreen built into the product. :-) I also use it on my neck and chest area.</li>
            <li> Didnt notice when I was ordering this for the price and prime availability, this is the small size (like the concealer size jar).</li>
            <li> This is a sample size - definitely NOT worth the price. Had to return.</li>
            <li> smaller and older version of bare minerals foundation</li>
            <li> This is 2 grams, the full size is 8 grams. My fault for not reading the fine print, but still! I was surprised that it was so small.</li>
            <li> crazy amazing coverage I would recommend this over the matte finish. I work 12 hour daysI will I move and I sweat a lot it stays on all day maybe one touch up but it&#x27;s by far my favorite</li>
            <li> Beware, this is the 2 G size which is small. For $28, the 6 G size is availabe online at other retailers.</li>
            <li> I used to love Bare Minerals. I don&#x27;t know if my skin has since dried out a little bit over the years, but I find much better coverage from a BB cream that I use. This looks cakey on, even if I apply over moisturizer and do just a very a small amount of powder. It also doesn&#x27;t cover as well as I remember. I know this never made me break out, which is a huge plus for me. I would keep looking if you&#x27;re hooked on mineral makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and it still the best ever!</li>
            <li> I was thinking the price was too good to be true and it was. This is the trial size and is more expensive at Amazon that at the store. A trial size lasts me about 2weeks so if you are wanting to try Bare Minerals this would be a good choice. Color was correct.</li>
            <li> The key to using this product is being able to sprinkle some out into the cap and use the brush in the cap to apply it.  The little insert in the cap was not well-attached, and keeps falling out.  The make-up itself is fine, but its packaging has to be able to work for the purpose, and this one doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, and this may have just been me:  I thought I was getting a good price.  I didn&#x27;t realize I was getting a smaller-than-usual package.  So the price wasn&#x27;t all that good.  But then, that means I use it up faster and don&#x27;t have to keep dealing with the faulty packaging.</li>
            <li> Amazon, don&#x27;t let this kind of practice continue...&lt;br /&gt;My fault for not reading the reviews, but I know the product so I didn&#x27;t think it was necessary to read any reviews.</li>
            <li> Tiny size. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Very very very shimmery.</li>
            <li> This product is being sold at at the same price as the full size versions even though it is much smaller. Obviously this is my own fault for not knowing the difference in sizes but very frustrating that the seller has priced their sample at the same price as a full size product.</li>
            <li> This is a TINY container! I stupidly read the .07 oz as being almost the same size as my old one, which was 8 grams, not ounces. This is 1/4 the size of what I had for the same price in store.</li>
            <li> I paid the price for a large container and these were very small......</li>
            <li> I love this product. I won&#x27;t ware anything else. I&#x27;m blonde and fair skinned so the Fairly Light fits my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I returned these because I thought I was getting the 8g/.028 size; these were much smaller; ordered larger size from Ulta for a few bucks more.</li>
            <li> This stuff is worth every penny. It seems expensive at first, but it lasts FOREVER because just a llittle goes a long way. It is amazing how much coverage it gives, and it always looks super natural - almost undetectable, really. I apply it with a very dense, large powder brush and get great results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s several shades darker than the powder shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> I think this is a quality product and I&#x27;m happy. It covers well as long as you have a good concealer to use! Because of my age, my skin variation tone etc.. the concealer and this foundation gives a nice finish.</li>
            <li> I like the bareMinerals product, and I would give the product itself 4 or 5 stars.  But this product should NOT be sold for $19.99.  It is a sample size product that is about 1/3 the size of the normal product -- and the normal size is usually in this price range.  While the &amp;#34;grams&amp;#34; of product is accurately stated, this is not something I pay attention to, and I was very surprised to receive this tiny size.  Amazon should not permit sellers to engage in this type of practice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of bareMinerals!  I was very happy to finally get more of my foundation.  It covers well and is not heavy at all.</li>
            <li> The product isn&#x27;t as awesome as I thought it would be, but it was OK.</li>
            <li> These are more like the sample containers you get in the kits but priced as full size!  Be careful when puchasing!</li>
            <li> I saw this and thought it was a good deal because the regular price for a standard foundation from bareminerals is about $24, and, because it was on Prime, shipping was free. Also, Bare minerals is an AMAZING PROUDUCT. Unfortunately, when I got it in the mail it was the sample size, Not the full size. So I paid only 5 less for something that is less that half the size of the large one I would have gotten down at the store. Make the drive to ULTA, this is a rip off.</li>
            <li> This product is a favorite of mine, but this is a trial size being sold as full size.</li>
            <li> Love baremineral! Buy online to save some extra money. Perfect size just like in the store. The item came quickly and sealed up brand new. Will buy online again and more bare minerals products.</li>
            <li> Great product...have used for years and love it!</li>
            <li> This is the only makeup that stays put and covers up my red cheeks. I have mild rosacea so covering it up and keeping it covered is very important to me.</li>
            <li> I found that for my oily skin, this isn&#x27;t the best product.  Had way too much shine within an hour, and it clogged my pores to where I broke out worse.</li>
