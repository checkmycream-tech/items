    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Here I thought I was doing something so wonderful for my mouth and teeth</li>
            <li>and assumed I had been using the best stuff on the shelf.  </li>
            <li>The reviewer that said they experienced \\&quot;no</li>
            <li>I have always taken great care when it comes to my dental hygiene.</li>
            <li>My husband did some great research about oral health, so we were both inspired.  </li>
            <li>Great mouthwash.  </li>
            <li>that doesn&#x27;t bother you, then this is great stuff.</li>
            <li>I wanted a really great rinse, and this seemed promising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and if so, I&#x27;m really happy.  </li>
            <li>but that alone is a great reason to stay away from it</li>
            <li>so I asked my brother to give his opinion and he thought it was fine and as delicious as ever.</li>
            <li>Crest Pro-Health Multiprotection Rinse has a good flavor and works well.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, a good oral rinse.</li>
            <li>Crest is always a good company that delivers what it claims to do.</li>
            <li>Buying it at a good price always helps.</li>
            <li>About two months ago I decided to try out the Crest Pro Health rinse because they make it sound so great for you!</li>
            <li>The minty taste is good for a mouth wash.</li>
            <li>I have liked using this mouthwash and feel my breathe has gotten better!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s my honest experience with the product.  </li>
            <li>but this is my honest experience with the product.</li>
            <li>So I thought I&#x27;d give this a swish and see how I liked</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a Scope kind of person for ages, but decided to give this and the Crest Pro-Health toothpaste a try.</li>
            <li>I wish when products would say mint, they would tell you what kind it is.</li>
            <li>Make your own mouthwash with peppermint oil.</li>
            <li>This mouthwash has a nice minty flavor.</li>
            <li>For a bottle that promises so many pros it would have been real nice to have a more accurate idea of what the cons were.</li>
            <li>taste is very strong and lasts for a while.</li>
            <li>LOVE this mouthwash - no burn, tastes great, keeps my breath fresh!</li>
            <li>That makes me some kind of weirdo, I&#x27;m sure.  </li>
            <li>This is as effective, and tastes better.</li>
            <li>Crest Pro-Health Multiprotection Clean Mint Rinse tastes good and seems to make my teeth feel cleaner</li>
            <li>These bottles are really large, which is great because it lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li>but I can say that my mouth feels fresher after using it.  : )</li>
            <li>Well, this product sure reversed that.</li>
            <li>:) I&#x27;ve used this stuff for about 2 years now.</li>
            <li>I started to notice my teeth turning darker all around, though more noticeably around the edges.  </li>
            <li>so I went to Costco to buy some more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 years, and I still have all my tastebuds. :-)</li>
            <li>There should be something on the bottle about his because I have used many, many kinds of mouthwashes and NONE of them have ever done this to my mouth.  </li>
            <li>I like the burn of Listerine better.  </li>
            <li>I think for people who can&#x27;t tolerate the burn of Listerine or Scope, this is the answer, and is definitely better than not using a mouth rinse.</li>
            <li>There is no way I would want to use this before dinner, I would not be able to taste it</li>
            <li>But I love that there is no burn and no alcohol.</li>
            <li>Love crest mouthwash because it works.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite flavors Mint.  </li>
            <li>Use it love it.</li>
            <li>I love Crest tooth paste, it works well</li>
            <li>My boyfriend turned me on to the Crest mouthwash and I have to admit, I&#x27;m glad I took his advice.  </li>
            <li>I am glad to have come accross the website , if not I would&#x27;ve been worried out of my mind and thought it mEant</li>
            <li>It does help with my kids&#x27; oral hygiene (better breath), but will update the review if we start experiencing adverse side effects.</li>
            <li>This mouthwash, and the generic Target/Mouthwash identical versions, are hazardous for your enjoyment of good food!  </li>
            <li>Crest Pro-Health Multi-protection Clean Mint Rinse is a perfect mouth wash for those with sensitive teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Plus, you&#x27;re able to swish longer for a better clean!</li>
            <li>i liked the taste, mouth felt clean afterwards..</li>
            <li>This mouthwash leaves my mouth feeling clean without the alcohol burn, which is nice.  </li>
            <li>I confess I haven&#x27;t experienced the numbness, loss of sense of taste or tooth staining others have done (though my tongue does turn an interesting shade of lilac for a while after I use it), and I can honestly see where those things would be a big problem.  </li>
            <li>She was able to remove most of the stains, fortunately, and recommended I use Listerine instead.  </li>
            <li>I continue to enjoy the wonderful tastes of all different kinds of meals and have no problems with my teeth turning brown, after 4 years of using this product.</li>
            <li>So, most alcohol free mouthwashes will be antibacterial, and will thus have the possibility of discoloring your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First the good: It does still sting a bit when you use it full strength, but nothing like many of the mouthwashes on the market.  </li>
            <li>Also I love the CLEAN feeling that mouthwashes give you.</li>
            <li>Also I love the CLEAN feeling that mouthwashes give you.</li>
            <li>The Crest Rinse seems like it&#x27;s helping to keep my gums healthy and leaves my teeth feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>Teeth feel fresh and clean, nice taste, doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;burn\\&quot; like listerine.  </li>
            <li>However, I experience an amazing clean feeling right after using Listerine.</li>
            <li>Oh God, I had a sample of this stuff and, while it tasted just fine, afterwards it tastes like there was ass in my mouth for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>Believe me when I tell you, I use no other kind!</li>
            <li>However, both times I have experienced the same side effect: loss of taste.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the lack of alcohol.</li>
            <li>I filled the cap, smelled it, looked at it and just jumped off the cliff and did it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d happily wait to write this until I consult with him, but I only just saw him a bit ago</li>
            <li>and I want a more powerful rinse instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I was told to use an alcohol free mouthwash during my pregnancy.)</li>
            <li>: If the company knows the real statistic, then why are they giving out a misleading statistic about how many customers complain when you ask them how many customers get staining?    </li>
            <li>Going to the dentist is a luxury for me, and a beautiful WHITE smile is a necessity.</li>
            <li>Going to the dentist is a luxury for me, and a beautiful WHITE smile is a necessity.</li>
            <li>If for no other reason, this makes it a good alternative.</li>
            <li>Crest Pro-Health Multiprotection Clean Mint Rinse is a somewhat mild tasting , alcohol free, mouth wash.</li>
            <li>then you&#x27;ll need to get yourself a bottle of Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Clean Mint Rinse today.</li>
            <li>Upon receiving a bottle of Crest Pro-Health Multiprotection Clean Mint Rinse from the Amazon Vine program, I started using it every morning after brushing my teeth, and maybe once in the evening before going out to dinner or socializing.  </li>
            <li>I believe that the crest pro-health multi-protection clean mint rinse created yellowish brown stains on my teeth.</li>
            <li>I am going to compare this product to [[ASIN:B008OVDRAM LISTERINE Ultra Clean Antiseptic Mouthwash]], which is my go-to product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Active ingredients in Listerine:&lt;br /&gt;Eucalyptol 0.092%&lt;br /&gt;Menthol 0.042%&lt;br /&gt;Methyl Salicylate 0.060%&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did not feel clean when using Crest.</li>
            <li>I did not feel clean when using Crest.</li>
            <li>Since 2007 when this came out to replace Listerine it has been receiving many issues by certain people.</li>
            <li>I ordered this because I needed it, not because I was super excited about what it could do for me.&lt;br /&gt;Having</li>
            <li>I use Crest Crest Pro Health Cool Wintergreen Mouth Wash, and it does not do this.</li>
            <li>So I actually think thats a good thing.</li>
            <li>But then I come across a website full of  crest pro health rinse complaints.</li>
            <li>I did experiments to see if it was just one type of taste (sweet, salty, etc)</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not painful like Listerine (even though I can take it).</li>
            <li>Its got a nice fresh minty taste but not excessively so like Listerine.</li>
            <li>Their wording, like that of their response to customers, might be technically true but, in my opinion, doesn&#x27;t leave the average reader with an accurate perception of the risks and of the prospects for successful treatment.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;To be honest, I think most mouthwashes are pretty much equal.  </li>
            <li>In other words, if you use this, you run the risk of depriving yourself of one of life&#x27;s great pleasures: tasting food and drink.</li>
            <li>If my mouth feels clean and my breath isn&#x27;t offensive, and I don&#x27;t suffer the torments of the damned while I&#x27;m using the stuff, I consider it a success.  </li>
            <li>my view choose another mouthwash with alcohol as its main fighter, those are said to be much better for your mouth compared to what this product contains.</li>
            <li>I do \\&quot;adequately brush\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>This mouthwash is tremendous if you want to lose weight, you&#x27;ll have no incentive to eat while using it.</li>
            <li>taste\\&quot; with this product got off lucky.  </li>
            <li>I hope my taste buds will continue to recover and by tomorrow morning I should be able to eat like normal again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Glad I researched this early on -- a Web search produces multiple references to the problem -- and was able to dump the product before more damage was done.</li>
            <li>This is hubby&#x27;s new favorite.</li>
            <li>I think it really does the job: without coming on too strong and tasting overpowering, it nevertheless freshens my breath for hours after using it.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t use this because you&#x27;re going on a date and want your mouth to smell pretty!  </li>
            <li>I whitened and brushed and used the rinse more not understanding why they were there!</li>
            <li>I can comfortable rinse this around in my mouth for a good, long, reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>The risk should have been clearly and prominently noted on the bottle.    </li>
            <li>My dental hygienist is thrilled that she doesn&#x27;t have to deal with constant staining.</li>
            <li>Since making the switch from this mouthwash to Listerine, my teeth are staying nice and white.</li>
            <li>and admittedly I rarely used mouthwash before.</li>
            <li>they were a nice light pink.  </li>
            <li>And it does this via an alcohol-free formula, which is a nice plus (alcohol finds its way into my life in enough areas already,</li>
            <li>the Crest mouthwash will keep your mouth feeling fresh and your breath minty for hours compared to Listerine.  </li>
            <li>I love the clean feeling of mouthwash, but have not always been faithful with my daily rinsing because of the burning (and drooling) it causes me.</li>
            <li>This mouthwash really does leave your mouth feeling fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>The product on paper looks good, but I cannot use it due to the side effects.</li>
            <li>I said right off I</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been eating because nothing tastes right (or doesn&#x27;t have any taste at all).  </li>
            <li>use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s 10 pm right now</li>
            <li>and I have some swell on the inside of my right cheek.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a loyal user of Listerine products, so the first thing I realized about the Crest Pro-Health Mint Rinse is that there&#x27;s no bitter or memorable aftertaste.</li>
            <li>Luckily, the dentist was able to polish them off but it totally sucked.</li>
            <li>But the fact that it definitely does a great job (again, without being overpowering) in freshening my breath, is in itself enough of a reason to keep using it!</li>
            <li>But, we received it free to give our opinion and I am liking it so far!</li>
            <li>The taste of this particular mouthwash is pleasant enough and leaves my mouth with a clean enough feeling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many mouthwashes, and this is nothing like the standard brands that have been around for a while.</li>
            <li>As many others have said, this STRIPPED my sense of taste for TWO WEEKS after only using once!  </li>
            <li>and I actually like it much better from a taste perspective.</li>
            <li>and when I moved it, it literally felt like I just licked a hot curling iron or something.  </li>
            <li>well, I will give it one more try and sure enough, the same problems returned within hours.  </li>
            <li>My toothpaste is white, so I was sure it was not that.</li>
            <li>What all these consumers are complaining about is exactly what I am experiencing.  </li>
            <li>I have used the Crest Pro-health rinse for several years now and there are many things that I like about it, and one that I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>This Pro Health mouth rinse really works!  </li>
            <li>I can no longer really taste much of anything, salty or sweet.  </li>
            <li>The funny thing is though,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s long lasting effects are perfect for morning use - to get you through the day -- or before bed, when germs can multiply and cause damage, even after brushing.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, if I hadn&#x27;t tried it before I read the other reviews, I might never have tried it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After about two weeks I noticed two dark brown spots forming in between my two front teeth on the top and bottom!</li>
            <li>I was very worried until I came on here and saw that many people had this same reaction.</li>
            <li>It worked much better than the prescription mouthwash, my mouth feels cleaner for longer, and it claims to strengthen the tooth enamel, which in itself would save money in the long run.</li>
            <li>I was ready to spit it out at the first sign of that burn.</li>
            <li>My tongue is super sensitive now.</li>
            <li>But I know there&#x27;s no reason to think it&#x27;s any less effective than a mouthwash with alcohol, which also dries out my mouth.</li>
            <li>but it certainly ruined my taste for a day.  </li>
            <li>I read a fine print on the bottom of the label and it states it MAY cause browning of teeth in some people.&lt;br /&gt;Going online to research this product further</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know what to say.  </li>
            <li>My whole family uses this product and we recommend it.</li>
            <li>I really wish I had read reviews on it before trusting the product, but I bought it in a store without thinking much of it.  </li>
            <li>As for that whole burned tongue thing</li>
            <li>Crest really needs to re-evaluate this line of mouthwashes from the ingredients to the label.</li>
            <li>I switched to Crest Pro-Health for two weeks, and I feel like my gums were a brighter shade of pink and not as healthy.  </li>
            <li>I figure if there are real benefits to using it</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how  much effects it had on my tongue after just one</li>
            <li>I also noticed that my gums were much healthier than they&#x27;ve ever been</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li>If you use as much as they tell you to, you&#x27;re going to cruise through this bottle in about a week,</li>
            <li>not so much.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t really think much of the incident until I went to go buy some chili cheese fries.</li>
            <li>The flavor is good too but that brings me to the negative.</li>
            <li>I think my mouth feels really clean, but then again, my tongue has felt kind of weird and nothing has tasted right since I woke up this morning.</li>
            <li>I have to agree with many other reviewers here.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;clean mouth feeling\\&quot; is no different from Listerine.</li>
            <li>The Clean Mint Rinse not only doesn&#x27;t bring the pain with each use, but it&#x27;ll protect your teeth and gums for twenty-four hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>in particular, that it really gives users a leg up on plaque-</li>
            <li>I have always been lucky and had white, straight, no problem teeth</li>
            <li>I use [[ASIN:B001OOLLVS Crest 3d White Advanced Vivid Teeth Whitening Strips]]</li>
            <li>I will in the future, because it is nice-tasting; minty without beeing too sweet or too medicinal.  </li>
            <li>I used it a total of three times, stopped four days ago, and still lack a full range of taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li>But after nearly a month of not being able to taste much and noticing brown stains on my bottom teeth I had to research it, leading me to this and other online reviews.</li>
            <li>Pizza, oatmeal bread, carrots, etc., all made before and enjoyed, tasted bland.  </li>
            <li>I find the main chemical used to fight \\&quot;evil\\</li>
            <li>The label does warn about possible staining but says it can be avoided with \\&quot;adequate brushing\\&quot; or removed with a dental cleaning.  </li>
            <li>The bottle, in a place I didn&#x27;t notice, says, misleadingly in my view, that the staining \\&quot;may be prevented by adequate brushing or removed at your next dental visit\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>forward to Crest Pro Health and this particular mouth wash.</li>
            <li>While I haven&#x27;t suffered any of the negative effects, as I indicated above, I&#x27;d have to say that Crest isn&#x27;t so great</li>
            <li>This is not permanent or harmful, and may be prevented by adequate brushing or removed at your next dental</li>
            <li>This is not permanent or harmful and may be prevented by adequate brushing or removed at your next dental visit.\\</li>
            <li>This is pretty much the only non-prescription product that has been shown to make much of a difference in this fight.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend NOT buying this product, and on the verge of swearing off Crest products altogether for their lack of concern for the \\&quot;3 percent\\&quot; of people this will happen to, to put a warning on their product for fear of not making money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this one even for kids.</li>
            <li>I thought the loss of taste had something to do with the procedure even though it was highly unusual.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice crisp wintergreen flavor, tending towards overly sweet (but aren&#x27;t they all), non-alcohol base (again, aren&#x27;t they all alcohol free now?).</li>
            <li>Like so many other people, my teeth developed grey-brown stains.</li>
            <li>I just purchased the Crest Pro Health last night August 15, 2012 and used it after brushing, exactly according to directions, and today I cannot taste anything!</li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t doubt that side effects can occur with this, it does seem that these reviews are inherently skewed - how many people would take the time to review such a mundane purchase such as mouthwash if their only thoughts on it were that they liked it?</li>
            <li>She then said 99.9% of customers have not complained.</li>
            <li>My GF bought this for me since I was out of my normal wash.</li>
            <li>I thought that the scalding effect on my tongue was just normal and after some time my buds would get used to it.</li>
            <li>Our household is normally a Listerine household.</li>
            <li>The minty taste is long lasting and lets you feel confident.</li>
            <li>I know the dentist says you should always use mouth wash, but to be perfectly honest I have never liked doing it because of the burning sensation that often is associated with them.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the risks, but in the end, you&#x27;re the only one who knows whether you want to take those risks or not.  </li>
            <li>This feeling is absolutely indescribable, and funny actually.</li>
            <li>It leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh without any burning, stinging, or alcoholic flavor.</li>
            <li>Well some people talked me into buying this out as it was a new non burning mouthwash they found.</li>
            <li>The new trend in mouthwash is \\&quot;antibacterial/antimicrobial\\&quot; mouth wash.</li>
            <li>Being one of the fortunate ones lets me move on to the good and the bad as I see them.  </li>
            <li>simply put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that you don&#x27;t get the same \\&quot;cool breath\\&quot; feel, but as long as it feels clean, who cares?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I use rinses like this it feels more mental than physical</li>
            <li>I originally bought this product at Costco here in Los Angeles---used it for three years with none of the effects mentioned in some other \\&quot;reviews\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>To my surprise, this Crest Pro-Health rinse was exactly what I used at my ortho office earlier!  </li>
            <li>My husband loves this; he says it makes his muth feel, \\&quot;fresh.\\&quot;  It is a little strong for me, though...</li>
            <li>But there is evidence that the active ingredient in it does have a clinically significant effect.  </li>
            <li>I felt a strange tingling on my tongue right away, but figured it was doing it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;My gums are a constant problem, and will turn red if I don&#x27;t brush for two full minutes twice a day, floss, and use a mouth rinse.  </li>
            <li>trust that the product&#x27;s other stated claims are true-</li>
            <li>Luckily I haven&#x27;t experienced the brown stains on my teeth like a lot of people, but losing my sens of taste is bad enough.</li>
            <li>Like many others I have experienced some horrific teeth stains from using this product.  </li>
            <li>After only a couple weeks I look like I have been a tobacco user for my whole life.  </li>
            <li>Crest offers refunds on their products, so I mailed in the receipt and UPC from the bottle.</li>
            <li>What really concerned me though was the accumulation in my mouth of a slimy, gooey white gunk which appeared as soon as I began using this mouthwash.  </li>
            <li>I just returned home from a dental visit to have stains (developed since my purchase) removed.</li>
            <li>so it wasn&#x27;t really supposed to taste like anything , but then later as I got the munchies for a snack, I reached for some nutella.</li>
            <li>but I recently developed some allergies</li>
            <li>I used this product twice, once at night and then again the next morning, and I noticed all day that I couldn&#x27;t really taste anything.</li>
            <li>I bought this crap once because of an awesome coupon I got...biggest mistake ever!!  </li>
            <li>it would really help me stay on top of my oral hygiene game.</li>
            <li>I would love for Crest to pay for my cleaning that I now need due to their product!!!!</li>
            <li>This tingling sensation is really mild and doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>On the Pro side, it tastes fine and really doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;burn\\&quot; like other brands (even other Crests).</li>
            <li>so I am OK with a little burn for the first few seconds.  </li>
            <li>My teeth end up feeling far less clean, my breath less fresh and EVERYTHING tastes like soap for hours and hours afterwards.</li>
            <li>This past week I have not been able to taste food from the middle of my tongue to the tip..</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t seem to taste anything sweet, salty or savory, only bitter.</li>
            <li>Our dentist actually recommended this product to us, particularly because our oldest son just got braces.</li>
            <li>I should say that, despite using a good toothpaste, a sonic toothbrush, floss, a Waterpik-type device, and an expensive prescription mouthwash, my problems with plaque and tartar, which my hygienist thinks I inherited, are such that my insurer and I have had to pay for professional cleaning and descaling every three months, rather than every six months.</li>
            <li>My spouse was slow to open his own bottle, but began to use it after hearing me rave, and has used it religiously ever since, so</li>
            <li>Apparently, there is some ingredient in it that literally stains your teeth!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Crest Pro-Health Multiprotection Clean Mint Rinse isn&#x27;t bad, but there are others I like better.</li>
            <li>used it only 3 times so far and lost my taste for 3 weeks since I used&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It apparently has additional ingredients to improve the functionality of the product.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s when I realized that I could barely taste anything.</li>
            <li>I have no great love of spearmint and that&#x27;s what this rinse is.</li>
            <li>I use this right after brushing and after gargling for a couple minutes, I can visibly see the dead plaque/</li>
            <li>I told him the only thing I did differently today was using the mouthwash by the sink - they normally had a different brand.  </li>
            <li>Now I have replaced it back to my old mouthwash and hopefully after my next dentist appointment my teeth should be getting a brighter color.</li>
            <li>In those 2 years, I havent had a single new cavity.  </li>
            <li>If you have a small mouth like mine, you might even be able to use less.</li>
            <li>I used it off and on for the next month and noticed for the first time in my life that my teeth began turning slightly brown despite my not changing my dental hygiene in any way except for using this Crest mouthwash.  </li>
            <li>We have been using this product for a couple of months, and none of us in the family have experienced the numb tongue or altered taste issue mentioned by other reviewers, but we are continuing to evaluate.  </li>
            <li>;  Apparently I was the second person they saw that had this issue.  </li>
            <li>looked online and apparently a lot of people have had similar problems!&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT USE THIS!!!</li>
            <li>I used this rinse for a few weeks, and after the first week or two, I noticed that my teeth were covered with brown stains.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t buy this on Amazon, but on impulse as my local grocery had a deep discount on some apparent closeouts.     </li>
            <li>/&gt;Because I didn&#x27;t have enough the first go round, I assumed it was a fluke, so I rinsed again.</li>
            <li>The price seems a bit much for mouthwash that does the same as my other ones, except on a stronger more distasteful level.</li>
            <li>I was glad to get the chance to try it, as we usually buy the green color mouthwashes (spearmint) instead of blue (peppermint).  </li>
            <li>After only a few days of using this new mouthwash, I noticed a big difference in the amount of buildup on my teeth, both in terms of new deposits (none) and in the effectiveness of my toothbrush in removing deposits that I had thought only a dental visit would remedy.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> Here I thought I was doing something so wonderful for my mouth and teeth</li>
            <li> and assumed I had been using the best stuff on the shelf.  </li>
            <li> The reviewer that said they experienced \\&quot;no</li>
            <li> I have always taken great care when it comes to my dental hygiene.</li>
            <li> My husband did some great research about oral health, so we were both inspired.  </li>
            <li> Great mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> that doesn&#x27;t bother you, then this is great stuff.</li>
            <li> I wanted a really great rinse, and this seemed promising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and if so, I&#x27;m really happy.  </li>
            <li> but that alone is a great reason to stay away from it</li>
            <li> so I asked my brother to give his opinion and he thought it was fine and as delicious as ever.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health Multiprotection Rinse has a good flavor and works well.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, a good oral rinse.</li>
            <li> Crest is always a good company that delivers what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> Buying it at a good price always helps.</li>
            <li> About two months ago I decided to try out the Crest Pro Health rinse because they make it sound so great for you!</li>
            <li> The minty taste is good for a mouth wash.</li>
            <li> I have liked using this mouthwash and feel my breathe has gotten better!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my honest experience with the product.  </li>
            <li> but this is my honest experience with the product.</li>
            <li> So I thought I&#x27;d give this a swish and see how I liked</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Scope kind of person for ages, but decided to give this and the Crest Pro-Health toothpaste a try.</li>
            <li> I wish when products would say mint, they would tell you what kind it is.</li>
            <li> Make your own mouthwash with peppermint oil.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash has a nice minty flavor.</li>
            <li> For a bottle that promises so many pros it would have been real nice to have a more accurate idea of what the cons were.</li>
            <li> taste is very strong and lasts for a while.</li>
            <li> LOVE this mouthwash - no burn, tastes great, keeps my breath fresh!</li>
            <li> That makes me some kind of weirdo, I&#x27;m sure.  </li>
            <li> This is as effective, and tastes better.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health Multiprotection Clean Mint Rinse tastes good and seems to make my teeth feel cleaner</li>
            <li> These bottles are really large, which is great because it lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li> but I can say that my mouth feels fresher after using it.  : )</li>
            <li> Well, this product sure reversed that.</li>
            <li> :) I&#x27;ve used this stuff for about 2 years now.</li>
            <li> I started to notice my teeth turning darker all around, though more noticeably around the edges.  </li>
            <li> so I went to Costco to buy some more.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 years, and I still have all my tastebuds. :-)</li>
            <li> There should be something on the bottle about his because I have used many, many kinds of mouthwashes and NONE of them have ever done this to my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I like the burn of Listerine better.  </li>
            <li> I think for people who can&#x27;t tolerate the burn of Listerine or Scope, this is the answer, and is definitely better than not using a mouth rinse.</li>
            <li> There is no way I would want to use this before dinner, I would not be able to taste it</li>
            <li> But I love that there is no burn and no alcohol.</li>
            <li> Love crest mouthwash because it works.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite flavors Mint.  </li>
            <li> Use it love it.</li>
            <li> I love Crest tooth paste, it works well</li>
            <li> My boyfriend turned me on to the Crest mouthwash and I have to admit, I&#x27;m glad I took his advice.  </li>
            <li> I am glad to have come accross the website , if not I would&#x27;ve been worried out of my mind and thought it mEant</li>
            <li> It does help with my kids&#x27; oral hygiene (better breath), but will update the review if we start experiencing adverse side effects.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash, and the generic Target/Mouthwash identical versions, are hazardous for your enjoyment of good food!  </li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health Multi-protection Clean Mint Rinse is a perfect mouth wash for those with sensitive teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Plus, you&#x27;re able to swish longer for a better clean!</li>
            <li> i liked the taste, mouth felt clean afterwards..</li>
            <li> This mouthwash leaves my mouth feeling clean without the alcohol burn, which is nice.  </li>
            <li> I confess I haven&#x27;t experienced the numbness, loss of sense of taste or tooth staining others have done (though my tongue does turn an interesting shade of lilac for a while after I use it), and I can honestly see where those things would be a big problem.  </li>
            <li> She was able to remove most of the stains, fortunately, and recommended I use Listerine instead.  </li>
            <li> I continue to enjoy the wonderful tastes of all different kinds of meals and have no problems with my teeth turning brown, after 4 years of using this product.</li>
            <li> So, most alcohol free mouthwashes will be antibacterial, and will thus have the possibility of discoloring your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First the good: It does still sting a bit when you use it full strength, but nothing like many of the mouthwashes on the market.  </li>
            <li> Also I love the CLEAN feeling that mouthwashes give you.</li>
            <li> Also I love the CLEAN feeling that mouthwashes give you.</li>
            <li> The Crest Rinse seems like it&#x27;s helping to keep my gums healthy and leaves my teeth feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> Teeth feel fresh and clean, nice taste, doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;burn\\&quot; like listerine.  </li>
            <li> However, I experience an amazing clean feeling right after using Listerine.</li>
            <li> Oh God, I had a sample of this stuff and, while it tasted just fine, afterwards it tastes like there was ass in my mouth for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> Believe me when I tell you, I use no other kind!</li>
            <li> However, both times I have experienced the same side effect: loss of taste.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the lack of alcohol.</li>
            <li> I filled the cap, smelled it, looked at it and just jumped off the cliff and did it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d happily wait to write this until I consult with him, but I only just saw him a bit ago</li>
            <li> and I want a more powerful rinse instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I was told to use an alcohol free mouthwash during my pregnancy.)</li>
            <li> : If the company knows the real statistic, then why are they giving out a misleading statistic about how many customers complain when you ask them how many customers get staining?    </li>
            <li> Going to the dentist is a luxury for me, and a beautiful WHITE smile is a necessity.</li>
            <li> Going to the dentist is a luxury for me, and a beautiful WHITE smile is a necessity.</li>
            <li> If for no other reason, this makes it a good alternative.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health Multiprotection Clean Mint Rinse is a somewhat mild tasting , alcohol free, mouth wash.</li>
            <li> then you&#x27;ll need to get yourself a bottle of Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Clean Mint Rinse today.</li>
            <li> Upon receiving a bottle of Crest Pro-Health Multiprotection Clean Mint Rinse from the Amazon Vine program, I started using it every morning after brushing my teeth, and maybe once in the evening before going out to dinner or socializing.  </li>
            <li> I believe that the crest pro-health multi-protection clean mint rinse created yellowish brown stains on my teeth.</li>
            <li> I am going to compare this product to [[ASIN:B008OVDRAM LISTERINE Ultra Clean Antiseptic Mouthwash]], which is my go-to product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Active ingredients in Listerine:&lt;br /&gt;Eucalyptol 0.092%&lt;br /&gt;Menthol 0.042%&lt;br /&gt;Methyl Salicylate 0.060%&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did not feel clean when using Crest.</li>
            <li> I did not feel clean when using Crest.</li>
            <li> Since 2007 when this came out to replace Listerine it has been receiving many issues by certain people.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I needed it, not because I was super excited about what it could do for me.&lt;br /&gt;Having</li>
            <li> I use Crest Crest Pro Health Cool Wintergreen Mouth Wash, and it does not do this.</li>
            <li> So I actually think thats a good thing.</li>
            <li> But then I come across a website full of  crest pro health rinse complaints.</li>
            <li> I did experiments to see if it was just one type of taste (sweet, salty, etc)</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not painful like Listerine (even though I can take it).</li>
            <li> Its got a nice fresh minty taste but not excessively so like Listerine.</li>
            <li> Their wording, like that of their response to customers, might be technically true but, in my opinion, doesn&#x27;t leave the average reader with an accurate perception of the risks and of the prospects for successful treatment.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;To be honest, I think most mouthwashes are pretty much equal.  </li>
            <li> In other words, if you use this, you run the risk of depriving yourself of one of life&#x27;s great pleasures: tasting food and drink.</li>
            <li> If my mouth feels clean and my breath isn&#x27;t offensive, and I don&#x27;t suffer the torments of the damned while I&#x27;m using the stuff, I consider it a success.  </li>
            <li> my view choose another mouthwash with alcohol as its main fighter, those are said to be much better for your mouth compared to what this product contains.</li>
            <li> I do \\&quot;adequately brush\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> This mouthwash is tremendous if you want to lose weight, you&#x27;ll have no incentive to eat while using it.</li>
            <li> taste\\&quot; with this product got off lucky.  </li>
            <li> I hope my taste buds will continue to recover and by tomorrow morning I should be able to eat like normal again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Glad I researched this early on -- a Web search produces multiple references to the problem -- and was able to dump the product before more damage was done.</li>
            <li> This is hubby&#x27;s new favorite.</li>
            <li> I think it really does the job: without coming on too strong and tasting overpowering, it nevertheless freshens my breath for hours after using it.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t use this because you&#x27;re going on a date and want your mouth to smell pretty!  </li>
            <li> I whitened and brushed and used the rinse more not understanding why they were there!</li>
            <li> I can comfortable rinse this around in my mouth for a good, long, reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> The risk should have been clearly and prominently noted on the bottle.    </li>
            <li> My dental hygienist is thrilled that she doesn&#x27;t have to deal with constant staining.</li>
            <li> Since making the switch from this mouthwash to Listerine, my teeth are staying nice and white.</li>
            <li> and admittedly I rarely used mouthwash before.</li>
            <li> they were a nice light pink.  </li>
            <li> And it does this via an alcohol-free formula, which is a nice plus (alcohol finds its way into my life in enough areas already,</li>
            <li> the Crest mouthwash will keep your mouth feeling fresh and your breath minty for hours compared to Listerine.  </li>
            <li> I love the clean feeling of mouthwash, but have not always been faithful with my daily rinsing because of the burning (and drooling) it causes me.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash really does leave your mouth feeling fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> The product on paper looks good, but I cannot use it due to the side effects.</li>
            <li> I said right off I</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been eating because nothing tastes right (or doesn&#x27;t have any taste at all).  </li>
            <li> use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s 10 pm right now</li>
            <li> and I have some swell on the inside of my right cheek.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a loyal user of Listerine products, so the first thing I realized about the Crest Pro-Health Mint Rinse is that there&#x27;s no bitter or memorable aftertaste.</li>
            <li> Luckily, the dentist was able to polish them off but it totally sucked.</li>
            <li> But the fact that it definitely does a great job (again, without being overpowering) in freshening my breath, is in itself enough of a reason to keep using it!</li>
            <li> But, we received it free to give our opinion and I am liking it so far!</li>
            <li> The taste of this particular mouthwash is pleasant enough and leaves my mouth with a clean enough feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many mouthwashes, and this is nothing like the standard brands that have been around for a while.</li>
            <li> As many others have said, this STRIPPED my sense of taste for TWO WEEKS after only using once!  </li>
            <li> and I actually like it much better from a taste perspective.</li>
            <li> and when I moved it, it literally felt like I just licked a hot curling iron or something.  </li>
            <li> well, I will give it one more try and sure enough, the same problems returned within hours.  </li>
            <li> My toothpaste is white, so I was sure it was not that.</li>
            <li> What all these consumers are complaining about is exactly what I am experiencing.  </li>
            <li> I have used the Crest Pro-health rinse for several years now and there are many things that I like about it, and one that I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This Pro Health mouth rinse really works!  </li>
            <li> I can no longer really taste much of anything, salty or sweet.  </li>
            <li> The funny thing is though,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long lasting effects are perfect for morning use - to get you through the day -- or before bed, when germs can multiply and cause damage, even after brushing.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, if I hadn&#x27;t tried it before I read the other reviews, I might never have tried it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After about two weeks I noticed two dark brown spots forming in between my two front teeth on the top and bottom!</li>
            <li> I was very worried until I came on here and saw that many people had this same reaction.</li>
            <li> It worked much better than the prescription mouthwash, my mouth feels cleaner for longer, and it claims to strengthen the tooth enamel, which in itself would save money in the long run.</li>
            <li> I was ready to spit it out at the first sign of that burn.</li>
            <li> My tongue is super sensitive now.</li>
            <li> But I know there&#x27;s no reason to think it&#x27;s any less effective than a mouthwash with alcohol, which also dries out my mouth.</li>
            <li> but it certainly ruined my taste for a day.  </li>
            <li> I read a fine print on the bottom of the label and it states it MAY cause browning of teeth in some people.&lt;br /&gt;Going online to research this product further</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know what to say.  </li>
            <li> My whole family uses this product and we recommend it.</li>
            <li> I really wish I had read reviews on it before trusting the product, but I bought it in a store without thinking much of it.  </li>
            <li> As for that whole burned tongue thing</li>
            <li> Crest really needs to re-evaluate this line of mouthwashes from the ingredients to the label.</li>
            <li> I switched to Crest Pro-Health for two weeks, and I feel like my gums were a brighter shade of pink and not as healthy.  </li>
            <li> I figure if there are real benefits to using it</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how  much effects it had on my tongue after just one</li>
            <li> I also noticed that my gums were much healthier than they&#x27;ve ever been</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> If you use as much as they tell you to, you&#x27;re going to cruise through this bottle in about a week,</li>
            <li> not so much.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t really think much of the incident until I went to go buy some chili cheese fries.</li>
            <li> The flavor is good too but that brings me to the negative.</li>
            <li> I think my mouth feels really clean, but then again, my tongue has felt kind of weird and nothing has tasted right since I woke up this morning.</li>
            <li> I have to agree with many other reviewers here.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;clean mouth feeling\\&quot; is no different from Listerine.</li>
            <li> The Clean Mint Rinse not only doesn&#x27;t bring the pain with each use, but it&#x27;ll protect your teeth and gums for twenty-four hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> in particular, that it really gives users a leg up on plaque-</li>
            <li> I have always been lucky and had white, straight, no problem teeth</li>
            <li> I use [[ASIN:B001OOLLVS Crest 3d White Advanced Vivid Teeth Whitening Strips]]</li>
            <li> I will in the future, because it is nice-tasting; minty without beeing too sweet or too medicinal.  </li>
            <li> I used it a total of three times, stopped four days ago, and still lack a full range of taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li> But after nearly a month of not being able to taste much and noticing brown stains on my bottom teeth I had to research it, leading me to this and other online reviews.</li>
            <li> Pizza, oatmeal bread, carrots, etc., all made before and enjoyed, tasted bland.  </li>
            <li> I find the main chemical used to fight \\&quot;evil\\</li>
            <li> The label does warn about possible staining but says it can be avoided with \\&quot;adequate brushing\\&quot; or removed with a dental cleaning.  </li>
            <li> The bottle, in a place I didn&#x27;t notice, says, misleadingly in my view, that the staining \\&quot;may be prevented by adequate brushing or removed at your next dental visit\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> forward to Crest Pro Health and this particular mouth wash.</li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t suffered any of the negative effects, as I indicated above, I&#x27;d have to say that Crest isn&#x27;t so great</li>
            <li> This is not permanent or harmful, and may be prevented by adequate brushing or removed at your next dental</li>
            <li> This is not permanent or harmful and may be prevented by adequate brushing or removed at your next dental visit.\\</li>
            <li> This is pretty much the only non-prescription product that has been shown to make much of a difference in this fight.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend NOT buying this product, and on the verge of swearing off Crest products altogether for their lack of concern for the \\&quot;3 percent\\&quot; of people this will happen to, to put a warning on their product for fear of not making money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this one even for kids.</li>
            <li> I thought the loss of taste had something to do with the procedure even though it was highly unusual.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice crisp wintergreen flavor, tending towards overly sweet (but aren&#x27;t they all), non-alcohol base (again, aren&#x27;t they all alcohol free now?).</li>
            <li> Like so many other people, my teeth developed grey-brown stains.</li>
            <li> I just purchased the Crest Pro Health last night August 15, 2012 and used it after brushing, exactly according to directions, and today I cannot taste anything!</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t doubt that side effects can occur with this, it does seem that these reviews are inherently skewed - how many people would take the time to review such a mundane purchase such as mouthwash if their only thoughts on it were that they liked it?</li>
            <li> She then said 99.9% of customers have not complained.</li>
            <li> My GF bought this for me since I was out of my normal wash.</li>
            <li> I thought that the scalding effect on my tongue was just normal and after some time my buds would get used to it.</li>
            <li> Our household is normally a Listerine household.</li>
            <li> The minty taste is long lasting and lets you feel confident.</li>
            <li> I know the dentist says you should always use mouth wash, but to be perfectly honest I have never liked doing it because of the burning sensation that often is associated with them.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the risks, but in the end, you&#x27;re the only one who knows whether you want to take those risks or not.  </li>
            <li> This feeling is absolutely indescribable, and funny actually.</li>
            <li> It leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh without any burning, stinging, or alcoholic flavor.</li>
            <li> Well some people talked me into buying this out as it was a new non burning mouthwash they found.</li>
            <li> The new trend in mouthwash is \\&quot;antibacterial/antimicrobial\\&quot; mouth wash.</li>
            <li> Being one of the fortunate ones lets me move on to the good and the bad as I see them.  </li>
            <li> simply put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that you don&#x27;t get the same \\&quot;cool breath\\&quot; feel, but as long as it feels clean, who cares?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I use rinses like this it feels more mental than physical</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product at Costco here in Los Angeles---used it for three years with none of the effects mentioned in some other \\&quot;reviews\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> To my surprise, this Crest Pro-Health rinse was exactly what I used at my ortho office earlier!  </li>
            <li> My husband loves this; he says it makes his muth feel, \\&quot;fresh.\\&quot;  It is a little strong for me, though...</li>
            <li> But there is evidence that the active ingredient in it does have a clinically significant effect.  </li>
            <li> I felt a strange tingling on my tongue right away, but figured it was doing it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> /&gt;My gums are a constant problem, and will turn red if I don&#x27;t brush for two full minutes twice a day, floss, and use a mouth rinse.  </li>
            <li> trust that the product&#x27;s other stated claims are true-</li>
            <li> Luckily I haven&#x27;t experienced the brown stains on my teeth like a lot of people, but losing my sens of taste is bad enough.</li>
            <li> Like many others I have experienced some horrific teeth stains from using this product.  </li>
            <li> After only a couple weeks I look like I have been a tobacco user for my whole life.  </li>
            <li> Crest offers refunds on their products, so I mailed in the receipt and UPC from the bottle.</li>
            <li> What really concerned me though was the accumulation in my mouth of a slimy, gooey white gunk which appeared as soon as I began using this mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> I just returned home from a dental visit to have stains (developed since my purchase) removed.</li>
            <li> so it wasn&#x27;t really supposed to taste like anything , but then later as I got the munchies for a snack, I reached for some nutella.</li>
            <li> but I recently developed some allergies</li>
            <li> I used this product twice, once at night and then again the next morning, and I noticed all day that I couldn&#x27;t really taste anything.</li>
            <li> I bought this crap once because of an awesome coupon I got...biggest mistake ever!!  </li>
            <li> it would really help me stay on top of my oral hygiene game.</li>
            <li> I would love for Crest to pay for my cleaning that I now need due to their product!!!!</li>
            <li> This tingling sensation is really mild and doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> On the Pro side, it tastes fine and really doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;burn\\&quot; like other brands (even other Crests).</li>
            <li> so I am OK with a little burn for the first few seconds.  </li>
            <li> My teeth end up feeling far less clean, my breath less fresh and EVERYTHING tastes like soap for hours and hours afterwards.</li>
            <li> This past week I have not been able to taste food from the middle of my tongue to the tip..</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t seem to taste anything sweet, salty or savory, only bitter.</li>
            <li> Our dentist actually recommended this product to us, particularly because our oldest son just got braces.</li>
            <li> I should say that, despite using a good toothpaste, a sonic toothbrush, floss, a Waterpik-type device, and an expensive prescription mouthwash, my problems with plaque and tartar, which my hygienist thinks I inherited, are such that my insurer and I have had to pay for professional cleaning and descaling every three months, rather than every six months.</li>
            <li> My spouse was slow to open his own bottle, but began to use it after hearing me rave, and has used it religiously ever since, so</li>
            <li> Apparently, there is some ingredient in it that literally stains your teeth!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Crest Pro-Health Multiprotection Clean Mint Rinse isn&#x27;t bad, but there are others I like better.</li>
            <li> used it only 3 times so far and lost my taste for 3 weeks since I used&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It apparently has additional ingredients to improve the functionality of the product.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when I realized that I could barely taste anything.</li>
            <li> I have no great love of spearmint and that&#x27;s what this rinse is.</li>
            <li> I use this right after brushing and after gargling for a couple minutes, I can visibly see the dead plaque/</li>
            <li> I told him the only thing I did differently today was using the mouthwash by the sink - they normally had a different brand.  </li>
            <li> Now I have replaced it back to my old mouthwash and hopefully after my next dentist appointment my teeth should be getting a brighter color.</li>
            <li> In those 2 years, I havent had a single new cavity.  </li>
            <li> If you have a small mouth like mine, you might even be able to use less.</li>
            <li> I used it off and on for the next month and noticed for the first time in my life that my teeth began turning slightly brown despite my not changing my dental hygiene in any way except for using this Crest mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> We have been using this product for a couple of months, and none of us in the family have experienced the numb tongue or altered taste issue mentioned by other reviewers, but we are continuing to evaluate.  </li>
            <li> ;  Apparently I was the second person they saw that had this issue.  </li>
            <li> looked online and apparently a lot of people have had similar problems!&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT USE THIS!!!</li>
            <li> I used this rinse for a few weeks, and after the first week or two, I noticed that my teeth were covered with brown stains.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this on Amazon, but on impulse as my local grocery had a deep discount on some apparent closeouts.     </li>
            <li> /&gt;Because I didn&#x27;t have enough the first go round, I assumed it was a fluke, so I rinsed again.</li>
            <li> The price seems a bit much for mouthwash that does the same as my other ones, except on a stronger more distasteful level.</li>
            <li> I was glad to get the chance to try it, as we usually buy the green color mouthwashes (spearmint) instead of blue (peppermint).  </li>
            <li> After only a few days of using this new mouthwash, I noticed a big difference in the amount of buildup on my teeth, both in terms of new deposits (none) and in the effectiveness of my toothbrush in removing deposits that I had thought only a dental visit would remedy.</li>
            <li> I have only used this crest product twice recently (once at night, and once the morning after) and at first I didn&#x27;t notice anything strange since I had eaten a very bland cereal</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s coated on my tongue, so that my entire tongue is blue, and when I try to rinse / brush my mouth out, it creates a strange foam out of nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use a Braun Oral B power toothbrush at least 2x daily, floss daily, and my dentist jokes that I don&#x27;t leave him much to do on my annual cleaning.     </li>
            <li> I usually use this once a day in the morning before brushing my teeth so maybe thats why I dont see the stains as much.</li>
            <li> In fact there was a flat chemically taste while rinsing and the chemical taste stayed for 30 minutes</li>
            <li> I think the reviews on here are probably a little (very?) skewed towards the negatives, since people are more likely to come on here after they notice bad things happening.</li>
            <li> My teeth didn&#x27;t turn brown from it, I didn&#x27;t loose my sense of taste the next day and my mother&#x27;s hair didn&#x27;t curl up from it...  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Listerine burns because of the high alcoholic content (</li>
            <li> CPC stays in the mouth for long periods of time which allows the rinse to provide its 12-hour benefit.</li>
            <li> pls comment, how long it took</li>
            <li> I have a strange chemical feeling on my tongue and gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a long time</li>
            <li> I no longer feel this strange sensation on my tongue</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also seems to do the job it&#x27;s meant to do, though I suspect that the larger issues of plaque and gingivitis are going to be harder to evaluate since those are both long term and dependent upon</li>
            <li> other thing I don&#x27;t like about Crest Pro-Health is that when you spit it out, it leaves blue clumps of residue on your sink, or wherever you spit it out.  </li>
            <li> I hope I get my taste back soon as other users have.</li>
            <li> Seriously type in Crest Pro-Health complaints and get ready to be amazed.....or horrified.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are whiter, my gums are healthy and my breath is fresh-- without the horrible stinging and burning of Listerine.  </li>
            <li> (just do a search for staining related to the active ingredient, Cetylpyridinium Chloride).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first I thought there was something wrong with the nutella because I could barely taste anything</li>
            <li> Changes in the taste of food typically go away shortly after you stop using the product.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not a big difference, but a slight difference.  </li>
            <li> I poured half a capfull and tossed it back.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t get the typical \\&quot;burn\\&quot; of regular mouthwash, but you do feel a bit of a tingling sensation in your mouth afterwards.</li>
            <li> SOMETHING IS DEFINITELY WRONG WITH THIS MOUTHWASH, AND AT A MINIMUM, THE FDA SHOULD DEMAND IT BE REMOVED FROM STORE&#x27;S SHELVES UNTIL ADEQUATE TESTING CAN BE DONE.  </li>
            <li> and well the first things that show up on google are some very serious diseases and illnesses like Alzheimer&#x27;s</li>
            <li> No alcohol burn, no bad aftertastes, and none of the weird side effects noted by the other reviewer.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health doesn&#x27;t burn at all, and only freshens your breath a little bit.  </li>
            <li> Close inspection of my teeth shows little blue globs of this mouthwash was hanging out all over the place.</li>
            <li> I would use the mouthwash at night, and my sense of taste was affectedly negatively throughout the entire next day.</li>
            <li> I Googled my problem and came across a few helpful articles with similar stories.</li>
            <li> Crest seems to imply that the staining is partially attributable to inadequate dental hygiene.</li>
            <li> I tried eating coffee ice cream for lunch and it was bitter and vile tasting.  </li>
            <li> and I think I have a mental hurdle that if it&#x27;s not burning, it&#x27;s not working.</li>
            <li> I was, as expected, hesitant to try it.</li>
            <li> but I am not really a mouthwash person at all.  </li>
            <li> The flavor (and burn) is not nearly as intense, but don&#x27;t let this fool</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago I was at my dentist&#x27;s for my semi-annual cleaning and the hygienist started asking me if I started drinking coffee, smoking, drinking lots of red wine because my teeth were extremely stained.  </li>
            <li> Note: a little goes a long way with this mouthwash.</li>
            <li> &quot; I also tried posting a review for the product on Crest&#x27;s site, however, it never appeared with the other reviews.</li>
            <li> Not the staining but the other thing.</li>
            <li> As usual, I brushed and flossed my teeth</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell where the stains were coming from until I read some of the other comments on this page.</li>
            <li> Like another popular brand, Crest Pro Health Mouth Wash kills 99% of common germs that can cause plaque, gingivitis and bad breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this crap is still on the market considering how many other complaints I have found on the internet alone.</li>
            <li> ive used other crest pro health items and been less than enthralled with the products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I find it hard to eat anything up to two hours later, as the taste lingers and lingers and lingers, and makes almost anything you put in your mouth taste</li>
            <li> But for the past few years, Crest Pro-Health has been making mouth washes that do not make you endure the unpleasant burning sensation that most dental rinses have.  </li>
            <li> There is a linger taste that really ruins food/beverage taste.</li>
            <li> It got to the point they were so dark</li>
            <li> Stopped for four days and my sense of taste slowly came back.  </li>
            <li> It felt like my tongue had a giant thick blister over</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m eating crackers with a sour cream dip</li>
            <li> so I have always been really careful about flossing/brushing/rinsing everyday to keep them that way.</li>
            <li> I went to the dentist today, and they narrowed it down to this Crest rinse I started using.</li>
            <li> Also it seems this chemical CPC can cause odd taste affects to users which I don&#x27;t get.</li>
            <li> Less than one-tenth of 1% of people... have raised this concern.\\&quot;     </li>
            <li> it was odd</li>
            <li> This was odd.</li>
            <li> This product from Crest tastes and feels like a typical mouthwash product.</li>
            <li> These alcohol-free mouthwashes tend to leave a weird, dryish feeling in my mouth, particularly on my tongue.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t rinse this residue down the drain, it will dry and it is really hard to scrub off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do, however, have a minor plaque problem -- mostly brushing thoroughly takes care of the worst of it -- and no gingivitis.  </li>
            <li> It did burn a little</li>
            <li> It hurts, I can&#x27;t taste anything and what little bit I can taste is metallic.  </li>
            <li> On the Con side, it&#x27;s a little pricey</li>
            <li> and I can taste a little bit of peanut butter.  </li>
            <li> Also, everything did taste a little metallic.</li>
            <li> So I get home and decide to do a little research and google \\&quot;loss of taste\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I made a pumpkin cake that we previously thought (twice) was amazing, and it tasted horribly metallic.  </li>
            <li> Oral Care Products containing CPC, the active ingredient in Crest Pro-Health Rinse, may cause a temporary aftertaste or temporary change in the taste of food in a small percentage of people.</li>
            <li> I used this for a few days and it caused brown staining on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of this stuff about six months ago and used it for a few days and found that it affected the way food tasted.  </li>
            <li> Killed my sense of taste, like the tip of my tongue was burned.  </li>
            <li> This stuff killed my sense of taste.</li>
            <li> The other common type of mouthwash is antiseptic mouthwash, and it uses alcohol.</li>
            <li> This was followed by a weekend of very bland food.</li>
            <li> I will be pouring my rather expensive bottle of blue chemicals down the drain.</li>
            <li> but the \\&quot;burn\\&quot; is a lot that kills the bad breath for real.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me I started noticing my teeth were getting a brown coloring after only one week of use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what to do now, but I will never buy this product again.</li>
            <li> they know this is a possibility, it should be easier to obtain a refund if you are not satisfied.</li>
            <li> I would say that you probably should give it a test try with a small bottle to see how you react to it, then if you&#x27;re one of us who has no issues, go for the multipacks.</li>
            <li> I am really not sure how in the heck</li>
            <li> For the past 40 years, all of my dentists have complimented me on how well I have taken care of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what the people here are complaining about.</li>
            <li> I picked it up when the market didn&#x27;t have my usual Listerine.</li>
            <li> I am not sure I will switch to this brand as we are a lister one household.</li>
            <li> I have been using Listerine for years (the green mint flavor that burns like fire!)</li>
            <li> I use it twice per day, and just have not experienced the staining or other issues.  </li>
            <li> but I tried peanut butter, plain salt and sugar on my tongue - NOTHING!  </li>
            <li> Its been documented that in a small group of individuals, the Cetylpyridinium chloride 0.07% makes your teeth look like you been chewing tobacco for years (a hard brown-yellow shade)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A LITTLE BIT ON THE INTERNET AND THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS AND COMMENTS WILL ASTOUND YOU!</li>
            <li> I STRONGLY recommend against using this terrible product.</li>
            <li> I ended up loosing 15 pounds in two months because the new taste of food just make me absolutely sick.  </li>
            <li> And my dentist worked hard at getting the stains off, but he didn&#x27;t get it all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned a hard lesson</li>
            <li> This is hardly a scientific study, by the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I can hardly taste anything.</li>
            <li> I was a little confused</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t* want to hear the number of people who have complained.</li>
            <li> I used the clear \\&quot;dye-free\\&quot; version and started to notice ugly brown stains that are not removed with vigorous brushing.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give it negative stars.</li>
            <li> I used the stuff one time and for at least two months it felt like my tongue was burned and everything tasted like it was coated in aluminum and solvents.  </li>
            <li> AFTER SEEING ALL THE NEGATIVE COMMENTS ABOUT THIS MOUTHWASH, ISN&#x27;T</li>
            <li> THE MANUFACTURER EVEN THE LEAST BIT CONCERNED?  </li>
            <li> have complained of, but that makes me worry about what&#x27;s in this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and when I came on line to find out if this is a common problem, lo and behold, here it is.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be a common problem.  </li>
            <li> &quot; This is a common side effect of antibacterial mouthwash.</li>
            <li> Put it away and then decided to try it again and have used it for the past four days and cannot taste my food!  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice anything too horrible at first, my tongue and gums were a little bit sore.</li>
            <li> They told me and others: \\&quot;[staining] is reported by a very small percentage of people.</li>
            <li> Needless to say the rest is going down the drain.  </li>
            <li> Refunds can be given for a bad product, but I want my taste back!</li>
            <li> The comments here and otherwise confirm to me that I&#x27;m not crazy; this stuff doesn&#x27;t affect everyone but for those it does, it&#x27;s TERRIBLE.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not a pleasant experience</li>
            <li> Food is just bland and tasteless.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn like some mouth washes, but it did seem to make my mouth feel a little numb.</li>
            <li> but, after using it for two weeks, it never did--it just got worse.  </li>
            <li> I can not recommend this product to anyone as the aftertaste is SO much worse than cranberry juice that I&#x27;d rather rinse cranberry juice.</li>
            <li> You use this if your gums are bleeding and you want to fight gingivitis and worse.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Exactly how much difference this product can make isn&#x27;t terribly well established.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit outraged that the bottle doesn&#x27;t warn you of the seriousness of the risk, even if it only happens to a minority of users.</li>
            <li> Personally I have not noticed any loss of my sense of taste that others have mentioned, but the stains are downright disgusting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while now and haven&#x27;t noticed any ill effects.</li>
            <li> It randomly crossed my mind:  </li>
            <li> I would use it at night and wake up in the morning with the same disgusting taste.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dental coverage, and the dentist is too expensive to pay for damages caused by a mouthwash.</li>
            <li> They kept getting worse, it was like they appeared in a matter of days!</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I will not be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I did not have a bad experience from it.  </li>
            <li> Washes with alcohol made my tongue go numb, so I decided to give an alcohol-free version a try</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s even worse!!  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t have any unpleasant taste or feeling to</li>
            <li> When I began using Crest Pro-Health mouthwash, it did leave an awful taste in my mouth for hours, and also seemed to take away my ability to taste things for at least six to eight hours.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this mouth wash for awhile now and have nothing bad to say about it.</li>
            <li> since it does not have the painful effect, I always wondering if it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> Stupid me, I thought,</li>
            <li> THIS CRAP TURNED MY TEETH,</li>
            <li> I HATE TO HAVE</li>
            <li> There is no alcohol base</li>
            <li> you hate that burning flavor that they try to market this rinse might be for you, but not all the alcohol-based rinses burn as described.&lt;br</li>
            <li> That just made my food very unpleasant.</li>
            <li> The spouse loves it, but it burns so bad for me!</li>
            <li> YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED!</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed in this and would stop others from buying it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s disgusting.  </li>
            <li> I CANNOT EMPHASIZE HOW MUCH I HATE THIS PRODUCT!  </li>
            <li> I, too, have had a terrible experience with this product -- I thought I must have burned my tongue.  </li>
            <li> This product is horrible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s horrible!</li>
            <li> This mouthwash is terrible for aftertaste.</li>
            <li> Oh my god, I literally can&#x27;t even describe how awful this stuff is.</li>
            <li> It was awful, not even whitening strips could get rid of them.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> OK...it&#x27;s a mouthwash....I don&#x27;t really know what to say.  My teeth didn&#x27;t turn brown from it, I didn&#x27;t loose my sense of taste the next day and my mother&#x27;s hair didn&#x27;t curl up from it...  jk.  Seriously, I did not have a bad experience from it.  It did burn a little but I haven&#x27;t had a mouthwash that didn&#x27;t.  I always feel that the burning is killing the bacteria so I am OK with a little burn for the first few seconds.  I don&#x27;t think my teeth are any whiter or cleaner but I can say that my mouth feels fresher after using it.  : )</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health Multiprotection Rinse has a good flavor and works well. It leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh without any burning, stinging, or alcoholic flavor. I&#x27;ve tried many mouthwashes, and this is nothing like the standard brands that have been around for a while. The Crest Rinse seems like it&#x27;s helping to keep my gums healthy and leaves my teeth feeling clean and smooth. These bottles are really large, which is great because it lasts quite a while. My whole family uses this product and we recommend it.</li>
            <li> Well some people talked me into buying this out as it was a new non burning mouthwash they found. Unfortunately for me I started noticing my teeth were getting a brown coloring after only one week of use. I read a fine print on the bottom of the label and it states it MAY cause browning of teeth in some people.&lt;br /&gt;Going online to research this product further I find the main chemical used to fight \\&quot;evil\\&quot; bacteria is actually found in some pesticides. Also it seems this chemical CPC can cause odd taste affects to users which I don&#x27;t get. Since 2007 when this came out to replace Listerine it has been receiving many issues by certain people. I belong to one group of users whose teeth become tobacco chewing color stained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gets 1 star from me as it may have no burn in your mouth feel but it MAY cost you some issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my view choose another mouthwash with alcohol as its main fighter, those are said to be much better for your mouth compared to what this product contains. Now I have replaced it back to my old mouthwash and hopefully after my next dentist appointment my teeth should be getting a brighter color.</li>
            <li> Like many others I have experienced some horrific teeth stains from using this product.  After only a couple weeks I look like I have been a tobacco user for my whole life.  I really wish I had read reviews on it before trusting the product, but I bought it in a store without thinking much of it.  Why would you ever expect a mouthwash to stain your teeth brown?  As always, hindsight is 20/20.  Personally I have not noticed any loss of my sense of taste that others have mentioned, but the stains are downright disgusting.</li>
            <li> I used this for a few days and it caused brown staining on my teeth.  The label does warn about possible staining but says it can be avoided with \\&quot;adequate brushing\\&quot; or removed with a dental cleaning.  I do \\&quot;adequately brush\\&quot;.  I would love for Crest to pay for my cleaning that I now need due to their product!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product years ago, and recently bought it again to give it a second chance. However, both times I have experienced the same side effect: loss of taste. I would use the mouthwash at night, and my sense of taste was affectedly negatively throughout the entire next day. Nothing tasted the way it should, to the point that I couldn&#x27;t even finish eating it. Crest offers refunds on their products, so I mailed in the receipt and UPC from the bottle. Over a month later, the mail was returned to me saying, \\&quot;P.O. Box Close.\\&quot; I also tried posting a review for the product on Crest&#x27;s site, however, it never appeared with the other reviews. It contained no slander; only an objective review of my experience. I&#x27;m not sure what to do now, but I will never buy this product again. I wanted to let people know that experiencing loss of taste is a possibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crest&#x27;s website even includes the following information in their FAQ&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Crest Pro-Health Rinse does not cause permanent taste alteration. Oral Care Products containing CPC, the active ingredient in Crest Pro-Health Rinse, may cause a temporary aftertaste or temporary change in the taste of food in a small percentage of people. CPC stays in the mouth for long periods of time which allows the rinse to provide its 12-hour benefit. Changes in the taste of food typically go away shortly after you stop using the product.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they know this is a possibility, it should be easier to obtain a refund if you are not satisfied.</li>
            <li> I think the reviews on here are probably a little (very?) skewed towards the negatives, since people are more likely to come on here after they notice bad things happening. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while now and haven&#x27;t noticed any ill effects. I enjoy the lack of alcohol. I would say that you probably should give it a test try with a small bottle to see how you react to it, then if you&#x27;re one of us who has no issues, go for the multipacks.</li>
            <li> Here I thought I was doing something so wonderful for my mouth and teeth and now I have brown stains in between teeth! Beware!</li>
            <li> As many others have said, this STRIPPED my sense of taste for TWO WEEKS after only using once!  This shouldn&#x27;t even be allowed on the market.  Do not buy!</li>
            <li> Like so many other people, my teeth developed grey-brown stains. I had no idea that this product was probably the cause. The risk should have been clearly and prominently noted on the bottle.    They told me and others: \\&quot;[staining] is reported by a very small percentage of people. Less than one-tenth of 1% of people... have raised this concern.\\&quot;     That might lead you to think that only one in a thousand people experience stains. But according to a story posted at newsinferno.com dated August 24, 2009 \\&quot;Proctor &amp; Gamble has said that 3 percent of all Crest Pro-Health users will experience such staining.\\&quot; That&#x27;s one in 33 customers (if you believe Proctor &amp; Gamble). Which raises a question: If the company knows the real statistic, then why are they giving out a misleading statistic about how many customers complain when you ask them how many customers get staining?    The bottle, in a place I didn&#x27;t notice, says, misleadingly in my view, that the staining \\&quot;may be prevented by adequate brushing or removed at your next dental visit\\&quot;. I brush for several minutes a day - is that not \\&quot;adequate\\&quot;? And my dentist worked hard at getting the stains off, but he didn&#x27;t get it all. Their wording, like that of their response to customers, might be technically true but, in my opinion, doesn&#x27;t leave the average reader with an accurate perception of the risks and of the prospects for successful treatment.    I called the company (1-800-285-9139) and asked for the staining statistics. I said right off I *don&#x27;t* want to hear the number of people who have complained. The rep went away, then came back. She then said 99.9% of customers have not complained. I said that wasn&#x27;t my question - I want to know what percentage of people get stains. She said research showed there was no difference in staining between their product and a control group, but she couldn&#x27;t cite the research. She said I could find the study at dentalcare dot com in the section for professionals. I looked. Didn&#x27;t find it.</li>
            <li> Every time I use this mouthwash I taste soap for hours afterward, everything tastes like soap.  It&#x27;s disgusting.  It gets two stars because it lives up to the no burn of alcohol claim.</li>
            <li> I bought this mouthwash about 2 weeks ago. I felt a strange tingling on my tongue right away, but figured it was doing it&#x27;s job. This past week I have not been able to taste food from the middle of my tongue to the tip.. Just on the back of my tongue. I Googled my problem and came across a few helpful articles with similar stories. Luckily I haven&#x27;t experienced the brown stains on my teeth like a lot of people, but losing my sens of taste is bad enough. I highly recommend NOT buying this product, and on the verge of swearing off Crest products altogether for their lack of concern for the \\&quot;3 percent\\&quot; of people this will happen to, to put a warning on their product for fear of not making money. If I could I would give this ZERO stars. BUYER BEWARE.</li>
            <li> I used this rinse for a few weeks, and after the first week or two, I noticed that my teeth were covered with brown stains. Nothing in my diet, lifestyle, or hygiene had changed, so I waited to see if they&#x27;d disappear, but they haven&#x27;t. I went to the dentist today, and they narrowed it down to this Crest rinse I started using. The problem is well-documented in the dental community and online (just do a search for staining related to the active ingredient, Cetylpyridinium Chloride).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only way to get rid of the stains, especially between teeth, is an ultrasonic cleaning by my dentist (a regular cleaning today wasn&#x27;t sufficient), which will put me back $125. I&#x27;m a bit outraged that the bottle doesn&#x27;t warn you of the seriousness of the risk, even if it only happens to a minority of users.</li>
            <li> Crest seems to imply that the staining is partially attributable to inadequate dental hygiene. I use a Braun Oral B power toothbrush at least 2x daily, floss daily, and my dentist jokes that I don&#x27;t leave him much to do on my annual cleaning.     Well, this product sure reversed that. I used the clear \\&quot;dye-free\\&quot; version and started to notice ugly brown stains that are not removed with vigorous brushing. Glad I researched this early on -- a Web search produces multiple references to the problem -- and was able to dump the product before more damage was done.</li>
            <li> My GF bought this for me since I was out of my normal wash. I used it once this morning at about 7am. It&#x27;s now 7pm and I still can&#x27;t taste anything. I tried eating coffee ice cream for lunch and it was bitter and vile tasting.  I can&#x27;t seem to taste anything sweet, salty or savory, only bitter. This mouthwash is tremendous if you want to lose weight, you&#x27;ll have no incentive to eat while using it.</li>
            <li> I tried Crest Pro-Health a week ago for two days and it dramatically affected my taste of food and drink.  Stopped for four days and my sense of taste slowly came back.  Tried it again today and again sense of taste dramatically changed.  Cannot taste salt at all.  The product on paper looks good, but I cannot use it due to the side effects.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m beginning to suspect there might be a lot of dentists writing some of the reviews here :) I&#x27;ve used this stuff for about 2 years now. In those 2 years, I havent had a single new cavity.  I use this right after brushing and after gargling for a couple minutes, I can visibly see the dead plaque/bacteria daisy chained in clumps when I spit it out.  No loss in taste at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*update*  I have since switched to Colgate Total&#x27;s mouth wash and I actually like it much better from a taste perspective. I was also worried the Crest was staining my teeth.</li>
            <li> The reviewer that said they experienced \\&quot;no taste\\&quot; with this product got off lucky.  THIS CRAP TURNED MY TEETH, THE BOTTOM PORTIONS ESPECIALLY, A BROWNISH YELLOW.  It has been documented that this product does that to everybody and this should be pulled from the shelves!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this on Amazon, but on impulse as my local grocery had a deep discount on some apparent closeouts.     I should say that, despite using a good toothpaste, a sonic toothbrush, floss, a Waterpik-type device, and an expensive prescription mouthwash, my problems with plaque and tartar, which my hygienist thinks I inherited, are such that my insurer and I have had to pay for professional cleaning and descaling every three months, rather than every six months. After only a few days of using this new mouthwash, I noticed a big difference in the amount of buildup on my teeth, both in terms of new deposits (none) and in the effectiveness of my toothbrush in removing deposits that I had thought only a dental visit would remedy. It worked much better than the prescription mouthwash, my mouth feels cleaner for longer, and it claims to strengthen the tooth enamel, which in itself would save money in the long run. My spouse was slow to open his own bottle, but began to use it after hearing me rave, and has used it religiously ever since, so I know he likes it, too.    Note: a little goes a long way with this mouthwash. There is a two teaspoon measure on the bottom of the inside of the cap, and that, twice a day, is all that is needed. If you have a small mouth like mine, you might even be able to use less.</li>
            <li> Burned tongue and it turns out I&#x27;m not alone!  Washes with alcohol made my tongue go numb, so I decided to give an alcohol-free version a try and it&#x27;s even worse!!  It feels like I scalded my tongue, I have no taste. My tongue is super sensitive now. I don&#x27;t want anything to touch it, food included.  My husband has had no problems, but I&#x27;m officially done with commercial mouthwashes, perhaps I&#x27;ll swish with some salt-water.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product. I wish I could give it negative stars. This mouthwash caused brown stains on my lower teeth along the gum line for years. I didn&#x27;t know what was causing it and had to visit my dental hygienist 4 times a year to have the stains removed using a cavitron. I worked with my hygienist to try and determine the cause but she couldn&#x27;t figure to out either. Started looking at Amazon to purchase all my hygiene needs and came across the reviews for this product. I then realized that this product was the cause of this issue that had plagued me for several years. I switched to Act and the stains haven&#x27;t come back. I now visit my dental hygienist 2 times a year instead of 4. My dental hygienist is thrilled that she doesn&#x27;t have to deal with constant staining. I can&#x27;t believe Crest sells a product like this. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED!</li>
            <li> used it only 3 times so far and lost my taste for 3 weeks since I used&lt;br /&gt;I have not yet gained back my taste sensation and hoping that I&#x27;ll regain it back&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyonw, who regained the sensation...pls comment, how long it took</li>
            <li> I used this rinse twice a day for about 3 or 4 months.  I started to notice my teeth turning darker all around, though more noticeably around the edges.  A few weeks ago I was at my dentist&#x27;s for my semi-annual cleaning and the hygienist started asking me if I started drinking coffee, smoking, drinking lots of red wine because my teeth were extremely stained.  I mentioned that I had been using this mouthwash and she immediately shook her head and said &amp;#34;That&#x27;s it.&amp;#34;  Apparently I was the second person they saw that had this issue.  She was able to remove most of the stains, fortunately, and recommended I use Listerine instead.  Since making the switch from this mouthwash to Listerine, my teeth are staying nice and white.</li>
            <li> I HAVE TO WRITE THIS TO REPORT MY EXPERIENCE WITH THIS PRODUCT.  I HAVE USED IT FOR THREE YEARS WITH NO SIDE EFFECTS OR STAINS OR LOSS OF TASTE...AT ALL.  I originally bought this product at Costco here in Los Angeles---used it for three years with none of the effects mentioned in some other \\&quot;reviews\\&quot;.  Then this week I ran out so I went to Costco to buy some more.  None of it was at Costco so I purchased Scope with about 14% alcohol.  THE SCOPE WITH THE ALCOHOL BURNED MY TONGUE!!!  So, I ordered the Crest, this product under review, from Amazon as Costco doesn&#x27;t carry it anymore. That&#x27;s when I realized that SCOPE BURNS MY TONGUE!!!  UGGG...I HATE TO HAVE MY TONGUE FEEL LIKE IT IS BURNING!!!  That&#x27;s my honest experience with the product.  Of course I can&#x27;t guarantee you will have the same experience that I had..but this is my honest experience with the product.</li>
            <li> I bought this crap once because of an awesome coupon I got...biggest mistake ever!!  I used the stuff one time and for at least two months it felt like my tongue was burned and everything tasted like it was coated in aluminum and solvents.  I ended up loosing 15 pounds in two months because the new taste of food just make me absolutely sick.  As for that whole burned tongue thing it was odd and I can&#x27;t explain it.  It felt like my tongue had a giant thick blister over it&#x27;s entire surface and when I moved it, it literally felt like I just licked a hot curling iron or something.  I am really not sure how in the heck this crap is still on the market considering how many other complaints I have found on the internet alone. Seriously type in Crest Pro-Health complaints and get ready to be amazed.....or horrified.  Either way it shouldn&#x27;t be on the market any longer.</li>
            <li> No alcohol burn, no bad aftertastes, and none of the weird side effects noted by the other reviewer. I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 years, and I still have all my tastebuds. :-)</li>
            <li> I have always taken great care when it comes to my dental hygiene. For the past 40 years, all of my dentists have complimented me on how well I have taken care of my teeth.  When I began using Crest Pro-Health mouthwash, it did leave an awful taste in my mouth for hours, and also seemed to take away my ability to taste things for at least six to eight hours.  What really concerned me though was the accumulation in my mouth of a slimy, gooey white gunk which appeared as soon as I began using this mouthwash.  This gunk would appear throughout my mouth, especially in the bottom of my gumlines, roof of my mouth, tongue, etc.  I kept using it thinking my mouth had to adjust to this stuff but, after using it for two weeks, it never did--it just got worse.  I stopped using it and all of the above problems immediately disappeared.  Stupid me, I thought, well, I will give it one more try and sure enough, the same problems returned within hours.  I used it off and on for the next month and noticed for the first time in my life that my teeth began turning slightly brown despite my not changing my dental hygiene in any way except for using this Crest mouthwash.  I stopped using it again, and, like before, the problems immediately disappeard.  However, this time I thoroughly research it on the interent, and found hundreds of comments from users like myself experiencing the same problems.  IN SUMMARY;  DIDN&#x27;T THE MANUFACTURER EVERY TEST THIS PRODUCT BEFORE PUTTING IT OUT ON THE MARKET?  AFTER SEEING ALL THE NEGATIVE COMMENTS ABOUT THIS MOUTHWASH, ISN&#x27;T THE MANUFACTURER EVEN THE LEAST BIT CONCERNED?  SOMETHING IS DEFINITELY WRONG WITH THIS MOUTHWASH, AND AT A MINIMUM, THE FDA SHOULD DEMAND IT BE REMOVED FROM STORE&#x27;S SHELVES UNTIL ADEQUATE TESTING CAN BE DONE.  I CANNOT EMPHASIZE HOW MUCH I HATE THIS PRODUCT!  DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, USE THIS PRODUCT.  RESEARCH IT A LITTLE BIT ON THE INTERNET AND THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS AND COMMENTS WILL ASTOUND YOU!</li>
            <li> Do not use Crest Pro-Health Rinse or toothpaste! I just used the rinse and cannot taste anything. After Googling it I have found that not only does it cause taste lose while using the product but it also causes staining. I cannot believe this product is still on the market! If I don&#x27;t have taste back by tonight I&#x27;m going to freak out.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash, and the generic Target/Mouthwash identical versions, are hazardous for your enjoyment of good food!  My husband did some great research about oral health, so we were both inspired.  He switched to Listerine for gingivitus, so I thought I&#x27;d use up his Pro-Health mouthwash, and started using it twice a day.  Big mistake.  I made a pumpkin cake that we previously thought (twice) was amazing, and it tasted horribly metallic.  I thought, maybe it&#x27;s my baking soda, so I switched brands, but the cookies I made the next day also tasted metallic.  Pizza, oatmeal bread, carrots, etc., all made before and enjoyed, tasted bland.  It randomly crossed my mind:  Is this mouthwash affecting my taste?  And then I found hundreds of people online with the same problem.  I believe that it is the mouthwash, and I wanted to add - stay away from the generic copycat - it does the same thing.</li>
            <li> I have to agree with many other reviewers here.  I bought a bottle of this stuff about six months ago and used it for a few days and found that it affected the way food tasted.  Put it away and then decided to try it again and have used it for the past four days and cannot taste my food!  Haven&#x27;t been eating because nothing tastes right (or doesn&#x27;t have any taste at all).  There should be something on the bottle about his because I have used many, many kinds of mouthwashes and NONE of them have ever done this to my mouth.  SUGGESTION:  Use this product if you want to lose weight because it will definately take the pleasure out of eating!</li>
            <li> LOVE this mouthwash - no burn, tastes great, keeps my breath fresh! I continue to enjoy the wonderful tastes of all different kinds of meals and have no problems with my teeth turning brown, after 4 years of using this product. While I don&#x27;t doubt that side effects can occur with this, it does seem that these reviews are inherently skewed - how many people would take the time to review such a mundane purchase such as mouthwash if their only thoughts on it were that they liked it?</li>
            <li> Killed my sense of taste, like the tip of my tongue was burned.  And stained my teeth too.  I can&#x27;t believe this stuff is still on the market !!  Back to Listerine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about three weeks since I bought this and admittedly I rarely used mouthwash before. I thought that the scalding effect on my tongue was just normal and after some time my buds would get used to it. But after nearly a month of not being able to taste much and noticing brown stains on my bottom teeth I had to research it, leading me to this and other online reviews. For a bottle that promises so many pros it would have been real nice to have a more accurate idea of what the cons were. Crest really needs to re-evaluate this line of mouthwashes from the ingredients to the label. Was very disappointed in this and would stop others from buying it.</li>
            <li> I just purchased the Crest Pro Health last night August 15, 2012 and used it after brushing, exactly according to directions, and today I cannot taste anything! My tongue feels as if it has been scalded.  I plan to contact the company for a refund.  I&#x27;ve learned a hard lesson, I will do my research on a product before wasting my money and jeopardizing my body or health.  I only hope my sense of taste returns!</li>
            <li> I like the burn of Listerine better.  That makes me some kind of weirdo, I&#x27;m sure.  It just feels like it is doing something.  Crest Pro-Health doesn&#x27;t burn at all, and only freshens your breath a little bit.  I did not experience taste loss or peeling skin like others have complained of, but that makes me worry about what&#x27;s in this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My gums are a constant problem, and will turn red if I don&#x27;t brush for two full minutes twice a day, floss, and use a mouth rinse.  I had my gums under control with Listerine...they were a nice light pink.  I switched to Crest Pro-Health for two weeks, and I feel like my gums were a brighter shade of pink and not as healthy.  Not a big difference, but a slight difference.  I will switch back to Listerine and confirm. This is hardly a scientific study, by the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing I don&#x27;t like about Crest Pro-Health is that when you spit it out, it leaves blue clumps of residue on your sink, or wherever you spit it out.  Sometimes I use mouthwash in the shower, but not this stuff.  If you don&#x27;t rinse this residue down the drain, it will dry and it is really hard to scrub off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why do I give it three stars then?  I think for people who can&#x27;t tolerate the burn of Listerine or Scope, this is the answer, and is definitely better than not using a mouth rinse.</li>
            <li> Our household is normally a Listerine household. The spouse loves it, but it burns so bad for me! I love the clean feeling of mouthwash, but have not always been faithful with my daily rinsing because of the burning (and drooling) it causes me. So I thought I&#x27;d give this a swish and see how I liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flossed, brushed, and grabbed the bottle. I poured half a capfull and tossed it back. Swish swish swish. Spit. There were chunks of blue in the sink. ?! This was odd. My toothpaste is white, so I was sure it was not that. Close inspection of my teeth shows little blue globs of this mouthwash was hanging out all over the place. It&#x27;s coated on my tongue, so that my entire tongue is blue, and when I try to rinse / brush my mouth out, it creates a strange foam out of nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I didn&#x27;t have enough the first go round, I assumed it was a fluke, so I rinsed again. Swish swish swish. Spit. Chunks of blue in the sink and all over my teeth. Another blue tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two hours later and I&#x27;m eating crackers with a sour cream dip and I can hardly taste anything. I have a strange chemical feeling on my tongue and gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to Listerine and all the burning, drooling, eye watering glory it provides me.</li>
            <li> I, too, have had a terrible experience with this product -- I thought I must have burned my tongue.  It hurts, I can&#x27;t taste anything and what little bit I can taste is metallic.  I realized that it is this product and when I came on line to find out if this is a common problem, lo and behold, here it is.  What all these consumers are complaining about is exactly what I am experiencing.  I will be pouring my rather expensive bottle of blue chemicals down the drain.</li>
            <li> I have the same issue that others have reported - it caused my lower front teeth to turn brown. I&#x27;m amazed this product is still being marketed. One to avoid!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Scope kind of person for ages, but decided to give this and the Crest Pro-Health toothpaste a try. It&#x27;s been a month, and I have yet to see any stains resulting from use. Not saying it doesn&#x27;t happen, just hasn&#x27;t happened with me (yet?). For the time being I&#x27;m going to stick with it. On the Pro side, it tastes fine and really doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;burn\\&quot; like other brands (even other Crests). On the Con side, it&#x27;s a little pricey and I think I have a mental hurdle that if it&#x27;s not burning, it&#x27;s not working. But I know there&#x27;s no reason to think it&#x27;s any less effective than a mouthwash with alcohol, which also dries out my mouth. If for no other reason, this makes it a good alternative. But I&#x27;ll keep an eye out for the staining and come back with an update if there&#x27;s an issue.</li>
            <li> ive used other crest pro health items and been less than enthralled with the products.&lt;br /&gt;This was a surprise. i liked the taste, mouth felt clean afterwards.. i guess results are gonna have to wait to see if the product lives up to its promises in its description</li>
            <li> Alcohol should only burn your mouth if you&#x27;re at the bar doing shots of Bacardi 101, or if you&#x27;re in Kentucky trying out Bubba&#x27;s home-brewed moonshine; NOT in the bathroom before heading to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crest&#x27;s no-burn, alcohol-free mouthwash does the trick by getting your mouth squeaky-clean without the burn, simply put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that you don&#x27;t get the same \\&quot;cool breath\\&quot; feel, but as long as it feels clean, who cares?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, you&#x27;re able to swish longer for a better clean!</li>
            <li> I have used the Crest Pro-health rinse for several years now and there are many things that I like about it, and one that I don&#x27;t. The rinse cleans up your mouth well without the burn that some brands have. The flavor is good too but that brings me to the negative. Do not use this rinse if you are going to eat or drink anything for about an hour. There is a linger taste that really ruins food/beverage taste. Otherwise, a good oral rinse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a loyal user of Listerine products, so the first thing I realized about the Crest Pro-Health Mint Rinse is that there&#x27;s no bitter or memorable aftertaste. You use it and you&#x27;re done. The \\&quot;clean mouth feeling\\&quot; is no different from Listerine. I will definitely buy this product in the store, if the price is comparable to what I&#x27;m already paying for Listerine.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash really does leave your mouth feeling fresh and clean.  The minty taste is long lasting and lets you feel confident.</li>
            <li> I wish when products would say mint, they would tell you what kind it is. I have no great love of spearmint and that&#x27;s what this rinse is. The cap can serve as a cap to &#x60;drink&#x27; the mouthwash out of.&lt;br /&gt;The taste is very strong and lasts for a while. The bottle says to use twice a day. There is no way I would want to use this before dinner, I would not be able to taste it or before I go to bed it would be way over powering to sleep with. The price seems a bit much for mouthwash that does the same as my other ones, except on a stronger more distasteful level.</li>
            <li> Great mouthwash.  Teeth feel fresh and clean, nice taste, doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;burn\\&quot; like listerine.  An item I will buy in the future!</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health Multiprotection Clean Mint Rinse is a somewhat mild tasting , alcohol free, mouth wash. It doesn&#x27;t burn like some mouth washes, but it did seem to make my mouth feel a little numb. I use Crest Crest Pro Health Cool Wintergreen Mouth Wash, and it does not do this. Like another popular brand, Crest Pro Health Mouth Wash kills 99% of common germs that can cause plaque, gingivitis and bad breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crest Pro-Health Multiprotection Clean Mint Rinse isn&#x27;t bad, but there are others I like better.</li>
            <li> I know the dentist says you should always use mouth wash, but to be perfectly honest I have never liked doing it because of the burning sensation that often is associated with them. It&#x27;s just not a pleasant experience so I didn&#x27;t do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to Crest Pro Health and this particular mouth wash. I was, as expected, hesitant to try it. I was ready to spit it out at the first sign of that burn. I filled the cap, smelled it, looked at it and just jumped off the cliff and did it. Yet... the burn never happened. In fact, I actually didn&#x27;t mind the taste at all. It didn&#x27;t have any unpleasant taste or feeling to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this mouth wash for awhile now and have nothing bad to say about it. I have no idea, based on scientific studies or anything if it actually \\&quot;works\\&quot;, but I can say that I don&#x27;t dread using it. So, that&#x27;s a definite plus.I figure if there are real benefits to using it that&#x27;s a win-win for me. I&#x27;d highly recommend this one even for kids.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health Multi-protection Clean Mint Rinse is a perfect mouth wash for those with sensitive teeth and gums.  For years the only mouth wash you can buy was ones that would burn your gums whilst rinsing and gargling.  But for the past few years, Crest Pro-Health has been making mouth washes that do not make you endure the unpleasant burning sensation that most dental rinses have.  The Clean Mint Rinse not only doesn&#x27;t bring the pain with each use, but it&#x27;ll protect your teeth and gums for twenty-four hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you are looking for some additional oral protection and need some extra help in your war against tooth decay then you&#x27;ll need to get yourself a bottle of Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Clean Mint Rinse today.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the people here are complaining about. I&#x27;ve been using this for a long time and I&#x27;ve had no loss of taste at all.People say that this causes some brown stains on your teeth. If you have ever used an anti-gingivitis rinse you like chlorhexidine gluconate you know that these rinses causes brown stains because of their gum disease fighting chemicals. So I actually think thats a good thing. Not the staining but the other thing. I usually use this once a day in the morning before brushing my teeth so maybe thats why I dont see the stains as much. But I love that there is no burn and no alcohol. Its got a nice fresh minty taste but not excessively so like Listerine.</li>
            <li> My dentist gave me a sample of this mouthwash, so I used it twice. This was followed by a weekend of very bland food. This stuff killed my sense of taste. Refunds can be given for a bad product, but I want my taste back!</li>
            <li> This product is horrible. I picked it up when the market didn&#x27;t have my usual Listerine. My teeth end up feeling far less clean, my breath less fresh and EVERYTHING tastes like soap for hours and hours afterwards. Do not buy this product.</li>
            <li> Love crest mouthwash because it works. There is no alcohol base so the after effects are longer lasting.  This is one of my favorite flavors Mint.  Use it love it.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash leaves my mouth feeling clean without the alcohol burn, which is nice.  However, I find it hard to eat anything up to two hours later, as the taste lingers and lingers and lingers, and makes almost anything you put in your mouth taste disgusting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If that doesn&#x27;t bother you, then this is great stuff.</li>
            <li> Oh God, I had a sample of this stuff and, while it tasted just fine, afterwards it tastes like there was ass in my mouth for the rest of the day. I can not recommend this product to anyone as the aftertaste is SO much worse than cranberry juice that I&#x27;d rather rinse cranberry juice.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would really help me stay on top of my oral hygiene game. I wanted a really great rinse, and this seemed promising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until I lost my sense of taste after two uses. I think my mouth feels really clean, but then again, my tongue has felt kind of weird and nothing has tasted right since I woke up this morning. I&#x27;m not going to be using this again, and I&#x27;m praying my sense of taste returns soon.</li>
            <li> Crest is always a good company that delivers what it claims to do.Buying it at a good price always helps.</li>
            <li> This Pro Health mouth rinse really works!  It&#x27;s long lasting effects are perfect for morning use - to get you through the day -- or before bed, when germs can multiply and cause damage, even after brushing.  I recommend it and so does my dentist.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this product and I have used it just once but that&#x27;s enough for me to come here to write a warning for those who want to try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to my orthodontist office for braces adjustment this morning.  As usual, I brushed and flossed my teeth then used the mouth rinse there by the sink.  It didn&#x27;t burn so I didn&#x27;t pay attention to anything until I got home and tried to eat lunch.  To my horror I couldn&#x27;t taste anything!  I thought it was the bread but I tried peanut butter, plain salt and sugar on my tongue - NOTHING!  I thought the loss of taste had something to do with the procedure even though it was highly unusual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called my ortho and he said he couldn&#x27;t think of anything that could cause taste loss.  I told him the only thing I did differently today was using the mouthwash by the sink - they normally had a different brand.  He said they had just started using this mouthwash, just to try it out.  I still didn&#x27;t think it was the mouthwash because mouthwash was supposed to help oral health, not to kill tastebuds!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My appointment was at 11 in the morning and by dinner time I still couldn&#x27;t taste anything.  I finally decided to go online to search for an answer.  To my surprise, this Crest Pro-Health rinse was exactly what I used at my ortho office earlier!  I couldn&#x27;t believe how  much effects it had on my tongue after just one use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s 10 pm right now and my sense of taste begins to come back.  I no longer feel this strange sensation on my tongue and I can taste a little bit of peanut butter.  I hope my taste buds will continue to recover and by tomorrow morning I should be able to eat like normal again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if this mouthwash will do the same to everyone&#x27;s tastebuds but it certainly ruined my taste for a day.  You can&#x27;t pay me to touch this stuff again.  It&#x27;s horrible!</li>
            <li> Upon receiving a bottle of Crest Pro-Health Multiprotection Clean Mint Rinse from the Amazon Vine program, I started using it every morning after brushing my teeth, and maybe once in the evening before going out to dinner or socializing.  I think it really does the job: without coming on too strong and tasting overpowering, it nevertheless freshens my breath for hours after using it.  And it does this via an alcohol-free formula, which is a nice plus (alcohol finds its way into my life in enough areas already, thank you).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I trust that the product&#x27;s other stated claims are true- in particular, that it really gives users a leg up on plaque- and if so, I&#x27;m really happy.  But the fact that it definitely does a great job (again, without being overpowering) in freshening my breath, is in itself enough of a reason to keep using it!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this; he says it makes his muth feel, \\&quot;fresh.\\&quot;  It is a little strong for me, though...but I am not really a mouthwash person at all.  I was glad to get the chance to try it, as we usually buy the green color mouthwashes (spearmint) instead of blue (peppermint).  This is hubby&#x27;s new favorite.</li>
            <li> I have liked using this mouthwash and feel my breathe has gotten better! I am not sure I will switch to this brand as we are a lister one household. But, we received it free to give our opinion and I am liking it so far!</li>
            <li> This product does just what it says. I have been using this mouthwash for over a year now ever since my dentist recommended it. I tried the others. Now,I have the confidence that my teeth are healthier and my breath fresher. I use it after EVERY  meal. Believe me when I tell you, I use no other kind!</li>
            <li> I confess I haven&#x27;t experienced the numbness, loss of sense of taste or tooth staining others have done (though my tongue does turn an interesting shade of lilac for a while after I use it), and I can honestly see where those things would be a big problem.  Being one of the fortunate ones lets me move on to the good and the bad as I see them.  First the good: It does still sting a bit when you use it full strength, but nothing like many of the mouthwashes on the market.  It&#x27;s not unbearable to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also seems to do the job it&#x27;s meant to do, though I suspect that the larger issues of plaque and gingivitis are going to be harder to evaluate since those are both long term and dependent upon the user NOT having something happen.  I do, however, have a minor plaque problem -- mostly brushing thoroughly takes care of the worst of it -- and no gingivitis.  When I visit my dentist next, I imagine he&#x27;ll let me know if the Crest is working.  I&#x27;d happily wait to write this until I consult with him, but I only just saw him a bit ago, so it&#x27;s going to be a while before I go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, I think most mouthwashes are pretty much equal.  If my mouth feels clean and my breath isn&#x27;t offensive, and I don&#x27;t suffer the torments of the damned while I&#x27;m using the stuff, I consider it a success.  While I haven&#x27;t suffered any of the negative effects, as I indicated above, I&#x27;d have to say that Crest isn&#x27;t so great it&#x27;s worth the risks, but in the end, you&#x27;re the only one who knows whether you want to take those risks or not.  Honestly, if I hadn&#x27;t tried it before I read the other reviews, I might never have tried it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish Lavoris was easier to find...</li>
            <li> This mouthwash is terrible for aftertaste. I would use it at night and wake up in the morning with the same disgusting taste. I don&#x27;t know how to explain it but that alone is a great reason to stay away from it</li>
            <li> I believe that the crest pro-health multi-protection clean mint rinse created yellowish brown stains on my teeth. I just returned home from a dental visit to have stains (developed since my purchase) removed. I couldn&#x27;t tell where the stains were coming from until I read some of the other comments on this page. I love Crest tooth paste, it works well but from now on I&#x27;ll just stick to Listerine mouth wash.</li>
            <li> I have been using Listerine for years (the green mint flavor that burns like fire!) and assumed I had been using the best stuff on the shelf.  My boyfriend turned me on to the Crest mouthwash and I have to admit, I&#x27;m glad I took his advice.  This stuff is leagues ahead of Listerine.  The flavor (and burn) is not nearly as intense, but don&#x27;t let this fool you-- the Crest mouthwash will keep your mouth feeling fresh and your breath minty for hours compared to Listerine.  I also noticed that my gums were much healthier than they&#x27;ve ever been and I can now use a heavier toothbrush without causing irritation.  I switch back and forth between using this and the Crest Whitening Mouthwash, which contains peroxide.  Between the two, I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  My teeth are whiter, my gums are healthy and my breath is fresh-- without the horrible stinging and burning of Listerine.  I&#x27;m definitely a convert.  Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> A lot of people on here complain because this stuff can potentially stain teeth (it has mine) and perhaps cause temporary changes to their taste buds (this hasn&#x27;t happened to me yet).  But what are they complaining about?  You don&#x27;t use this because you&#x27;re going on a date and want your mouth to smell pretty!  You use this if your gums are bleeding and you want to fight gingivitis and worse.  Gum disease can cause loss of teeth, heart disease, and even death.  This is pretty much the only non-prescription product that has been shown to make much of a difference in this fight.  So all the whining about the aftertaste seems like spoiled children screaming at their parents because they don&#x27;t want to wear seat belts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exactly how much difference this product can make isn&#x27;t terribly well established.  But there is evidence that the active ingredient in it does have a clinically significant effect.  Of course, along with this mouth wash you need to floss/brush twice a day.  Ultrasonic teeth cleaning painlessly removed the stains in my case.  Do I like the stains?  No.  But I&#x27;d rather have stained teeth than oral surgery.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I needed it, not because I was super excited about what it could do for me.&lt;br /&gt;Having tried it (not long-term, so I can&#x27;t speak to the supposed whitening benefits, although I have my doubts about those), I can say - it&#x27;s mouthwash! Nice crisp wintergreen flavor, tending towards overly sweet (but aren&#x27;t they all), non-alcohol base (again, aren&#x27;t they all alcohol free now?). If you use as much as they tell you to, you&#x27;re going to cruise through this bottle in about a week, even if it&#x27;s just you using it. And that, my friends, is a rip off, for what amounts to Splenda-water. Make your own mouthwash with peppermint oil. Save money.</li>
            <li> I got this through the Amazon Vine program, so I didn&#x27;t have to pay for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I will in the future, because it is nice-tasting; minty without beeing too sweet or too medicinal.  And it works, too -- my teeth definitely feel cleaner since using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before, I was using Listerine, but I will switch.  This is as effective, and tastes better.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health Multiprotection Clean Mint Rinse tastes good and seems to make my teeth feel cleaner but I simply do not like the rinses that do not have alcohol in them.  The rinses that market the fact they don&#x27;t have alcohol so there isn&#x27;t that \\&quot;burn\\&quot; I can see why they do so but the \\&quot;burn\\&quot; is a lot that kills the bad breath for real.  When I use rinses like this it feels more mental than physical and I want a more powerful rinse instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you hate that burning flavor that they try to market this rinse might be for you, but not all the alcohol-based rinses burn as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***</li>
            <li> This product from Crest tastes and feels like a typical mouthwash product. It apparently has additional ingredients to improve the functionality of the product. It seems to work quite well though.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash has a nice minty flavor. These alcohol-free mouthwashes tend to leave a weird, dryish feeling in my mouth, particularly on my tongue. You don&#x27;t get the typical \\&quot;burn\\&quot; of regular mouthwash, but you do feel a bit of a tingling sensation in your mouth afterwards. This tingling sensation is really mild and doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I am going to compare this product to [[ASIN:B008OVDRAM LISTERINE Ultra Clean Antiseptic Mouthwash]], which is my go-to product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Active ingredients in Listerine:&lt;br /&gt;Eucalyptol 0.092%&lt;br /&gt;Menthol 0.042%&lt;br /&gt;Methyl Salicylate 0.060%&lt;br /&gt;Thymol 0.064%&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inactive: Alcohol 21.5%&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Active ingredients in Crest Pro-Health Alcohol free:&lt;br /&gt;Cetylpyridinium chloride 0.07%&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inactive: Methlyparaben &amp; Propylparaben (Listerine contains no parabens but does have benzoic acid, poloxamer 407, and sodium benzoare)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Impressions:&lt;br /&gt;Listerine burns because of the high alcoholic content (close to 1/4 of the bottle is alcohol) and there is no burning feeling with the Crest bottle. However, I experience an amazing clean feeling right after using Listerine. With Crest? not so much. In fact there was a flat chemically taste while rinsing and the chemical taste stayed for 30 minutes later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the Listerine had no warning labels on its bottle, I was alarmed by this warning label on the Crest:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;In some cases, antimicrobial rinses may cause surface staining to teeth. This is not permanent or harmful, and may be prevented by adequate brushing or removed at your next dental visit\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;removed at your next dental visit? I don&#x27;t have dental coverage, and the dentist is too expensive to pay for damages caused by a mouthwash. Its been documented that in a small group of individuals, the Cetylpyridinium chloride 0.07% makes your teeth look like you been chewing tobacco for years (a hard brown-yellow shade)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I use [[ASIN:B001OOLLVS Crest 3d White Advanced Vivid Teeth Whitening Strips]] and I used them last night and found my teeth hurting after using this mouthwash. I did NOT get this with Listerine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERDICT:&lt;br /&gt;I feel I am playing russian roulette when I use this mouthwash. Will it stain my teeth? I rather have piece of mind with Listerine. Atleast that one doesn&#x27;t have a warning on the bottle about stains that \\&quot;can be removed on your next dental visit\\&quot;. Going to the dentist is a luxury for me, and a beautiful WHITE smile is a necessity. Also I love the CLEAN feeling that mouthwashes give you. I did not feel clean when using Crest. I will use stick with Listerine.e bottle about stains that \\&quot;can be removed on your next dental visit\\&quot;. Going to the dentist is a luxury for me, and a beautiful WHITE smile is a necessity. Also I love the CLEAN feeling that mouthwashes give you. I did not feel clean when using Crest.

            <li> I have only used this crest product twice recently (once at night, and once the morning after) and at first I didn&#x27;t notice anything strange since I had eaten a very bland cereal so it wasn&#x27;t really supposed to taste like anything , but then later as I got the munchies for a snack, I reached for some nutella. At first I thought there was something wrong with the nutella because I could barely taste anything so I asked my brother to give his opinion and he thought it was fine and as delicious as ever. I was a little confused but I didn&#x27;t really think much of the incident until I went to go buy some chili cheese fries. That&#x27;s when I realized that I could barely taste anything. It was like if the taste buds in the front of my tongue were gone. I could only taste with the back of my tongue. That just made my food very unpleasant. Also, everything did taste a little metallic. So I get home and decide to do a little research and google \\&quot;loss of taste\\&quot; and well the first things that show up on google are some very serious diseases and illnesses like Alzheimer&#x27;s and so I actually begin to get scared because I&#x27;m only 17! But then I come across a website full of  crest pro health rinse complaints. And I begin to read what everyone has to say and that&#x27;s when I realized that it was the mouthwash that did this to me. I am glad to have come accross the website , if not I would&#x27;ve been worried out of my mind and thought it mEant I had alzheimeirs. I hope I get my taste back soon as other users have. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of one is because my family used it too and nothing happened to them. Also, I had used this mouthwash once before around 3 years ago and nothing happened to me then but I recently developed some allergies so maybe it&#x27;s that?</li>
            <li> I used it a total of three times, stopped four days ago, and still lack a full range of taste in my mouth. In other words, if you use this, you run the risk of depriving yourself of one of life&#x27;s great pleasures: tasting food and drink. I STRONGLY recommend against using this terrible product. The comments here and otherwise confirm to me that I&#x27;m not crazy; this stuff doesn&#x27;t affect everyone but for those it does, it&#x27;s TERRIBLE.</li>
            <li> Oh my god, I literally can&#x27;t even describe how awful this stuff is. I have always been lucky and had white, straight, no problem teeth so I have always been really careful about flossing/brushing/rinsing everyday to keep them that way. About two months ago I decided to try out the Crest Pro Health rinse because they make it sound so great for you! I didn&#x27;t notice anything too horrible at first, my tongue and gums were a little bit sore. After about two weeks I noticed two dark brown spots forming in between my two front teeth on the top and bottom! I whitened and brushed and used the rinse more not understanding why they were there! They kept getting worse, it was like they appeared in a matter of days! It got to the point they were so dark I went to the dentist to see what the deal was. I told her I had been using the pro-health rinse and she immediately told me never to use it! Apparently, there is some ingredient in it that literally stains your teeth! It was awful, not even whitening strips could get rid of them. Luckily, the dentist was able to polish them off but it totally sucked. My tongue burned, the roof of my mouth burned, and I even lost my sense of taste for a while! I stopped using immediately after going to the dentist and haven&#x27;t had any of the same problems (and that was about a month ago!).&lt;br /&gt;I looked online and apparently a lot of people have had similar problems!&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT USE THIS!!! IT MAKES BROWN SPOTS ON YOUR TEETH!!</li>
            <li> I used this product twice, once at night and then again the next morning, and I noticed all day that I couldn&#x27;t really taste anything. I did experiments to see if it was just one type of taste (sweet, salty, etc) but it was everything! It&#x27;s been about 12 hours now and I still can&#x27;t taste.  I was very worried until I came on here and saw that many people had this same reaction. This feeling is absolutely indescribable, and funny actually. Needless to say, I will not be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> My dentists recently recommended I start using a mouthwash, so I perused the shelves at the supermarket and picked up some of this.  After only using it 3 times I could tell that something was up with my taste buds.  I thought I was imagining things, so I check on the internet.  Seems to be a common problem.  I can no longer really taste much of anything, salty or sweet.  Food is just bland and tasteless.  I&#x27;m using as directed (per the label) and it burns quit a bit towards the end of a rinse and I have some swell on the inside of my right cheek. Needless to say the rest is going down the drain.  Avoid this product.</li>
            <li> Well, what can I say. It meets my expectations. It helps freshen my breath and it&#x27;s not painful like Listerine (even though I can take it). I can comfortable rinse this around in my mouth for a good, long, reasonable amount of time. The minty taste is good for a mouth wash. The funny thing is though, since it does not have the painful effect, I always wondering if it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> We have been using this product for a couple of months, and none of us in the family have experienced the numb tongue or altered taste issue mentioned by other reviewers, but we are continuing to evaluate.  Our dentist actually recommended this product to us, particularly because our oldest son just got braces. I use it twice per day, and just have not experienced the staining or other issues.  It does help with my kids&#x27; oral hygiene (better breath), but will update the review if we start experiencing adverse side effects.</li>
            <li> The new trend in mouthwash is \\&quot;antibacterial/antimicrobial\\&quot; mouth wash. Like any mouthwash of this type, this comes with a warning, \\&quot;In some cases, antimicrobial rinses may cause surface staining to teeth. This is not permanent or harmful and may be prevented by adequate brushing or removed at your next dental visit.\\&quot; This is a common side effect of antibacterial mouthwash. The other common type of mouthwash is antiseptic mouthwash, and it uses alcohol. So, most alcohol free mouthwashes will be antibacterial, and will thus have the possibility of discoloring your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I don&#x27;t have any discoloration issues with antibacterial mouthwash. (I was told to use an alcohol free mouthwash during my pregnancy.) The taste of this particular mouthwash is pleasant enough and leaves my mouth with a clean enough feeling.</li>
