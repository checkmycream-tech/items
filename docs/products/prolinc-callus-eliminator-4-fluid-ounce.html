            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>i love it works really great!</li>
            <li>Get a pedicure every couple of weeks in my own home without having to pay $25 each time!</li>
            <li>It worked successfully in removing the callus.</li>
            <li>lol thank you for this product I&#x27;m satisfied!</li>
            <li>I think it is amazing and does a great job.  </li>
            <li>Worked good when I used it.</li>
            <li>and none of them worked as good as this product.</li>
            <li>Even though getting a pedicure &#x27;done&#x27; at the salon feels good</li>
            <li>I go for pedicures &amp; feel so good when I leave.  </li>
            <li>We tried skipping that step and the results were not as good at all.  </li>
            <li>Have a good foot file.  </li>
            <li>This works good, but it is not a miracle worker.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>Also, you have to wash your feet really good.</li>
            <li>my feet never felt so good.</li>
            <li>Finishing with a good moisturizer helps a lot too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Demo</li>
            <li>Works as good as Draino.....</li>
            <li>I use it a lot and its good</li>
            <li>a good saving.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this is a good cosmetic product but not medicinal strength.</li>
            <li>find that if I use this product every two weeks, my feet look good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, this may be great for people who can&#x27;t put in the elbow grease, or have baby calluses, or have never tried shaving/filing their own calluses to begin</li>
            <li>Accompany this with foot pedi-file and foot razor and your good to go.</li>
            <li>Item received in good condition.</li>
            <li>I just got fair results.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll have good results.</li>
            <li>Had to go to salon for good results.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t looked this good in years.</li>
            <li>This is a good callus remover.  </li>
            <li>This product works Sooo good.</li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s very potent, there is no odor</li>
            <li>It was better cause it worked great and</li>
            <li>Love it works great just like going to the spa</li>
            <li>I tried this based on all of the great reviews--and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I was so impressed with how smooth my feet stayed, that I bought some on my own for when I do my own feet de-scaling.  </li>
            <li>lol thats how much I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>will say I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>A very good product that has my feet back to its pre-mommy state and at a great price..unbelievable!!</li>

            <li>Worked perfectly the first time.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like magic!</li>
            <li>I get much better result with a foam sandpaper block that I buy at Home Depot!</li>
            <li>Easy to use with great results every time.  </li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>My feel felt amazing.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions found on YouTube and had amazing results.  </li>
            <li>Eliminator\\&quot; is an amazing product.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>It does and amazing job with resurfacing the skin of the foot.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>so you could see what an amazing difference I am experiencing.</li>
            <li>I scrub with a pumice stone and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>This product works amazing well.</li>
            <li>It worked amazingly well.</li>
            <li>This product works amazing.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product that no doubt works miracles.  </li>
            <li>My pedicure place uses this stuff and it is amazing.</li>
            <li>I wish I could rave about how amazing this product is</li>
            <li>remover(the knife/razor kind of tool)&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a life saver product.</li>
            <li>the smell was really nice.</li>
            <li>, I let my feet soak for about 10 mins in a nice warm soak, I then apply the Callus Eliminator and leave it on 5 mins.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to use a good moisturizer on your peds...</li>
            <li>Ive used this product before whenever I got my pedicures, but this time I decided to order my own and save the money$$, but when this was shipped here it was spilled everywhere</li>
            <li>This is an extremely effective product.  </li>
            <li>just as much as I would had I not used this product.. not too impressed..</li>
            <li>I just soaked my feet with so epson salt and warm water for about 10 minutes, applied the remover, waited for 5 min and then used a foot file.</li>
            <li>Really effective for callus&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m fiarly impressed but not as much as i&#x27;d hoped.  </li>
            <li>Soak feet in warm water to prepare feet - about 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li>This has a nice smell.  </li>
            <li>Works nicely.</li>
            <li>and this was a great way to get rid of all the hardened scaly skin and start fresh with some good at home foot care.</li>
            <li>It really works and it is one of the best products if you walk around barefoot and want softer feet.</li>
            <li>honest.  </li>
            <li>SINCE MY PURCHASE, I TAKE THIS ITEM WITH ME TO THE NAIL AND PEDICURE SALON AND USE MY OWN PRODUCT INSTEAD OF PAYING $3.00 TO USE THEIR APPLICATION.</li>
            <li>THEY DO NOT LIKE IT AND SOME OF THE SALONS WILL NOT ALLOW ME TO USE MY OWN PRODUCT,</li>
            <li>WHY CAN&#x27;T I USE MY OWN PRODUCT WHEN I AM STILL PAYING FOR THE SERVICE</li>
            <li>It is strong but will work best with the right tools.</li>
            <li>This is more effective than some, but not overly effective.</li>
            <li>Its very strong chemical and SHOULD ALWAYS WEAR GLVOES BEFORE USING IT.</li>
            <li>I can tell you my feet are just wonderful now, and so soft</li>
            <li>/&gt;Luckily I was able to purchase my own bottle of this product and in between salon pedicures</li>
            <li>It says to wait 3-5 minutes and after about 2 min I hastily started lightly scrubbing (it works so good</li>
            <li>Instructions are easy to follow (and please do, or else it could get messy/painful!).  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper than a pedicure and also good for in-between maintenance!</li>
            <li>Great product and very fast</li>
            <li>It worked great even the first time.  </li>
            <li>I first experienced this product at a nail salon (for an additional $5).</li>
            <li>very gentle to the skin, but very effective at softening callouses.</li>
            <li>This is a very good product for your feet, if you want your feet soft when you get out the shower</li>
            <li>I use it once a week at home and it makes a HUGE difference!</li>
            <li>but I think I still need more time to use it</li>
            <li>I tried and it worked much better.</li>
            <li>, I got most of the callous off but not all</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try to find a better product.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much better it feels..</li>
            <li>Too many days in flip flops.  </li>
            <li>Better foot file took off tons of callous.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff..</li>
            <li>I then tried 7 min and that was the magical number.</li>
            <li>Make sure you soak your feet for 10 min before applying.</li>
            <li>I think the recommended one will be better though.  </li>
            <li>This sure saves on the upcharge when I go get a pedicure.  </li>
            <li>Okay so I never review products on Amazon</li>
            <li>but I did notice my skin felt better after I scrubbed them...</li>
            <li>Made my feet nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>I was born and raised in South Florida and was almost always barefoot :)</li>
            <li>I got this only because the reviews were so awesome.</li>
            <li>cover your foot with the plastic wrap and make sure the area that you used to apply the eliminator is on the bottom of your feet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just okay.  </li>
            <li>This worked ok for me.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t burn my skin at all and helped remove more than just a pumice by itself would do but don&#x27;t expect a miracle.</li>
            <li>, already ordered two more bottles.</li>
            <li>I did the recommended process on the bottle, it would work even better.</li>
            <li>I did the same thing with my husband&#x27;s feet and he was very happy with result as well.</li>
            <li>it is better that a pedicurist</li>
            <li>Many are undettered and still   use this product    </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Saving more than the cost of the product.</li>
            <li>Even better when you add a Swiss foot file to scrub off the callouses.</li>
            <li>I have used this product many times.</li>
            <li>Works good,but since I use the O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Healthy Feet Creme, I haven&#x27;t need to use this at all.</li>
            <li>Follow the directions, this stuff is potent.  </li>
            <li>I thought maybe I should try it again to be for sure,</li>
            <li>Could be stronger or more directions.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t incredibly pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>It did however make my hands peel, so maybe my feet are just rougher than most others.</li>
            <li>SO, after reading more reviews, I decided to try again</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had calloused feet for many, many years.  </li>
            <li>My feet are baby smooth!  </li>
            <li>Much better than filing and filing my feet and produces a better and smoother result.</li>
            <li>but it is fantastic!</li>
            <li>A fantastic way to remove caluses on my feet, cuticles on fingers and toes!</li>
            <li>is a fantastic product!</li>
            <li>sure</li>
            <li>This is one of the better pedicure products that will save you money so you don&#x27;t need so many pedicures.</li>
            <li>this product is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I am sure any lotion would work for that purpose also, but Vaseline won&#x27;t slip around or drip.</li>
            <li>So pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>I use this weekly in conjunction with nightly BioOil and heel socks and my feet have never looked better.</li>
            <li>Definitely soak your feet before use, apply to heels and wash hands after, scrub with the ped egg after 3-5 mins then wash it all away and repeat...repeat...til you&#x27;ve got perfect heels!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m convinced those nails salons will pretend anything works, so they can charge you more money.</li>
            <li>am pleased.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do anything miraculous, for sure.</li>
            <li>This product did its job and more for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure if I had followed directions</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I thought this product was just okay.</li>
            <li>I used to be an exotic dancer.</li>
            <li>I read alot of reviews which I was pleased with.</li>
            <li>The instructions on the bottle warn you not to leave the gel on more than 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I switched to better shoe and the callus was gone in 3 months.</li>
            <li>It was okay by my standards.</li>
            <li>The good side is, right after the pedicures</li>
            <li>The reviews are REAL , my feet havent felt like this since I was a child !!!!</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>Super soft, callus removed evenly, im very happy!!</li>
            <li>Tried this on a callus that turned out to be a wart, and did a pretty dang good job of removing the excess skin.  </li>
            <li>Give your feet a good scrub and soak first then use it.</li>
            <li>I have to leave it on for the full five minutes for it to be effective...</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good product.  </li>
            <li>and he was blown away by how quickly it worked and how effective it is.</li>
            <li>Maybe I received a defective item, but with this many good reviews I really tried to wait</li>
            <li>most important</li>
            <li>It is cheap and more efficient.  </li>
            <li>Product really does a great job if a couple of things are true:    </li>
            <li>They are soft and presentable, they look great</li>
            <li>It softens the callus which made a more comfortable removal.</li>
            <li>my feet were so smooth and my heels looked so healthy.</li>
            <li>But be care with surrounding skin to avoid damage to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;So happy to find BE NATURAL</li>
            <li>and this really did a good job.  </li>
            <li>Key is you need a good scrubber!</li>
            <li>Cannot say enough good things about this product!</li>
            <li>Melts the calluses like butter for easy removal.</li>
            <li>I went easy</li>
            <li>I use it in conjunction with the Denco Easy Grip Foot Smoother.  </li>
            <li>This does the trick and very quickly.</li>
            <li>It works well &amp; easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, the smell is acceptable.</li>
            <li>It makes it easy to take of calluses.  </li>
            <li>Use with caution because this is strong stuff.  </li>
            <li>It is strong, but that is what makes it work.</li>
            <li>It is strong stuff though.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem as strong as the description and instructions lead me to believe.  </li>
            <li>This product requires a better pumice than natural pumice to get good results.</li>
            <li>Very fast &amp; effective.  </li>
            <li>It was pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say I have never given a more glowing review of a product, and if choose your own rating were an option, 5 stars would not be enough.</li>
            <li>I tried this first at a pedicure and decided to buy my own bottle.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use and leave your feet soft and nice.</li>
            <li>lol I highly recommend pairing this product with the Microplane Colossal Pedicure Foot Rasp, which I also purchased here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It was fine on my heels, but it caused cuts and burns on the side of my ankle and side of the foot as well.</li>
            <li>It is great product, make the work much easy , I have dry skin from nature and have to spend a lot of time with my feet, I love to walk home without shoes and we know what the effect of it is ..</li>
            <li>give you the easy results, and smooth skin that this stuff does.</li>
            <li>This product is fine.  </li>
            <li>I use a fine paint brush &amp; they are removed with in a couple minutes.</li>
            <li>It peeled skin on my feet where I applied it, but it didn&#x27;t feel good and the areas felt very sensitive.</li>
            <li>Make your feet soft, Good on price, Easy to use, Use it with a scrubber, Cheaper on Amazon send the salon</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s useful to my dad and we all like it~&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;ll be better if effect more quickly</li>
            <li>Follow the directions precisely.  </li>
            <li>Your heels will be so smooth.  </li>
            <li>Now I can do it myself for cheap.</li>
            <li>I save so much $$ doing my own pedicures at home.</li>
            <li>Works great, low odor.</li>
            <li>I cannot get over how fantastic they feel.  </li>
            <li>However, sores excepted, my heels are almost baby-butt smooth.</li>
            <li>I found that my heels became smooth a LOT faster this way.  </li>
            <li>It worked fabulously.  </li>
            <li>But it on my calluses for like 4-5 mins, wipe off excess, microplane &amp; smooth out.</li>
            <li>I would be happy to order the extra strength version, but this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li>This stuff gets my feet so smooth.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t sand them smooth while showering.</li>
            <li>my feet feel smoother than before and free of calluses</li>
            <li>I like &#x27;mediterranean olive almond &amp; sage WONDERBALM&#x27; by Boots available at Target.</li>
            <li>Oh, the calluses on feet re-grow smooth.</li>
            <li>My feet are incredibly smooth and callous free.</li>
            <li>I just discovered this SO CHEAP after spending years at the pedi place.  </li>
            <li>My feet were baby smooth afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I think there should be more detailed instructions for use but overall its good.</li>
            <li>follow the directions....be attentive to where this mixture trails on your skin.....</li>
            <li>My feet are smooth.</li>
            <li>Maybe it works on extremely light callouses.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the same stuff that was used when I had a pedicure and the guy was able to get a good bit of the callus and cracked heals taken care of.  </li>
            <li>You will  not be surprised over your outcome, because this product does a good job in ridding callouses.</li>
            <li>finally something that works as good as the salon where I go for pedicures - they still get me as a client but in between my feet love me for using this</li>
            <li>This would be a good product for regular foot maintenance but for me didn&#x27;t work for a more severe callus.</li>
            <li>To give you an idea of what I am working with, I am 48 years old, and I have always taken good care of feet..</li>
            <li>i must admit the product itself is pretty good but was expecting the bottle to come exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>Make sure you wash your hands right away after applying or use gloves.</li>
            <li>this product is very useful for me.</li>
            <li>It sure is a good addition to my pedicure routine - it helps my heels and sides of my feel feel so much more smooth with less scrubbing</li>
            <li>I gave this stuff another try mainly because some reviewers actually liked it</li>
            <li>So glad I bought it and used it for the first time tonight...</li>
            <li>and it is totally worth it, espcially with summer coming up!</li>
            <li>you can too by using the same tools that the pros use in the privacy of your own home!</li>
            <li>between use of CE, I suggest use of rich creams and socks at night.</li>
            <li>but it is not a home use product friendly item.</li>
            <li>Was so excited to get this product and try out.  </li>
            <li>I then wipe off my feet with a clean towel and use the foot scrapper.  </li>
            <li>I refuse to pay $$$ for professional foot treatments, and this is the next best option.</li>
            <li>My pedicurist regularly uses this product with great success.  </li>
            <li>Great product works very well with no harsh odors .A</li>
            <li>Hopefully the next product I try will be more effective.</li>
            <li>After reading so many positive reviews I decided to give this product a try.  </li>
            <li>I use a large &amp;#34;cheese grater&amp;#34; looking thing and the two things together are fabulous!</li>
            <li>It makes a difference right away!</li>
            <li>The first time I noticed a HUGE difference in my feet, and by the third use my feet looked AMAZING!  </li>
            <li>I used this for the first time last night, and I was extremely happy.  </li>
            <li>The Callus Eliminator worked great at first, but the calluses would come back and had to re apply it.  </li>
            <li>Leave it on for the full amount of time after soaking your feet and then just file away...</li>
            <li>A whole lot more than this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I soak my feet about five minutes, then put the product on, and then soak again for about five minutes, put a bit more product on, and let sit for about five minutes, GENTLY wipe the product off, and use a pumice stone.</li>
            <li>This is close as I&#x27;ve come to a professional pedicure in the comfort of my own home.  </li>
            <li>I work retail and go to college full time</li>
            <li>As good as it did I will only have to use it once a week.</li>
            <li>When I ordered it, I was SO excited that I might be able to have soft, smooth feet.</li>
            <li>(it doesn&#x27;t rinse easily so wipe first) 4)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m lucky to have a bench in my shower</li>
            <li>This product arrived early and really does a good job on callus.  </li>
            <li>It works okay, but I think the way it would work better is if you actually had someone to put it on for you and you could sit with them elevated after soaking, so</li>
            <li>I have an old trick that works better (but still not 100% callus free).</li>
            <li>I tried all kind of stuffs that do not really work.&lt;br /&gt;The product does exactly as it claims for a great price.&lt;br /&gt;Instruction is clear.</li>
            <li>I love wearing high heels, as well as  sandals, flip flops, and walking barefoot.  </li>
            <li>It is very effective and with regular use, your feet will remain sandal ready.</li>
            <li>By far the best Callus Eliminator I&#x27;ve ever used and the only one that really works when doing at home.  </li>
            <li>I got visible results after the very first use.  </li>
            <li>I tried this product twice as directed, and it didn&#x27;t do anything more than a normal soak and scrub</li>
            <li>Does a great job at breaking down the callus.</li>
            <li>It really softens the roughness and callus so that they are easily removed.</li>
            <li>Pretty feet!</li>
            <li>I soaked my feet first, applied the product and pumiced away!  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described...a wonder!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still better than not using anything, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s strong enough to warrant wearing gloves for protection.  </li>
            <li>it works very quick (2 minutes) but make sure you have a scrubby and such</li>
            <li>Just recently moved to a very dry climate and this stuff works great!!</li>
            <li>Sometimes I have to repeat the cycle twice to really get my feet smooth</li>
            <li>and/or your feet aren&#x27;t heavily calloused, it will probably work great for you.</li>
            <li>I soaked my feet in warm water for 10 minutes and left the stuff on for the directed amount of time, but I still had to do a couple of rounds.</li>
            <li>This was not as effective as callus remover I&#x27;ve purchased at local drug stores.</li>
            <li>Maybe they have more sensitive feet?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It was totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Well, I don&#x27;t take time to do the full soak first then apply, wait &amp; scrub.  </li>
            <li>I think a professional may do better</li>
            <li>Eliminator\\&quot; isn&#x27;t a miracle product, but it does a good job of removing rough skin and calluses on your feet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I soaked my feet for 10 minutes, then applied the eliminator directly on my heels and covered with a gauze 4x4 ans soaked some more</li>
            <li>Something like the Microcplane Colossal Pedicure Rasp or Danco Callus Shaver.  </li>
            <li>, I only did it on my own feet.  </li>
            <li>This is worth the time and money.</li>
            <li>Use it in conjunction with the Microplane Colossal Pedicure Rasp.  </li>
            <li>Massage it into your feet just like lotion until you skin has absorbed it.</li>
            <li>It does an okay job, but it is far from &amp;#34;natural!&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>I do my own pedicures and this is an essential step.  </li>
            <li>This eliminator does a good job with a partially removed callus that has been prepped by Dr. Scholls.  </li>
            <li>B00756HQNQ Microplane Brown Colossal Pedicure Foot Rasp]]</li>
            <li>it softens the dead skin and makes scrubbing so much more effective.</li>
            <li>I would suggest that you do a good job in soaking feet prior to use and you will really see how miraculous this product is.</li>
            <li>its definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>I still use the lotion after I shower, but other then that I dont do anything different, I still walk around my foot barefoot lol and no problems :)</li>
            <li>This stuff works very well, and is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I guess my calluses are the toughest of all Amazon planet because I didn&#x27;t get this thing to work as good as other users claim they did.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cure cancer or save the rainforest as some of the other reviews might lead you to believe, but it does help take a layer of callus off the with aid of a good pumice scrubbing.</li>
            <li>takes the callused right off no problem.</li>
            <li>and they were out so their customer service called me right away and offered me the orange one.  </li>
            <li>I applied the product right after I finish showering, so</li>
            <li>Right</li>
            <li>The callus comes right off.</li>
            <li>Do this right before bed.</li>
            <li>AND I put my feet in water right away to soak while the solution was still on,  </li>
            <li>The skin will just fall right off</li>
            <li>I get rid of the calluses on my own at home, using exactly the same process and tools as they use at the salon.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve tried this twice over the past two days and even after using this product as the instructions on the bottle indicated, I had to do a GREAT deal of buffing with a foot file..</li>
            <li>After reading the great reviews I purchased this, didn&#x27;t work for me, not sure if it was expired</li>
            <li>I normally always upgrade my pedicure to have this product applied, but it&#x27;s a huge cost saver to DIY.</li>
            <li>I needed something that was quick and effective and this fits the bill perfectly as it had my feet back to its natural soft and touchable state in less than 30 minutes (soaking included)!  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re not supposed to scrub too hard or you&#x27;ll remove too many layers of skin) and could not believe how nice my feet felt.</li>
            <li>The price and super fast shipping can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>I the heels of my feet were perfectly smooth, I could feel normally for the first time in literally years..</li>
            <li>Also it shipped super fast.  </li>
            <li>and I meet personalities in top social status.</li>
            <li>While proper application to caluses is not dangerous, be sure not to get this product on any non-calloused skin.  </li>
            <li>After one easy application, my feet are so smoothe and soft.  </li>
            <li>while i use it, it make my feet skin very soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li>This is a good product for callus feet on the top, but not for deep down spot callus.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it before and it was very good at dealing with tough callus&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>Still worked very very well.  </li>
            <li>Ever since I started getting pedicures, I have suffered with very very cracked heals.</li>
            <li>I have had calloused feet my whole life, and have tried different soaks, scrubs, scrapers, blades, etc., all to varying degrees of success, but nothing has worked as easily and as quickly as this product.</li>
            <li>My feet feel soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>the first time I used it</li>
            <li>Still it works ok enough to keep, but I&#x27;ll try to contact AII to ask about this change before reordering.</li>
            <li>This callus eliminator really helps, moreover without injuring the feet!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product does exactly as it claims for a great price and the bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li>The product works better than what I get in a salon, and the results last longer.  </li>
            <li>After using it several times, it works okay, but I didn&#x27;t find it to be the miracle product I was hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>highly recommended !!</li>
            <li>It also probably something you need to do on more of a regular basis.</li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>The first time.</li>
            <li>I used the product twice the first week</li>
            <li>Whether you are a man or woman (I am a man), if you are not well groomed, trust me that the people around you will notice it FAST!</li>
            <li>I say it is worth the money I have so much callus</li>
            <li>It pairs very well with the Microplane Brown Colossal Pedicure Foot Rasp, which I also purchased on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I did exactly what the directions said to do faithfully.  </li>
            <li>Used it exactly as directed, no problems.</li>
            <li>My MIL says she uses this exact product at her salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>first bottle I received was leaking (which is bound to happen sometimes), so I reported it.</li>
            <li>I do not trust third parties to work on my feet as I believe I will do better than somebody else.</li>
            <li>Once i purchased this product, I have no problem with my regular pedi any more.</li>
            <li>The first time I had this used on my feet at the nail salon</li>
            <li>Make sure you apply on your calculus only!</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll have soft, smooth skin on your heels.</li>
            <li>my feet were soft and without callus free.</li>
            <li>I first learned  about this product while having a pedicure</li>
            <li>This thing really works!</li>
            <li>thanks you!</li>
            <li>The first time I did it after a shower.  </li>
            <li>so next time I will use more and see how it works.  </li>
            <li>so far so smooth for my me time...</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>Its okay will continue to use daily have</li>
            <li>When I tried this the first time, I soaked for 5 minutes then applied the product for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>I packaged it up better and shipped it back.  </li>
            <li>It has some pretty toxic ingredients that will take the skin off anything it touches...</li>
            <li>Take a hot shower.</li>
            <li>My feet were soft and smooth for over a month.  </li>
            <li>first time I tried this I soaked my feet for about 10 minutes, then put the solution on for about 5.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty bad/thick callouses</li>
            <li>Works extremely fast!</li>
            <li>For years, I have suffered from a deep callous buildup on my pinkie toe, to the point where I could not even wear most shoes without screaming pain.</li>
            <li>On my first application with this product, the majority of the callous buildup is gone.</li>
            <li>If used correctly it really works!</li>
            <li>My feet are soft and callus free.</li>
            <li>My wife absolutely swears by this stuff and she is picky about her beauty products!</li>
            <li>After the first test, I knew it was.</li>
            <li>does exactly what its supposed to do in one treatment.</li>
            <li>and you will have smooth, silky, baby soft feet.</li>
            <li>The products works really well too!</li>
            <li>So the first time, I followed the instructions.  </li>
            <li>However, it didn&#x27;t work for me after the first time using it.</li>
            <li>It performs exactly as described.</li>
            <li>You definitely have to make sure you use an aplicator and don&#x27;t get it on your fingers.</li>
            <li>After reading all the reviews, I thought for sure I had finally found a callous remover that truly did what it advertised.  </li>
            <li>I was able to remove some callous skin on my heels, but it keeps coming back.  </li>
            <li>This works really good at removing the dead skin on your feet, but you have to wear gloves.</li>
            <li>Soaked my feet, dried them, applied the product fairly generously, waited five minutes, rubbed a pumice stone on my heel, and</li>
            <li>This eliminator is good in the sense that it removes all the dead skin</li>
            <li>AND IT IS EASY AND SHOWS MAJOR RESULTS A MUST HAVE.</li>
            <li>Works as in salon, highly recommend, quick fix in home set up</li>
            <li>WOW!!!!</li>
            <li>WOW!!!!</li>
            <li>Much better for me than going to the nail salon, I paid about the same for the one time pedicure as I did for the large bottle of this.</li>
            <li>if that changes in the future, I will certainly update the review with more information.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions and while it did make my feet feel good right after applying it, the feeling didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>Even after just one use it creates an amazing and lasting soft effect with almost to callus.  </li>
            <li>this is a product that i will actually reorder, works great and does as it advertises i have the rough feet</li>
            <li>has almost or more than 50% of the Lye as Toilet Drain Openers    </li>
            <li>Like many, I;ve been searching for an effective product to deal with rough dry scaly heels.</li>
            <li>My feet are super soft!</li>
            <li>After reading some reviews, I was positive that this would work for me.  </li>
            <li>Other than that overall its a great product.</li>
            <li>Some items don&#x27;t even soften the callus, so for that reason I think this is a better product and is not completely deceptive in its claims.</li>
            <li>I use it with my nail buffer and  it keeps my pedicure looking fresh and new.</li>
            <li>I swear this is the first time I haven&#x27;t had a HUGE callus on the back of my heel.  </li>
            <li>Following the directions made use of the product easy.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is strong and I saw a big difference after using it once.</li>
            <li>use it with foot creme and large rasp.</li>
            <li>I came home and bought the orange scented large bottle off Amazon, and some vinyl gloves, and have done this at home ever since, did a couple of friend&#x27;s feet, too.  </li>
            <li>I like this product, fast shipping, high quality, easy to use, fast acting 3-5 minutes, I love this product, I will get a big one</li>
            <li>I was careful to follow the instructions exactly as provided, but for me simply using file or egg shaped file and then using their heal lotion to be much more effective if used on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPS didn&#x27;t bother , as the price point is not that big, but luckily Amazon took care of it !</li>
            <li>I left it on for about 5 minutes on each foot, and scrubbed with both a foot file and fine grater-type stainless steel file to remove the skin (you can buy a 4-in-1 foot tool to use with this, which is what I used).  </li>
            <li>Have to pair up with a great little machine like the Tip2Toe or something similar.  </li>
            <li>I do feel a little like the calluses are easier to scrape off, but I honestly think the soaking in the water contributes just as much as the gel does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would have preferred a little more of the callus to be removed so next time I will use more product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it twice so far and my heels are soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Amazing and wonderful, but disgusting!</li>
            <li>It really works</li>
            <li>This product works very well.  </li>
            <li>Much safer than callus</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>it is a solution that once applied to the soles will emove some of the callus  be carefull, your soles are going to be very slippery and on tile you can fall</li>
            <li>It really works...</li>
            <li>Given that I walk barefoot on tile floors all day at home, my whole foot is basically a \\&quot;callus\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It took quite a bit of elbow grease and time, but by the time I was done, my feet were much, much softer and nicer-looking than when I started.  </li>
            <li>Not only is it great to use at home, but I will definitely take it with me to all future pedicures and request that they use it.</li>
            <li>It works very well.  </li>
            <li>Too much walking around the house with no shoes.  </li>
            <li>Because of the condition, I&#x27;m not supposed to file or grate my feet, so I really wanted this stuff to work.</li>
            <li>If you have very calloused feet, you will be underwhelmed.</li>
            <li>it gentle remove all the death skin</li>
            <li>But one day I was walking along and the whole callus fell off.  </li>
            <li>How much would I pay now that I&#x27;ve used it?  </li>
            <li>Pro linc Callus Eliminator is very efficient.</li>
            <li>I choose to rate this product because it really work.</li>
            <li>does it really work?</li>
            <li>Now my feet are so smooth, I only get mini pedicures.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping it would work and was looking forward to the results...</li>
            <li>Also i increased the wait time to 10 minutes and that didnt do much either.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did not find that the treatment did much.  </li>
            <li>This really works - just follow the directions.  </li>
            <li>but this doesn&#x27;t appear to do much if anything.</li>
            <li>Absolutely nothing came off.</li>
            <li>it really works.</li>
            <li>will keep using and hope my feet back to smooth</li>
            <li>i highly recommend this and will buy it again!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this did anything really.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think it does anything.</li>
            <li>This product really works and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>This is the &amp;#34;acid-like&amp;#34; stuff (or it is acid)  that salons use and really does work when applied as directed, keeping it on the longer duration of the range of minutes suggested.</li>
            <li>I think this is what solons use, and so much chaper than paying for a pedicure.  </li>
            <li>Use gloves or finger cots to protect your skin, it really dries them out.</li>
            <li>This really is heaven sent for all feet</li>
            <li>I did not find this product very helpful.  </li>
            <li>I use this instead of getting Spa Pedicure at the nail salon, its much.</li>
            <li>I bought this because my feet have really been taking a beating with me working out running so much.</li>
            <li>My calluses were very embarrassing</li>
            <li>it can really do</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re really flexible, you can probably do this all yourself -- me, not so much.</li>
            <li>This really helps.</li>
            <li>I was very unsatisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Arrive fast and well packed.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have to use much of it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t see much what this does.</li>
            <li>Did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>Then wipe away excess and use a file or buffer to gently remove callus.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>This product really works to get rid of foot callous.</li>
            <li>I used the product on three separate occasions over two weeks, but did not see much in the way of results.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Will absolutely stay in my beauty arsenal.</li>
            <li>I even used it twice in one sitting with a pumice stone after each use and it worked very well.  </li>
            <li>It sure did,but be careful.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m very cautionary on things like that of those types of products.</li>
            <li>I use this product once or twice a month, really does a miracle for my feet.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I ended up not using it as much as I planned because of the chemical smell.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works well.  </li>
            <li>Only a $5 item and ended up costing much more since I took off early from work and had to drive to the post office.</li>
            <li>started using this when they sold it at a salon i used to go to, it&#x27;s the best thing ever and really requires no scraping or cutting, i use it on my heels</li>
            <li>Over time and consistent use, within a few weeks my dry calloused feet improved a great deal.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for about two years and my heels are as soft as a baby&#x27;s!!!  </li>
            <li>Once the girl at the nail salon started using this during her pedicures my heels started becoming dry within a week.</li>
            <li>Listen, I&#x27;m 40-something and live in Arizona, rarely wear shoes, and live in a house that is tiled throughout.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried most products out there and like a lot of other reviewers, I&#x27;ve had this used on me at the salon.  </li>
            <li>This has worked better than other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>But the 2nd time, i soaked my feet very well, applied this and wait for 5 full minutes, wiped off with a towel and buffed.  </li>
            <li>I used it on my heel where I had a tiny crack which quickly turned into a large vefy</li>
            <li>this is a very strong preparation for destroying calluses, if you have abnormally thickened calluses that have to be removed in bulk</li>
            <li>I recommend re-soaking your heels briefly in warm water then patting them dry before continuing to file them; repeat these steps as necessary.  </li>
            <li>rinse your feet in warm water and lastly 5) use a pumice scrubber to gently buff the rough skin off-</li>
            <li>While no product or procedure has ever made my heels baby smooth for long, this product comes close.  </li>
            <li>I used Be Natural Unscented Callus Eliminator first and saw some improvement of my callus.  </li>
            <li>All soft and pretty.  </li>
            <li>After years of walking around on deeply callused feet and feeling embarrassed at nail salons as they kept shaving and shaving off the thick skin on my heels, I finally found something that I can use at home and get wonderful results.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Be Natural Callus Eliminator and I must say it does exactly what it purports to do.</li>
            <li>and I was sooooo anxious to get my own results</li>
            <li>I found it no more effective than soaking my feet in water.</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time and wow</li>
            <li>I used the product as recommended, and I don&#x27;t think it increased the amount I was able to sand down my callouses with my pumice bar.  </li>
            <li>Its like having new feet!  </li>
            <li>it was not brand new!</li>
            <li>Packaging wasn&#x27;t very good, especially considering this is a caustic solution.  </li>
            <li>Some may need more, some less.  </li>
            <li>It melts away callus tissue easily and with minimal elbow grease.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Purchased Dr. Scholl&#x27;s &#x27;ET&#x27; Callus Remover kit (For half the cost of ProLinc) made one application with medicated disk and protective cushion and within forty-eight hours most of the callus on foot was removed.</li>
            <li>After only 1 use my feet are as soft and smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom...</li>
            <li>and I will be doing it weekly to keep my feet looking decent.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely repurchase this in the future :)</li>
            <li>i was hesitant at first but after the first and second try</li>
            <li>Later on that day I felt like I put this junk of my feet for nothing because they had the same calluses as before no change and not even slightly better.</li>
            <li>Anyway, second attempt I tried applying it and then wrapping in plastic wrap - which definitely made it easier to walk to the sink to wash my hands after touching the stuff.  </li>
            <li>Pair this with a quick facial and in 10 min or so, you&#x27;ll have a smoother face and feet.</li>
            <li>She first became aware of the product during a recent visit to a spa and they used it on her and charged her $15.00.</li>
            <li>here are the bullet points for this particular</li>
            <li>i was very good at hiding my feet and most of the previous treatments would only smooth over the top layer and kinda polish them, still leaving the horrible callus.</li>
            <li>the second time, I tried this after soaking in a very hot bubble bath for about 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I just soak my feet in hot water for 10-15 minutes, wipe them with towel and immediately put on ProLinc Callus Eliminator and leave it on for a few minutes (the key word is Immediately, otherwise it will not work as well, by my own experience) .</li>
            <li>If it is on the top you will burn the top skin of your foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Relax and let it sit for about 7-8 min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use a pumice stone or nail file to file down the dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend watching the video on the Prolinc site because they show you how to use a paper towel so that the stuff stays put.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for those of us who struggle with calluses.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised because I have used a lot of more expensive products that had me doing lots of arm/handwork scrubbing to get results like this..and took a lot more time too.  </li>
            <li>and it was a little better.</li>
            <li>Re-soaked my feet with a little soap and scrubbed a bit more.</li>
            <li>I think I was expecting a little more out of it than I got</li>
            <li>I put lotion on and my feet were so smooth they were slipping out of my flip flops.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally leave reviews</li>
            <li>No merchandise second speed is so good, the effect is not very good</li>
            <li>It did work fine on calluses, but you have to be very careful not to get on softer tissue.  </li>
            <li>I used a very coarse foot file and the skin comes right off.  </li>
            <li>I then unwrapped , rinsed and used a Microplane Colossal foot file , the hard callus just melted away, super easy, I scrubbed them for about 5 minutes each, I then put on the dry heel eliminator and some socks.</li>
            <li>I live in a year-round warm climate and usually wear sandals--and the soles of my feet show it!</li>
            <li>You do have to use a little power and a good buffer to remove the rough skin, but it does come off.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t call it any new miracle solution, but it remove some callused skin from my feet.</li>
            <li>I new</li>
            <li>The new nail salon I went to would have spa pedicures and included the Callus remover.</li>
            <li>I have since moved and they new place I go to does not have this</li>
            <li>but after washing off the rest my feet, they looked and felt  brand new</li>
            <li>It looks like I got new feet.  </li>
            <li>From this company    and    the State of New Jersey.gov</li>
            <li>A heavy-duty moisturizer will keep newly exposed skin supple.</li>
            <li>I feel like a new woman.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even wait for my new pumas stone to get her</li>
            <li>However I do not like this procedure because i have hard time to make my heels nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I was thinking the extra money might be worth it, and when I looked at my baby soft feet, it was.</li>
            <li>whole process takes a while: soak your feet, leave the callus remover on for about five minutes, pumice the rough skin away, but I would say the time is worth the end result...</li>
            <li>What this product does is to burn away any old skin on your body, btw, your whole body is covered with old skin.</li>
            <li>I tried it on several different occasions and followed the directions precisely</li>
            <li>I would be very careful while using this product because it is so very powerful and can burn your skin.</li>
            <li>I like this product very much, but you should definitely use gloves when applying.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised when I felt my feet afterwards.</li>
            <li>I had a salon use this on my feet during a pedicure and they got some on the soft part of the bottom of my foot (right in the middle)</li>
            <li>my feet are very soft now - not sure if it was the sally hansen filed plus this product, but i like my feel now :)</li>
            <li>It works ok, but seems much weaker than I expected, leaving some rough skin intact even after soaking, leaving the solution on for 5 minutes, then using a pumice bar and file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Be natural should be called beripoff!</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>Pretty simple to use.  </li>
            <li>I left it on 3 minutes the first time, because I was nervous.  </li>
            <li>they were baby soft!  </li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly and even left it on for longer than suggested and there still were no results.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly and even left it on for longer than suggested and there still were no results.</li>
            <li>When I wiped it all off after 5 minutes I thought my foot felt like I had just got out of the shower, but within 15 minutes my feet felt exactly the same as before.</li>
            <li>My husband always said I look like i have heels of a hundred year old lady (at 30!).  </li>
            <li>Soft feet!</li>
            <li>it was like baby soft skin on my heels!</li>
            <li>I read the other reviews and was so excited about this.  </li>
            <li>Anyhow, I used it after showering and it took the dead skin right off!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to keep your feet looking pretty all year long.</li>
            <li>The active ingredient of this product is Potassium Hydroxide, lye, used to clean clogged drains.    </li>
            <li>These two together make the skin easily slough off without harsh rubbing or shaving.</li>
            <li>I can use it on my own convenience &amp; it only takes a few minutes!</li>
            <li>Wow, I&#x27;m not usually prone to writing to reviews, but had to do so for this product.  </li>
            <li>Worked well enough when I used it twice to get the majority of a super stubborn callus in the crook of my big toe off.</li>
            <li>Guess what your feet will turn out better than they would if you paid $35 to sit in a chair for 11 minutes while being exposed to germs from other patrons that were clearly not eliminated from everything.</li>
            <li>I also recommend that you apply with a tounge depressor or other item to smooth the product over skin, I would not suggest using your bare hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to stick to the cheap little foot cheese grater and be done with it.</li>
            <li>but if I left it on a little longer it would probably work even better.</li>
            <li>Do you know how hard it is to find cute dress shoes that are closed-toe and closed-heel?</li>
            <li>applied the gel and wrapped my foot in clear plastic wrap....</li>
            <li>I read the directions clearly and put a generous amount on my feet and then used a foot file and nothing.</li>
            <li>Softened rough patches but really didn&#x27;t do the whole work of a spa pedi.  </li>
            <li>Really works at getting off calluses but you have to keep doing it or they just grow back.</li>
            <li>Used properly, it does the job very well.</li>
            <li>Use Natural Sierra Pumice Stone instead.  </li>
            <li>Natural Callus</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only thing that works really well after one application.  </li>
            <li>I was completely amazed at the difference it made.  </li>
            <li>even on the outer edge near my pinky toes ..</li>
            <li>But it is a hassle if u are a busy person</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to touch it then rinse with water for baby soft feet ..</li>
            <li>For someone who has covered her feet up her whole life this is such a relief.</li>
            <li>Maybe it only works on REALLY callused feet.....</li>
            <li>Iit does the job very well, but in addition to just simply working it makes your skin like baby skin.</li>
            <li>i recommend ,I have feet really soft</li>
            <li>Rather than save time, I had to take off work early to make it to the post office in time to pick it up and sign for it.</li>
            <li>I tried this product several times and it did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>and it made my foot baby soft.</li>
            <li>B00011JZWW Be Natural Unscented Callus Eliminator 4 oz.]]&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I tried this product several times and it did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>Your feet will be softer (it softens the callus), but this far hasn&#x27;t removed them.</li>
            <li>I used it only once and really did not like the outcome.  </li>
            <li>No harsh smells</li>
            <li>and wow.</li>
            <li>and they were so soft afterwards that i couldn&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li>After using this product for many months I want to change my review rating to a five, BUT there is, at least when I am using this product, a trick to making this product work.</li>
            <li>/&gt;\\&quot;Be Natural Callus</li>
            <li>And I got the same result as when I do this straight out of the shower AGAIN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that this item worked as indicated.</li>
            <li>my feet are so soft.  </li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t burn any sensitive skin that&#x27;s not calloused.</li>
            <li>Using gloves i opened the bottle to see how much was left inside</li>
            <li>I now use one a month to keep my feet&#x27;s looking and feeling soft.</li>
            <li>I bought Amlactin to rub into my feet, and that keeps the skin soft.</li>
            <li>: Be Natural Callus Eliminator&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>hint for those people that have sensitive skin/are scared of the product getting on their \\&quot;uncallused\\&quot; skin....use Vaseline to corral the product where it is needed.  </li>
            <li>It made my foot soft after using the product but it did make a dent in the campus on my foot.</li>
            <li>Unbelievably soft.</li>
            <li>and WOW I paid 1/4 of the cost with shipping.  </li>
            <li>Just a few minutes and your in your way to smooth feet.  </li>
            <li>, I had it pretty thick, I think I did a bit to much because my heel was a bit sore at first</li>
            <li>&quot;, I said sure, she whispered, \\&quot;eight dollar\\&quot;, but I heard her, I went a head with it, she popped out this callus eliminator, applied it to my very crusty heels, afew minutes later she was using a regular file and rolls of dead skin</li>
            <li>My heels are pink and normal looking for the first time in years.</li>
            <li>After three uses my feet have barely visible cracks!!!  </li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s a little soft and I will watch it by keeping the area moist and clean with lotion.</li>
            <li>Feet are really pretty dry otherwise.  </li>
            <li>A little grossed out on how much it took off the first time I used this.</li>
            <li>The bottle with Earth Friendly green printing?    </li>
            <li>but if it helps just one other person with the problem feet like mine then it is worth it.</li>
            <li>Seriously gang, this product works as well or better than what they use professionally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>If its not its pretty close because my feet feel better than any expensive pedicure I&#x27;ve ever paid for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Is it worth the whole mess and rubber gloves and potential poison storage problems?</li>
            <li>I give them another quick soak to wash off the rest of the callus stuff and dead skin and apply the lotion, and my feet are just so soft.    </li>
            <li>when using this product, don&#x27;t apply too much for long time.</li>
            <li>I work in retail, and the bottoms of my feet get pretty rough.  </li>
            <li>I suspect that AII may of shifted to a weaker or more watered down version due to misuse or burns.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for more dramatic results than what I normally get...</li>
            <li>Yes, I,d highly recommend to anybody who has severe callus-corn probs.....was big big help for my feet callus-corn problems so far!</li>
            <li>I got a $72 pedicure in this really nice spa and saw how the person buffed away my dead skin with little effort.</li>
            <li>Anyhow I live this product &amp; will definitely buy again when I run out!</li>
            <li>A new bottle arrived 2 days later.</li>
            <li>Definitely want to soak your feet first and don&#x27;t leave it on for too long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many callus removing-implements, some of them very fancy and expensive (Diamencel) and none of them work as well as this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve searched high and low for a product that actually removes calluses the way that professional nail salons do.</li>
            <li>I later found the exact same product at a local beauty supply store for a comparable price.  </li>
            <li>Dead skin comes right off leaving my heels soft almost like a baby&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>the next morning I was literally 100% clear..</li>
            <li>As the directions state, it&#x27;s definitely not a good idea to use this when you&#x27;ve got open sores as I did, but it sure removed the callous.</li>
            <li>when using this it will temporarily make the skin on your fingers peel if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>I went for a pedicure while on vacation in Texas and the guy was complaining about how I must walk around in bare feet all the time, blah, blah, blah.  </li>
            <li>However when I bought it myself and applied 2 applications, it barely made a dent.</li>
            <li>It barely did anything</li>
            <li>I spent the afternoon working on my feet really pampering them.  </li>
            <li>I have heavy calluses on my big toes and have used a callus remover that I found in the drug store that really didn&#x27;t do much.  </li>
            <li>I believed it.&lt;br /&gt;Not even when this quemical touched my bare skin i got a reaction...none.</li>
            <li>Something along the lines of a acid that burns through if you are not careful.  </li>
            <li>and I have had a crack from time to time if I am not careful)  </li>
            <li>it will look worse before it looks better.</li>
            <li>The texture of the liquid is smooth and sort of thick.</li>
            <li>For some reason, my feet get very callused, and usually, even after the pedicurist scrapes them, they are still kinda hard, even though very smooth.</li>
            <li>Also, make sure you apply a thick quantity as it tends to dry out.</li>
            <li>I use this once every week &amp; half after shower, to save me from having to soak my feet first.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping for a miracle callus eliminator gel like some of these other reviewers warned us about.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products without seeing a difference in my really cracked heels.</li>
            <li>Just be very careful when applying because your feet become very slippery - I do not recommend standing up once applied.</li>
            <li>Use it with gloves though and try very little, when using for the first time!</li>
            <li>Seriously, the inconvenience was miniscule, the customer service was fantastic.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions and was expecting a more dramatic result.  </li>
            <li>American International    Be NATURAL Callous Eliminator    </li>
            <li>The whole layer of dead skin came off effortlessly, my heels were completely renewed.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping I could use this to stop the deep down callus from coming back, but, it is only useful for heels, and toes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price, you need very little.</li>
            <li>I am doing the exact same thing my previous nail salon did.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very calloused feet due to a medical condition.</li>
            <li>It did exactly what it said it would do it remove so much dead skin and callus skin on my feet.</li>
            <li>You have to have a metal file or something pretty sturdy to help you file off all the dead skin after soaking your feet.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good..kinda messy</li>
            <li>At first, it looks like you are getting A LOT of dead skin off your feet.  </li>
            <li>well worth the money and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Professional grade (as this claims to be, and frankly is the same product I&#x27;ve seen at my local salon where I get to treat myself to the occasional pedicure) is not the same as industrial/medical grade that I might need.  </li>
            <li>natural by ProLinc dry heel eliminator</li>
            <li>Although this is my first time using something like this, I took extra precaution after reading the reviews expecting it to be harsh.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought many products from the store in the past, but they were a waste of money..</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t take long before I was satisfied that enough of the tough skin was gone.</li>
            <li>that I come across that looks promising only to be let down.</li>
            <li>I practically live in flip flops all year long, as long as its over 50</li>
            <li>This stuff really worked on my rough, dry, cracked, callused feet.</li>
            <li>Perhaps if you are the type with only mild callusing this would take care of it for you, but for the elephant-footed (such as myself) it&#x27;s going to be hard for any one product to do the job.</li>
            <li>Well, at least as pretty as my feet can get!</li>
            <li>It price is way better on amazon, locally they sell a small bottle less than one ounce for 5.99 this bottle is 4 oz , looks like it will last a long time.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing it ate through all the thick hard skin in no time.  </li>
            <li>This is the only product that I found that works instantly to repair dry, cracked,and hard heels after trying so many other things that did not work for me.</li>

            <li> i love it works really great!</li>
            <li> Get a pedicure every couple of weeks in my own home without having to pay $25 each time!</li>
            <li> It worked successfully in removing the callus.</li>
            <li> lol thank you for this product I&#x27;m satisfied!</li>
            <li> I think it is amazing and does a great job.  </li>
            <li> Worked good when I used it.</li>
            <li> and none of them worked as good as this product.</li>
            <li> Even though getting a pedicure &#x27;done&#x27; at the salon feels good</li>
            <li> I go for pedicures &amp; feel so good when I leave.  </li>
            <li> We tried skipping that step and the results were not as good at all.  </li>
            <li> Have a good foot file.  </li>
            <li> This works good, but it is not a miracle worker.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Also, you have to wash your feet really good.</li>
            <li> my feet never felt so good.</li>
            <li> Finishing with a good moisturizer helps a lot too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Demo</li>
            <li> Works as good as Draino.....</li>
            <li> I use it a lot and its good</li>
            <li> a good saving.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this is a good cosmetic product but not medicinal strength.</li>
            <li> find that if I use this product every two weeks, my feet look good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, this may be great for people who can&#x27;t put in the elbow grease, or have baby calluses, or have never tried shaving/filing their own calluses to begin</li>
            <li> Accompany this with foot pedi-file and foot razor and your good to go.</li>
            <li> Item received in good condition.</li>
            <li> I just got fair results.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll have good results.</li>
            <li> Had to go to salon for good results.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t looked this good in years.</li>
            <li> This is a good callus remover.  </li>
            <li> This product works Sooo good.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s very potent, there is no odor</li>
            <li> It was better cause it worked great and</li>
            <li> Love it works great just like going to the spa</li>
            <li> I tried this based on all of the great reviews--and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>

            <li> This is an extremely effective product.  </li>
            <li> just as much as I would had I not used this product.. not too impressed..</li>
            <li> I just soaked my feet with so epson salt and warm water for about 10 minutes, applied the remover, waited for 5 min and then used a foot file.</li>
            <li> Really effective for callus&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m fiarly impressed but not as much as i&#x27;d hoped.  </li>
            <li> Soak feet in warm water to prepare feet - about 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> This has a nice smell.  </li>
            <li> Works nicely.</li>
            <li> and this was a great way to get rid of all the hardened scaly skin and start fresh with some good at home foot care.</li>
            <li> It really works and it is one of the best products if you walk around barefoot and want softer feet.</li>
            <li> honest.  </li>
            <li> SINCE MY PURCHASE, I TAKE THIS ITEM WITH ME TO THE NAIL AND PEDICURE SALON AND USE MY OWN PRODUCT INSTEAD OF PAYING $3.00 TO USE THEIR APPLICATION.</li>
            <li> THEY DO NOT LIKE IT AND SOME OF THE SALONS WILL NOT ALLOW ME TO USE MY OWN PRODUCT,</li>
            <li> WHY CAN&#x27;T I USE MY OWN PRODUCT WHEN I AM STILL PAYING FOR THE SERVICE</li>
            <li> It is strong but will work best with the right tools.</li>
            <li> This is more effective than some, but not overly effective.</li>
            <li> Its very strong chemical and SHOULD ALWAYS WEAR GLVOES BEFORE USING IT.</li>
            <li> I can tell you my feet are just wonderful now, and so soft</li>
            <li> /&gt;Luckily I was able to purchase my own bottle of this product and in between salon pedicures</li>
            <li> It says to wait 3-5 minutes and after about 2 min I hastily started lightly scrubbing (it works so good</li>
            <li> Instructions are easy to follow (and please do, or else it could get messy/painful!).  </li>
            <li> Much cheaper than a pedicure and also good for in-between maintenance!</li>
            <li> Great product and very fast</li>
            <li> It worked great even the first time.  </li>
            <li> I first experienced this product at a nail salon (for an additional $5).</li>
            <li> very gentle to the skin, but very effective at softening callouses.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product for your feet, if you want your feet soft when you get out the shower</li>
            <li> I use it once a week at home and it makes a HUGE difference!</li>
            <li> but I think I still need more time to use it</li>
            <li> I tried and it worked much better.</li>
            <li> , I got most of the callous off but not all</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try to find a better product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much better it feels..</li>
            <li> Too many days in flip flops.  </li>
            <li> Better foot file took off tons of callous.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff..</li>
            <li> I then tried 7 min and that was the magical number.</li>
            <li> Make sure you soak your feet for 10 min before applying.</li>
            <li> I think the recommended one will be better though.  </li>
            <li> This sure saves on the upcharge when I go get a pedicure.  </li>
            <li> Okay so I never review products on Amazon</li>
            <li> but I did notice my skin felt better after I scrubbed them...</li>
            <li> Made my feet nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> I was born and raised in South Florida and was almost always barefoot :)</li>
            <li> I got this only because the reviews were so awesome.</li>
            <li> cover your foot with the plastic wrap and make sure the area that you used to apply the eliminator is on the bottom of your feet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just okay.  </li>
            <li> This worked ok for me.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t burn my skin at all and helped remove more than just a pumice by itself would do but don&#x27;t expect a miracle.</li>
            <li> , already ordered two more bottles.</li>
            <li> I did the recommended process on the bottle, it would work even better.</li>
            <li> I did the same thing with my husband&#x27;s feet and he was very happy with result as well.</li>
            <li> it is better that a pedicurist</li>
            <li> Many are undettered and still   use this product    </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Saving more than the cost of the product.</li>
            <li> Even better when you add a Swiss foot file to scrub off the callouses.</li>
            <li> I have used this product many times.</li>
            <li> Works good,but since I use the O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Healthy Feet Creme, I haven&#x27;t need to use this at all.</li>
            <li> Follow the directions, this stuff is potent.  </li>
            <li> I thought maybe I should try it again to be for sure,</li>
            <li> Could be stronger or more directions.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t incredibly pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> It did however make my hands peel, so maybe my feet are just rougher than most others.</li>
            <li> SO, after reading more reviews, I decided to try again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had calloused feet for many, many years.  </li>
            <li> My feet are baby smooth!  </li>
            <li> Much better than filing and filing my feet and produces a better and smoother result.</li>
            <li> but it is fantastic!</li>
            <li> A fantastic way to remove caluses on my feet, cuticles on fingers and toes!</li>
            <li> is a fantastic product!</li>
            <li> sure</li>
            <li> This is one of the better pedicure products that will save you money so you don&#x27;t need so many pedicures.</li>
            <li> this product is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I am sure any lotion would work for that purpose also, but Vaseline won&#x27;t slip around or drip.</li>
            <li> So pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> I use this weekly in conjunction with nightly BioOil and heel socks and my feet have never looked better.</li>
            <li> Definitely soak your feet before use, apply to heels and wash hands after, scrub with the ped egg after 3-5 mins then wash it all away and repeat...repeat...til you&#x27;ve got perfect heels!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m convinced those nails salons will pretend anything works, so they can charge you more money.</li>
            <li> am pleased.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything miraculous, for sure.</li>
            <li> This product did its job and more for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure if I had followed directions</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I thought this product was just okay.</li>
            <li> I used to be an exotic dancer.</li>
            <li> I read alot of reviews which I was pleased with.</li>
            <li> The instructions on the bottle warn you not to leave the gel on more than 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I switched to better shoe and the callus was gone in 3 months.</li>
            <li> It was okay by my standards.</li>
            <li> The good side is, right after the pedicures</li>
            <li> The reviews are REAL , my feet havent felt like this since I was a child !!!!</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> Super soft, callus removed evenly, im very happy!!</li>
            <li> Tried this on a callus that turned out to be a wart, and did a pretty dang good job of removing the excess skin.  </li>
            <li> Give your feet a good scrub and soak first then use it.</li>
            <li> I have to leave it on for the full five minutes for it to be effective...</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good product.  </li>
            <li> and he was blown away by how quickly it worked and how effective it is.</li>
            <li> Maybe I received a defective item, but with this many good reviews I really tried to wait</li>
            <li> most important</li>
            <li> It is cheap and more efficient.  </li>
            <li> Product really does a great job if a couple of things are true:    </li>
            <li> They are soft and presentable, they look great</li>
            <li> It softens the callus which made a more comfortable removal.</li>
            <li> my feet were so smooth and my heels looked so healthy.</li>
            <li> But be care with surrounding skin to avoid damage to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;So happy to find BE NATURAL</li>
            <li> and this really did a good job.  </li>
            <li> Key is you need a good scrubber!</li>
            <li> Cannot say enough good things about this product!</li>
            <li> Melts the calluses like butter for easy removal.</li>
            <li> I went easy</li>
            <li> I use it in conjunction with the Denco Easy Grip Foot Smoother.  </li>
            <li> This does the trick and very quickly.</li>
            <li> It works well &amp; easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, the smell is acceptable.</li>
            <li> It makes it easy to take of calluses.  </li>
            <li> Use with caution because this is strong stuff.  </li>
            <li> It is strong, but that is what makes it work.</li>
            <li> It is strong stuff though.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem as strong as the description and instructions lead me to believe.  </li>
            <li> This product requires a better pumice than natural pumice to get good results.</li>
            <li> Very fast &amp; effective.  </li>
            <li> It was pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say I have never given a more glowing review of a product, and if choose your own rating were an option, 5 stars would not be enough.</li>
            <li> I tried this first at a pedicure and decided to buy my own bottle.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use and leave your feet soft and nice.</li>
            <li> lol I highly recommend pairing this product with the Microplane Colossal Pedicure Foot Rasp, which I also purchased here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It was fine on my heels, but it caused cuts and burns on the side of my ankle and side of the foot as well.</li>
            <li> It is great product, make the work much easy , I have dry skin from nature and have to spend a lot of time with my feet, I love to walk home without shoes and we know what the effect of it is ..</li>
            <li> give you the easy results, and smooth skin that this stuff does.</li>
            <li> This product is fine.  </li>
            <li> I use a fine paint brush &amp; they are removed with in a couple minutes.</li>
            <li> It peeled skin on my feet where I applied it, but it didn&#x27;t feel good and the areas felt very sensitive.</li>
            <li> Make your feet soft, Good on price, Easy to use, Use it with a scrubber, Cheaper on Amazon send the salon</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s useful to my dad and we all like it~&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;ll be better if effect more quickly</li>
            <li> Follow the directions precisely.  </li>
            <li> Your heels will be so smooth.  </li>
            <li> Now I can do it myself for cheap.</li>
            <li> I save so much $$ doing my own pedicures at home.</li>
            <li> Works great, low odor.</li>
            <li> I cannot get over how fantastic they feel.  </li>
            <li> However, sores excepted, my heels are almost baby-butt smooth.</li>
            <li> I found that my heels became smooth a LOT faster this way.  </li>
            <li> It worked fabulously.  </li>
            <li> But it on my calluses for like 4-5 mins, wipe off excess, microplane &amp; smooth out.</li>
            <li> I would be happy to order the extra strength version, but this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> This stuff gets my feet so smooth.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t sand them smooth while showering.</li>
            <li> my feet feel smoother than before and free of calluses</li>
            <li> I like &#x27;mediterranean olive almond &amp; sage WONDERBALM&#x27; by Boots available at Target.</li>
            <li> Oh, the calluses on feet re-grow smooth.</li>
            <li> My feet are incredibly smooth and callous free.</li>
            <li> I just discovered this SO CHEAP after spending years at the pedi place.  </li>
            <li> My feet were baby smooth afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I think there should be more detailed instructions for use but overall its good.</li>
            <li> follow the directions....be attentive to where this mixture trails on your skin.....</li>
            <li> My feet are smooth.</li>
            <li> Maybe it works on extremely light callouses.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the same stuff that was used when I had a pedicure and the guy was able to get a good bit of the callus and cracked heals taken care of.  </li>
            <li> You will  not be surprised over your outcome, because this product does a good job in ridding callouses.</li>
            <li> finally something that works as good as the salon where I go for pedicures - they still get me as a client but in between my feet love me for using this</li>
            <li> This would be a good product for regular foot maintenance but for me didn&#x27;t work for a more severe callus.</li>
            <li> To give you an idea of what I am working with, I am 48 years old, and I have always taken good care of feet..</li>
            <li> i must admit the product itself is pretty good but was expecting the bottle to come exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> Make sure you wash your hands right away after applying or use gloves.</li>
            <li> this product is very useful for me.</li>
            <li> It sure is a good addition to my pedicure routine - it helps my heels and sides of my feel feel so much more smooth with less scrubbing</li>
            <li> I gave this stuff another try mainly because some reviewers actually liked it</li>
            <li> So glad I bought it and used it for the first time tonight...</li>
            <li> and it is totally worth it, espcially with summer coming up!</li>
            <li> you can too by using the same tools that the pros use in the privacy of your own home!</li>
            <li> between use of CE, I suggest use of rich creams and socks at night.</li>
            <li> but it is not a home use product friendly item.</li>
            <li> Was so excited to get this product and try out.  </li>
            <li> I then wipe off my feet with a clean towel and use the foot scrapper.  </li>
            <li> I refuse to pay $$$ for professional foot treatments, and this is the next best option.</li>
            <li> My pedicurist regularly uses this product with great success.  </li>
            <li> Great product works very well with no harsh odors .A</li>
            <li> Hopefully the next product I try will be more effective.</li>
            <li> After reading so many positive reviews I decided to give this product a try.  </li>
            <li> I use a large &amp;#34;cheese grater&amp;#34; looking thing and the two things together are fabulous!</li>
            <li> It makes a difference right away!</li>
            <li> The first time I noticed a HUGE difference in my feet, and by the third use my feet looked AMAZING!  </li>
            <li> I used this for the first time last night, and I was extremely happy.  </li>
            <li> The Callus Eliminator worked great at first, but the calluses would come back and had to re apply it.  </li>
            <li> Leave it on for the full amount of time after soaking your feet and then just file away...</li>
            <li> A whole lot more than this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I soak my feet about five minutes, then put the product on, and then soak again for about five minutes, put a bit more product on, and let sit for about five minutes, GENTLY wipe the product off, and use a pumice stone.</li>
            <li> This is close as I&#x27;ve come to a professional pedicure in the comfort of my own home.  </li>
            <li> I work retail and go to college full time</li>
            <li> As good as it did I will only have to use it once a week.</li>
            <li> When I ordered it, I was SO excited that I might be able to have soft, smooth feet.</li>
            <li> (it doesn&#x27;t rinse easily so wipe first) 4)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lucky to have a bench in my shower</li>
            <li> This product arrived early and really does a good job on callus.  </li>
            <li> It works okay, but I think the way it would work better is if you actually had someone to put it on for you and you could sit with them elevated after soaking, so</li>
            <li> I have an old trick that works better (but still not 100% callus free).</li>
            <li> I tried all kind of stuffs that do not really work.&lt;br /&gt;The product does exactly as it claims for a great price.&lt;br /&gt;Instruction is clear.</li>
            <li> I love wearing high heels, as well as  sandals, flip flops, and walking barefoot.  </li>
            <li> It is very effective and with regular use, your feet will remain sandal ready.</li>
            <li> By far the best Callus Eliminator I&#x27;ve ever used and the only one that really works when doing at home.  </li>
            <li> I got visible results after the very first use.  </li>
            <li> I tried this product twice as directed, and it didn&#x27;t do anything more than a normal soak and scrub</li>
            <li> Does a great job at breaking down the callus.</li>
            <li> It really softens the roughness and callus so that they are easily removed.</li>
            <li> Pretty feet!</li>
            <li> I soaked my feet first, applied the product and pumiced away!  </li>
            <li> Exactly as described...a wonder!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still better than not using anything, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s strong enough to warrant wearing gloves for protection.  </li>
            <li> it works very quick (2 minutes) but make sure you have a scrubby and such</li>
            <li> Just recently moved to a very dry climate and this stuff works great!!</li>
            <li> Sometimes I have to repeat the cycle twice to really get my feet smooth</li>
            <li> and/or your feet aren&#x27;t heavily calloused, it will probably work great for you.</li>
            <li> I soaked my feet in warm water for 10 minutes and left the stuff on for the directed amount of time, but I still had to do a couple of rounds.</li>
            <li> This was not as effective as callus remover I&#x27;ve purchased at local drug stores.</li>
            <li> Maybe they have more sensitive feet?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It was totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Well, I don&#x27;t take time to do the full soak first then apply, wait &amp; scrub.  </li>
            <li> I think a professional may do better</li>
            <li> Eliminator\\&quot; isn&#x27;t a miracle product, but it does a good job of removing rough skin and calluses on your feet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I soaked my feet for 10 minutes, then applied the eliminator directly on my heels and covered with a gauze 4x4 ans soaked some more</li>
            <li> Something like the Microcplane Colossal Pedicure Rasp or Danco Callus Shaver.  </li>
            <li> , I only did it on my own feet.  </li>
            <li> This is worth the time and money.</li>
            <li> Use it in conjunction with the Microplane Colossal Pedicure Rasp.  </li>
            <li> Massage it into your feet just like lotion until you skin has absorbed it.</li>
            <li> It does an okay job, but it is far from &amp;#34;natural!&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> I do my own pedicures and this is an essential step.  </li>
            <li> This eliminator does a good job with a partially removed callus that has been prepped by Dr. Scholls.  </li>
            <li> B00756HQNQ Microplane Brown Colossal Pedicure Foot Rasp]]</li>
            <li> it softens the dead skin and makes scrubbing so much more effective.</li>
            <li> I would suggest that you do a good job in soaking feet prior to use and you will really see how miraculous this product is.</li>
            <li> its definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I still use the lotion after I shower, but other then that I dont do anything different, I still walk around my foot barefoot lol and no problems :)</li>
            <li> This stuff works very well, and is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I guess my calluses are the toughest of all Amazon planet because I didn&#x27;t get this thing to work as good as other users claim they did.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cure cancer or save the rainforest as some of the other reviews might lead you to believe, but it does help take a layer of callus off the with aid of a good pumice scrubbing.</li>
            <li> takes the callused right off no problem.</li>
            <li> and they were out so their customer service called me right away and offered me the orange one.  </li>
            <li> I applied the product right after I finish showering, so</li>
            <li> Right</li>
            <li> The callus comes right off.</li>
            <li> Do this right before bed.</li>
            <li> AND I put my feet in water right away to soak while the solution was still on,  </li>
            <li> The skin will just fall right off</li>
            <li> I get rid of the calluses on my own at home, using exactly the same process and tools as they use at the salon.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve tried this twice over the past two days and even after using this product as the instructions on the bottle indicated, I had to do a GREAT deal of buffing with a foot file..</li>
            <li> After reading the great reviews I purchased this, didn&#x27;t work for me, not sure if it was expired</li>
            <li> I normally always upgrade my pedicure to have this product applied, but it&#x27;s a huge cost saver to DIY.</li>
            <li> I needed something that was quick and effective and this fits the bill perfectly as it had my feet back to its natural soft and touchable state in less than 30 minutes (soaking included)!  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re not supposed to scrub too hard or you&#x27;ll remove too many layers of skin) and could not believe how nice my feet felt.</li>
            <li> The price and super fast shipping can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> I the heels of my feet were perfectly smooth, I could feel normally for the first time in literally years..</li>
            <li> Also it shipped super fast.  </li>
            <li> and I meet personalities in top social status.</li>
            <li> While proper application to caluses is not dangerous, be sure not to get this product on any non-calloused skin.  </li>
            <li> After one easy application, my feet are so smoothe and soft.  </li>
            <li> while i use it, it make my feet skin very soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li> This is a good product for callus feet on the top, but not for deep down spot callus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it before and it was very good at dealing with tough callus&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> Still worked very very well.  </li>
            <li> Ever since I started getting pedicures, I have suffered with very very cracked heals.</li>
            <li> I have had calloused feet my whole life, and have tried different soaks, scrubs, scrapers, blades, etc., all to varying degrees of success, but nothing has worked as easily and as quickly as this product.</li>
            <li> My feet feel soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> the first time I used it</li>
            <li> Still it works ok enough to keep, but I&#x27;ll try to contact AII to ask about this change before reordering.</li>
            <li> This callus eliminator really helps, moreover without injuring the feet!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product does exactly as it claims for a great price and the bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> The product works better than what I get in a salon, and the results last longer.  </li>
            <li> After using it several times, it works okay, but I didn&#x27;t find it to be the miracle product I was hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> highly recommended !!</li>
            <li> It also probably something you need to do on more of a regular basis.</li>
            <li> This product really works!</li>
            <li> The first time.</li>
            <li> I used the product twice the first week</li>
            <li> Whether you are a man or woman (I am a man), if you are not well groomed, trust me that the people around you will notice it FAST!</li>
            <li> I say it is worth the money I have so much callus</li>
            <li> It pairs very well with the Microplane Brown Colossal Pedicure Foot Rasp, which I also purchased on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I did exactly what the directions said to do faithfully.  </li>
            <li> Used it exactly as directed, no problems.</li>
            <li> My MIL says she uses this exact product at her salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> first bottle I received was leaking (which is bound to happen sometimes), so I reported it.</li>
            <li> I do not trust third parties to work on my feet as I believe I will do better than somebody else.</li>
            <li> Once i purchased this product, I have no problem with my regular pedi any more.</li>
            <li> The first time I had this used on my feet at the nail salon</li>
            <li> Make sure you apply on your calculus only!</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll have soft, smooth skin on your heels.</li>
            <li> my feet were soft and without callus free.</li>
            <li> I first learned  about this product while having a pedicure</li>
            <li> This thing really works!</li>
            <li> thanks you!</li>
            <li> The first time I did it after a shower.  </li>
            <li> so next time I will use more and see how it works.  </li>
            <li> so far so smooth for my me time...</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> Its okay will continue to use daily have</li>
            <li> When I tried this the first time, I soaked for 5 minutes then applied the product for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> I packaged it up better and shipped it back.  </li>
            <li> It has some pretty toxic ingredients that will take the skin off anything it touches...</li>
            <li> Take a hot shower.</li>
            <li> My feet were soft and smooth for over a month.  </li>
            <li> first time I tried this I soaked my feet for about 10 minutes, then put the solution on for about 5.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty bad/thick callouses</li>
            <li> Works extremely fast!</li>
            <li> For years, I have suffered from a deep callous buildup on my pinkie toe, to the point where I could not even wear most shoes without screaming pain.</li>
            <li> On my first application with this product, the majority of the callous buildup is gone.</li>
            <li> If used correctly it really works!</li>
            <li> My feet are soft and callus free.</li>
            <li> My wife absolutely swears by this stuff and she is picky about her beauty products!</li>
            <li> After the first test, I knew it was.</li>
            <li> does exactly what its supposed to do in one treatment.</li>
            <li> and you will have smooth, silky, baby soft feet.</li>
            <li> The products works really well too!</li>
            <li> So the first time, I followed the instructions.  </li>
            <li> However, it didn&#x27;t work for me after the first time using it.</li>
            <li> It performs exactly as described.</li>
            <li> You definitely have to make sure you use an aplicator and don&#x27;t get it on your fingers.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews, I thought for sure I had finally found a callous remover that truly did what it advertised.  </li>
            <li> I was able to remove some callous skin on my heels, but it keeps coming back.  </li>
            <li> This works really good at removing the dead skin on your feet, but you have to wear gloves.</li>
            <li> Soaked my feet, dried them, applied the product fairly generously, waited five minutes, rubbed a pumice stone on my heel, and</li>
            <li> This eliminator is good in the sense that it removes all the dead skin</li>
            <li> AND IT IS EASY AND SHOWS MAJOR RESULTS A MUST HAVE.</li>
            <li> Works as in salon, highly recommend, quick fix in home set up</li>
            <li> WOW!!!!</li>
            <li> WOW!!!!</li>
            <li> Much better for me than going to the nail salon, I paid about the same for the one time pedicure as I did for the large bottle of this.</li>
            <li> if that changes in the future, I will certainly update the review with more information.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and while it did make my feet feel good right after applying it, the feeling didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Even after just one use it creates an amazing and lasting soft effect with almost to callus.  </li>
            <li> this is a product that i will actually reorder, works great and does as it advertises i have the rough feet</li>
            <li> has almost or more than 50% of the Lye as Toilet Drain Openers    </li>
            <li> Like many, I;ve been searching for an effective product to deal with rough dry scaly heels.</li>
            <li> My feet are super soft!</li>
            <li> After reading some reviews, I was positive that this would work for me.  </li>
            <li> Other than that overall its a great product.</li>
            <li> Some items don&#x27;t even soften the callus, so for that reason I think this is a better product and is not completely deceptive in its claims.</li>
            <li> I use it with my nail buffer and  it keeps my pedicure looking fresh and new.</li>
            <li> I swear this is the first time I haven&#x27;t had a HUGE callus on the back of my heel.  </li>
            <li> Following the directions made use of the product easy.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is strong and I saw a big difference after using it once.</li>
            <li> use it with foot creme and large rasp.</li>
            <li> I came home and bought the orange scented large bottle off Amazon, and some vinyl gloves, and have done this at home ever since, did a couple of friend&#x27;s feet, too.  </li>
            <li> I like this product, fast shipping, high quality, easy to use, fast acting 3-5 minutes, I love this product, I will get a big one</li>
            <li> I was careful to follow the instructions exactly as provided, but for me simply using file or egg shaped file and then using their heal lotion to be much more effective if used on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPS didn&#x27;t bother , as the price point is not that big, but luckily Amazon took care of it !</li>
            <li> I left it on for about 5 minutes on each foot, and scrubbed with both a foot file and fine grater-type stainless steel file to remove the skin (you can buy a 4-in-1 foot tool to use with this, which is what I used).  </li>
            <li> Have to pair up with a great little machine like the Tip2Toe or something similar.  </li>
            <li> I do feel a little like the calluses are easier to scrape off, but I honestly think the soaking in the water contributes just as much as the gel does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would have preferred a little more of the callus to be removed so next time I will use more product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice so far and my heels are soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Amazing and wonderful, but disgusting!</li>
            <li> It really works</li>
            <li> This product works very well.  </li>
            <li> Much safer than callus</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> it is a solution that once applied to the soles will emove some of the callus  be carefull, your soles are going to be very slippery and on tile you can fall</li>
            <li> It really works...</li>
            <li> Given that I walk barefoot on tile floors all day at home, my whole foot is basically a \\&quot;callus\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It took quite a bit of elbow grease and time, but by the time I was done, my feet were much, much softer and nicer-looking than when I started.  </li>
            <li> Not only is it great to use at home, but I will definitely take it with me to all future pedicures and request that they use it.</li>
            <li> It works very well.  </li>
            <li> Too much walking around the house with no shoes.  </li>
            <li> Because of the condition, I&#x27;m not supposed to file or grate my feet, so I really wanted this stuff to work.</li>
            <li> If you have very calloused feet, you will be underwhelmed.</li>
            <li> it gentle remove all the death skin</li>
            <li> But one day I was walking along and the whole callus fell off.  </li>
            <li> How much would I pay now that I&#x27;ve used it?  </li>
            <li> Pro linc Callus Eliminator is very efficient.</li>
            <li> I choose to rate this product because it really work.</li>
            <li> does it really work?</li>
            <li> Now my feet are so smooth, I only get mini pedicures.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping it would work and was looking forward to the results...</li>
            <li> Also i increased the wait time to 10 minutes and that didnt do much either.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did not find that the treatment did much.  </li>
            <li> This really works - just follow the directions.  </li>
            <li> but this doesn&#x27;t appear to do much if anything.</li>
            <li> Absolutely nothing came off.</li>
            <li> it really works.</li>
            <li> will keep using and hope my feet back to smooth</li>
            <li> i highly recommend this and will buy it again!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this did anything really.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think it does anything.</li>
            <li> This product really works and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This is the &amp;#34;acid-like&amp;#34; stuff (or it is acid)  that salons use and really does work when applied as directed, keeping it on the longer duration of the range of minutes suggested.</li>
            <li> I think this is what solons use, and so much chaper than paying for a pedicure.  </li>
            <li> Use gloves or finger cots to protect your skin, it really dries them out.</li>
            <li> This really is heaven sent for all feet</li>
            <li> I did not find this product very helpful.  </li>
            <li> I use this instead of getting Spa Pedicure at the nail salon, its much.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my feet have really been taking a beating with me working out running so much.</li>
            <li> My calluses were very embarrassing</li>
            <li> it can really do</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re really flexible, you can probably do this all yourself -- me, not so much.</li>
            <li> This really helps.</li>
            <li> I was very unsatisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Arrive fast and well packed.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to use much of it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see much what this does.</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> Then wipe away excess and use a file or buffer to gently remove callus.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> This product really works to get rid of foot callous.</li>
            <li> I used the product on three separate occasions over two weeks, but did not see much in the way of results.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Will absolutely stay in my beauty arsenal.</li>
            <li> I even used it twice in one sitting with a pumice stone after each use and it worked very well.  </li>
            <li> It sure did,but be careful.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m very cautionary on things like that of those types of products.</li>
            <li> I use this product once or twice a month, really does a miracle for my feet.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I ended up not using it as much as I planned because of the chemical smell.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works well.  </li>
            <li> Only a $5 item and ended up costing much more since I took off early from work and had to drive to the post office.</li>
            <li> started using this when they sold it at a salon i used to go to, it&#x27;s the best thing ever and really requires no scraping or cutting, i use it on my heels</li>
            <li> Over time and consistent use, within a few weeks my dry calloused feet improved a great deal.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for about two years and my heels are as soft as a baby&#x27;s!!!  </li>
            <li> Once the girl at the nail salon started using this during her pedicures my heels started becoming dry within a week.</li>
            <li> Listen, I&#x27;m 40-something and live in Arizona, rarely wear shoes, and live in a house that is tiled throughout.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried most products out there and like a lot of other reviewers, I&#x27;ve had this used on me at the salon.  </li>
            <li> This has worked better than other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> But the 2nd time, i soaked my feet very well, applied this and wait for 5 full minutes, wiped off with a towel and buffed.  </li>
            <li> I used it on my heel where I had a tiny crack which quickly turned into a large vefy</li>
            <li> this is a very strong preparation for destroying calluses, if you have abnormally thickened calluses that have to be removed in bulk</li>
            <li> I recommend re-soaking your heels briefly in warm water then patting them dry before continuing to file them; repeat these steps as necessary.  </li>
            <li> rinse your feet in warm water and lastly 5) use a pumice scrubber to gently buff the rough skin off-</li>
            <li> While no product or procedure has ever made my heels baby smooth for long, this product comes close.  </li>
            <li> I used Be Natural Unscented Callus Eliminator first and saw some improvement of my callus.  </li>
            <li> All soft and pretty.  </li>
            <li> After years of walking around on deeply callused feet and feeling embarrassed at nail salons as they kept shaving and shaving off the thick skin on my heels, I finally found something that I can use at home and get wonderful results.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Be Natural Callus Eliminator and I must say it does exactly what it purports to do.</li>
            <li> and I was sooooo anxious to get my own results</li>
            <li> I found it no more effective than soaking my feet in water.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time and wow</li>
            <li> I used the product as recommended, and I don&#x27;t think it increased the amount I was able to sand down my callouses with my pumice bar.  </li>
            <li> Its like having new feet!  </li>
            <li> it was not brand new!</li>
            <li> Packaging wasn&#x27;t very good, especially considering this is a caustic solution.  </li>
            <li> Some may need more, some less.  </li>
            <li> It melts away callus tissue easily and with minimal elbow grease.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Purchased Dr. Scholl&#x27;s &#x27;ET&#x27; Callus Remover kit (For half the cost of ProLinc) made one application with medicated disk and protective cushion and within forty-eight hours most of the callus on foot was removed.</li>
            <li> After only 1 use my feet are as soft and smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom...</li>
            <li> and I will be doing it weekly to keep my feet looking decent.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely repurchase this in the future :)</li>
            <li> i was hesitant at first but after the first and second try</li>
            <li> Later on that day I felt like I put this junk of my feet for nothing because they had the same calluses as before no change and not even slightly better.</li>
            <li> Anyway, second attempt I tried applying it and then wrapping in plastic wrap - which definitely made it easier to walk to the sink to wash my hands after touching the stuff.  </li>
            <li> Pair this with a quick facial and in 10 min or so, you&#x27;ll have a smoother face and feet.</li>
            <li> She first became aware of the product during a recent visit to a spa and they used it on her and charged her $15.00.</li>
            <li> here are the bullet points for this particular</li>
            <li> i was very good at hiding my feet and most of the previous treatments would only smooth over the top layer and kinda polish them, still leaving the horrible callus.</li>
            <li> the second time, I tried this after soaking in a very hot bubble bath for about 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I just soak my feet in hot water for 10-15 minutes, wipe them with towel and immediately put on ProLinc Callus Eliminator and leave it on for a few minutes (the key word is Immediately, otherwise it will not work as well, by my own experience) .</li>
            <li> If it is on the top you will burn the top skin of your foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Relax and let it sit for about 7-8 min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use a pumice stone or nail file to file down the dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend watching the video on the Prolinc site because they show you how to use a paper towel so that the stuff stays put.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for those of us who struggle with calluses.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised because I have used a lot of more expensive products that had me doing lots of arm/handwork scrubbing to get results like this..and took a lot more time too.  </li>
            <li> and it was a little better.</li>
            <li> Re-soaked my feet with a little soap and scrubbed a bit more.</li>
            <li> I think I was expecting a little more out of it than I got</li>
            <li> I put lotion on and my feet were so smooth they were slipping out of my flip flops.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally leave reviews</li>
            <li> No merchandise second speed is so good, the effect is not very good</li>
            <li> It did work fine on calluses, but you have to be very careful not to get on softer tissue.  </li>
            <li> I used a very coarse foot file and the skin comes right off.  </li>
            <li> I then unwrapped , rinsed and used a Microplane Colossal foot file , the hard callus just melted away, super easy, I scrubbed them for about 5 minutes each, I then put on the dry heel eliminator and some socks.</li>
            <li> I live in a year-round warm climate and usually wear sandals--and the soles of my feet show it!</li>
            <li> You do have to use a little power and a good buffer to remove the rough skin, but it does come off.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call it any new miracle solution, but it remove some callused skin from my feet.</li>
            <li> I new</li>
            <li> The new nail salon I went to would have spa pedicures and included the Callus remover.</li>
            <li> I have since moved and they new place I go to does not have this</li>
            <li> but after washing off the rest my feet, they looked and felt  brand new</li>
            <li> It looks like I got new feet.  </li>
            <li> From this company    and    the State of New Jersey.gov</li>
            <li> A heavy-duty moisturizer will keep newly exposed skin supple.</li>
            <li> I feel like a new woman.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even wait for my new pumas stone to get her</li>
            <li> However I do not like this procedure because i have hard time to make my heels nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I was thinking the extra money might be worth it, and when I looked at my baby soft feet, it was.</li>
            <li> whole process takes a while: soak your feet, leave the callus remover on for about five minutes, pumice the rough skin away, but I would say the time is worth the end result...</li>
            <li> What this product does is to burn away any old skin on your body, btw, your whole body is covered with old skin.</li>
            <li> I tried it on several different occasions and followed the directions precisely</li>
            <li> I would be very careful while using this product because it is so very powerful and can burn your skin.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much, but you should definitely use gloves when applying.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised when I felt my feet afterwards.</li>
            <li> I had a salon use this on my feet during a pedicure and they got some on the soft part of the bottom of my foot (right in the middle)</li>
            <li> my feet are very soft now - not sure if it was the sally hansen filed plus this product, but i like my feel now :)</li>
            <li> It works ok, but seems much weaker than I expected, leaving some rough skin intact even after soaking, leaving the solution on for 5 minutes, then using a pumice bar and file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be natural should be called beripoff!</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> Pretty simple to use.  </li>
            <li> I left it on 3 minutes the first time, because I was nervous.  </li>
            <li> they were baby soft!  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly and even left it on for longer than suggested and there still were no results.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly and even left it on for longer than suggested and there still were no results.</li>
            <li> When I wiped it all off after 5 minutes I thought my foot felt like I had just got out of the shower, but within 15 minutes my feet felt exactly the same as before.</li>
            <li> My husband always said I look like i have heels of a hundred year old lady (at 30!).  </li>
            <li> Soft feet!</li>
            <li> it was like baby soft skin on my heels!</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews and was so excited about this.  </li>
            <li> Anyhow, I used it after showering and it took the dead skin right off!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to keep your feet looking pretty all year long.</li>
            <li> The active ingredient of this product is Potassium Hydroxide, lye, used to clean clogged drains.    </li>
            <li> These two together make the skin easily slough off without harsh rubbing or shaving.</li>
            <li> I can use it on my own convenience &amp; it only takes a few minutes!</li>
            <li> Wow, I&#x27;m not usually prone to writing to reviews, but had to do so for this product.  </li>
            <li> Worked well enough when I used it twice to get the majority of a super stubborn callus in the crook of my big toe off.</li>
            <li> Guess what your feet will turn out better than they would if you paid $35 to sit in a chair for 11 minutes while being exposed to germs from other patrons that were clearly not eliminated from everything.</li>
            <li> I also recommend that you apply with a tounge depressor or other item to smooth the product over skin, I would not suggest using your bare hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to stick to the cheap little foot cheese grater and be done with it.</li>
            <li> but if I left it on a little longer it would probably work even better.</li>
            <li> Do you know how hard it is to find cute dress shoes that are closed-toe and closed-heel?</li>
            <li> applied the gel and wrapped my foot in clear plastic wrap....</li>
            <li> I read the directions clearly and put a generous amount on my feet and then used a foot file and nothing.</li>
            <li> Softened rough patches but really didn&#x27;t do the whole work of a spa pedi.  </li>
            <li> Really works at getting off calluses but you have to keep doing it or they just grow back.</li>
            <li> Used properly, it does the job very well.</li>
            <li> Use Natural Sierra Pumice Stone instead.  </li>
            <li> Natural Callus</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only thing that works really well after one application.  </li>
            <li> I was completely amazed at the difference it made.  </li>
            <li> even on the outer edge near my pinky toes ..</li>
            <li> But it is a hassle if u are a busy person</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to touch it then rinse with water for baby soft feet ..</li>
            <li> For someone who has covered her feet up her whole life this is such a relief.</li>
            <li> Maybe it only works on REALLY callused feet.....</li>
            <li> Iit does the job very well, but in addition to just simply working it makes your skin like baby skin.</li>
            <li> i recommend ,I have feet really soft</li>
            <li> Rather than save time, I had to take off work early to make it to the post office in time to pick it up and sign for it.</li>
            <li> I tried this product several times and it did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> and it made my foot baby soft.</li>
            <li> B00011JZWW Be Natural Unscented Callus Eliminator 4 oz.]]&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I tried this product several times and it did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> Your feet will be softer (it softens the callus), but this far hasn&#x27;t removed them.</li>
            <li> I used it only once and really did not like the outcome.  </li>
            <li> No harsh smells</li>
            <li> and wow.</li>
            <li> and they were so soft afterwards that i couldn&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li> After using this product for many months I want to change my review rating to a five, BUT there is, at least when I am using this product, a trick to making this product work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;\\&quot;Be Natural Callus</li>
            <li> And I got the same result as when I do this straight out of the shower AGAIN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that this item worked as indicated.</li>
            <li> my feet are so soft.  </li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t burn any sensitive skin that&#x27;s not calloused.</li>
            <li> Using gloves i opened the bottle to see how much was left inside</li>
            <li> I now use one a month to keep my feet&#x27;s looking and feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I bought Amlactin to rub into my feet, and that keeps the skin soft.</li>
            <li> : Be Natural Callus Eliminator&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> hint for those people that have sensitive skin/are scared of the product getting on their \\&quot;uncallused\\&quot; skin....use Vaseline to corral the product where it is needed.  </li>
            <li> It made my foot soft after using the product but it did make a dent in the campus on my foot.</li>
            <li> Unbelievably soft.</li>
            <li> and WOW I paid 1/4 of the cost with shipping.  </li>
            <li> Just a few minutes and your in your way to smooth feet.  </li>
            <li> , I had it pretty thick, I think I did a bit to much because my heel was a bit sore at first</li>
            <li> &quot;, I said sure, she whispered, \\&quot;eight dollar\\&quot;, but I heard her, I went a head with it, she popped out this callus eliminator, applied it to my very crusty heels, afew minutes later she was using a regular file and rolls of dead skin</li>
            <li> My heels are pink and normal looking for the first time in years.</li>
            <li> After three uses my feet have barely visible cracks!!!  </li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s a little soft and I will watch it by keeping the area moist and clean with lotion.</li>
            <li> Feet are really pretty dry otherwise.  </li>
            <li> A little grossed out on how much it took off the first time I used this.</li>
            <li> The bottle with Earth Friendly green printing?    </li>
            <li> but if it helps just one other person with the problem feet like mine then it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Seriously gang, this product works as well or better than what they use professionally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> If its not its pretty close because my feet feel better than any expensive pedicure I&#x27;ve ever paid for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Is it worth the whole mess and rubber gloves and potential poison storage problems?</li>
            <li> I give them another quick soak to wash off the rest of the callus stuff and dead skin and apply the lotion, and my feet are just so soft.    </li>
            <li> when using this product, don&#x27;t apply too much for long time.</li>
            <li> I work in retail, and the bottoms of my feet get pretty rough.  </li>
            <li> I suspect that AII may of shifted to a weaker or more watered down version due to misuse or burns.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for more dramatic results than what I normally get...</li>
            <li> Yes, I,d highly recommend to anybody who has severe callus-corn probs.....was big big help for my feet callus-corn problems so far!</li>
            <li> I got a $72 pedicure in this really nice spa and saw how the person buffed away my dead skin with little effort.</li>
            <li> Anyhow I live this product &amp; will definitely buy again when I run out!</li>
            <li> A new bottle arrived 2 days later.</li>
            <li> Definitely want to soak your feet first and don&#x27;t leave it on for too long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many callus removing-implements, some of them very fancy and expensive (Diamencel) and none of them work as well as this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched high and low for a product that actually removes calluses the way that professional nail salons do.</li>
            <li> I later found the exact same product at a local beauty supply store for a comparable price.  </li>
            <li> Dead skin comes right off leaving my heels soft almost like a baby&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> the next morning I was literally 100% clear..</li>
            <li> As the directions state, it&#x27;s definitely not a good idea to use this when you&#x27;ve got open sores as I did, but it sure removed the callous.</li>
            <li> when using this it will temporarily make the skin on your fingers peel if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> I went for a pedicure while on vacation in Texas and the guy was complaining about how I must walk around in bare feet all the time, blah, blah, blah.  </li>
            <li> However when I bought it myself and applied 2 applications, it barely made a dent.</li>
            <li> It barely did anything</li>
            <li> I spent the afternoon working on my feet really pampering them.  </li>
            <li> I have heavy calluses on my big toes and have used a callus remover that I found in the drug store that really didn&#x27;t do much.  </li>
            <li> I believed it.&lt;br /&gt;Not even when this quemical touched my bare skin i got a reaction...none.</li>
            <li> Something along the lines of a acid that burns through if you are not careful.  </li>
            <li> and I have had a crack from time to time if I am not careful)  </li>
            <li> it will look worse before it looks better.</li>
            <li> The texture of the liquid is smooth and sort of thick.</li>
            <li> For some reason, my feet get very callused, and usually, even after the pedicurist scrapes them, they are still kinda hard, even though very smooth.</li>
            <li> Also, make sure you apply a thick quantity as it tends to dry out.</li>
            <li> I use this once every week &amp; half after shower, to save me from having to soak my feet first.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping for a miracle callus eliminator gel like some of these other reviewers warned us about.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products without seeing a difference in my really cracked heels.</li>
            <li> Just be very careful when applying because your feet become very slippery - I do not recommend standing up once applied.</li>
            <li> Use it with gloves though and try very little, when using for the first time!</li>
            <li> Seriously, the inconvenience was miniscule, the customer service was fantastic.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and was expecting a more dramatic result.  </li>
            <li> American International    Be NATURAL Callous Eliminator    </li>
            <li> The whole layer of dead skin came off effortlessly, my heels were completely renewed.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping I could use this to stop the deep down callus from coming back, but, it is only useful for heels, and toes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the price, you need very little.</li>
            <li> I am doing the exact same thing my previous nail salon did.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very calloused feet due to a medical condition.</li>
            <li> It did exactly what it said it would do it remove so much dead skin and callus skin on my feet.</li>
            <li> You have to have a metal file or something pretty sturdy to help you file off all the dead skin after soaking your feet.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good..kinda messy</li>
            <li> At first, it looks like you are getting A LOT of dead skin off your feet.  </li>
            <li> well worth the money and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Professional grade (as this claims to be, and frankly is the same product I&#x27;ve seen at my local salon where I get to treat myself to the occasional pedicure) is not the same as industrial/medical grade that I might need.  </li>
            <li> natural by ProLinc dry heel eliminator</li>
            <li> Although this is my first time using something like this, I took extra precaution after reading the reviews expecting it to be harsh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought many products from the store in the past, but they were a waste of money..</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take long before I was satisfied that enough of the tough skin was gone.</li>
            <li> that I come across that looks promising only to be let down.</li>
            <li> I practically live in flip flops all year long, as long as its over 50</li>
            <li> This stuff really worked on my rough, dry, cracked, callused feet.</li>
            <li> Perhaps if you are the type with only mild callusing this would take care of it for you, but for the elephant-footed (such as myself) it&#x27;s going to be hard for any one product to do the job.</li>
            <li> Well, at least as pretty as my feet can get!</li>
            <li> It price is way better on amazon, locally they sell a small bottle less than one ounce for 5.99 this bottle is 4 oz , looks like it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing it ate through all the thick hard skin in no time.  </li>
            <li> This is the only product that I found that works instantly to repair dry, cracked,and hard heels after trying so many other things that did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I was bare foot and pregnant, literally, and it did a number on my poor feet as I wore nothing but</li>
            <li> Not sure how this product is getting any positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> this maybe helps a little, with dry heels, but it doesn&#x27;t do much for actual calluses on the balls of ones feet from wearing heels.  </li>
            <li> First i soaked my feet in hot water, and used a Microplane Colossal Pedicure Foot Rasp, to grate the thick callus off my feel then put the ProLinc Callus eliminator all over the remaining thick hard callus for about 5mns and began used a Mr Pumice all over my feet.</li>
            <li> I ordered this, not sure if it was really the same product she had used.</li>
            <li> You only need to use a drop every 2-4 weeks so the bottle will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is the same product the girls use at the salon by my house and they charge $5 each time they use it on me, and they don&#x27;t leave it on long enough</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for treatment of heavy callous areas.</li>
            <li> work really good on my husband dry, ugly and achy feet.</li>
            <li> It did remove some dead, dry skin, but did not make much of a dent in the calluses on my feet.  </li>
            <li> I usually put it on my feet and keep rubbing my whole foot</li>
            <li> I have had no issues with the product burning my non-calloused skin, but I was also careful to only apply where it was needed, and only left it on for the minimum of 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> Not much on the market apparently does.</li>
            <li> I have a very hard callus on the balls of my feet near the pinkies and this product didnt do much at all.</li>
            <li> I did have one instant where I went a little too far with the file and</li>
            <li> In the morning, the skin is soft enough to be scrubbed away (with a little elbow grease).</li>
            <li> Works very well at softening the extremely tough callous making it far easier to scrape with whatever tool suits you.</li>
            <li> I prefer a natural volcanic pumice over the less efficient synthetic type.</li>
            <li> ProLinc Dry Heel Eliminator, 4 Fluid Ounce]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried it once at a salon, where this extra service comes at a $5-10 additional charge depending where you go, and it does wonders for removing dry skin from heels.</li>
            <li> I think the salon left it on too long and they weren&#x27;t careful enough to not let touch softer skin.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe it when I dried my foot and found my heels to be baby soft, and without razor blades!</li>
            <li> In fact, I think it was worse because when I scrubbed with the foot file, it broke the top later of skin, so when it dried, the skin was rough and jagged.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m also extremely cautious about following the directions and keeping the product only on the parts of my feet that need it.</li>
            <li> Amazing product if you have bad calluses.</li>
            <li> and I really wanted to not feel like a sucker.</li>
            <li> you are burning your skin, you are leaving it on too long.  </li>
            <li> I just took and long shower and allowed my skin to soften that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> If I leave it on for too long, my feet will flake for a day or two, but I don&#x27;t mind because it&#x27;s making them softer.</li>
            <li> you can get a pedicure, but they aren&#x27;t going to allow you to soak your feet as long as they need to be in order for you to get the results you want.</li>
            <li> It did not really soften the callus enough for removal, until after 3 applications.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to provide some moisturizing benefits as well, however.</li>
            <li> The only downside to the product is the amount of time spent soaking your feet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why if you apply it on soft skin for a few of minutes, you will get burnt.</li>
            <li> I wish I had known about this long before now.</li>
            <li> The results were minimal and I feel that I could have gotten the same thing with just the foot file alone.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T LEAVE IT ON TOO LONG  </li>
            <li> this worked as described, in fact I didn&#x27;t even leave it on as long as it recommended</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it several times and ABSOLUTELY no difference.</li>
            <li> I will buy this item for as long as it is available.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> If I leave the gel on for a LONG TIME (like 30 minutes)</li>
            <li> as long as you wash your hands immediately you do not need gloves, def should leave on 3-5 min depending on the severity of the callus.</li>
            <li> (Shipping was rather long though</li>
            <li> My feet take a serious beating and my foot has turned into one large callus.</li>
            <li> and it was the only thing that worked all of the other products</li>
            <li> I have DRY heels, at times even cracked.  </li>
            <li> Then those dry, cracked heels would return.  </li>
            <li> I have terribly dry, cracked fingers and calluses from weight lifting.</li>
            <li> By the way, I suffer from severely dry cracked heels, at the time I had the pedicure, there were no cracks.</li>
            <li> I have seriously calloused feet, so much that it is embarrassing to have a pedicure.</li>
            <li> My heels were dry and cracked, as well as the balls of my feet.  </li>
            <li> But it improved dry heels a lot.</li>
            <li> I am always fighting with my feet because they seem to develop calluses and dry skin overnight.  </li>
            <li> product that just arrived, despite the bottle looking the same as in the photo here, contains the active ingredient Potassium Hydroxide.</li>
            <li> I believed I was destined to either suffer in limited fashion, or endure foot surgery.</li>
            <li> it also burns a little if you get it on your regular skin.. but not that bad, just keep a rag handy and wipe off anything that stings..</li>
            <li> So I decided to try this brand because it said it contained natural products to gently remove calluses and hard, thick skin.  </li>
            <li> However be aware that CE contains potassium hydroxide which is a caustic alkaline product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It did leak during shipping and this is pretty caustic stuff</li>
            <li> A pumice is needed to rid feet of loose skin after the product has been applied.</li>
            <li> I literally jumped up and down when I was finished &amp; looked at my final results.</li>
            <li> I soaked one foot at a time for about 45 seconds in my sink, and then sat down with a medical latex glove on my hand to apply this gel to the callused surfaces.</li>
            <li> If you have dry heels, cracked, callused-TRY THIS!</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t be fooled, this is just the dry gel!  </li>
            <li> If you follow the instructions, you can lose the callus, rough skin and even the dry cuticles on your toes.  </li>
            <li> This bottle will last you forever, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Still, it just did not work on my slight to moderate  areas.</li>
            <li> It does not get the the center of deep down callus.</li>
            <li> and she has very dry and cracked heels</li>
            <li> I am a man and have very dry cracked feet.</li>
            <li> I can tell you what my feet were before - very dry and cracked.</li>
            <li> one single use .. applying it for 5 minutes on my heels and in the other dry spots for 5 minutes after a bath..</li>
            <li> Within a few minutes of applying to difficult areas on your feet, the dead skin easily rolls off when using a basic foot file.  </li>
            <li> It was enough except for one little spot which I reapplied for another minute.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this product, a little of the gel goes a long way, works great, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> BUT it does little to actual calluses.</li>
            <li> WORKS OK IF THE CALLUSES AREN&#x27;T TOO BAD</li>
            <li> I used gloves at first, but since it worked so badly I applied the second applications with my (also callus) hands and it barely worked there either.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really working, or I should say at least u can not feel it&#x27;s working, the dead skin still there after applied on my skin, not even feel softer.</li>
            <li> I put it on and left it for 1-2 minutes then &amp;#34;sanded: off the dead skin.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s such a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Only apply to the areas where you have lots of dead skin as it will burn the \\&quot;good\\&quot; skin.</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to get it on your hands</li>
            <li> You have to be careful when applying it as it makes your skin peel.</li>
            <li> Once it sits on the pre-soaked skin, the residue needs to be abrased off with a rough scraper of some sort.  </li>
            <li> It removed ALL my dead skin and left a pile of it in the tub!YUCK</li>
            <li> a few days later the remainder just up and died and fell off.</li>
            <li> total waste of money</li>
            <li> I expected them to come off easier than they did.</li>
            <li> Just did not work as expected.</li>
            <li> This product was a waste of money &amp; if I hadn&#x27;t of thrown away the details for sending it back</li>
            <li> I will try using it several time with a few days break between uses to allow skin to rest.  </li>
            <li> Apply Callus Eliminator to the rough areas of the foot.  </li>
            <li> Just soak your feet, apply for 5 minutes and the callous and dead skin come off in one (possibly two) applications using a foot scrubber or foot file.</li>
            <li> I say give it a try, because it does yield results, but not if you have rough feet like I do.</li>
            <li> You do have to  be careful where and how you apply</li>
            <li> It is messy to do a pedi with this, but a pedi without it just isn&#x27;t thorough enough.</li>
            <li> This is a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> It definitely works to get rid of dead skin</li>
            <li> So be careful.</li>
            <li> I applied the eliminator to my feet not really knowing what to expect.</li>
            <li> but my problem with it which is why I rated it 4 stars, is that it makes ur feet rough after a week or two of using it.</li>
            <li> I had absolutely no results from this product.</li>
            <li> Wife likes the ability to use something to soften the heels rough areas.</li>
            <li> When I was younger and got pedicures I would always allowed them to shave off all of the dead skin until I tried a new place and they told me it was not good for the skin.</li>
            <li> 1st time, the dead skin came off but I&#x27;ve seen other products that did the same.  </li>
            <li> Be careful not to get any on your clothes or other skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product, but as everyone has said, follow the instructions carefully because the stuff is caustic.</li>
            <li> little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> it really does melt the nasty old skin from the heel - and I use it on my big toe and ball of the foot too - seems to need to be done every couple of weeks for my horrid old feet -</li>
            <li> No more spending an extra \\&quot;5 dolla more\\&quot; when getting a pedicure.  </li>
            <li> No razors or rough sanding needed!</li>
            <li> I did not experience any sensitivity to the skin on my hands when I applied it that other reviewers have mentioned.      </li>
            <li> PLEASE be careful using this product!</li>
            <li> agree with other reviewers that the product is rather runny, but I just kept my legs hanging over the side of the tub, in case of any drips.</li>
            <li> I have tried other stuff, including a 30 dollar pumice on a handle, other stones, the egg shaver thing and not one</li>
            <li> Do not follow with a razor or other metal implement whcih could score or severely abrade the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> other areas in foot that don&#x27;t have calculus would burn your skin.</li>
            <li> They were seriously rough and calloused too!  </li>
            <li> I think I will do another treatment in about a week to get the other calluses on my feet.</li>
            <li> I did use rubber gloves as suggested from other reviews.  </li>
            <li> other reviews made it seem.</li>
            <li> Doing so has sent me to the pedi chair numerous times the past 20 years.  </li>
            <li> It is  however extremely oily</li>
            <li> I did my feet twice because I was worried about the burning I read in other reviews.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first b/c</li>
            <li> After you let the gel dry a little, you take a pumice stone and rub off the gel.  </li>
            <li> I probably don&#x27;t leave it on long enough because I am afraid of burning the live skin</li>
            <li> so be very careful when applying.  </li>
            <li> My feet had really been badly neglected due to poor maintenance on my part from being a busy new mom.  </li>
            <li> and it was about half empty.  </li>
            <li> I read a magazine for a few minutes, and then put my foot back in the sink and scrubbed the calluses with one of those heavy grit rectangular scrubbers.</li>
            <li> Have to use the pumice stone a little harder to remove callus</li>
            <li> tried it multiple times, and hardly took care of anything.</li>
            <li> I put it on, five minutes later a got in the tub, washed the solution off and scraped away ALL the dead skin with very little effort.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t believe it at first that, my painful calluses will be removed with one simple application</li>
            <li> my feet have had a chance to soak for at least 10 minutes, then I just hang out (sometimes while I also deep condition my hair).  </li>
            <li> Is very runny and difficult to apply.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical but this product really works.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but the product really worked.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> I brought it for cleaning the dead skin, however, I still don&#x27;t get it how to use it, even though i read the instruction carefully for twice.</li>
            <li> &quot; calluses in 3-5 minutes, I pictured the skin on my feet burning and well, breaking down.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions and filed down my calluses and my heels and it did just what it said it would.</li>
            <li> This ensures the product isn&#x27;t going down the drain and staying on your feet.  </li>
            <li> Only annoying thing is how quickly they return.</li>
            <li> One foot was on a little longer than 5 minutes because I was working on the other one.  </li>
            <li> No more wasted time and money on stuff that takes long to work and produces minimal results because I&#x27;ve found this product and it&#x27;s a keeper!  </li>
            <li> I soaked my feet for at least 20 minutes, wiped the water off, and liberally applied the gel (being careful to wear gloves due to the warning on other reviews).  </li>
            <li> Its less than $15 bucks</li>
            <li> I also use it for 3-minutes or less on my fingers and hands.</li>
            <li> but instead, maybe I&#x27;m doing it wrong, maybe mine aren&#x27;t simple enough..</li>
            <li> I waited less than 5 minutes and used a pumice type scrubber like they use at the nail salon..</li>
            <li> I have used foot files and different products such as Glytone heel and elbow cream which is really expensive and none of them work as well as this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes, but sadly this didn&#x27;t work at all for me.</li>
            <li> It reduces the calluses some but always painful for days afterward, this stuff is a miracle and not painful in anyway.</li>
            <li> Not strong enough for thick callus need to repeat 2-3 times just to remove a little layer of callus ( used pumice stone).</li>
            <li> After I few minutes I scrub them down with a foot scrubber/pumice stone for maybe 3 minutes?  </li>
            <li> A few months ago while at the nail salon the gal doing my pedicure put callus remover on my heels and then filed the calluses down.  </li>
            <li> I followed the instructions for how long to leave the product on and the results were unbelievable!,</li>
            <li> and my feet were getting bad quick</li>
            <li> My turned red and looked bad but after a week i noticed less callus as it dried into normal skin..if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d even go so far as to say that if you only have mildly calloused feet you may want to try something less aggressive, but for really nasty hard thick callous it makes knocking it down a lot easier.</li>
            <li> Options are limited to say the least...</li>
            <li> This was a bit disappointing after all the hype of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Ours were a little wimpy.  </li>
            <li> I soaked my feet for about 10 minutes in the warmest water with a little epsom salt.</li>
            <li> I do wear sandals so sometimes my heels show a little dryness</li>
            <li> It made my feet a little softer but the calluses are still there.  </li>
            <li> Just use a little and leave on for a few mins before rinsing.  </li>
            <li> Tough callouses may need several passes with this stuff so plan to take your time.  </li>
            <li> Anyway the dead skin just sloughs off.</li>
            <li> Just try a few minutes at a time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Buffed with a tool and my feet as soft as a babies behind!  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t cry while a was trying to scrape the dead skin off.</li>
            <li> I followed all the instuctions, and also wrapped my feet in plastic wrap (what they do at the salon) for the few minutes it was on.  </li>
            <li> you just 1) soak your feet for a few minutes to soften up the calluses 2)</li>
            <li> I simply got tired of my feet snagging on my comforter when I went to bed.  </li>
            <li> I have tried everything for the last year to remove the callus off the bottom of my feet, pregnancy just made it worse.</li>
            <li> and I refuse to have them razor off the dead skin</li>
            <li> ProLinc Callus Eliminator loosens the dead skin on your feet in a matter of minutes for faster removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This softened them in just a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> dead skin be gone.</li>
            <li> i tried a few times...  </li>
            <li> You could see the dead skin flake off.</li>
            <li> Rather than harsh tools that sand away the hooves this cuts through and sloughs away the callus.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I should be fully reibursed beacuse of the waste of time......</li>
            <li> used the pumic stone to get the dead skin out.</li>
            <li> so I could get the results everyone is raving about, but it didn&#x27;t work and this was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at the amount of dead skin that just rubbed away.  </li>
            <li> I started doing my pedicures at home to save some money and this was the missing link.</li>
            <li> I see that there are a few that are as dissatisfied as I am.</li>
            <li> follow with a heavy moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Removes all the callous and dead skin from my heels.</li>
            <li> I dried feet, then put on plastic gloves and spread the callus eliminator on the bottom of my feet.</li>
            <li> I tried countless callous remover products off of the shelf, and had poor results.</li>
            <li> I figured I could save few $.</li>
            <li> but I dont like have any dead skin lingering on the pads of my feet.</li>
            <li> the dead skin just rolled off with the use of a buffer.  </li>
            <li> but I did remove a lot of dead skin.  </li>
            <li> It was just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Now i was told before buying it that it may take a few months for the callus remover to work.</li>
            <li> It like melts the dead skin away.</li>
            <li> This product does help slough off the dead skin.  </li>
            <li> Got it down to less noticeable at least...</li>
            <li> It got to me in Japan in less than a week!</li>
            <li> For less than $8, I think it costs me about 20 cents each use!</li>
            <li> I bought it and it works as well as it did at the beauty salon - for a lot less money!</li>
            <li> may be working for really small calluses , but is too weak for bigger once.</li>
            <li> Use this for thick callus&#x27; on my feet due to a lot of gym time.  </li>
            <li> Not nearly so strong as others rated it to be.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really work for part of my feet, where has serious callus on it.</li>
            <li> For the first time in years I don&#x27;t have cracked, painful heels.</li>
            <li> so you soak your feet and than apply the product for a few minutes, than it should cause the dead skin on your feet to &#x27;rub&#x27; off with the help of a pumice stone, nothing happened!</li>
            <li> It does sting a little if it gets into a crack, but it really wasn&#x27;t that bad...</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am SO tired of having a pedicure &amp; being hard sold on adding a callus remover treatment for an extra $5 to $15.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what the product is like, I ordered it and It was never delivered, the other orders I placed at the same time were all received, except for this buyer who insisted they need the product back in order to redeliver, and that I gave them my address missing , which is impossible !</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product, based on word-of-mouth and the other customer reviews, and I was severely disappointed.  </li>
            <li> which takes very little time since the chemicals in this product soften the skin for you.</li>
            <li> painful one after getting to much of the remover on there.</li>
            <li> work no better than a lot of the product that i&#x27;ve purchase  at the pharmacy.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I just had a pedicure this past weekend and the woman used this product</li>
            <li> I had tried everything, scrubs, stones, weekly pedicures, that scary looking cheese grater thing for the heels, all the \\&quot;only on TV\\&quot; products - but nothing worked as well as this did.    </li>
            <li> If you have thick calluses (like I do) and find that it takes a lot of work to file away the dead skin after applying this gel:  </li>
            <li> Messy and  Icky.  </li>
            <li> I started doing pedicures at home to save money when I realized I was never completely satisfied unless I did it myself now</li>
            <li> anymore, I&#x27;m not sure what to do with it.</li>
            <li> This works well, but is not a magical cure.</li>
            <li> , looks like a small cheese graters.  </li>
            <li> I first used this last night and the layers of skin coming off was disgusting!</li>
            <li> It may take a few applications to get all of your calluses off, but it takes a lot of the work out of filing and filing for days!</li>
            <li> Usually leave it on for 5-7 minutes.  </li>
            <li> And then I filed as usual.  </li>
            <li> No more rubbing, sawing and scrubbing every time you take a shower.</li>
            <li> t o say I am amature so not sure if using correctly.</li>
            <li> Not even a small difference.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not magic - you still have to &#x27;file&#x27; after it&#x27;s been on -</li>
            <li> They are small but they are bother me.</li>
            <li> I USUALLY USE MY OWEN LOTIONS, AND NAIL POLISHES AND PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li> I often get calluses on my fingers and small bunions on my toes and this resolves both.  </li>
            <li> WASTE OF CASH!</li>
            <li> a little bit half of it was spilled in the bag not a happy camper</li>
            <li> It is not a good sign when you feel like you could file down wood with your heals.  </li>
            <li> Ill probably never pay to get a pedicure again as long as they keep making this stuff.</li>
            <li> My toes looked like I have never seen them before, with new skin underneath all that ugly stuff gone but</li>
            <li> I had a very expensive pedicure and was charged $10 extra because they used this product to remove the dead skin from my feet.  </li>
            <li> My hand hurt from how hard I was scrubbing.</li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t touch a hard callus that probably requires the help of a podiatrist.</li>
            <li> I could hardly believe how well it worked.  </li>
            <li> its not amazing, like the hard skin does not just fall off</li>
            <li> It is now late September.  </li>
            <li> I read some reviews here prior to buying it &amp; seen complaints about how slippery &amp; dangerous it is, i suggest not to walk around while</li>
            <li> Living in the south we put in lots of sandal, flip flop and barefoot time, which leads to icky callused heels.  </li>
            <li> I am wondering if I should leave it on longer but am afraid to since I felt my skin starting to burn just before rinsing.</li>
            <li> After applying it, I wrap my feet in plastic wrap the way they did at the salon, and I leave it on for at least 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have terribly thick calluses on my heels.</li>
            <li> Immediately put thick cotton socks on and leave them on over night.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t be a dummy and waste your money !!</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it did not work as well for me as some of the other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> they were so bad that I couldn&#x27;t feel anything in those areas of my feet because it was just dry, dead, thick skin...</li>
            <li> Very messy!</li>
            <li> Think about it, they&#x27;re all skin, seriously, you expect a chemical to recognize callus?&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> It is ridiculous</li>
            <li> (the first time I probably could have went the maximum 5 minutes, but I was chicken), and now I basically use it for maintenance, every 2 weeks or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing product!!</li>
            <li> but if you get it on a sore or an open cut - it hurts bad</li>
            <li> I HAD horrible dry cracked heels and callus&#x27; on my big toe from sandals all summer .</li>
            <li> I left it on about 5 minutes on the worst part of my heels, about 2 minutes on the other parts, then used a callus scrubber.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t leave this stuff on for too long, could be painful.</li>
            <li> The callus eliminator is weak.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about buying this product even though I read all of the reviews for it on here and on other sites.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This stuff works miracles on the tough areas.</li>
            <li> then I does take off a couple layers of tough skin, but it&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;miracle</li>
            <li> I had a very thick callus.  </li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s caustic, so watch you skin and hands.</li>
            <li> My feet were worse than the before picture that Amazon has.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to go get my feet done &amp; spend unnecessary amount of money.</li>
            <li> I get a kick out of all these reviewers who atleast in writing their reviews appear to have feet even worse than mine.  </li>
            <li> It was a pain to use since it&#x27;s caustic and you need gloves and a wait time where you can&#x27;t let it touch anything.</li>
            <li> Preformed this task several times without any sufficient results in removing any layers of  hardened part from callus on base of foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I then wrapped my feet in plastic wrap for 7 minutes ( directions say 3-5 , since my feet were worse than their example I went with 7).</li>
            <li> I got tired of sitting still at about 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> It is also quite thin and you need to shake the bottle well before applying or it will just run everywhere...</li>
            <li> I apply and let sit for approximately 5mins and use my pumice stones...</li>
            <li> , I used my old cruddy one i have.</li>
            <li> NO MORE HARD CRACKED YELLOWED CRUST!!!</li>
            <li> No more dangerous shaving off the callous with a razor blade.</li>
            <li> Getting frustrated because of no quick results.  </li>
            <li> Even dirty came in between the skin which were hard to reach with soap and body scrub.</li>
            <li> I have had horrible cracked heals and calluses since I was quite young.  </li>
            <li> Mine are not as bad as some people&#x27;s but bad enough to have to sand them for quite awhile in the shower.</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I recently had a child about 1 month ago, so needless to say the bottom of my feet looked nasty &amp; cracked on the bottom.</li>
            <li> NOT impressed.</li>
            <li> and it got to be to expensive,</li>
            <li> went for a girl&#x27;s day, including an expensive pedicure with a friend who was visiting from out of town.</li>
            <li> I could be wrong, but I bought the iVog Xbuff which is a helpful tool, hoping to combine with this and discover something miraculous based on reviews I read here..</li>
            <li> When I work, I&#x27;m on my feet non-stop for up to 8 hours at a time in uncomfortable dress shoes.</li>
            <li> wrong w/ her feet</li>
            <li> /&gt;There had to be another solution, when my trusty pumice and file failed me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve taken before and after pictures - but unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I might be doing something wrong.  </li>
            <li> yes scary.</li>
            <li> WELL, NO MORE EXPENSIVE PEDI&#x27;S OR BLADES!!  </li>
            <li> I was shocked because I was expecting worse.</li>
            <li> used to &amp;#34;sand&amp;#34; my feet like crazy</li>
            <li> Potassium hydroxide is a dangerous chemical..</li>
            <li> After ordering and reading I was afraid to use it because I was concered I would be chemically burned.  </li>
            <li> Keep away from children and animals since it can be dangerous.</li>
            <li> (UNBELIEVABLE SCRAPER!!!! http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0084JQFIK/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_29).</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will try and use it again unless they get so bad</li>
            <li> Bad packaging..</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It really works but I think I still need more time to use it</li>
            <li> Really works at getting off calluses but you have to keep doing it or they just grow back.</li>
            <li> It works, my feet feels the same as when I go to the nail salon. The only downside is you have to scrub your feet.  Anyway the dead skin just sloughs off.</li>
            <li> With all of the marvelous reviews on this product, I thought I would give it a try. Well... it&#x27;s &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;. I wouldn&#x27;t call it any new miracle solution, but it remove some callused skin from my feet. Is it worth the whole mess and rubber gloves and potential poison storage problems? Nope. I&#x27;m going to stick to the cheap little foot cheese grater and be done with it.</li>
            <li> Amazing. I watch what they do to my feet in the salon and wanted to get this item. First i soaked my feet in hot water, and used a Microplane Colossal Pedicure Foot Rasp, to grate the thick callus off my feel then put the ProLinc Callus eliminator all over the remaining thick hard callus for about 5mns and began used a Mr Pumice all over my feet. The chemical in this solution literally melted the remaining nasty callus off my feel. It was almost coming off in liquid form while bufing away with Mr Pumice bar. My feel felt amazing. Super soft, callus removed evenly, im very happy!! Great products to have at home, salon quality.</li>
            <li> work really good on my husband dry, ugly and achy feet.</li>
            <li> This product works very well.  I have some calluses on the heels of my feet.  I put it on and left it for 1-2 minutes then &amp;#34;sanded: off the dead skin.  It was enough except for one little spot which I reapplied for another minute.  Perfection!&lt;br /&gt;If you are burning your skin, you are leaving it on too long.  This is a great product but the length of time to leave it on depends on the thickness of the callus.  Some may need more, some less.  Just try a few minutes at a time.&lt;br /&gt;I used to &amp;#34;sand&amp;#34; my feet like crazy and it didn&#x27;t even come close to 2 minute application of this stuff.  I am definitely buying this again when I run out.  Fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;ps.  bought the heel lotion too</li>
            <li> I tried all kind of stuffs that do not really work.&lt;br /&gt;The product does exactly as it claims for a great price.&lt;br /&gt;Instruction is clear. Result is great. Much safer than callus remover(the knife/razor kind of tool)&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a life saver product.</li>
            <li> Used after soaking feet as directed.  Buffed with a tool and my feet as soft as a babies behind!  Pretty feet!</li>
            <li> This works really good at removing the dead skin on your feet, but you have to wear gloves. I usually put it on my feet and keep rubbing my whole foot and I also use the remover as well. I also use a nail file to remove the cuticle around my nails. It works really well. I do all these for about 3 to 5 minutes... I will order it again when I run out.</li>
            <li> takes the callused right off no problem. Ill probably never pay to get a pedicure again as long as they keep making this stuff.</li>
            <li> Use this for thick callus&#x27; on my feet due to a lot of gym time.  Works great, just follow the instructions.</li>
            <li> Use with caution because this is strong stuff.  Used properly, it does the job very well.</li>
            <li> By far the best Callus Eliminator I&#x27;ve ever used and the only one that really works when doing at home.  I followed the directions found on YouTube and had amazing results.  My feet feel soft and smooth.  So glad I discovered it!</li>
            <li> This stuff works!  I got visible results after the very first use.  I left it on about 5 minutes on the worst part of my heels, about 2 minutes on the other parts, then used a callus scrubber.  Even though it&#x27;s very potent, there is no odor and I experienced no burning or pain.  Love it and will be keeping this product in the medicine cabinet as a staple!!</li>
            <li> Worked good when I used it.</li>
            <li> It works... but it&#x27;s brutal.  Follow the directions precisely.  Don&#x27;t let it get on non callous skin (or it&#x27;ll burn and hurt like hell).  It does work, I just don&#x27;t like the way it works.</li>
            <li> Product worked great and lives up to its name.  Melts the calluses like butter for easy removal. You should purchase a foot smoother to go along with this product.</li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s caustic, so watch you skin and hands. It melts away callus tissue easily and with minimal elbow grease. Highly recommended for treatment of heavy callous areas.</li>
            <li> I have never written a review for anything before but this product deserves the praise, I would give it 100 stars if I could!!! I have never had a callus treatment before I have just been filing away with every file, pumice, gadget, etc. that I come across that looks promising only to be let down. I have NEVER found anything that would actually cut thru the \\&quot;crust\\&quot; on my heels and the balls of my feet until I decided to check out Amazon&#x27;s stock and read EVERY review for this product before buying. So glad I bought it and used it for the first time tonight...NO MORE HARD CRACKED YELLOWED CRUST!!! After only 1 use my feet are as soft and smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom...LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> I think this is a great product I ordered the no smell one and they were out so their customer service called me right away and offered me the orange one.  It was better cause it worked great and the smell was really nice.</li>
            <li> Excellent callous remover!</li>
            <li> it is a solution that once applied to the soles will emove some of the callus  be carefull, your soles are going to be very slippery and on tile you can fall</li>
            <li> Great product.  Use as directed, end with pumice stone.</li>
            <li> I used the Pedegg and some of the over the counter stuff and none of them worked as good as this product. I didn&#x27;t believe it at first that, my painful calluses will be removed with one simple application but I was wrong. I put it on, five minutes later a got in the tub, washed the solution off and scraped away ALL the dead skin with very little effort. My toes looked like I have never seen them before, with new skin underneath all that ugly stuff gone but most important I didn&#x27;t cry while a was trying to scrape the dead skin off. It&#x27;s a pleasure, to take care of my calluses now. Thank you, for this amazing product!</li>
            <li> Use Natural Sierra Pumice Stone instead.  It is cheap and more efficient.  I used Be Natural Unscented Callus Eliminator first and saw some improvement of my callus.  My podiatrist advised me to use simple pumice stone instead.  I tried and it worked much better.</li>
            <li> So I have some terrible feet!  I am 32 but my feet look about 80, my husband cant believe how awfully callous they were.    I tried everything.  Vaseline on at night with socks on, sea salt soak, ped egg, baby oil.  Nothing works!     So I found this stuff on amazon and figured I&#x27;d try it, I also got the callous lotion and a different type of foot scrapper.    I can tell you my feet are just wonderful now, and so soft, you would never believe I had terrible callous feet.    the first time I used it I went easy, I got most of the callous off but not all, I had it pretty thick, I think I did a bit to much because my heel was a bit sore at first but it soon pass.  I do this every 7 days (Once a week), I let my feet soak for about 10 mins in a nice warm soak, I then apply the Callus Eliminator and leave it on 5 mins.  I then wipe off my feet with a clean towel and use the foot scrapper.  I give them another quick soak to wash off the rest of the callus stuff and dead skin and apply the lotion, and my feet are just so soft.    I still use the lotion after I shower, but other then that I dont do anything different, I still walk around my foot barefoot lol and no problems :)</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about two years and my heels are as soft as a baby&#x27;s!!!  The price and super fast shipping can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Be Natural Callus Eliminator\\&quot; is an amazing product.  I didn&#x27;t think a product could remove the callus build up on the heels my feet, but this miracle product does.  Even just one application makes an incredible difference. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this product, a little of the gel goes a long way, works great, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This stuff works great.  No more spending an extra \\&quot;5 dolla more\\&quot; when getting a pedicure.  You only need to use a drop every 2-4 weeks so the bottle will last a long time.  All you need is a pumice bar, stone, or rock and you are all set!</li>
            <li> I had a salon use this product.  It did work fine on calluses, but you have to be very careful not to get on softer tissue.  I think the salon left it on too long and they weren&#x27;t careful enough to not let touch softer skin.  Result was badly burned skin around both ankles - - very painful.</li>
            <li> I hate calluses and I get them all the time.  I&#x27;ve tried most products out there and like a lot of other reviewers, I&#x27;ve had this used on me at the salon.  I think it is amazing and does a great job.  I followed all the instuctions, and also wrapped my feet in plastic wrap (what they do at the salon) for the few minutes it was on.  It worked great even the first time.  One foot was on a little longer than 5 minutes because I was working on the other one.  It didn&#x27;t bother me at all, did not seem to effect the non callused skin at all.  Love this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> very gentle to the skin, but very effective at softening callouses. well worth the money and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Even though getting a pedicure &#x27;done&#x27; at the salon feels good, it&#x27;s such a waste of money. This stuff is the same product the girls use at the salon by my house and they charge $5 each time they use it on me, and they don&#x27;t leave it on long enough so I prefer to do it myself. It really works...you just 1) soak your feet for a few minutes to soften up the calluses 2) apply this product  3) wipe off (it doesn&#x27;t rinse easily so wipe first) 4) rinse your feet in warm water and lastly 5) use a pumice scrubber to gently buff the rough skin off- which takes very little time since the chemicals in this product soften the skin for you. Yay!</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful.  I&#x27;ve used it twice so far and my heels are soft and smooth. And the treatment lasts for weeks.</li>
            <li> This product initially removed some layers of calluses but quit working by the third application.  I&#x27;ll try to find a better product.</li>
            <li> When I read that this product \\&quot;breaks down\\&quot; calluses in 3-5 minutes, I pictured the skin on my feet burning and well, breaking down.  The bottle advises to use gloves or wash hands immediately after applying to calluses.  I sat at the edge of the bathtub and simply washed my hands, no gloves needed.  Given that I walk barefoot on tile floors all day at home, my whole foot is basically a \\&quot;callus\\&quot; so I applied it liberally, as the bottle suggested.  I left it on for about 5 minutes on each foot, and scrubbed with both a foot file and fine grater-type stainless steel file to remove the skin (you can buy a 4-in-1 foot tool to use with this, which is what I used).  I felt no discomfort or pain while the product was on my feet.  It took quite a bit of elbow grease and time, but by the time I was done, my feet were much, much softer and nicer-looking than when I started.  This is now going to be part of my beauty routine and I will be doing it weekly to keep my feet looking decent.  I refuse to pay $$$ for professional foot treatments, and this is the next best option.</li>
            <li> My pedicurist regularly uses this product with great success.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Just recently moved to a very dry climate and this stuff works great!! It&#x27;s the only thing that works really well after one application.  I&#x27;m hooked!!</li>
            <li> I found this product when I went to a spa while on vacation, and it was great! They didn&#x27;t sell it there, so I got the info and found it on Amazon. Within a few minutes of applying to difficult areas on your feet, the dead skin easily rolls off when using a basic foot file.  No razors or rough sanding needed! I was completely amazed at the difference it made.  Not only is it great to use at home, but I will definitely take it with me to all future pedicures and request that they use it. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Although this is my first time using something like this, I took extra precaution after reading the reviews expecting it to be harsh. It works ok, but seems much weaker than I expected, leaving some rough skin intact even after soaking, leaving the solution on for 5 minutes, then using a pumice bar and file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My product that just arrived, despite the bottle looking the same as in the photo here, contains the active ingredient Potassium Hydroxide. There is no Dihydroxy Propylene in mine, as is listed in the product page. I suspect that AII may of shifted to a weaker or more watered down version due to misuse or burns. Still it works ok enough to keep, but I&#x27;ll try to contact AII to ask about this change before reordering.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference using this product , I won&#x27;t recommended it</li>
            <li> I ride a bike about 40 miles 3 times a week, I hike, I run..  I&#x27;ve had calloused heels for YEARS .. even on the outer edge near my pinky toes .. they were so bad that I couldn&#x27;t feel anything in those areas of my feet because it was just dry, dead, thick skin... I finally decided to do something about it so I found this stuff on here.. read the reviews.. got the gloves and all the stuff needed..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In one single use .. applying it for 5 minutes on my heels and in the other dry spots for 5 minutes after a bath.. I used foot file and it was all gone after just several minutes.. I followed up applying the conditioner I bought separately from the same company and the next morning I was literally 100% clear.. I the heels of my feet were perfectly smooth, I could feel normally for the first time in literally years.. I plan to maintain it.. I can&#x27;t believe how much better it feels.. I got too used to my feet being beat up from all the activity.. \&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent stuff..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: Follow the directions closely .. I did have one instant where I went a little too far with the file and the stuff hit the scraped skin.. it burned like fire.. it also burns a little if you get it on your regular skin.. but not that bad, just keep a rag handy and wipe off anything that stings.. don&#x27;t go beyond the 5 minutes..</li>
            <li> Do not use this product! My friend has chemical burns so bad she&#x27;s having skin grafts on her feet this week . Potassium hydroxide is a dangerous chemical.. She&#x27;s going after them .. Lawsuit</li>
            <li> I could never find anything to help my horrible feet. This stuff is amazing. My feet were worse than the before picture that Amazon has. Now they look like the after. AMAZING!!!! I literally jumped up and down when I was finished &amp; looked at my final results.</li>
            <li> Ordered this base on these rave reviews claiming that this is some miracle product I feel ripped off/ bamboozled !!! It is not a miracle in fact it didn&#x27;t burn my non callus parts!! Think of Elmer&#x27;s glue when it dries how you can peel it. That is what this product basically is. Save your money and get some cetaphil from the pharmacy!! Please don&#x27;t be a dummy and waste your money !! Be natural should be called beripoff!</li>
            <li> did&#x27;t work as i thought it would.didn&#x27;t work no better than a lot of the product that i&#x27;ve purchase  at the pharmacy.I thought the price would have made a difference in the product</li>
            <li> I would give this 10 stars if I could.  WOW!  I have DRY heels, at times even cracked.  I go for pedicures &amp; feel so good when I leave.  Then those dry, cracked heels would return.  They reccommended callus eliminator. Unbelievable. 1st put on gloves, then rub on heels, let it sit @ 5 minutes(depending on heels), then use a pumice stone-get scrubbin&#x27;! Your heels will be so smooth.  If you have dry heels, cracked, callused-TRY THIS! You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s spa workplace uses this for their clients&#x27; feet. She came over to my house and took my bottle, so I had to buy another one. works great and makes your callouses go away.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and filed down my calluses and my heels and it did just what it said it would. However if you don&#x27;t keep up with moisturizing and using a pumice stone regularly you will have to use this product constantly. It does and amazing job with resurfacing the skin of the foot. The smell is terrible but bearable. I advise that you wear gloves when using this it will temporarily make the skin on your fingers peel if you&#x27;re not careful. Other than that overall its a great product. I would definitely repurchase this in the future :)</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  It works very well.  I use it in conjunction with the Denco Easy Grip Foot Smoother.  I simply got tired of my feet snagging on my comforter when I went to bed.  It is not a good sign when you feel like you could file down wood with your heals.  Sometimes I have to repeat the cycle twice to really get my feet smooth but that is simply because I have been neglecting them.  Make sure to use a good moisturizer on your peds...they are the only ones you get and they seem to be the one thing we forget to care for.</li>
            <li> Summer was brutal on the feet.  Too many days in flip flops.  Too much walking around the house with no shoes.  Product really does a great job if a couple of things are true:    Follow the directions.  Soaking the feet appears to be key.  We tried skipping that step and the results were not as good at all.  Have a good foot file.  Ours were a little wimpy.  Better foot file took off tons of callous.  Use moisturizer after.  We needed to do that for a couple of days.  Feet are really pretty dry otherwise.  Final tip.  We found you had to wait several days in between treatments -- even if our feet still had callous to be removed.  It is now late September.  Our feet are in great shape.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.. This is what they charge me the extra bucks for in the nail salon to get calus off my foot. Now I can do it myself for cheap.</li>
            <li> I thought i was going to use this once and my problem would be gone.  But it is a hassle if u are a busy person so I would rather pay for a pedicure and have them do it.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!! This works awesome. I got a $72 pedicure in this really nice spa and saw how the person buffed away my dead skin with little effort. When I asked her what she had used, she showed me this bottle. I new I had to get it. I tried leaving it 3 min as the bottle recommended and it was not enough. Then I tried 5 min and it was a little better. I then tried 7 min and that was the magical number. Make sure you soak your feet for 10 min before applying. Only apply to the areas where you have lots of dead skin as it will burn the \\&quot;good\\&quot; skin. Make sure you wash your hands right away after applying or use gloves. Also, make sure you apply a thick quantity as it tends to dry out. I will never again pay for a pedicure. Absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> I had terrible calluses and thought that there is no way to get rid of them. But I was wrong! This callus eliminator really helps, moreover without injuring the feet!</li>
            <li> This is the best product of its kind either over the counter or prescription. If you follow the instructions, you can lose the callus, rough skin and even the dry cuticles on your toes.  &lt;br /&gt;You can also choose to ignore the instructions and burn yourself, it&#x27;s your choice.  &lt;br /&gt;The product does exactly as it claims for a great price and the bottle will last a long time. Just remember to respect its strength.</li>
            <li> The product works better than what I get in a salon, and the results last longer.  I recommend it.  Just be careful not to get it on your hands or it dries them out.</li>
            <li> I have very calloused feet due to a medical condition. Because of the condition, I&#x27;m not supposed to file or grate my feet, so I really wanted this stuff to work. After using it several times, it works okay, but I didn&#x27;t find it to be the miracle product I was hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get regular pedicures and/or your feet aren&#x27;t heavily calloused, it will probably work great for you. If you have very calloused feet, you will be underwhelmed.</li>
            <li> I have had the worst feet since going through boot camp 12 years ago.  I saw this and thought hey, I&#x27;ll give it a try.  I swear this is the first time I haven&#x27;t had a HUGE callus on the back of my heel.  It is absolutely perfect.  The scrubber hadn&#x27;t come in yet, so i used ones we already had, and it worked.  I think the recommended one will be better though.  Its like having new feet!  I totally think if you are searching for a callus remover, this is the product for you.  I also watched the you tube video in spanish with subtitles.  Pretty simple to use.  I did a couple of times in one hour, since I freaked out over someone else comment about burning yourself.  I didn&#x27;t have any problem with it.  no irritation or anything!  a must have!!! Also it shipped super fast.  It got to me in Japan in less than a week!</li>
            <li> My callused heals can&#x27;t believe it! I live in a year-round warm climate and usually wear sandals--and the soles of my feet show it! I&#x27;ve tried many callus removing-implements, some of them very fancy and expensive (Diamencel) and none of them work as well as this.</li>
            <li> I recently had a child about 1 month ago, so needless to say the bottom of my feet looked nasty &amp; cracked on the bottom. I have tried everything for the last year to remove the callus off the bottom of my feet, pregnancy just made it worse. I just had a pedicure this past weekend and the woman used this product and I could not believe how smooth my feet are!! This is the best product to remove callus! My husband will actually rub my feet for me now!</li>
            <li> Awesome product! I&#x27;ve searched high and low for a product that actually removes calluses the way that professional nail salons do. This is it. I save so much $$ doing my own pedicures at home.</li>
            <li> so you soak your feet and than apply the product for a few minutes, than it should cause the dead skin on your feet to &#x27;rub&#x27; off with the help of a pumice stone, nothing happened!</li>
            <li> Works great, low odor.</li>
            <li> This sure saves on the upcharge when I go get a pedicure.  I love it! use it with foot creme and large rasp.</li>
            <li> Okay so I never review products on Amazon but I HAD to review this one - THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING!!!!!    I practically live in flip flops all year long, as long as its over 50* I think flip flops are appropriate - so needless to say, my feet get really gross.  I dont want to get too graphic but you could peel away at the calluses, they got caught on the sheets and bedding, it was really really awful.  In fact, my boyfriend hates when I put my feet on him because he thinks they look terrible... and I had just resigned myself to thinking I would have to have big cracks on my heels forever.  BUT then I got this product.    After three uses my feet have barely visible cracks!!!  They are soft and presentable, they look great, they feel great, I am so happy you have no idea!!    I applied the product right after I finish showering, so my feet have had a chance to soak for at least 10 minutes, then I just hang out (sometimes while I also deep condition my hair).  After I few minutes I scrub them down with a foot scrubber/pumice stone for maybe 3 minutes?  And then wash them off and they are good to go!  I did not experience any sensitivity to the skin on my hands when I applied it that other reviewers have mentioned.      The first time I noticed a HUGE difference in my feet, and by the third use my feet looked AMAZING!  I cannot get over how fantastic they feel.  I had tried everything, scrubs, stones, weekly pedicures, that scary looking cheese grater thing for the heels, all the \\&quot;only on TV\\&quot; products - but nothing worked as well as this did.    I only wish I had taken a before picture so you could see what an amazing difference I am experiencing. Dont resign yourself to gross feet forever- get this product!  Its less than $15 bucks and it is totally worth it, espcially with summer coming up!</li>
            <li> PLEASE be careful using this product! I had a salon use this on my feet during a pedicure and they got some on the soft part of the bottom of my foot (right in the middle) and now I have cuts and burns all over the bottom of the foot. It was fine on my heels, but it caused cuts and burns on the side of my ankle and side of the foot as well. I wouldn&#x27;t use it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it before and it was very good at dealing with tough callus&#x27;.  Recommended to anybody who has bad calluses.</li>
            <li> Following the directions made use of the product easy.  It did what it was supposed to do.  It softens the callus which made a more comfortable removal.</li>
            <li> All as promised and the product has been excellent. My heels were cracked to bleeding and had also been cut up a bit by using a razor blade callous remover. As the directions state, it&#x27;s definitely not a good idea to use this when you&#x27;ve got open sores as I did, but it sure removed the callous. I soaked my feet in warm water for 10 minutes and left the stuff on for the directed amount of time, but I still had to do a couple of rounds. However, sores excepted, my heels are almost baby-butt smooth. I&#x27;ll follow up with regular ammonium lactate lotion, and I think that I&#x27;ve got the problem licked.  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> This was not as effective as callus remover I&#x27;ve purchased at local drug stores. I followed the directions but was disappointed with the lack of results.</li>
            <li> Ive used this product before whenever I got my pedicures, but this time I decided to order my own and save the money$$, but when this was shipped here it was spilled everywhere it was not brand new!</li>
            <li> Love it works great just like going to the spa</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t experience the burning or any adverse effects. I followed the directions. Since you have to soak your feet before you use it, I use it after I shower. 5 minutes is enough to loosen up the skin. I scrub with a pumice stone and it&#x27;s amazing. I also use it for 3-minutes or less on my fingers and hands. I have terribly dry, cracked fingers and calluses from weight lifting. This does the trick and very quickly.</li>
            <li> I like it... its not amazing, like the hard skin does not just fall off but I did notice my skin felt better after I scrubbed them... Key is you need a good scrubber!</li>
            <li> It is great product, make the work much easy , I have dry skin from nature and have to spend a lot of time with my feet, I love to walk home without shoes and we know what the effect of it is .. it gentle remove all the death skin , I use a brush for application after feet bath so I don&#x27;t have to touch it then rinse with water for baby soft feet .. highly recommended !!</li>
            <li> This works good, but it is not a miracle worker. It also probably something you need to do on more of a regular basis. Be careful not to get any on your clothes or other skin.</li>
            <li> I was totally embarrassed to show my callused, cracked feet until I found this product.  If you have thick calluses (like I do) and find that it takes a lot of work to file away the dead skin after applying this gel:  I recommend re-soaking your heels briefly in warm water then patting them dry before continuing to file them; repeat these steps as necessary.  I found that my heels became smooth a LOT faster this way.  Highly recommend this product, but as everyone has said, follow the instructions carefully because the stuff is caustic.</li>
            <li> I tried this based on all of the great reviews--and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  It worked fabulously.  I used it with [[ASIN:B000NO58SW Mr. Pumice Two Sided Ultimate Pumice Bar]] and it worked well.  I highly recommend watching the video on the Prolinc site because they show you how to use a paper towel so that the stuff stays put.  I think it makes a big difference.  I left it on 3 minutes the first time, because I was nervous.  Still worked very very well.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This stuff works well. I followed directions and have used it about 3 times to get rid of 2 nickle sized calluses on each of my big toes. Warning..it will look worse before it looks better. My turned red and looked bad but after a week i noticed less callus as it dried into normal skin..if that makes sense. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> This product really works! I was shocked because I was expecting worse. Made my feet nice and smooth. My boyfriend lovea rubbing my feet after I use this.</li>
            <li> I have had calloused feet my whole life, and have tried different soaks, scrubs, scrapers, blades, etc., all to varying degrees of success, but nothing has worked as easily and as quickly as this product. The first time. I AM SIMPLY AMAZED!! For someone who has covered her feet up her whole life this is such a relief. Do you know how hard it is to find cute dress shoes that are closed-toe and closed-heel? Options are limited to say the least... but that is no longer a concern of mine. I am breaking out sandals this year, baby!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with other reviewers that the product is rather runny, but I just kept my legs hanging over the side of the tub, in case of any drips. I have had no issues with the product burning my non-calloused skin, but I was also careful to only apply where it was needed, and only left it on for the minimum of 3 minutes. I used the product twice the first week (the first time I probably could have went the maximum 5 minutes, but I was chicken), and now I basically use it for maintenance, every 2 weeks or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing product!!</li>
            <li> My job takes me all over the world and I meet personalities in top social status. Whether you are a man or woman (I am a man), if you are not well groomed, trust me that the people around you will notice it FAST! At a given time I may be attending a pool party or swimming with a prospect. This product is the ultimate solution for well groomed feet, especially if you are in an unfamiliar area, have no time for a pedicure etc...Use it correctly and you&#x27;ll get no burns whatsoever but you&#x27;ll be happy with immediate results!</li>
            <li> Leave it on for the full amount of time after soaking your feet and then just file away...I say it is worth the money I have so much callus I do multiple thing but this product is definitely a added plus.</li>
            <li> I had terrible calluses until I purchased this product! It has made my feet so much better! I wish I would have known about this years ago! I&#x27;ve had no skin issues using this whatsoever like some have commented about. This bottle will last you forever, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I did not like this product at all nor the smell. You have to be careful when applying it as it makes your skin peel. It peeled skin on my feet where I applied it, but it didn&#x27;t feel good and the areas felt very sensitive. I prefer using a pumace stone or foot scrubber.</li>
            <li> This is an extremely effective product.  Instructions are easy to follow (and please do, or else it could get messy/painful!).  Even after just one use it creates an amazing and lasting soft effect with almost to callus.  I used it maybe 3 or 4 times and now don&#x27;t even need it.  It pairs very well with the Microplane Brown Colossal Pedicure Foot Rasp, which I also purchased on Amazon.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love this item! It works well &amp; easy to use. I use this once every week &amp; half after shower, to save me from having to soak my feet first. But it on my calluses for like 4-5 mins, wipe off excess, microplane &amp; smooth out. Also, you have to wash your feet really good. I read some reviews here prior to buying it &amp; seen complaints about how slippery &amp; dangerous it is, i suggest not to walk around while its on your feet (its like walking around w/soap on your feet, c&#x27;mon!). But this product works! Its awesome! I don&#x27;t have to go get my feet done &amp; spend unnecessary amount of money. I can use it on my own convenience &amp; it only takes a few minutes! Been using this product for 3 months. Did &amp; will recommend!</li>
            <li> This not only worked on my feet I used it on a wart that I had on my finger and it was the only thing that worked all of the other products didn&#x27;t work like this one.</li>
            <li> I have terribly thick calluses on my heels. This softens them up and I could remove them with my fingernails. It is like finding a miracle.</li>
            <li> It did exactly what it said it would do it remove so much dead skin and callus skin on my feet. my feet never felt so good. will continue to use and recommend.</li>
            <li> I had a very thick callus.  I did exactly what the directions said to do faithfully.  Getting frustrated because of no quick results.  But one day I was walking along and the whole callus fell off.  I didn&#x27;t have to tug at it or anything.  Now it&#x27;s a little soft and I will watch it by keeping the area moist and clean with lotion.</li>
            <li> It works I think it does. I see my manicurist and pedicurist use it all the time so I know it does. I\</li>
            <li> This works!  Just like in the pedicure salon.</li>
            <li> I have had horrible cracked heals and calluses since I was quite young.  I was born and raised in South Florida and was almost always barefoot :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the same stuff that was used when I had a pedicure and the guy was able to get a good bit of the callus and cracked heals taken care of.  I just hate to spend all that time and money on pedicures when they don&#x27;t get all of the problem taken care of.  I bought this product and have used it 4 times and finally have the feet I was hoping were under all that cracking mess!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use it as directed and make sure you don&#x27;t get it on any surface that you are concerned about!  It is strong, but that is what makes it work.</li>
            <li> Ever since I started getting pedicures, I have suffered with very very cracked heals. I got this only because the reviews were so awesome. Otherwise I would have been iffy. Anyhow, I used it after showering and it took the dead skin right off!! It did however take me 4 applications on one foot because it was so badly cracked. There was no stinging like I see people claim on here.... Maybe they have more sensitive feet? Anyhow I live this product &amp; will definitely buy again when I run out! It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!!! When I was younger and got pedicures I would always allowed them to shave off all of the dead skin until I tried a new place and they told me it was not good for the skin. The new nail salon I went to would have spa pedicures and included the Callus remover. I have since moved and they new place I go to does not have this and my feet were getting bad quick and I refuse to have them razor off the dead skin so leave it to Amazon to have every item in stock!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is how I used it at home- I am doing the exact same thing my previous nail salon did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soak feet for about 10 min- I just took and long shower and allowed my skin to soften that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then get plastic wrap. The type you use to cover food with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply some of the Eliminator to the plastic wrap and apply to the sections of the foot you would like to have the callus removed from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then cover your foot with the plastic wrap and make sure the area that you used to apply the eliminator is on the bottom of your feet. If it is on the top you will burn the top skin of your foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Relax and let it sit for about 7-8 min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use a pumice stone or nail file to file down the dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rinse feet well with water and you are done.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product, based on word-of-mouth and the other customer reviews, and I was severely disappointed.  I tried this product twice as directed, and it didn&#x27;t do anything more than a normal soak and scrub would do.  I suggest you spend your $20 on a pedicure instead.</li>
            <li> ialways get pedicures and they had this item so i decided to try it out!</li>
            <li> Followed directions and this caused third degree burns on the feet and had to seek emergeny medical attention. Do Not Use!</li>
            <li> Tough callouses may need several passes with this stuff so plan to take your time.  I&#x27;m lucky to have a bench in my shower so I can sit and wait while it softens the skin.  It works but patience is required.  Once it sits on the pre-soaked skin, the residue needs to be abrased off with a rough scraper of some sort.  Then, on the last pass, a buffer followed by a rinse and lotion. Yes.  Messy and  Icky.  But then again, so are callouses so....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are unsure about the process, go to your local nail salon and watch how they do it.  It is strong but will work best with the right tools.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just okay.  I get a kick out of all these reviewers who atleast in writing their reviews appear to have feet even worse than mine.  Maybe it only works on REALLY callused feet.....Mine are just a bit callused.  Anyway, run of the mill pumice stone seems to do the same job..atleast for me.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product for your feet, if you want your feet soft when you get out the shower</li>
            <li> Same as buying it from Sally&#x27;s but cheaper!  Woot Woot!  I use it in the shower but I recommend getting some left over grocery plastic bags, put the product on your feet, wrap your feet with the bags and resume your shower or shave your legs.  This ensures the product isn&#x27;t going down the drain and staying on your feet.  If I leave it on for too long, my feet will flake for a day or two, but I don&#x27;t mind because it&#x27;s making them softer.</li>
            <li> This product works amazing well. I&#x27;m kicking myself for &amp;#34;pumicing&amp;#34; the hell out of my heels all these years. Used it exactly as directed, no problems. My MIL says she uses this exact product at her salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first bottle I received was leaking (which is bound to happen sometimes), so I reported it. Within that hour I received an email apologizing for the inconvenience. A new bottle arrived 2 days later. Seriously, the inconvenience was miniscule, the customer service was fantastic.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product at a salon in Austin, TX when getting a pedicure. The difference in my heels was amazing!  While no product or procedure has ever made my heels baby smooth for long, this product comes close.  Living in the south we put in lots of sandal, flip flop and barefoot time, which leads to icky callused heels.  Even in winter this product comes through and saves me from having ruined stockings and tights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily I was able to purchase my own bottle of this product and in between salon pedicures I get rid of the calluses on my own at home, using exactly the same process and tools as they use at the salon. You do have to use a little power and a good buffer to remove the rough skin, but it does come off. Finishing with a good moisturizer helps a lot too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Demo video is on this page: [...]</li>
            <li> I always wondered what the folks at the nail salon would dab on my feet before scrubbing away. It has to be something similar to this product. It says to wait 3-5 minutes and after about 2 min I hastily started lightly scrubbing (it works so good you&#x27;re not supposed to scrub too hard or you&#x27;ll remove too many layers of skin) and could not believe how nice my feet felt. I put lotion on and my feet were so smooth they were slipping out of my flip flops. I&#x27;m sold! Much cheaper than a pedicure and also good for in-between maintenance!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve tried this twice over the past two days and even after using this product as the instructions on the bottle indicated, I had to do a GREAT deal of buffing with a foot file.. just as much as I would had I not used this product.. not too impressed.. this maybe helps a little, with dry heels, but it doesn&#x27;t do much for actual calluses on the balls of ones feet from wearing heels.  NOT impressed.</li>
            <li> Iit does the job very well, but in addition to just simply working it makes your skin like baby skin. Love it!</li>
            <li> This worked ok for me.  Didn&#x27;t burn my skin at all and helped remove more than just a pumice by itself would do but don&#x27;t expect a miracle.</li>
            <li> I HAD horrible dry cracked heels and callus&#x27; on my big toe from sandals all summer . I was to the point I would have to pay for pedicures every two weeks just to keep it under controlled and it got to be to expensive, so I thought I would give it a try. It was totally worth it. I just soaked my feet with so epson salt and warm water for about 10 minutes, applied the remover, waited for 5 min and then used a foot file. It removed ALL my dead skin and left a pile of it in the tub!YUCK but after washing off the rest my feet, they looked and felt  brand new, already ordered two more bottles.</li>
            <li> Very fast &amp; effective.  How much would I pay now that I&#x27;ve used it?  A whole lot more than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am SO tired of having a pedicure &amp; being hard sold on adding a callus remover treatment for an extra $5 to $15. Seriously gang, this product works as well or better than what they use professionally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do I use it?  Well, I don&#x27;t take time to do the full soak first then apply, wait &amp; scrub.  I get in the shower, shampoo &amp; put conditioner on.  I turn off shower, put this all over my calluses to soak in while I soap up &amp; shave, then scrub this off with a Mr. Pumice, and rinse everything at once.  It probably adds 2 minutes total.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I did the recommended process on the bottle, it would work even better. For less than $8, I think it costs me about 20 cents each use!</li>
            <li> I ALWAYS SEE THE SALONS USING PRODUCTS LIKE THIS AND IT WORKS. COMBINE WITH THE CALLUS REMOVER TOOL AND IT IS EASY AND SHOWS MAJOR RESULTS A MUST HAVE.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it you can get a pedicure, but they aren&#x27;t going to allow you to soak your feet as long as they need to be in order for you to get the results you want. ProLinc Callus Eliminator loosens the dead skin on your feet in a matter of minutes for faster removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happens if you decide to run water in your bathtub and soak your feet until they get all wrinkled then you put ProLinc Callus Eliminator on it and use your Mr. Pumice? Guess what your feet will turn out better than they would if you paid $35 to sit in a chair for 11 minutes while being exposed to germs from other patrons that were clearly not eliminated from everything. I started doing pedicures at home to save money when I realized I was never completely satisfied unless I did it myself now you can too by using the same tools that the pros use in the privacy of your own home!</li>
            <li> I do not trust third parties to work on my feet as I believe I will do better than somebody else. However I do not like this procedure because i have hard time to make my heels nice and soft. Once i purchased this product, I have no problem with my regular pedi any more. I just soak my feet in hot water for 10-15 minutes, wipe them with towel and immediately put on ProLinc Callus Eliminator and leave it on for a few minutes (the key word is Immediately, otherwise it will not work as well, by my own experience) . Then i wipe gel off and rub with pumice. Dead skin comes right off leaving my heels soft almost like a baby&#x27;s.  I did the same thing with my husband&#x27;s feet and he was very happy with result as well.</li>
            <li> Will recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Actually works but I left on for about 10 minutes and then use a course file or pumice stone type thingy</li>
            <li> Pro linc Callus Eliminator is very efficient. i recommend ,I have feet really soft it is better that a pedicurist</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time last night, and I was extremely happy.  I work in retail, and the bottoms of my feet get pretty rough.  This softened them in just a few minutes.  I soaked my feet first, applied the product and pumiced away!  It looks like I got new feet.  All soft and pretty.  Well, at least as pretty as my feet can get!</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the great reviews but I have seen no improvement of my calluses.  I have used the callus eliminator as directed on the bottle.</li>
            <li> I will buy this product for the rest of my life. It works just like it said it would within two minutes my feet were so smooth and my heels looked so healthy.</li>
            <li> American International    Be NATURAL Callous Eliminator    The bottle with Earth Friendly green printing?    Asking about that product?    Company document below.    My review?    Works as good as Draino.....has almost or more than 50% of the Lye as Toilet Drain Openers    The active ingredient of this product is Potassium Hydroxide, lye, used to clean clogged drains.    If we use it sparingly, with ventilation    Never touch non calloused skin,    We should never inhale, ingest    This can affect the lungs etc...  See below...    Potassium hydroxide    As drain cleaner has 18-36%    Callous Eliminator has 19+%    Manicure and pedicure professionals, have quit, rather than use this brand  Many are undettered and still   use this product    Here are the WARNINGS    From this company    and    the State of New Jersey.gov Right To Know    [...]</li>
            <li> Really effective for callus&#x27;s. Only annoying thing is how quickly they return.</li>
            <li> Great Staff. I love it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is magical!</li>
            <li> I choose to rate this product because it really work. dead skin be gone.I use it a lot and its good</li>
            <li> Worked well enough when I used it twice to get the majority of a super stubborn callus in the crook of my big toe off. Got it down to less noticeable at least...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then a few days later the remainder just up and died and fell off. Works for me I guess.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products that I have used or have had as an service used.  My nail salon just started using this product as well.  It really softens the roughness and callus so that they are easily removed.</li>
            <li> I went for a pedicure while on vacation in Texas and the guy was complaining about how I must walk around in bare feet all the time, blah, blah, blah.  The next thing I know he puts some of this stuff on my feet and they were baby soft!  A MUST HAVE.</li>
            <li> does it really work? nah.. i tried a few times...  doesnt even remove callus at all whatsoever...  total waste of money</li>
            <li> Like the product but did not like the fact that the shipment required a signature for delivery confirmation. The reason I order on-line is to save time. Rather than save time, I had to take off work early to make it to the post office in time to pick it up and sign for it. Only a $5 item and ended up costing much more since I took off early from work and had to drive to the post office. Sellers should state this is required on low cost items, would not have ordered</li>
            <li> I tried this product several times and it did absolutely nothing. I followed the directions exactly and even left it on for longer than suggested and there still were no results.</li>
            <li> I remember trying this once at a salon and it made my foot baby soft. You could see the dead skin flake off. However when I bought it myself and applied 2 applications, it barely made a dent. I used gloves at first, but since it worked so badly I applied the second applications with my (also callus) hands and it barely worked there either. I would be happy to order the extra strength version, but this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00011JZWW Be Natural Unscented Callus Eliminator 4 oz.]]&lt;br /&gt;I went for a girl&#x27;s day, including an expensive pedicure with a friend who was visiting from out of town. The lady who was doing my feet asked me if I wanted a \\&quot;callus treatment\\&quot;, I said sure, she whispered, \\&quot;eight dollar\\&quot;, but I heard her, I went a head with it, she popped out this callus eliminator, applied it to my very crusty heels, afew minutes later she was using a regular file and rolls of dead skin came off (eeeewwww!!) I was thinking the extra money might be worth it, and when I looked at my baby soft feet, it was. I came home and bought the orange scented large bottle off Amazon, and some vinyl gloves, and have done this at home ever since, did a couple of friend&#x27;s feet, too.  This stuff works very well, and is worth every penny! Much better for me than going to the nail salon, I paid about the same for the one time pedicure as I did for the large bottle of this. Just follow the directions. By the way, I suffer from severely dry cracked heels, at the time I had the pedicure, there were no cracks. You cannot use this when you have a cracked heel...it will sting... I have tried other stuff, including a 30 dollar pumice on a handle, other stones, the egg shaver thing and not one give you the easy results, and smooth skin that this stuff does. I also recommend thier lotion, it&#x27;s not greasy and keeps those heels supple.</li>
            <li> It did not really soften the callus enough for removal, until after 3 applications.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to provide some moisturizing benefits as well, however.</li>
            <li> This stuff gets my feet so smooth.  My manicurist uses it so I bought some for in between pedicures.  Now my feet are so smooth, I only get mini pedicures. Saving more than the cost of the product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to avoid having to sand my calluses over and over. Mine are not as bad as some people&#x27;s but bad enough to have to sand them for quite awhile in the shower. I went through the steps according to the directions and still had to sand quite a bit afterward. I expected them to come off easier than they did. It was a pain to use since it&#x27;s caustic and you need gloves and a wait time where you can&#x27;t let it touch anything. I am wondering if I should leave it on longer but am afraid to since I felt my skin starting to burn just before rinsing. I don&#x27;t think I will try and use it again unless they get so bad I can&#x27;t sand them smooth while showering. I also bought this to avoid paying for pedicures as often.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!&lt;br /&gt;Just follow the instructions&lt;br /&gt;I applied the gel and wrapped my foot in clear plastic wrap....&lt;br /&gt;Results are same as in salons!&lt;br /&gt;Such a good saving.</li>
            <li> Yes, I,d highly recommend to anybody who has severe callus-corn probs.....was big big help for my feet callus-corn problems so far!</li>
            <li> Tried this on a callus that turned out to be a wart, and did a pretty dang good job of removing the excess skin.  The wart didn&#x27;t disappear, but it stopped bleeding on excess friction on the wart.  So that&#x27;s nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now that it&#x27;s gone and I don&#x27;t have &amp;#34;calluses&amp;#34; (warts) anymore, I&#x27;m not sure what to do with it.</li>
            <li> This stuff did nothing. I was really hoping it would work and was looking forward to the results...however the results were zero.</li>
            <li> I would be very careful while using this product because it is so very powerful and can burn your skin.</li>
            <li> It sure is a good addition to my pedicure routine - it helps my heels and sides of my feel feel so much more smooth with less scrubbing BUT it does little to actual calluses. I have a very hard callus on the balls of my feet near the pinkies and this product didnt do much at all. I had to do the cycle of apply-wait-scrub cycle about 4 times to get anything off at all. Also i increased the wait time to 10 minutes and that didnt do much either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a good cosmetic product but not medicinal strength.</li>
            <li> Is very runny and difficult to apply.  You need a place that you can put your feet up so they do not get everywhere.  I did not find that the treatment did much.  I went back to using a file</li>
            <li> This really works - just follow the directions.  Even better when you add a Swiss foot file to scrub off the callouses.</li>
            <li> Not noticing that this does anything specifically. I could be wrong, but I bought the iVog Xbuff which is a helpful tool, hoping to combine with this and discover something miraculous based on reviews I read here..but instead, maybe I&#x27;m doing it wrong, maybe mine aren&#x27;t simple enough..but this doesn&#x27;t appear to do much if anything.</li>
            <li> This has worked better than other products I&#x27;ve tried. I used it with a Mr. Pumice to remove calluses then I use flexitol heel balm with urea to moisturize.</li>
            <li> Make your feet soft, Good on price, Easy to use, Use it with a scrubber, Cheaper on Amazon send the salon</li>
            <li> This works well, but is not a magical cure. I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times and my horribly calloused feet get better with each use, but it&#x27;s going to take more work.</li>
            <li> Followed directions of application to infected area.  Preformed this task several times without any sufficient results in removing any layers of  hardened part from callus on base of foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchased Dr. Scholl&#x27;s &#x27;ET&#x27; Callus Remover kit (For half the cost of ProLinc) made one application with medicated disk and protective cushion and within forty-eight hours most of the callus on foot was removed.</li>
            <li> Simply put this product works. Rather than harsh tools that sand away the hooves this cuts through and sloughs away the callus.  Beware, this is not a one-time cure-all.  You have to continue to use it otherwise the callus will reform.</li>
            <li> Just did not work as expected. Not nearly so strong as others rated it to be. You might as well buy something at your local CVS.</li>
            <li> I tried this product several times and it did absolutely nothing. I followed the directions exactly and even left it on for longer than suggested and there still were no results.</li>
            <li> Like many, I;ve been searching for an effective product to deal with rough dry scaly heels. This product definatly improved my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Callous Eliminator 2-3 times a week, after showering when the skin was softest.  However be aware that CE contains potassium hydroxide which is a caustic alkaline product. This is what softens and minimizes calluses.  While proper application to caluses is not dangerous, be sure not to get this product on any non-calloused skin.  Trust me on this. I also recommend that you apply with a tounge depressor or other item to smooth the product over skin, I would not suggest using your bare hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the effectiveness, I found Callus Eliminator does the trick.  Over time and consistent use, within a few weeks my dry calloused feet improved a great deal.  I followed up removal of the product (with a cloth or tissues) with a pumice stone.  Do not follow with a razor or other metal implement whcih could score or severely abrade the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In between use of CE, I suggest use of rich creams and socks at night. Hope you experience the same sucess I did.</li>
            <li> i used this as directed and no deal.  i was also upset that the product leaked in the package even before it was delivered.  i followed the instructions as shown on you tube with plastic wrap and so forth.  it simply does not work in a nutshell.</li>
            <li> This stuff contains lye ….watch out, I threw mine in the garbage.y</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li> The first time I had this used on my feet at the nail salon I was so impressed with how smooth my feet stayed, that I bought some on my own for when I do my own feet de-scaling.  Works well if you flow the instructions.  I wouldn&#x27;t leave this stuff on for too long, could be painful.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes, but sadly this didn&#x27;t work at all for me. Soaked my feet, dried them, applied the product fairly generously, waited five minutes, rubbed a pumice stone on my heel, and....... nothing. Absolutely nothing came off. Waste of money. Still looking for something that actually works!</li>
            <li> used 5min routine once per day. it really works. but required to washout after. will keep using and hope my feet back to smooth</li>
            <li> i love it works really great! i highly recommend this and will buy it again! i was hesitant at first but after the first and second try ugh! my feet feel smoother than before and free of calluses</li>
            <li> I was hopeful after reading reviews that this would remove calluses. Not much on the market apparently does. I got calluses about a couple of years ago and have been trying everything to get rid of them. This is more effective than some, but not overly effective. Your feet will be softer (it softens the callus), but this far hasn&#x27;t removed them. Some items don&#x27;t even soften the callus, so for that reason I think this is a better product and is not completely deceptive in its claims.</li>
            <li> I have used this product many times. The lady at the spa that does my pedi&#x27;s uses this same stuff. I use it once a week at home and it makes a HUGE difference! I tell all my girl-friends about it. Buy it.....use it....love it!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this did anything really.  I used the product as recommended, and I don&#x27;t think it increased the amount I was able to sand down my callouses with my pumice bar.  I really don&#x27;t think it does anything.</li>
            <li> This product really works and it gets the job done. Make sure you apply on your calculus only! other areas in foot that don&#x27;t have calculus would burn your skin. Before apply it, you must the direction. I use a foot buffer to scrape everything. highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I used it only once and really did not like the outcome.  I think a professional may do better but it is not a home use product friendly item.</li>
            <li> Callus Eliminator came today picked up the bag noticed it was glossy and the pouch was open a little bit half of it was spilled in the bag not a happy camper</li>
            <li> This product was a waste of money &amp; if I hadn&#x27;t of thrown away the details for sending it back I would have definitely returned it.</li>
            <li> this is a product that i will actually reorder, works great and does as it advertises i have the rough feet and this works</li>
            <li> Works great!  Just like the stuff they use at salons for pedicures!  I use it with the micro plane foot shaver($12), looks like a small cheese graters.  These two together make the skin easily slough off without harsh rubbing or shaving.</li>
            <li> After reading some reviews, I was positive that this would work for me.  It barely did anything and I followed the instructions. Was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great.  It melts callouses away.  Definitely want to soak your feet first and don&#x27;t leave it on for too long.</li>
            <li> Not necessary at all to remove calluses I&#x27;ve found.  Soak your foot in the bathtub before removing for a safer and just as affective alternative</li>
            <li> Works good,but since I use the O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Healthy Feet Creme, I haven&#x27;t need to use this at all. It is strong stuff though.</li>
            <li> This is the &amp;#34;acid-like&amp;#34; stuff (or it is acid)  that salons use and really does work when applied as directed, keeping it on the longer duration of the range of minutes suggested. I use a large &amp;#34;cheese grater&amp;#34; looking thing and the two things together are fabulous!</li>
            <li> The Callus Eliminator worked great at first, but the calluses would come back and had to re apply it.  I thought once you used it you would never has calluses again</li>
            <li> Works in minutes. No harsh smells</li>
            <li> Looked for a product like this after having a pedicure.  Found this product at a beauty supply store for $25.  Found it here for under $10 and thought I&#x27;d try it.  After one easy application, my feet are so smoothe and soft.  They were seriously rough and calloused too!  It worked great!</li>
            <li> Bad packaging.. I should be fully reibursed beacuse of the waste of time......I will appreciate if you guys can do something about it.</li>
            <li> I think this is what solons use, and so much chaper than paying for a pedicure.  Follow the directions and you&#x27;ll have soft, smooth skin on your heels.</li>
            <li> The callus eliminator is weak. Not strong enough for thick callus need to repeat 2-3 times just to remove a little layer of callus ( used pumice stone).</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but this product really works. Use sparingly because it can burn but it definitely gets rid of cracked heels!</li>
            <li> Awesome product!!! i think i won&#x27;t need to go for a pedicure anymore. I got the product last week and used it the same day. soaked my feet for 15 mins and then used the product on my heels, left it on for 5 mins and then wipe it off with towel. used the pumic stone to get the dead skin out. and wow. my feet were soft and without callus free. I gave my mom a pedicure and she has very dry and cracked heels and they were so soft afterwards that i couldn&#x27;t believe it. One mistake that i made was that i didn&#x27;t wear gloves which i should have. because later on my hands skin was peeling off. Its very strong chemical and SHOULD ALWAYS WEAR GLVOES BEFORE USING IT. I will definitly buy it again.</li>
            <li> This product arrived early and really does a good job on callus.  I first learned  about this product while having a pedicure</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m fiarly impressed but not as much as i&#x27;d hoped.  It doesn&#x27;t seem as strong as the description and instructions lead me to believe.  I will try using it several time with a few days break between uses to allow skin to rest.  It&#x27;s still better than not using anything, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s strong enough to warrant wearing gloves for protection.  after application, I just wiped my hands off on tissue, without washing and didn&#x27;t have any problems.  if that changes in the future, I will certainly update the review with more information.</li>
            <li> Works very well at softening the extremely tough callous making it far easier to scrape with whatever tool suits you. Use gloves or finger cots to protect your skin, it really dries them out. Follow the directions, this stuff is potent.  I&#x27;d even go so far as to say that if you only have mildly calloused feet you may want to try something less aggressive, but for really nasty hard thick callous it makes knocking it down a lot easier.</li>
            <li> This thing really works! I went to a nail salon and a employee used this on my foot and my feet has been perfect ever since. I&#x27;ve been using it ever since. This really is heaven sent for all feet lol thank you for this product I&#x27;m satisfied!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Bought one for me and as a gift! Works great with the micro plane colossal that you can buy on amazon!! Get a pedicure every couple of weeks in my own home without having to pay $25 each time!</li>
            <li> Great stuff. You must use as described and several times before you see results. Would recommend to anyone looking for a callus remover.</li>
            <li> So far so good! I had some annoying calluses on my feet from wearing work boots 5 days out of the week. Now that I&#x27;m on pregnancy bed rest I figured I&#x27;d take some time to work on myself. I first used this last night and the layers of skin coming off was disgusting! Amazing and wonderful, but disgusting! It may take a few applications to get all of your calluses off, but it takes a lot of the work out of filing and filing for days! Give your feet a good scrub and soak first then use it. I haven&#x27;t experienced any burning yet but I&#x27;m also extremely cautious about following the directions and keeping the product only on the parts of my feet that need it.</li>
            <li> No need for expensive pedicures now!</li>
            <li> I want to add an edit to my remarks on this product. After using this product for many months I want to change my review rating to a five, BUT there is, at least when I am using this product, a trick to making this product work. I soak my feet about five minutes, then put the product on, and then soak again for about five minutes, put a bit more product on, and let sit for about five minutes, GENTLY wipe the product off, and use a pumice stone. The callus comes right off. The only downside to the product is the amount of time spent soaking your feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Be Natural Callus Eliminator\\&quot; isn&#x27;t a miracle product, but it does a good job of removing rough skin and calluses on your feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole process takes a while: soak your feet, leave the callus remover on for about five minutes, pumice the rough skin away, but I would say the time is worth the end result...nicer looking feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that if I use this product every two weeks, my feet look good.</li>
            <li> I did not find this product very helpful.  I was careful to follow the instructions exactly as provided, but for me simply using file or egg shaped file and then using their heal lotion to be much more effective if used on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!! This stuff really worked on my rough, dry, cracked, callused feet. I spent the afternoon working on my feet really pampering them.  My feet were horrible Ithey would wear holes in socks in just a couple of hours, and forget all about wearing nylons.  I have worn through the sheets on the bed and drawn blood from my husbands shins.  This product is amazing it ate through all the thick hard skin in no time.  My feet thank you, I thank you and my husband thanks you!</li>
            <li> This works for callus removal. I use this instead of getting Spa Pedicure at the nail salon, its much.</li>
            <li> If I could have given this no stars I would have. I bought this because my feet have really been taking a beating with me working out running so much. This product did NOTHING at all. I read the directions clearly and put a generous amount on my feet and then used a foot file and nothing. When I wiped it all off after 5 minutes I thought my foot felt like I had just got out of the shower, but within 15 minutes my feet felt exactly the same as before. Later on that day I felt like I put this junk of my feet for nothing because they had the same calluses as before no change and not even slightly better. I thought maybe I should try it again to be for sure, so I used 2 days later and still NOTHING. After that 2 days later still NOTHING. Maybe I received a defective item, but with this many good reviews I really tried to wait so I could get the results everyone is raving about, but it didn&#x27;t work and this was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> I have seriously calloused feet, so much that it is embarrassing to have a pedicure. I have had every type of pedicure possible, with clippers, shavers, paraffin wax ect... It reduces the calluses some but always painful for days afterward, this stuff is a miracle and not painful in anyway. I soaked my feet for 10 minutes, then applied the eliminator directly on my heels and covered with a gauze 4x4 ans soaked some more, I then wrapped my feet in plastic wrap for 7 minutes ( directions say 3-5 , since my feet were worse than their example I went with 7). I then unwrapped , rinsed and used a Microplane Colossal foot file , the hard callus just melted away, super easy, I scrubbed them for about 5 minutes each, I then put on the dry heel eliminator and some socks. My heels are pink and normal looking for the first time in years. I think I will do another treatment in about a week to get the other calluses on my feet. I have spent sooooooo much money on pumices, planes, foot scrubs, lotions, pedi eggs, even a battery operated so called callus remover, I have spent countless hours working on my feet and NEVER , even after weeks of scrubbing gotten my feet to look like this. My calluses were very embarrassing i was very good at hiding my feet and most of the previous treatments would only smooth over the top layer and kinda polish them, still leaving the horrible callus. I don&#x27;t normally leave reviews but if it helps just one other person with the problem feet like mine then it is worth it. It price is way better on amazon, locally they sell a small bottle less than one ounce for 5.99 this bottle is 4 oz , looks like it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> What this product does is to burn away any old skin on your body, btw, your whole body is covered with old skin. That&#x27;s why if you apply it on soft skin for a few of minutes, you will get burnt. Think about it, they&#x27;re all skin, seriously, you expect a chemical to recognize callus?&lt;br /&gt;So when using this product, don&#x27;t apply too much for long time. Of course, use on place with callus.</li>
            <li> Wear gloves when using this product.  Set out some paper towels in the tub.  Soak feet in warm water to prepare feet - about 20 minutes.  Apply Callus Eliminator to the rough areas of the foot.  Place your feet on the paper towels to let the solution absorb per the instructions.  Usually leave it on for 5-7 minutes.  Then scrape the callous areas with a grater.  Something like the Microcplane Colossal Pedicure Rasp or Danco Callus Shaver.  This is what the salon would do for my pedicure so now I do it at home to maintain my heels.</li>
            <li> I have seen this product be used in salons so when I saw it online, I wanted to get it for my stock.  It works okay, but I think the way it would work better is if you actually had someone to put it on for you and you could sit with them elevated after soaking, so it can really do it&#x27;s job.  If you&#x27;re really flexible, you can probably do this all yourself -- me, not so much.</li>
            <li> This is the same product nail salons and spas use for callus removal. It is very effective and with regular use, your feet will remain sandal ready. If you are planning to use this at home, you will need a pumice and heavy-duty moisturizer. A pumice is needed to rid feet of loose skin after the product has been applied. I prefer a natural volcanic pumice over the less efficient synthetic type. A heavy-duty moisturizer will keep newly exposed skin supple. I like &#x27;mediterranean olive almond &amp; sage WONDERBALM&#x27; by Boots available at Target.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this twice now.  The first time I did it after a shower.  And then I filed as usual.  I was hoping for more dramatic results than what I normally get... darnit, I didn&#x27;t.  Listen, I&#x27;m 40-something and live in Arizona, rarely wear shoes, and live in a house that is tiled throughout.  My feet are BAD.  I have to pamper them weekly at a minimum so they don&#x27;t catch on the bathroom rug.  No joke.  So I am in need of something industrial grade.  Professional grade (as this claims to be, and frankly is the same product I&#x27;ve seen at my local salon where I get to treat myself to the occasional pedicure) is not the same as industrial/medical grade that I might need.  Anyway, second attempt I tried applying it and then wrapping in plastic wrap - which definitely made it easier to walk to the sink to wash my hands after touching the stuff.  Oh, and this was also after a shower.  So I let it sit longer.  I thought I would let it go until it started to burn or tingle... I got tired of sitting still at about 20 minutes.  Then I wiped and filed.  And I got the same result as when I do this straight out of the shower AGAIN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this may be great for people who can&#x27;t put in the elbow grease, or have baby calluses, or have never tried shaving/filing their own calluses to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll give it 2 stars because, you know, I only did it on my own feet.  Not yours.</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you have problems with callused feet! Use it with gloves though and try very little, when using for the first time! I used it on my heel where I had a tiny crack which quickly turned into a large vefy painful one after getting to much of the remover on there.</li>
            <li> Was so excited to get this product and try out.  I did use rubber gloves as suggested from other reviews.  I don&#x27;t think I put enough product on my feet so next time I will use more and see how it works.  I followed the directions and after removing the product I rinsed and used a callus file to remove the callus.  It worked beautifully. I would have preferred a little more of the callus to be removed so next time I will use more product.  This is worth the time and money.</li>
            <li> so far so smooth for my me time... all smiles. 1app. will keep it up for a while &amp; come to share later.</li>
            <li> saves lots of money on pedicures.  can treat myself any time I want or need&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 2 3 4 5 6</li>
            <li> I looked at the reviews and thought I would try this. I was very disappointed that it just didn&#x27;t work. was packed and shipped well.</li>
            <li> This is close as I&#x27;ve come to a professional pedicure in the comfort of my own home.  I was amazed at the amount of dead skin that just rubbed away.  I wish I had known about this long before now.</li>
            <li> It really works! No more rubbing, sawing and scrubbing every time you take a shower. No more dangerous shaving off the callous with a razor blade. Just soak your feet, apply for 5 minutes and the callous and dead skin come off in one (possibly two) applications using a foot scrubber or foot file. I used to pay 25-45 dollars for a pedicure just to get rid of the callouses, now I just use ProLinc Callus Eliminator. I discovered it when a spa in a fancy hotel used it on my &#x27;problem feet&#x27;. Now you can get spa quality callous removal at home.</li>
            <li> Nothing to dislike here.  Have to pair up with a great little machine like the Tip2Toe or something similar.  Would recommend for all.</li>
            <li> I started doing my pedicures at home to save some money and this was the missing link. This stuff works miracles on the tough areas. Accompany this with foot pedi-file and foot razor and your good to go. I do believe this is nail salon quality. If its not its pretty close because my feet feel better than any expensive pedicure I&#x27;ve ever paid for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need this for DIY pedicures or feet maintenance in between appointments.</li>
            <li> ProLinc Callus Eliminator works well.  Use it in conjunction with the Microplane Colossal Pedicure Rasp.  Use the rasp 1st then follow up with callus eliminator the next day.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Emjoi MicroPedi Foot Buffer AP-3RP at the same time and that did the job without the potential danger of the Callus Eliminator which has the danger of burning or damaging tissue.</li>
            <li> After reading the great reviews I purchased this, didn&#x27;t work for me, not sure if it was expired but it just did not work at all.  I even tried leaving it on way longer than recommended and it just didn&#x27;t work.  Won&#x27;t try again.</li>
            <li> I like this product, fast shipping, high quality, easy to use, fast acting 3-5 minutes, I love this product, I will get a big one</li>
            <li> I never knew this would help rid me of these calluses, and I was desperate to try anything! I was ripping my pantyhose....a wardrobe malfunction! This really helps.</li>
            <li> Its okay will continue to use daily have&lt;br /&gt;not seen any improvement since I started&lt;br /&gt;using it for my callus</li>
            <li> Item received in good condition. I was pleasantly surprised that this item worked as indicated. Have recommended it to others &amp; will definetly re-order when needed.</li>
            <li> I never had a pedicure before so I can&#x27;t say if professionals use this stuff... but if they do it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me. It worked amazingly well. I have lots of calluses on my feet and this made them melt away. It was pretty amazing. Paired with their cream and it worked miracles.</li>
            <li> This product is fine.  Could be stronger or more directions.  what else t o say I am amature so not sure if using correctly.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AWESOME. Does a great job at breaking down the callus. For the first time in years I don&#x27;t have cracked, painful heels. It does sting a little if it gets into a crack, but it really wasn&#x27;t that bad... Felt the same as if you had cleaned a cut with rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, the smell is acceptable. And I feel it needs to be washed within 3 mins.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t incredibly pleased with this product. It did remove some built up callus&#x27;, but it didn&#x27;t seem to work as well as other reviews made it seem. It did however make my hands peel, so maybe my feet are just rougher than most others. I say give it a try, because it does yield results, but not if you have rough feet like I do. Head to your local salon and have them take care of you.</li>
            <li> I was very unsatisfied with this product. When I ordered it, I was SO excited that I might be able to have soft, smooth feet. I was very disappointed. I work retail and go to college full time (I walk around 2 miles a day on campus ALONE just getting to my classes). When I work, I&#x27;m on my feet non-stop for up to 8 hours at a time in uncomfortable dress shoes. My feet take a serious beating and my foot has turned into one large callus. When I tried this the first time, I soaked for 5 minutes then applied the product for 5 minutes. NOTHING. Not even a small difference. In fact, I think it was worse because when I scrubbed with the foot file, it broke the top later of skin, so when it dried, the skin was rough and jagged. SO, after reading more reviews, I decided to try again, I soaked for 20 minutes and applied the product for 8 MINUTES! My hand hurt from how hard I was scrubbing. The results were minimal and I feel that I could have gotten the same thing with just the foot file alone. I see that there are a few that are as dissatisfied as I am. I have an old trick that works better (but still not 100% callus free). It just takes forever. Do this right before bed. Get some Dr. Scholl&#x27;s overnight foot cream. Massage it into your feet just like lotion until you skin has absorbed it. Immediately put thick cotton socks on and leave them on over night. In the morning, the skin is soft enough to be scrubbed away (with a little elbow grease). I just don&#x27;t often have the time for that.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much, but you should definitely use gloves when applying.</li>
            <li> WORKED JUST AS DESCRIBED IN PROMO  -&lt;br /&gt;JUST DON&#x27;T LEAVE IT ON TOO LONG  (MAKE&lt;br /&gt;SURE YOU FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS ON&lt;br /&gt;THE LABEL)</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but the product really worked.  I just followed the instructions and my feet are so soft.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  I had the worst looking feet for the longest time.  My heels were dry and cracked, as well as the balls of my feet.  After just one use my husband asked me whose feet these were! I will always use this.  I followed the instructions for how long to leave the product on and the results were unbelievable!,</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! I normally always upgrade my pedicure to have this product applied, but it&#x27;s a huge cost saver to DIY. It&#x27;s worth the price, you need very little. You do have to  be careful where and how you apply so you don&#x27;t burn any sensitive skin that&#x27;s not calloused. It is messy to do a pedi with this, but a pedi without it just isn&#x27;t thorough enough.</li>
            <li> this worked as described, in fact I didn&#x27;t even leave it on as long as it recommended AND I put my feet in water right away to soak while the solution was still on,  I used a very coarse foot file and the skin comes right off.  follow with a heavy moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My callouses must be hopeless because this is like using Neet or Nair hair remover on my soles... it did not work for me at all. I&#x27;ll go back to soaking and scraping.</li>
            <li> Product itself isn&#x27;t bad but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it online again.  Packaging wasn&#x27;t very good, especially considering this is a caustic solution.  They just threw the bottle in a bubble-lined envelope.  I immediately noticed liquid leaking through before I even opened it.  When i opened it the entire bag was coated in the fluid and most of the writing had been removed from the bottle (its caustic!)  Using gloves i opened the bottle to see how much was left inside and it was about half empty.  I packaged it up better and shipped it back.  I later found the exact same product at a local beauty supply store for a comparable price.  But that one isn&#x27;t smooshed in shipping.</li>
            <li> I have heavy calluses on my big toes and have used a callus remover that I found in the drug store that really didn&#x27;t do much.  So I decided to try this brand because it said it contained natural products to gently remove calluses and hard, thick skin.  It does an okay job, but it is far from &amp;#34;natural!&amp;#34;  It has some pretty toxic ingredients that will take the skin off anything it touches...so be very careful when applying.  I have to leave it on for the full five minutes for it to be effective...then I does take off a couple layers of tough skin, but it&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;miracle cure&amp;#34; for calluses and hardened skin.  It is also quite thin and you need to shake the bottle well before applying or it will just run everywhere...heed this advice - I&#x27;ve been there!</li>
            <li> it really does melt the nasty old skin from the heel - and I use it on my big toe and ball of the foot too - seems to need to be done every couple of weeks for my horrid old feet - it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> this is a very strong preparation for destroying calluses, if you have abnormally thickened calluses that have to be removed in bulk this is your stuff - but if you get it on a sore or an open cut - it hurts bad</li>
            <li> Arrive fast and well packed. The product worked wonders for me. I now use one a month to keep my feet&#x27;s looking and feeling soft.</li>
            <li> After years of walking around on deeply callused feet and feeling embarrassed at nail salons as they kept shaving and shaving off the thick skin on my heels, I finally found something that I can use at home and get wonderful results. I soaked one foot at a time for about 45 seconds in my sink, and then sat down with a medical latex glove on my hand to apply this gel to the callused surfaces. I read a magazine for a few minutes, and then put my foot back in the sink and scrubbed the calluses with one of those heavy grit rectangular scrubbers. It didn&#x27;t take long before I was satisfied that enough of the tough skin was gone. I couldn&#x27;t believe it when I dried my foot and found my heels to be baby soft, and without razor blades! I bought Amlactin to rub into my feet, and that keeps the skin soft.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all! Waste of money! tried it multiple times, and hardly took care of anything. Very messy! not recommended at all!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really work for part of my feet, where has serious callus on it. But it works well for heels</li>
            <li> Wow, I&#x27;m not usually prone to writing to reviews, but had to do so for this product.  I&#x27;m amazed and a believer!  I tried this first at a pedicure and decided to buy my own bottle.  I have the roughest heels ever.  My husband always said I look like i have heels of a hundred year old lady (at 30!).  After using this, all the callus miraculously went away.  You do need to use this regularly though, just like any maintenance product.</li>
            <li> started using this when they sold it at a salon i used to go to, it&#x27;s the best thing ever and really requires no scraping or cutting, i use it on my heels</li>
            <li> Removes all the callous and dead skin from my heels. I apply and let sit for approximately 5mins and use my pumice stones...feet feel amazing!!</li>
            <li> This is awesome! Just to test it out, I scraped before I used it (UNBELIEVABLE SCRAPER!!!! http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0084JQFIK/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_29). I used the Eliminator, waited 5 minutes, rinsed and then scraped again with so much more coming off!!! It does not irritate or &amp;#34;go too far&amp;#34; I found it stunning!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had calloused feet for many, many years.  I love wearing high heels, as well as  sandals, flip flops, and walking barefoot.  Doing so has sent me to the pedi chair numerous times the past 20 years.  Prior to getting pedi&#x27;s, I used dangerous razor blades to remove the callous after soaking feet in warm water.  WELL, NO MORE EXPENSIVE PEDI&#x27;S OR BLADES!!  After reading the reviews a week ago for this product, I ordered it.  It came in the mail today.  I soaked my feet for about 10 minutes in the warmest water with a little epsom salt. I dried feet, then put on plastic gloves and spread the callus eliminator on the bottom of my feet. I didn&#x27;t have to use much of it. I waited less than 5 minutes and used a pumice type scrubber like they use at the nail salon.. Callous literally fell off without a lot of scrub effort. Re-soaked my feet with a little soap and scrubbed a bit more. My feet are baby smooth!  I&#x27;ve bought many products from the store in the past, but they were a waste of money.. This product is a winner! I&#x27;m still in shock it works this well!</li>
            <li> Amazing product if you have bad calluses. This is the stuff they use in the best nail places in ny. Take a hot shower. Put this on your heels and wrap Saran Wrap around it and then in ten minutes scrub your heels with a pumice stone. The skin will just fall right off</li>
            <li> I have used this on my feet twice now, but the calluses haven&#x27;t disappeared; they have softened up though.  I will continue to use this and see if I can see improvement over the long-term.  I would definitely try it, and it does make the feet feel softer.</li>
            <li> This product works amazing. It is  however extremely oily so i would suggest putting socks on after application. Definitely noticed a change in my heels after one use.</li>
            <li> I do my own pedicures and this is an essential step.  Just use a little and leave on for a few mins before rinsing.  Much better than filing and filing my feet and produces a better and smoother result.</li>
            <li> WORKS OK IF THE CALLUSES AREN&#x27;T TOO BAD</li>
            <li> Works but I prefer the Callus Blaster instead.  This has a nice smell.  Have to use the pumice stone a little harder to remove callus</li>
            <li> No merchandise second speed is so good, the effect is not very good</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see much what this does. followed instructions too.</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing. I  tried five times and used as directed but no results.  I have contacted seller who referred me to the company and they have not responded. Do not recommend this product</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in this bottle but it works like miracle.  1st time, the dead skin came off but I&#x27;ve seen other products that did the same.  But the 2nd time, i soaked my feet very well, applied this and wait for 5 full minutes, wiped off with a towel and buffed.  The whole layer of dead skin came off effortlessly, my heels were completely renewed.  I&#x27;ve never seen anything like this.  It was truly a \\&quot;WOW\\&quot; moment.</li>
            <li> After all the glowing reviews I had great hopes for this product. I&#x27;ve used it several times and ABSOLUTELY no difference. No burning, no reaction , no results. What a disappointment!!</li>
            <li> Looking forward to trying it-ordered 3 weeks ago. I have callous feet which are painful. The doctors office used a liquid that dissolved them once.</li>
            <li> A few months ago while at the nail salon the gal doing my pedicure put callus remover on my heels and then filed the calluses down.  My feet were soft and smooth for over a month.  When I saw this online I thought I&#x27;ve give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I tried this I soaked my feet for about 10 minutes, then put the solution on for about 5.  I then used this cheese grater looking thing on my feet. The results were eh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the second time, I tried this after soaking in a very hot bubble bath for about 20 minutes.  I just got fair results.</li>
            <li> I have pretty bad/thick callouses and this really did a good job.  There is plenty in the bottle for multiple applications - even using liberally.  It&#x27;s not magic - you still have to &#x27;file&#x27; after it&#x27;s been on - I use on of those things that looks like a cheese grater.  Follow the directions and you&#x27;ll have good results.</li>
            <li> This product requires a better pumice than natural pumice to get good results. Had to go to salon for good results.</li>
            <li> I was a bit worried about using this myself but it is fantastic! I used to pay for it whnever I got a pedicure and decided to use it myself.</li>
            <li> A fantastic way to remove caluses on my feet, cuticles on fingers and toes! Works extremely fast! Calluses take a while to form after removal! way cheaper than going to a salon for a mani/pedi! Oh, the calluses on feet re-grow smooth. When I use a file while taking a bath when the calluses regrow they are often &amp;#34;scratchy&amp;#34; I had to constantly aply lotion, but it was only a temp. fix!&lt;br /&gt;This is a fantastic product! You must use care to use it on your cuticles tho. I use a fine paint brush &amp; they are removed with in a couple minutes. I never leave it on for longer that 2 maybe 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> This eliminator does a good job with a partially removed callus that has been prepped by Dr. Scholls.  However, it doesn&#x27;t touch a hard callus that probably requires the help of a podiatrist.</li>
            <li> This worked well for me. I use it with [[ASIN:B00756HQNQ Microplane Brown Colossal Pedicure Foot Rasp]] and [[ASIN:B0007LM2P8 ProLinc Dry Heel Eliminator, 4 Fluid Ounce]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did leak during shipping and this is pretty caustic stuff and it actually made the directions unreadable. Here are the directions in case anyone else has a similar experience: \\&quot;Directions: After soaking, liberally spread Callus Eliminator over callus. Let it set for 3-5 minutes depending on callus buildup. Then wipe away excess and use a file or buffer to gently remove callus. Wash off with water. Wear gloves or rinse fingers after applying.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I can honestly say I have never given a more glowing review of a product, and if choose your own rating were an option, 5 stars would not be enough. This stuff is a miracle product. For years, I have suffered from a deep callous buildup on my pinkie toe, to the point where I could not even wear most shoes without screaming pain. I tried countless callous remover products off of the shelf, and had poor results. I believed I was destined to either suffer in limited fashion, or endure foot surgery. On my first application with this product, the majority of the callous buildup is gone. I was close to tears of joy. My feet are incredibly smooth and callous free. I am like a walking commercial advertisement. I feel like a new woman. lol I highly recommend pairing this product with the Microplane Colossal Pedicure Foot Rasp, which I also purchased here on Amazon. It is so gentle, you almost wonder if it is working, until you turn it over and the buckets of flaky, dead skin is revealed. If this review doesn&#x27;t convince you, nothing will. UNLESS you try it for yourself.</li>
            <li> Works as in salon, highly recommend, quick fix in home set up</li>
            <li> This is a total waste of money. It didn&#x27;t do anything to the callus on my feet at all. Totally disappointed.</li>
            <li> I brought it for cleaning the dead skin, however, I still don&#x27;t get it how to use it, even though i read the instruction carefully for twice. It doesn&#x27;t really working, or I should say at least u can not feel it&#x27;s working, the dead skin still there after applied on my skin, not even feel softer. Not recommend.</li>
            <li> My feet had calluses that a regular pumice stone would not remove. This worked like a dream. My feet are super soft!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. If used correctly it really works! I will be buying this again... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> This product really works to get rid of foot callous. Best product on the market. Great buy for the money.</li>
            <li> Followed instructions and watched my callus skin disappear. It&#x27;s just like what they use when I go get a pedicure.</li>
            <li> I am so grateful for this stuff! Had a pedicure with it and now I do it at home- sure beats all the filing I used to do. After applying it, I wrap my feet in plastic wrap the way they did at the salon, and I leave it on for at least 5 minutes. Then wash and file with the M﻿icroplane foot rasp, and voila! Soft feet!</li>
            <li> This product works great . I use it with my nail buffer and  it keeps my pedicure looking fresh and new. My feet are soft and callus free.</li>
            <li> This is one of the better pedicure products that will save you money so you don&#x27;t need so many pedicures. Very easy to use and leave your feet soft and nice.</li>
            <li> this product is fantastic! i use it all over the soles of my feet to prep for my at-home pedicures. it softens the dead skin and makes scrubbing so much more effective.</li>
            <li> Did not work at all, I would not recommend this product to anyone.. Save your money on this one product.</li>
            <li> Best a home product i&#x27;ve found. Pair this with a quick facial and in 10 min or so, you&#x27;ll have a smoother face and feet.</li>
            <li> My wife absolutely swears by this stuff and she is picky about her beauty products! She first became aware of the product during a recent visit to a spa and they used it on her and charged her $15.00. She said the results were great (And I admit, I can&#x27;t find a thing wrong w/ her feet, so it must work!). Therefore, she decided to buy this product (I actually bought it) for about $5.00 and now, she does her feet at home.</li>
            <li> Great product and very fast delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Easily removes the callus...... But be care with surrounding skin to avoid damage to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;So happy to find BE NATURAL products.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> I had been looking for the stuff the ladies at the nail shop use on my feet. I figured I could save few $. Well, I found it! I got it yesterday. I didn&#x27;t even wait for my new pumas stone to get her, I used my old cruddy one i have. I did my feet twice because I was worried about the burning I read in other reviews. No burning at all! I left it on for 5 min and scrubbed off. I even did my boyfriends feet, and my friend is coming over tomorrow so I can do her feet lol thats how much I love this stuff. LOL Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I had a very expensive pedicure and was charged $10 extra because they used this product to remove the dead skin from my feet.  I bought it and it works as well as it did at the beauty salon - for a lot less money!</li>
            <li> This stuff works just as well as the stuff they use at the salon. I am a man and have very dry cracked feet. I use this once a week now to get the calluses off the heels of my feet. Get this is you have this problem.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive it and have no idea how is works. I cannot recommend something I do not have.&lt;br /&gt;be natural by ProLinc dry heel eliminator and it is not fluid although labeled so.</li>
            <li> Ridiculous.  It is ridiculous I just discovered this SO CHEAP after spending years at the pedi place.  What prompted the search for this was a vacation that left my feet wrecked.  Cracked heels, sandpaper feeling, nasty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There had to be another solution, when my trusty pumice and file failed me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter: Be Natural Callus Eliminator&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here are the bullet points for this particular item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It WORKS.&lt;br /&gt;2. I will buy this item for as long as it is available.&lt;br /&gt;3. My pedi place has lost my business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A hint for those people that have sensitive skin/are scared of the product getting on their \\&quot;uncallused\\&quot; skin....use Vaseline to corral the product where it is needed.  I put Vaseline on my instep, toes, and sides of feet.  I am sure any lotion would work for that purpose also, but Vaseline won&#x27;t slip around or drip.</li>
            <li> Works nicely. Ezpecially if you have alot of callus. I dont but I dont like have any dead skin lingering on the pads of my feet. I use sparingly.</li>
            <li> Product works great along with a rasp however do not start using it if you ever plan to stop! Once the girl at the nail salon started using this during her pedicures my heels started becoming dry within a week. The good side is, right after the pedicures it was like baby soft skin on my heels!</li>
            <li> I hesitated before purchasing this but it lived up to its claim.  I was bare foot and pregnant, literally, and it did a number on my poor feet as I wore nothing but sandals for 9 months.  This product, along with a Mr. Pumise scrub, did what a salon couldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have used foot files and different products such as Glytone heel and elbow cream which is really expensive and none of them work as well as this stuff.  Easy to use with great results every time.  Have purchased twice and don&#x27;t plan to buy anything else for my feet.</li>
            <li> They use this at my nail place and it works incredibly. Now I have it at home for in between pedicures.</li>
            <li> You will  not be surprised over your outcome, because this product does a good job in ridding callouses. I would suggest that you do a good job in soaking feet prior to use and you will really see how miraculous this product is. The Best on market!</li>
            <li> finally something that works as good as the salon where I go for pedicures - they still get me as a client but in between my feet love me for using this</li>
            <li> This stuff works! I tried it once at a salon, where this extra service comes at a $5-10 additional charge depending where you go, and it does wonders for removing dry skin from heels. The product pays for itself in one use! My husband has terrible man-feet and this was a great way to get rid of all the hardened scaly skin and start fresh with some good at home foot care. I highly recommend this product to keep your feet looking pretty all year long.</li>
            <li> I finally made the time to use this product.  I could hardly believe how well it worked.  I think I only left it on for three minutes and the dead skin just rolled off with the use of a buffer.  So pleased with this product.  My feet were baby smooth afterwards.  Haven&#x27;t looked this good in years.</li>
            <li> This works! It really works and it is one of the best products if you walk around barefoot and want softer feet.</li>
            <li> I guess my calluses are the toughest of all Amazon planet because I didn&#x27;t get this thing to work as good as other users claim they did. I followed the instructions and while it did make my feet feel good right after applying it, the feeling didn&#x27;t last long. I recommend this for someone with softer calluses</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s useful to my dad and we all like it~&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;ll be better if effect more quickly and i think i&#x27;ll buy it in future.</li>
            <li> Great product works very well with no harsh odors .A little goes a long way. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what the product is like, I ordered it and It was never delivered, the other orders I placed at the same time were all received, except for this buyer who insisted they need the product back in order to redeliver, and that I gave them my address missing , which is impossible ! I ordered all items at the same time using the same shipping info!&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t deal with them, they kept copy pasting the same message that it is my fault !!&lt;br /&gt;UPS didn&#x27;t bother , as the price point is not that big, but luckily Amazon took care of it !</li>
            <li> After reading so many positive reviews I decided to give this product a try.  It did remove some dead, dry skin, but did not make much of a dent in the calluses on my feet.  I used the product on three separate occasions over two weeks, but did not see much in the way of results.</li>
            <li> It made my foot soft after using the product but it did make a dent in the campus on my foot. I am a jogged and have obtained a callus on my feet. They are small but they are bother me. I don&#x27;t like to be barefoot around others. I thought this product would help but it only soften my heels. I followed the directions listed on the package.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Be Natural Callus Eliminator and I must say it does exactly what it purports to do. I use this weekly in conjunction with nightly BioOil and heel socks and my feet have never looked better. This product is excellent! Highly recommended! Will absolutely stay in my beauty arsenal.</li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve taken before and after pictures - but unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t. I can tell you what my feet were before - very dry and cracked. Even dirty came in between the skin which were hard to reach with soap and body scrub. I used this four times in one sitting using the \\&quot;egg\\&quot; to scrub off the skin. By the time I was done, my heels were so smooth!!! Definitely soak your feet before use, apply to heels and wash hands after, scrub with the ped egg after 3-5 mins then wash it all away and repeat...repeat...til you&#x27;ve got perfect heels!!!</li>
            <li> I first experienced this product at a nail salon (for an additional $5). I was skeptical at first b/c I&#x27;m convinced those nails salons will pretend anything works, so they can charge you more money. I was very surprised when I felt my feet afterwards. For some reason, my feet get very callused, and usually, even after the pedicurist scrapes them, they are still kinda hard, even though very smooth. Well, after this, my felt felt like babies&#x27; feet. Unbelievably soft. Which is why immediately afterwards I went home and looked for it online. The pedicurist told me the name, but again, b/c I&#x27;m a skeptic, I figured she might have been lying so that I&#x27;d always have to come to her to have my feet feel like that. I ordered this, not sure if it was really the same product she had used. After the first test, I knew it was. This stuff is miraculous.</li>
            <li> This product came in promptly and packaged well. It worked successfully in removing the callus. No problems what so ever.&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased.</li>
            <li> I had a couple of bad calluses from blisters I had gotten on the bottom of my feet and using a buffer wasn&#x27;t getting rid of them so I decided to try this.  It definitely works to get rid of dead skin but it did not help with my blister calluses. I ended up getting a callus shaver and that did the trick. This would be a good product for regular foot maintenance but for me didn&#x27;t work for a more severe callus.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cure cancer or save the rainforest as some of the other reviews might lead you to believe, but it does help take a layer of callus off the with aid of a good pumice scrubbing. I&#x27;ve used it twice now over about a week and my calluses are smoother, but there are still calluses. Perhaps if you are the type with only mild callusing this would take care of it for you, but for the elephant-footed (such as myself) it&#x27;s going to be hard for any one product to do the job.</li>
            <li> does exactly what its supposed to do in one treatment. its definitely worth the money. will recommend this to everyone i know.</li>
            <li> The picture did not match the item on the ad but I think the product works. I used it once on my boyfriends feet....I think there should be more detailed instructions for use but overall its good.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product that no doubt works miracles.  My feet had really been badly neglected due to poor maintenance on my part from being a busy new mom.  I needed something that was quick and effective and this fits the bill perfectly as it had my feet back to its natural soft and touchable state in less than 30 minutes (soaking included)!  I was very surprised because I have used a lot of more expensive products that had me doing lots of arm/handwork scrubbing to get results like this..and took a lot more time too.  I used it as directed and it caused no issue with non-callused areas of my feet.  I even used it twice in one sitting with a pumice stone after each use and it worked very well.  No more wasted time and money on stuff that takes long to work and produces minimal results because I&#x27;ve found this product and it&#x27;s a keeper!  A very good product that has my feet back to its pre-mommy state and at a great price..unbelievable!!</li>
            <li> Amazing! Worked perfectly the first time. I saw a sign advertising this product while I was getting my nails done. I went home and found it on Amazon and Presto it&#x27;s like magic!</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews and was so excited about this.  I might be doing something wrong.  I followed the instructions and was expecting a more dramatic result.  It does  make the skin smoother but I did not have a lot of exfoliation.  It did burn when I accidentally got some on my leg.  So be careful.</li>
            <li> This was a bit disappointing after all the hype of the positive reviews. Doesn&#x27;t do anything miraculous, for sure.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to remove callouses from my feet. It sure did,but be careful.  Even wearing gloves my hands became itchy and red. In a week my fingernails became weakened and peeled. This product did its job and more for me. I&#x27;d recommend using it in a salon...NOT at home!</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever found! I discovered it during a pedicure visit at the spa. Just be very careful when applying because your feet become very slippery - I do not recommend standing up once applied.</li>
            <li> I want my money back. This didn&#x27;t work.. Did everything it says on the directions. I even left it on longer.</li>
            <li> some reviews said this product is great. I believed it.&lt;br /&gt;Not even when this quemical touched my bare skin i got a reaction...none.</li>
            <li> After ordering and reading I was afraid to use it because I was concered I would be chemically burned.  I&#x27;m sure if I had followed directions I wouldn&#x27;t have but I&#x27;m very cautionary on things like that of those types of products.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good product.  I think I was expecting a little more out of it than I got but I did remove a lot of dead skin.  You have to have a metal file or something pretty sturdy to help you file off all the dead skin after soaking your feet.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described...a wonder!  I have tried everything...honest.  This product does it all....follow the directions....be attentive to where this mixture trails on your skin.....and you will have smooth, silky, baby soft feet.</li>
            <li> I use this product once or twice a month, really does a miracle for my feet.  My feet are smooth.</li>
            <li> Just like the Callus remover lotion that my spa/salon uses.&lt;br /&gt;Caution: Wash hands thoroughly after else it&#x27;ll cause flaky palms.</li>
            <li> yes scary. it works really great but i haven&#x27;t had time to keep using it to remove all my foot callus. it works very quick (2 minutes) but make sure you have a scrubby and such</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It was recommend to me by a friend. It works just as advertised. Its very effective at removing calluses at the core. I highly recommend this product for those of us who struggle with calluses.</li>
            <li> I go for regular Pedi&#x27;s and this product was used by my beauty rep.  I bought it at her salon and paid $20 a bottle.  Just by chance thought I would check it out online and WOW I paid 1/4 of the cost with shipping.  The products works really well too!</li>
            <li> This is a good product for callus feet on the top, but not for deep down spot callus. It does not get the the center of deep down callus. I was hoping I could use this to stop the deep down callus from coming back, but, it is only useful for heels, and toes.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good..kinda messy</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT!! I INTEND ON PURCHASING ANOTHER ONE FOR MY SISTER!! GREAT PRICE AND GREAT ITEM!!I SINCE MY PURCHASE, I TAKE THIS ITEM WITH ME TO THE NAIL AND PEDICURE SALON AND USE MY OWN PRODUCT INSTEAD OF PAYING $3.00 TO USE THEIR APPLICATION. THEY DO NOT LIKE IT AND SOME OF THE SALONS WILL NOT ALLOW ME TO USE MY OWN PRODUCT, WHEN THAT HAPPENS I LEAVE. WHY CAN&#x27;T I USE MY OWN PRODUCT WHEN I AM STILL PAYING FOR THE SERVICE AND I GIVE A GREAT TIP ALSO. I USUALLY USE MY OWEN LOTIONS, AND NAIL POLISHES AND PRODUCTS. I FIND THEIRS TO BE  INFERIOR. IN ANY EVENT THIS PRODUCT WORKS GREAT!!!!!</li>
            <li> my feet are very soft now - not sure if it was the sally hansen filed plus this product, but i like my feel now :)</li>
            <li> got it for my husband as he has really bad calloused feet and he was blown away by how quickly it worked and how effective it is. I would definitely recommend this for anyone who has stubborn callouses!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Just a few minutes and your in your way to smooth feet.  I would buy this again.  Great product!</li>
            <li> this product is very useful for me. while i use it, it make my feet skin very soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I thought this product was just okay. I don&#x27;t like the smell and the fact that I have to wear gloves to apply this. I ended up not using it as much as I planned because of the chemical smell.</li>
            <li> I used to be an exotic dancer. My feet are callous prone because of the fact that I also have mortons toe. I read alot of reviews which I was pleased with. Just yesterday I got a pedicure and when the man saw the bottom of my feet he displayed his disgust. Any ways , I received th product TODAY and I was sooooo anxious to get my own results I popped it open. The texture of the liquid is smooth and sort of thick. I applied the eliminator to my feet not really knowing what to expect. I applied it to my heels and the balls of my feet. OMG! The reviews are REAL , my feet havent felt like this since I was a child !!!!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product along with the Sof Feet Callus Reducer. I used this product and followed the directions, but didn&#x27;t any of the results. It was just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This eliminator is good in the sense that it removes all the dead skin but my problem with it which is why I rated it 4 stars, is that it makes ur feet rough after a week or two of using it. My husband has even refused to use it again.</li>
            <li> Now i was told before buying it that it may take a few months for the callus remover to work. I am still waiting, but with that said it does make them smoother. It is supposed to make them fall off though.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping for a miracle callus eliminator gel like some of these other reviewers warned us about.  Something along the lines of a acid that burns through if you are not careful.  (Not that my feet are that bad.  To give you an idea of what I am working with, I am 48 years old, and I have always taken good care of feet..so there are no built up calluses.  I do wear sandals so sometimes my heels show a little dryness and I have had a crack from time to time if I am not careful)  I have used this gel three times, and I still have to do a lot of work with the pumice stone after all is said and done.  I soaked my feet for at least 20 minutes, wiped the water off, and liberally applied the gel (being careful to wear gloves due to the warning on other reviews).  The instructions on the bottle warn you not to leave the gel on more than 5 minutes.  So the first time, I followed the instructions.  There was no appreciable difference.  So I did it again, and left it on 15 minutes this time.  After you let the gel dry a little, you take a pumice stone and rub off the gel.  At first, it looks like you are getting A LOT of dead skin off your feet.  But don&#x27;t be fooled, this is just the dry gel!  Then you rinse your feet, and there you go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using the gloves, and just wash my hands now after application.  No problems with my hands.  If I leave the gel on for a LONG TIME (like 30 minutes) I do feel a little like the calluses are easier to scrape off, but I honestly think the soaking in the water contributes just as much as the gel does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to use this stuff because I bought it, but I will not be purchasing this product again.  Not worth the money in my opinion.  I get much better result with a foam sandpaper block that I buy at Home Depot!</li>
            <li> I have used this product three times and I do not see any improvement on my calluses.</li>
            <li> Helps soften my calluses</li>
            <li> may be working for really small calluses , but is too weak for bigger once. I switched to better shoe and the callus was gone in 3 months. I had it for 2 years.</li>
            <li> My pedicure place uses this stuff and it is amazing. It like melts the dead skin away. Your feet will feel great after you use it.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because of the reviews. However, it didn&#x27;t work for me after the first time using it. But, I will try again following the direction.</li>
            <li> Only used it for a one time need and it did work. Need to type seven words to post this.</li>
            <li> works great! as long as you wash your hands immediately you do not need gloves, def should leave on 3-5 min depending on the severity of the callus. awesome product</li>
            <li> Softened rough patches but really didn&#x27;t do the whole work of a spa pedi.  But it improved dry heels a lot.</li>
            <li> Not sure how this product is getting any positive reviews.  Maybe it works on extremely light callouses.  I found it no more effective than soaking my feet in water.</li>
            <li> This is really good stuff! I put it on, wait, and then use my foot board to take off the bad stuff. It performs exactly as described.</li>
            <li> It makes it easy to take of calluses.  A little grossed out on how much it took off the first time I used this.</li>
            <li> This is a good callus remover.  I often get calluses on my fingers and small bunions on my toes and this resolves both.  Follow the instructions on the bottle</li>
            <li> Great product but watch the time you leave the product on your feet or you will get burned. Keep away from children and animals since it can be dangerous. I&#x27;ve used the product once and it gives me weeks of relief from cracked heels. Cannot say enough good things about this product!</li>
            <li> This product works Sooo good. You definitely have to make sure you use an aplicator and don&#x27;t get it on your fingers.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time and wow my heels and bottom of  feet look great.  This stuff really works well.  I am impressed with the out come. I am a forever customer on this product. As good as it did I will only have to use it once a week. It makes a difference right away!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products without seeing a difference in my really cracked heels. This stuff is strong and I saw a big difference after using it once. Give it a try!</li>
            <li> I had absolutely no results from this product. I tried multiple times to use it and it did nothing. Worthless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 4/7/2013 - I gave this stuff another try mainly because some reviewers actually liked it and I really wanted to not feel like a sucker. Still, it just did not work on my slight to moderate  areas.</li>
            <li> I am always fighting with my feet because they seem to develop calluses and dry skin overnight.  This product does help slough off the dead skin.  I probably don&#x27;t leave it on long enough because I am afraid of burning the live skin but if I left it on a little longer it would probably work even better.</li>
            <li> I LEFT PRODUCT ON AND SCRUBBED AFTER 10 MINS, NO RESULTS! WASTE OF CASH! I would not reccomend this, buy something else.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about buying this product even though I read all of the reviews for it on here and on other sites.&lt;br /&gt;I will say I am very pleased with this product. My feet thank you!  (Shipping was rather long though…I don&#x27;t have prime).</li>
            <li> I wish I could rave about how amazing this product is but unfortunately it did not work as well for me as some of the other reviewers.  I tried it on several different occasions and followed the directions precisely but this product did nothing for my calluses.  It made my feet a little softer but the calluses are still there.  Hopefully the next product I try will be more effective.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that I found that works instantly to repair dry, cracked,and hard heels after trying so many other things that did not work for me.</li>
            <li> i must admit the product itself is pretty good but was expecting the bottle to come exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> Wife likes the ability to use something to soften the heels rough areas. Does not require a lot to work.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews, I thought for sure I had finally found a callous remover that truly did what it advertised.  I was able to remove some callous skin on my heels, but it keeps coming back.  It was okay by my standards.</li>
