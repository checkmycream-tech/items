            <li>to good to be true and way out of my budget at 70$.</li>
            <li>they love it and so do I.  </li>
            <li>And about the pushy sales lady,  she was a great sales person in my opinion, enjoyed the whole experience.  </li>
            <li>For $30, I thought the kit seemed to be an OK price.  </li>
            <li>It was such a wonderful package, 5 gifts in one box.</li>
            <li>and I have to say I love it.</li>
            <li>All I all great product, just be careful who you buy it from lol</li>
            <li>I love the lotion, cuticle oil and the nail buffer</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>She will be returning for more when this is gone to get more.</li>
            <li>To top it all of</li>
            <li>Unlike many, I did not get ripped off by this guy.</li>
            <li>, in the end I saved about $25 more than I would&#x27;ve if I would have bought it on here.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they work on commission &amp; any sale is better than no sale:)</li>
            <li>Very happy with it - though I wish there was a way to buy this specific lotion separately.</li>
            <li>I love these products.</li>
            <li>The cuticle cutter and lotion are the best because my cuticles tend to dry up very easily</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful line of products in a great little package.</li>
            <li>Good deal that definitely beats what people try to sell you in the mall :P</li>
            <li>This kit has all you need to have beautiful natural nails.  </li>
            <li>The buffer is what I love most - it really does leave your nails gorgeous.</li>
            <li>I liked both the hand cream and buffer, but the buffer was $29 by itself and that was what I was most interested in.  </li>
            <li>Not only did they come out incredibly, they have held up for a month.  </li>
            <li>Good product fast shipment</li>
            <li>It leaves your nails really shiny and the hand lotion smells really good.</li>
            <li>I actually got a good deal from my Kiosk guy!  </li>
            <li>so I actually ended up with a good deal!</li>
            <li>in all - make sure you get your money&#x27;s worth if you buy it at a mall, but if you do, it&#x27;s a fantastic nail set that won&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li>I also got free stuff.</li>
            <li>I just got a kit, and they tried to upsell me to buy 2 kits and get one free, with the kits being, &amp;#34;half priced.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>#34;shhh, don&#x27;t tell anyone I sold it so cheap to you!&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I paid $171.00 for 2  and he supposedly gave me 3 free.</li>
            <li>then I&#x27;d get 2 free.</li>
            <li>He charged me $80.00 for one kit, then said if I bought another one I&#x27;d get one free, and then he \\&quot;gave\\</li>
            <li>Maybe when replacements are needed they will be available.</li>
            <li>I was very happy with the product, but after a few years, the cuticle trimmer broke, so I placed this order.</li>
            <li>I love the brown files that come with these sets, this is my 6th set, but this one came with a white file that doesn&#x27;t seem as good.</li>
            <li>For the $60, that she wanted to sell it to me for originally...</li>
            <li>Overall Loving it!</li>
            <li>I love the fact that I can have shiny pretty nails without polish.  </li>
            <li>Not much challenge there, since her nails are beautiful anyway.  </li>
            <li>; The girl tried to convince me to buy Christmas gifts, but I was honest with her that our families no longer buy gifts for adults, just children and the adult women are all so picky</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase, it&#x27;s the same one at the mall counters that they try to sell me for $69.99!</li>
            <li>This was a way to get pretty nails and soft hands very easily.  </li>
            <li>You would pay far more in a department store for this quality and quantity of nail products.  </li>
            <li>Eventually he learned that I was a nurse &amp; would really use the product &amp; most likely come bk for more(&amp; I will)</li>
            <li>While the products are excellent, I was unable to secure them online.  </li>
            <li>I originally found Deep Sea while shopping in a mall, so glad to be a customer now.</li>
            <li>I was pretty lucky.</li>
            <li>(yeah right) for $49.99.</li>
            <li>Like it&#x27;s not glued right.</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s price is right.</li>
            <li>Service and speed was right on.</li>
            <li>Yea right.</li>
            <li>You can basically get it as cheap as you want it, if you stick to your guns &amp; make them realize you are interested you just can&#x27;t pay that much.</li>
            <li>(bought two and he gave me two \\&quot;free\\&quot; because I told him we had a large family to buy Christmas presents for!)</li>
            <li>and she actually only charged me slightly more than the price listed here.</li>
            <li>She actually bought this at a vender in the mall in Texas and paid so much more for it...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to come back for more, never stop selling this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m even glad that this cuticle oil actually works</li>
            <li>As a baker, nailpolish is rarely an option for me, and I love that my nails now can look good without me risking getting weird chemicals in my creations.</li>
            <li>This was gifted to me once before, so I ordered this when I ran out of my initial package.</li>
            <li>Especially since the set will be a perfect gift for someone I know that&#x27;s usually really hard to buy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really what got me interested in it in the 1st place) and a 5yr warranty on the cuticle</li>
            <li>Anyway, for $30, I thought it was reasonable.  </li>
            <li>Got this as a gift for my daughter, but I know she loves it as much as I do.</li>
            <li>So I went snooping on the Internet to see how much money I lost</li>
            <li>I was absolutely amazed by this product.</li>
            <li>They will try to haggle you for more money, or get you to buy more products, but you gotta know how to play their game.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend had really dry, cracked cuticles, &amp; we seen a huge improvement after 1 use:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sure the buffer got rid of the ridges, right down to the fingers!!!</li>
            <li>The kit was brand new.  </li>
            <li>Items were still brand new.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have no problem with anything in this kit.  </li>
            <li>The other parts of this kit are nice.. not much of a nail junky though.</li>
            <li>And it makes your hands and body so soft!</li>
            <li>the cuticul oil is very \\&quot;loose\\&quot; for lack of a better word- a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It makes my nails shiny and soft like they have clear coat on them!</li>
            <li>I bought this from a kiosk in the mall and was almost certain that I got ripped off by the overly pushy sails person who essentially put the poduct in a bag and asked me for my card.</li>
            <li>I swear it was like the guy put a clear coat on.</li>
            <li>WOW...</li>
            <li>The demo was done on my two thumb nails, which have considerably thicker nails.</li>
            <li>I went back today after looking around on the web, and upon complaint got a second set free -</li>
            <li>She ran over and picked up a nail kit with a slightly torn box and told me that if the tear in the box didn&#x27;t bother me, BC obviously I was only interested in buying a kit for myself, that she would sell it to me for $30.  </li>
            <li>Hoping it will help with my sensitive dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Just one little thing, the oil top was little loose and some amount of it was spilled around, also the nail file on the side is a bit pealed.</li>

            <li> Use it correctly and you will grown out beautiful nails. I&#x27;ve grown mine out without buffing them&lt;br /&gt;if your worried you can make them to thin. Do go lightly with the buffer as it can thin your nail&lt;br /&gt;and make them weak. I use the oil on my nails daily, use gloves when cleaning or doing dishes.&lt;br /&gt;I put on the lotion after I&#x27;ve applied the oil to my nails. Amazing results!</li>
            <li> Great product for the money!  My hands were a mess and a pushy sales lady at the mall kiosk did my thumb!  WOW...to good to be true and way out of my budget at 70$. I turned her down flat..I know how to barter..they love it and so do I.  Soo, I paid 70$ for two sets and I was happy with this deal.  You would pay far more in a department store for this quality and quantity of nail products.  And about the pushy sales lady,  she was a great sales person in my opinion, enjoyed the whole experience.  I waste money in the stores buying junk, but she did the demo and I saw instant results.  This kit has all you need to have beautiful natural nails.  The file is the best I have ever used.  And the lady that reviewed this product and said after she buffed her nails they were thin and hurt,  the box says do not over buff, will thin nails. Read directions!  I have very sensitive skin and have no problem with anything in this kit.  Ty Stella!</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Got this product cheaper at a kiosk in the mall. They will try to haggle you for more money, or get you to buy more products, but you gotta know how to play their game. I also got free stuff.</li>
            <li> Do not be afraid to bargain with them at the mall kiosk.  I just got a kit, and they tried to upsell me to buy 2 kits and get one free, with the kits being, &amp;#34;half priced.&amp;#34; The girl tried to convince me to buy Christmas gifts, but I was honest with her that our families no longer buy gifts for adults, just children and the adult women are all so picky anyway, I no longer wanted to buy them gifts, as they often don&#x27;t like what they get.  So, I told her I would think about it come back to her kiosk later.  She ran over and picked up a nail kit with a slightly torn box and told me that if the tear in the box didn&#x27;t bother me, BC obviously I was only interested in buying a kit for myself, that she would sell it to me for $30.  Of course she said, &amp;#34;shhh, don&#x27;t tell anyone I sold it so cheap to you!&amp;#34;.  The kit was brand new.  She told me a customer tried to open the box and ripped it by accident, which I can see is possible, since the design is a slide out, not lift up box.  Items were still brand new.  Anyway, for $30, I thought it was reasonable.  I liked both the hand cream and buffer, but the buffer was $29 by itself and that was what I was most interested in.  Beware that if you have short unpainted nails, they will pinpoint you.  She immediately asked if I&#x27;m a nurse (I am) and told me nurses are her best customers, since they wash their hands so often and often aren&#x27;t allowed to wear nail polish.  This was a way to get pretty nails and soft hands very easily.  For $30, I thought the kit seemed to be an OK price.  For the $60, that she wanted to sell it to me for originally... No way.  For $118... Heck no!</li>
            <li> Horrible product Would never purchase again gave me skin allergies even though it claims to be good for all skin types. Horrible Don&#x27;t waste money on this!</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for my daughter, but I know she loves it as much as I do. I originally found Deep Sea while shopping in a mall, so glad to be a customer now. I will continue to order it.</li>
            <li> Just got my kit. I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase, it&#x27;s the same one at the mall counters that they try to sell me for $69.99! With some promo discount that day (yeah right) for $49.99. Just one little thing, the oil top was little loose and some amount of it was spilled around, also the nail file on the side is a bit pealed. Like it&#x27;s not glued right. Overall Loving it! I&#x27;m about to do my nails now:)As well I am about to purchase one kit for a very good friend of mine. Will def purchase it again (when needed hehe)</li>
            <li> This item was given to me as a gift. It was such a wonderful package, 5 gifts in one box. Since I received it I have been buying the product to give as gifts for others. Amazon&#x27;s price is right.</li>
            <li> I was pretty lucky. I bought this from a kiosk in the mall and was almost certain that I got ripped off by the overly pushy sails person who essentially put the poduct in a bag and asked me for my card. So I went snooping on the Internet to see how much money I lost and she actually only charged me slightly more than the price listed here. I dropped 30 bucks on this kit and I have to say I love it. The cuticle cutter and lotion are the best because my cuticles tend to dry up very easily and I end up needing mass motorized. And the nail buffer is sweat as well. All I all great product, just be careful who you buy it from lol</li>
            <li> I purchased it for my wife and she wanted to have multiple sets to give gifts to someone. This is a nice gift, not a  burden on pocket as well.</li>
            <li> Good product fast shipment</li>
            <li> I love the brown files that come with these sets, this is my 6th set, but this one came with a white file that doesn&#x27;t seem as good. I love the lotion, cuticle oil and the nail buffer is awesome!</li>
            <li> The buffer really is as amazing as it is hyped up to be. The other parts of this kit are nice.. not much of a nail junky though. Good deal that definitely beats what people try to sell you in the mall :P</li>
            <li> My mother purchased this for me a few years ago. The best investment ever! She actually bought this at a vender in the mall in Texas and paid so much more for it... I have had lots of manicure sets before but nothing like this... This stuff lasts for a while and does miracles to dry, dammaged, and brittle nails... I recomend this to all my friends when I give them manis with this! They all love it and go out and get it for themselves!</li>
            <li> The nail buffer is AMAZING!  I love the fact that I can have shiny pretty nails without polish.  The cream is great too!  Hoping it will help with my sensitive dry skin.  I actually got a good deal from my Kiosk guy!  Paid about $26 ea. (bought two and he gave me two \\&quot;free\\&quot; because I told him we had a large family to buy Christmas presents for!) :)</li>
            <li> If you want the best for your nails - this is the product line to use.  Coral is my favorite!</li>
            <li> Wife got this and likes it. She will be returning for more when this is gone to get more.Service and speed was right on.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It makes my nails shiny and soft like they have clear coat on them! It got rid of the ridges in my nails. And if you only use it how they say with no more then 10-15 seconds on each nail it won&#x27;t wear them thin and you will be very satisfied with this nail kit. To top it all of there&#x27;s amazing lotion that almost smells like flowers. I got the coral lotion! And it makes your hands and body so soft! I just bought another set because my grandmother birthday. She was amazed with what I showed her and let her use! And you can buy the lotion and other things by itself on here!</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful line of products in a great little package. This lotion smells awsome. the nail file, buffer and cuticle thing are great for at home use when you feel like giving your self or your boyfriend a manicure. the cuticul oil is very \\&quot;loose\\&quot; for lack of a better word- a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item and my nails are so beautiful and shiny.  I can&#x27;t believe the price because when I saw this product at the mall it was priced almost double. I&#x27;m going to come back for more, never stop selling this product.  Thank you!!!!!</li>
            <li> Pricey but its way cheaper than the mall. I recommend NEVER BUY FROM THE MALL KIOSKS. It leaves your nails really shiny and the hand lotion smells really good. I&#x27;m even glad that this cuticle oil actually works</li>
            <li> This is a good product but boy did I get ripped off. I paid $171.00 for 2  and he supposedly gave me 3 free. Yea right. Thats what I get for stoping to talk to these people at the Kiosk&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Got this from a mall kiosk the other day - paid about 40$ for it. I went back today after looking around on the web, and upon complaint got a second set free - so I actually ended up with a good deal! Especially since the set will be a perfect gift for someone I know that&#x27;s usually really hard to buy for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thing is, this kit is really good. The buffer is what I love most - it really does leave your nails gorgeous. As a baker, nailpolish is rarely an option for me, and I love that my nails now can look good without me risking getting weird chemicals in my creations. The file is just a file, the oil is great, and the lotion smells amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all - make sure you get your money&#x27;s worth if you buy it at a mall, but if you do, it&#x27;s a fantastic nail set that won&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li> I was absolutely amazed by this product. I was lured to one of the Kiosks at the Mall &amp; given a demonstration. I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes. My nails were so shiny. I swear it was like the guy put a clear coat on. It even feels like I have nail polish on. And the cuticle oil works great too. My boyfriend had really dry, cracked cuticles, &amp; we seen a huge improvement after 1 use:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Now onto purchasing the product***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Unlike many, I did not get ripped off by this guy. I actually ended up getting a deal from him. He started out trying to rip me off though, as they all do. Before he realized I wasn&#x27;t gonna take the bait, he offered me 1 for $95 then I&#x27;d get 2 free. Which wouldn&#x27;t have been a bad deal compared to the prices here. I just didn&#x27;t have the $95 to spend that day. He tried different variations in number of products &amp; prices, but I kept saying no. Eventually he learned that I was a nurse &amp; would really use the product &amp; most likely come bk for more(&amp; I will) he then opened a cabinet under the register &amp; pulled out a brand new kit, with 1 small problem. The corner of the box was dented from shipping(they ship it from Israel), but everything inside the hox was intact and perfect. Bc of that he couldn&#x27;t sell it on the shelf so he offered it 2 me for $20. With a 5yr warranty on the buffer(that&#x27;s my fav. It&#x27;s really what got me interested in it in the 1st place) and a 5yr warranty on the cuticle oil(my 2nd fav thing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in the end I saved about $25 more than I would&#x27;ve if I would have bought it on here. The moral of the story: don&#x27;t automatically discount the sales men &amp; women at the mall bc other ppl got ripped off. You can basically get it as cheap as you want it, if you stick to your guns &amp; make them realize you are interested you just can&#x27;t pay that much. Trust me. They want to sell it to you just as bad as you want to buy it. I&#x27;m sure they work on commission &amp; any sale is better than no sale:) Good luck. And you will love theproduct, it truly is amazing:)</li>
            <li> This was gifted to me once before, so I ordered this when I ran out of my initial package. All the products were of the same quality. Very happy with it - though I wish there was a way to buy this specific lotion separately.</li>
            <li> I bought the nail kit at a kiosk at a mall in Seattle and like the other person, got ripped off.  He charged me $80.00 for one kit, then said if I bought another one I&#x27;d get one free, and then he \\&quot;gave\\&quot; me a fourth.  Asked if I could buy just the buffer thing but no.</li>
            <li> I love these products.</li>
            <li> While the products are excellent, I was unable to secure them online.  Maybe when replacements are needed they will be available.</li>
            <li> I did not buy this item from Amazon, but at a mall kiosk. The demo was done on my two thumb nails, which have considerably thicker nails. When I got home and used the product on my remaining fingernails, oh, what pain!!! Sure the buffer got rid of the ridges, right down to the fingers!!! My nails are now so thin my fingertips hurt... The hand/body lotion left me feeling like I had a burning rash on various body parts. Not good...not good at all</li>
            <li> I previously purchased the Deep Sea Cosmetics Dead Sea DSC Platinum Manicure Nail Kit. I was very happy with the product, but after a few years, the cuticle trimmer broke, so I placed this order. Within a month, the very same tool, the cuticle trimmer broke and I had to go out and buy another one. I&#x27;m not too happy about that!</li>
            <li> This did great for my wife.  Not much challenge there, since her nails are beautiful anyway.  I tried on my nails, which were in hideous shape.  Not only did they come out incredibly, they have held up for a month.  I&#x27;m looking forward to tomorrow, when I get to use the kit again.  I recommend this product 100%!</li>
