    <ol>
            <li>but this one is a great scent.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells great.</li>
            <li>love the cologne and would be very happy to change my review to five stars after you get it together and sell or include the atomizer on Amazon</li>
            <li>Very clean and attractive scent!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great to see that it&#x27;s now readily available on Amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a nice Manly fragrance not too over powering</li>
            <li>I Love this cologne.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>My husband has been using this product for many years and when we moved to VA we thought we couldn&#x27;t get any longer.  </li>
            <li>Most people like the smell, etc.  </li>
            <li>I even like the way it smells:)</li>
            <li>Much better price here than the site I saw it in.</li>
            <li>if you like Bermuda Spyce you will love this one too&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;After seeing that the atomizer wasn&#x27;t available from you off of Amazon, I started to order both the cologne and the atomizer off of your TreasureQuestShoppe.biz website but (a) the cologne costs more there, and (b) the shipping is significantly more: $7 for the cologne, alone, and $14 when I add the 1 oz.</li>
            <li>Glad to see it&#x27;s still available.</li>
            <li>It really has a good smell and my wife likes it</li>
            <li>In fact, that&#x27;s how your cologne was displayed for testing in that retail store — with a spray pump atomizer so the cologne could be easily tested.</li>
            <li>Same great fragrance with essence of Delaware/Maryland shore.</li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s one and only cologne at a great price.</li>
            <li>Enjoy the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Spraying on the cologne with an atomizer is much easier than unscrewing the top, wasting excess cologne in your hands, splashing it on, screwing on the top, and washing your hands, drying your hands.</li>
            <li>Makes my husband smell sexy ;)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a clean spicy scent with a hint of citrus.</li>
            <li>I I used to live on the Chesapeake Bay and loved this product from the first time I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>The scent is VERY close to Tuscany by Aramis (which is one of my favorite colognes).</li>
            <li>We have used this product for a long time and are happy to find a way to purchase it since our old source is no longer available</li>
            <li>Not cheap, but very effective.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells, but this isn&#x27;t too strong when used correctly.</li>
            <li>Great fragrance for a product that&#x27;s hard to find.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, you guys are in the penalty box until you are willing to sell the &amp;#34;spray pump atomizer&amp;#34; that goes with the cologne, as you do off of your website and in retail stores.</li>
            <li>**)&lt;br /&gt;•  </li>
            <li>(*)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &#x27;</li>
            <li>Really!?</li>
            <li>you can see, I have a lot of time on my hands — but you guys really need to get it together!</li>
            <li>I first found this in an Atlantic Rancher catalog over a decade ago.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care how much I like your cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>but, right now, you only get one star for not understanding how your product works.</li>
            <li>I really like this cologne and first found it in a small store in Annapolis, MD, circa 1998.</li>

            <li> I Love this cologne. Found it recently in a little shop in downtown historic Annapolis. The scent is VERY close to Tuscany by Aramis (which is one of my favorite colognes). It&#x27;s got a clean spicy scent with a hint of citrus. I get plenty of compliments on this cologne and has become one of my favorites. The company behind this cologne has a few others they sell. Not sure what they smell like but this one is a great scent. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance for a product that&#x27;s hard to find.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this cologne for my dad for the last 14 years or so. He loves it, my mom loves it, and they are both picky when it comes to fragrances. It&#x27;s a winner</li>
            <li> Had always purchased in person, however have not been back to the beach in a few years.  Same great fragrance with essence of Delaware/Maryland shore.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s one and only cologne at a great price. Not overpowering; has a fresh, subtle scent.</li>
            <li> I really like this cologne and first found it in a small store in Annapolis, MD, circa 1998. In fact, it&#x27;s the only cologne I wear and it&#x27;s great to see that it&#x27;s now readily available on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, you guys are in the penalty box until you are willing to sell the &amp;#34;spray pump atomizer&amp;#34; that goes with the cologne, as you do off of your website and in retail stores. Instead, now I have to hunt down your website, jump through all the hoops to order the atomizer by itself, and wait for a separate shipment from there. What a drag!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;•  Chesapeake Bay Spyce Cologne WITH Spray Pump Atomizer &#x3D; FIVE STARS (*****)&lt;br /&gt;•  Chesapeake Bay Spyce Cologne WITHOUT Spray Pump Atomizer &#x3D; ONE STAR (*)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &#x27;98 in Annapolis, I remember purchasing, separately, a spray pump because the bottle only came with a screw-on cap. In fact, that&#x27;s how your cologne was displayed for testing in that retail store — with a spray pump atomizer so the cologne could be easily tested. Spraying on the cologne with an atomizer is much easier than unscrewing the top, wasting excess cologne in your hands, splashing it on, screwing on the top, and washing your hands, drying your hands. I&#x27;m just not going to do that. I don&#x27;t care how much I like your cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After seeing that the atomizer wasn&#x27;t available from you off of Amazon, I started to order both the cologne and the atomizer off of your TreasureQuestShoppe.biz website but (a) the cologne costs more there, and (b) the shipping is significantly more: $7 for the cologne, alone, and $14 when I add the 1 oz. $2.50 atomizer to the cologne. Really!? An extra $7 for shipping to include a 1 oz. atomizer with the cologne? Come on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the cologne and would be very happy to change my review to five stars after you get it together and sell or include the atomizer on Amazon but, right now, you only get one star for not understanding how your product works. That&#x27;s how much of a drag it is not to haveyour cologne with a spray pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see, I have a lot of time on my hands — but you guys really need to get it together!</li>
            <li> I I used to live on the Chesapeake Bay and loved this product from the first time I purchased it.  My husband has not been without it since then.  I love it.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this product for many years and when we moved to VA we thought we couldn&#x27;t get any longer.  Thank goodness for Amazon.</li>
            <li> Enjoy the fragrance.  Most people like the smell, etc.  Just wish that it was easier to obtain in Arizona.&lt;br /&gt;Instead of having to order through the mail, makes it expensive to pay shipping.</li>
            <li> I use it for after shave and have used it on different occasions,  It really has a good smell and my wife likes it what can I say.  I gave it a 4 star because my belief is no product is a 5.  Ric</li>
            <li> We have used this product for a long time and are happy to find a way to purchase it since our old source is no longer available</li>
            <li> This is the only cologne that both my husband and father-in-law will use. Even my brother-in-law loves it. I even like the way it smells:)</li>
            <li> Have used this Spyce for 20+ years, and will probably take a bottle to my cremation. Also get a lot of &amp;#34;smell good&amp;#34; comments from the women. Not cheap, but very effective.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great. I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells, but this isn&#x27;t too strong when used correctly. Makes my husband smell sexy ;) Much better price here than the site I saw it in.</li>
            <li> I first found this in an Atlantic Rancher catalog over a decade ago. It always gets me compliments and stands out in a crowded field of lotions and colognes. Glad to see it&#x27;s still available. Subtle yet distinctive.</li>
            <li> if you like Bermuda Spyce you will love this one too&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice Manly fragrance not too over powering</li>
            <li> Very clean and attractive scent!</li>
