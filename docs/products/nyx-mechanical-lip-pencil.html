            <li>Happy.</li>
            <li>Inexpensive makeup line and good.</li>
            <li>Very smooth!</li>
            <li>I love this lip liner i wear it every day!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice nude/neutral color and works for every day use.</li>
            <li>Its a nice natrual color.</li>
            <li>The perfect early Christmas gift.</li>
            <li>Goes on very smoothly.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t appear to bleed and helps shape my lips to make my lipstick look better</li>
            <li>Love love this lip color.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite nude lip liners</li>
            <li>The operation of the lip pencil was fine.</li>
            <li>Always a fine tip.  </li>
            <li>The mechanical aspect is a huge draw.  </li>
            <li>overall packaging was good.</li>
            <li>other than the color its a great pencil, can still use it but not as a nude liner,</li>
            <li>My first NYX lip liner and I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li>lasting color love it!</li>
            <li>When you buy a lip liner online make sure you try it in person also just because it looks the same on someone else it wont be the same color on your lips because of your own lip color.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and stays on until normal wear from drinking, eating, etc.</li>
            <li>Perhaps a different color would work better.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a replacement to my Joey of New York Super Duper Vitamin E nude color lip pencil, but this did not even come close.  </li>
            <li>The color isn&#x27;t exactly the color of my lips but darker in a way that accents them rather than accentuates them too much.</li>
            <li>Im giving this 4 stars because I was under the impression that it would be a certain color but its much darker on my lips.</li>
            <li>Color matches my lips very well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m  mixed race medium skin tone and thought I&#x27;d give this a try but the color was just too light for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Looks as expected and glides on smooth.</li>
            <li>I love the color and the shape of these lip pencils however they somehow don&#x27;t last a long time fore me</li>
            <li>Other than that it is fine.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, the line it forms is fine enough to be called a liner but the color is a little orangey for me and doesn&#x27;t stay on very long</li>
            <li>Natural look.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t last all day but what lip pencil really does?</li>
            <li>This is a nude to natural color that barely shows up.</li>
            <li>Be careful not to raise the crayon too high or it will break off.</li>

            <li> doesn&#x27;t last that long</li>
            <li> Color matches my lips very well.  Doesn&#x27;t appear to bleed and helps shape my lips to make my lipstick look better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m  mixed race medium skin tone and thought I&#x27;d give this a try but the color was just too light for me. Definitely made for lighter girls which is no big deal, but it made my lips blend in with my skin almost!</li>
            <li> Definitely was not a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; color.  Worst decision I have ever made as far as lip liner.  It ended up in the trash.</li>
            <li> Love love this lip color. The perfect early Christmas gift. I can&#x27;t wait to use it this coming weekend with my Ruby woo</li>
            <li> Im giving this 4 stars because I was under the impression that it would be a certain color but its much darker on my lips. When you buy a lip liner online make sure you try it in person also just because it looks the same on someone else it wont be the same color on your lips because of your own lip color. overall packaging was good.</li>
            <li> The product color is a great &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34;.  It goes on smoothly and stays on until normal wear from drinking, eating, etc. Price can&#x27;t be beat for the quality of this lip pencil.</li>
            <li> Always use NYX lip liner. It&#x27;s smooth and lasts a long time. I also like that it&#x27;s sharpens when you twist up the bottom. No fuss!</li>
            <li> New to the lip pencil game and I finally see the appeal. I put this on once a day, in the morning after foundation because I always get my foundation on my lips and want to redarken the edges without cleaning them off with remover or rubbing (I&#x27;m lazy). The color isn&#x27;t exactly the color of my lips but darker in a way that accents them rather than accentuates them too much. Natural look. Goes on very smoothly.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a replacement to my Joey of New York Super Duper Vitamin E nude color lip pencil, but this did not even come close.  I will use it for now but keep looking.</li>
            <li> I love the color and the shape of these lip pencils however they somehow don&#x27;t last a long time fore me</li>
            <li> A very nice nude lip liner, perfect shade for my lips. My first NYX lip liner and I&#x27;m not disappointed. Would like to try some other colors as well.</li>
            <li> Looks as expected and glides on smooth. Doesn&#x27;t last all day but what lip pencil really does?</li>
            <li> however, it is a little dry and the tip broke off with the first use. Other than that it is fine.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive makeup line and good. No need to pay ginormous prices for lipliners nyc does the job.  Happy. Will puchase their products again.</li>
            <li> I wanted a lip liner that would blend with my skin, just to keep my lipstick from bleeding. This has a tan color to it - I&#x27;ll have to throw it away. The operation of the lip pencil was fine. Next time I&#x27;ll buy one in a store so I can see the color.</li>
            <li> Works well to keep the lipstick from having lines</li>
            <li> other than the color its a great pencil, can still use it but not as a nude liner,oh well I can always use liners</li>
            <li> Affordable and does the job! It&#x27;s a nice nude/neutral color and works for every day use. I have many of their products and have never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very smooth! I love this lip liner i wear it every day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased these over and over again.  I prefer the nude or flesh tone.  The mechanical aspect is a huge draw.  Always a fine tip.  Be careful not to raise the crayon too high or it will break off.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite nude lip liners</li>
            <li> Love it! Its a nice natrual color.</li>
            <li> I had alip liner I was trying to replace and this looked close.  So because it&#x27;s not what I had I&#x27;ll just give it 4 stars.  It goes on smoothly, the line it forms is fine enough to be called a liner but the color is a little orangey for me and doesn&#x27;t stay on very long</li>
            <li> lasting color love it!</li>
            <li> This is a nude to natural color that barely shows up. I was hoping for a deeper pigment that I could actually see on my lips. Perhaps a different color would work better.</li>
