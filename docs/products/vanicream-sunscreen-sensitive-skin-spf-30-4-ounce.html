            <li>Happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing!</li>
            <li>More like a moisturizer than sunscreen, but provides awesome protection.  </li>
            <li>Stays on good, no irritation at all.</li>
            <li>The great thing about these ingredients is that they are effective immediately.  </li>
            <li>His advice was wise.</li>
            <li>Living in Texas, good sun protection is a year-round &amp;#34;must&amp;#34; for extended driving and outdoor activities.  </li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a good product if you&#x27;re allergic to sunscreen as I am.</li>
            <li>I chose it for a good rating on the EWG website.  </li>
            <li>Good quality and my dermatologist recommended it.  </li>
            <li>I have fair skin prone to irregular moles</li>
            <li>Good quality sunscreen cream recommend to me by a Dermotologist.</li>
            <li>now i dont haveto.order two products for protection its good for the face also.</li>
            <li>I do have fair skin, however, so</li>
            <li>so I put on a good slathering and he looks even paler til it absorbs.</li>
            <li>This is a good non-allergenic sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>I often forget to wear makeup because it looks so good.</li>
            <li>Leaving for trip to the Rockies, and needed good sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Good for deli ate skin.</li>
            <li>Good for 3 months of once a day application to face, neck, chest.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s stickier and whiter than chemical sunscreens, but once it soaks in, it&#x27;s perfect (and worth it!).</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin and burn quite easily</li>
            <li>I used it a number of times and was very pleased, even though it requires a lot of rubbing.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with product and supplier.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>I am allergic to many sunscreens, but this works great for me.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Also, my husband has a photosensitive allergic reaction to most sunscreens (think of the allergic reaction in \\&quot;Hitch\\&quot; and that&#x27;s my husband after a day of hiking-yikes!)</li>
            <li>Love my vanicream moisturizers!</li>
            <li>I was using Shisiedo, which I love but at $38 for about 1/3 the product!</li>
            <li>Better on the skin than micro-zinc IN the skin-yuck!</li>
            <li>From more than one sunscreen (including california baby!)</li>
            <li>Fabulous!!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>

            <li>This sunscreen is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I have been using his product for 7 years and really liked it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Despite everything, it is a nice sunscreen.</li>
            <li>managed a nice tan even with the spf 30 and neither of us</li>
            <li>NICE TEXTURE..</li>
            <li>In theory it seemed perfect for my very acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>be effective.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best mineral sunscreen I have tried.</li>
            <li>and maybe I should take a break and try to warm up.  </li>
            <li>Vanicream Sunscreen for Sensitive Skin, SPF 30 has been the perfect answer for me, and it also works as a good moisturizer as well.  </li>
            <li>I am fair skinned and my boyfriend is significantly darker but we both needed a good sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Easy to apply good for babies and all ages and skin types.</li>
            <li>So it is very easy to appy and blends into the skin on contact.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>Really good price, well packaged and quick delivery - cannot ask for more!  </li>
            <li>My sensitive skin is happy!</li>
            <li>I found another that is just as effective and safe and goes on smoother because it contains olive oil.</li>
            <li>Wonderful for ultra sensitive skin esp.</li>
            <li>NO stains on clothes and easy to apply!</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, and isn&#x27;t super-thick either!  </li>
            <li>Very good for highly reactive skin.</li>
            <li>There are barely 4 full-body applications in one tube of this product, so my hunt for the perfect body sunscreen continues...</li>
            <li>I live in Florida and the sun is so strong here that you need real good protection.</li>
            <li>I am very fair and have had no complaints regarding sunburn when using this, nor any reaction for sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li>but it settles into what I call the perfect finish - not greasy and not dry.  </li>
            <li>This product is effective and very gentle on the face!!</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>But I do love it</li>
            <li>I bought all of the top name brands for sensative skin and he still broke out in a rash/hives.</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>It made my skin look healthy, hydrated, and was odorless.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; sunscreen products but to no avail.  </li>
            <li>I guess that&#x27;s the most important thing!</li>
            <li>Many have the preferred zinc/titanium dioxide but are so greasy that they aggravate my roseacia acne.</li>
            <li>I have eczema and my face is incredibly sun sensitive.</li>
            <li>I decided to try Vanicream because it has zinc oxide and titanium dioxide that serve to deflect the rays and it works much better and is not greasy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not awful, just not what I&#x27;m going for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m confident in the product&#x27;s effectiveness.</li>
            <li>I love Vanicream Sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Love the cream.</li>
            <li>this is lighter and much more spreadable.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>glad i checked this out here.</li>
            <li>IN MOST OF THE STORE SUNSCREENS....</li>
            <li>ow anyone would be able to apply makeup over this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen is fabulous!</li>
            <li>Soooo glad my dermatologist recommended Vanicream 35 to me</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fabulous!  </li>
            <li>We love ALL of Vanicream products.</li>
            <li>But it sure covers well...</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I was sure I would have to return it as I had tried Vanicream sunscreen years ago</li>
            <li>I applied it to my lower legs, as the top and knee were covered by yoga pants.</li>
            <li>I ordered this on a friend&#x27;s recommendation and am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I wear it on my face mostly under my makeup and over my moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s unscented and does not cause me a rash.</li>
            <li>Works okay for me.  </li>
            <li>It is also much more water resistant (I applied this to my son&#x27;s face after taking him in the water after applying Babo Botanicals and I could see that one just running off his face in the pool).  </li>
            <li>I have rosacea and many sunscreens burn my face, make my eyes water and start the itch.</li>
            <li>Physical sunscreen is the best pick for my skin.</li>
            <li>I love both.</li>
            <li>Wish it had a hinged top instead of screw cap.</li>
            <li>I used to carry around two sunscreen bottles and this is way more convenient.</li>
            <li>I have used it on my face for more than 3 years without problems.</li>
            <li>There is something in most suncreens that cause me to break out.  </li>
            <li>I get an allergic reaction to all of the spray kinds for sure.  </li>
            <li>This is a very good sunscreen goes on easy and clear.</li>
            <li>I like it, seems pretty good.</li>
            <li>Great price for great product if you want heavy protection.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried quite a few and this is the best for not causing any rash or breakouts, plus it blends in nicely.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and this sunscreen works great.</li>
            <li>best sunblock I&#x27;ve found for surfing, tried many other products and everything else I&#x27;ve tried has to be reapplied way too often, this stays on for hours while I&#x27;m in the water and keeps me from getting burnt.</li>
            <li>This does the trick, and relies largely on zinc (good)</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin and went to an all-day car show last weekend.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen was recommended to me by a dermatologist which was so great for people with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Most important of all, though, Vanicream does not cause tears when applied close to the eyes</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>i have eczema also Great product Vanicream for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Great if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>great sun screen for allergy sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Great sunscreen for me and my daughter who both are hyper sensitive to sunscreens.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the zinc, which is the most important ingredient.  </li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Great for people and kids with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>As others say, this is high rated as Safest and Most effective of sunscreens on EWG SkinDeep safe cosmetics database.</li>
            <li>This was the true test!</li>
            <li>It has almost no smell and blends/disappears easily.  </li>
            <li>had to use alot because it dosen&#x27;t spread easily</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, easy to pack and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Also this also had very quick shipping.</li>
            <li>My skin burns easy and Vanicream keep my skin from burning like I use too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i did try a product that I was initially impressed with until I developed a very itchy rash that I did not get any relief from for 14 days.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong (I can tell when she wears it), but you get use to it after awhile.</li>
            <li>They say this one is fine, and wont pull away when i apply it.</li>
            <li>So I now use less and it is great!!</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and spreads easily.</li>
            <li>but it seems to work just fine.</li>
            <li>This one isn&#x27;t as smooth as the others and doesn&#x27;t rub in as easy as the light lotion</li>
            <li>Our whole family uses it, very gentle and effective!</li>
            <li>This stuff is very moisturizing-a bit too much for acne break out areas of the face but great for the eyes and body.  </li>
            <li>Huge fan.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and keep the skin moist.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a GREAT sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I would never have been able to enjoy an event like that in a bathing suit without worrying about getting burnt, and it&#x27;s a good thing because I was in a wedding 2 days later!</li>
            <li>And my dermatologist introduced me to it with a free sample.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love that this takes longer, but it&#x27;s worth it for a gentle effective sunscreen.</li>
            <li>With use of Vanicream I am now itch free and bump free.  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen goes on smooth and stays on.  </li>
            <li>We spend alot of time on the water either fishing or boating to enjoy the day.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product, I have used it regularly for a couple of weeks now.</li>
            <li>I had been searching for a hypoallergenic, fragrance free, gluten free sunscreen that didn&#x27;t make me break out in hives or cause a burning sensation for quite some time.</li>
            <li>no reactions and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>I used it for morning runs as well as daytime under light make up.</li>
            <li>I like it because it is fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>Also the cost is fantastic.</li>
            <li>and I look like I&#x27;ve had a light tan instead of burning.</li>
            <li>It is also a bit shiny on face... a light powder remedies</li>
            <li>We use several Vanicream products and happily use the sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>my daughter has sensitive skin,my friend told me this brand Sunscreen, her daughter used and felt good.</li>
            <li>Good sunscreen for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have discoid lupus, which means that my skin is so sensitive to the sun that I have to wear a very good high SPF sunscreen at all times on any exposed skin.  </li>
            <li>Clean with no annoying coconut odor.</li>
            <li>My new favorite sunscreen!</li>
            <li>Aqua Rich Waterly Essence Sunscreen 50g Spf50</li>
            <li>Well worth the purchase price!</li>
            <li>It takes a bit of work to rub it in, but it is worth it!</li>
            <li>The best for sensitive skin, and no white pasty look.</li>
            <li>Thrilled to find a sunscreen for my very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to worry about whether or not I&#x27;m doing more harm than good with this sunscreen, because the active ingredients are just zinc oxide and titanium dioxide.  </li>
            <li>Nice to be major chemical free, and it does eventually absorb, so you lose the &#x27;ghost face&#x27; effect.  </li>
            <li>Has a good consistency, needs to be rubbed in well, but that is not a big deal to me.  </li>
            <li>Works just as well or better as the California Baby brand I paid twice as much for.  </li>
            <li>This is not as good as a similar product by Vanicream that I meant to buy which is Vanicream sport 35.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Love Vanicream Sunscreens: absolutely nothing in it to bother skin, while still getting protection.</li>
            <li>With skin  cancer the problem there can never  be enough good sun screens</li>
            <li>I have used this product for about 10 years and love it so much.  </li>
            <li>Love to surf and am in the Florida sun much a lot.  </li>
            <li>My skin has no bad reactions.  </li>
            <li>This cream doesn&#x27;t blend in as well and doesn&#x27;t seem to make my skin as happy as the other cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, many physical sunscreens that are chemical-free, but this is the one I stick with.</li>
            <li>had to get to the pool quick, so</li>
            <li>actually does rub into your skin much better than most.</li>
            <li>Would highly tell you to try this- you will love it.</li>
            <li>This sun block is highly recommended by EWG as safe.  </li>
            <li>The new formula has NDC 4534-353-04 printed on top of the container.</li>
            <li>First off, this stuff is thick as peanut butter, best of luck spreading it around your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hands down the best sunscreen I have ever tried for my sensitive rosacea-prone middle-aged skin.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>I wish they made a higher SPF!</li>
            <li>Nice and smooth especially if you moisturize first otherwise</li>
            <li>Which is exactly what I wanted!  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend Vanicream products to anyone who has allergies!!!</li>
            <li>and it was quite visible on my friends&#x27; and my faces as we beaded with sweat in the hot Las Vegas sun yesterday!</li>
            <li>I looked real hard for the right kind of sunscreen for scars that can&#x27;t be in the sun, which i think is all of them lol.</li>
            <li>Because of the super effective zinc oxide the cream is white</li>
            <li>Great sunscreen for kids/babies with sensitive skin including my toddler who has eczema, the only downside is the sunscreen isn&#x27;t super easy to apply and if it gets in their hair, it looks really greasy and oily.</li>
            <li>But, it soaks in so quickly that I&#x27;m able to immediately apply my makeup with no heavy or greasy feel.  </li>
            <li>I have never written a review on Amazon, but I have to say this product is amazing for me and hopefully for anyone with a similar issue.  </li>
            <li>On top of the container box the number NDC 45334-333-04 appears for the old formula.  </li>
            <li>Guess it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s as close to natural as you can get.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Love that it has no harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>Skin has a whitish tinge when applied, but worth it for those allergic to sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s non sensitizing, is not white on skin and is effective.  </li>
            <li>and I guess I was a more sensitive to the sun than I realized.</li>
            <li>kept my skin soft but safe from the harshness of the sun exposure.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t done an all day outside kind of thing</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth the effort.</li>
            <li>and we all have success with this product.</li>
            <li>Luckily the baby didn&#x27;t get burned but I&#x27;ll be super cautious for awhile until I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s effective for his delicate skin.</li>
            <li>If you get too much you&#x27;ll be looking like Casper the Friendly Ghost.  </li>
            <li>so I need sunscreen even indoors with UV lighting (which is almost everywhere right now).</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;d prefer one with more natural ingredients (these sound like chemicals), it is a barrier cream that is far easier to apply that all the others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>We live in a city and have well water which makes a Huge difference in the products we can and can not use.  </li>
            <li>This product offers all the ingredients you need to keep your scar safe and It pretty much does everything it says.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find this cream to be a very important part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li>I loved the SPF 30 -- it was a little shiny</li>
            <li>But, when you see a blue girl at the pool, and you&#x27;re a nice older lady, you have to say something to try to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel any heavier on my face than Aveeno or Neutragena, and there&#x27;s no weird fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first because everything including items that are for &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; always cause an adverse reaction on my face.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a small price to pay for a great, gentle moisturizer with sunblock.</li>
            <li>I would rate higher</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it has worked for others but it totally backfired on my end.</li>
            <li>In hot weather it might feel sticky for a while</li>
            <li>At first glance I thought this was a return bc</li>
            <li>product is exactly what it says it is and works exactly as it is suppose to.</li>
            <li>first found this a Mayo Clinic..</li>
            <li>But Vanicream was gentle and he did not break out at all!  </li>
            <li>I have tried any others and this is the first that did not cause a burning sensation to my face.</li>
            <li>It is the first sunscreen that my kids have used that didn&#x27;t make them break out in hives.  </li>
            <li>Sunscreen rubbed in better than Blue Lizard.  </li>
            <li>When I first apply it, my face literally looks like I rubbed cooking oil on it.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to do that with sunscreen before without developing a severe rash and possibly hives.  </li>
            <li>and I stay pretty brown year</li>
            <li>Love it finally found something I can use without allergy issues!&lt;br</li>
            <li>like it enough I&#x27;ve recommended it to people and they are pleased.</li>
            <li>Good spf coverage without all the harsh chemicals the drugstore brands have.</li>
            <li>the smell is mild to me (and I am generally not into strong scents).</li>
            <li>I was breakout free because it is very friendly to sensitive skin - it just felt like a mask the entire time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is rare to find any sunscreen that does not elicit eye burning or be so mild that it is completely ineffective.  </li>
            <li>We both have an extreme sensitivity to the ingredients in many of the popular sunscreens and my husband had a severe rash on his arms recently when her tried another product.  </li>
            <li>It took a week for his skin to clear up enough to even attempt Vanicream and I love it!</li>
            <li>Also, my eyes are SUPER sensitive, but I can put this right up to my eyes w</li>
            <li>really liked the other product that I had been using for years until it was discontinued.</li>
            <li>This would be great for folks with sensitive skin not sure if it worth the price for non-sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I ended up with Vanicream because it&#x27;s broad spectrum SPF 30 (also available in SPF 60), and it&#x27;s noncomedogenic (doesn&#x27;t clog pores).  </li>
            <li>; when it goes on, I believe, are people not familiar with the nature of this overall type of (safest and most effective) sunscreens made with zinc oxide.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I should have patch tested, and am positive it was not a sensitivity reaction.</li>
            <li>I settled on this brand not merely for the manufacturer&#x27;s quality reputation, but because it really stays on well without being all shiny on my skin.  </li>
            <li>The bottle lasts a long time too, buying more now for the summer.</li>
            <li>Makeup can go over it and it offers full protection for the face.</li>
            <li>For a physical sun block, the cream went on easily which was a plus.</li>
            <li>The Cotz brand is thicker and better for winter dry skin.</li>
            <li>SPF 30 seems strong enough for even a mid-day surf.  </li>
            <li>It is very gentle, non irritating and is very effective.  </li>
            <li>Vanicream is free of several major skin irritants, such as chemical sunscreens, lanolin, dyes, all fragrances (including masking fragrances), parabens, and preservatives...which is a nice bonus.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was excited to get this at first because I breakout in a rash from all regular drugstore-available sunscreens.</li>
            <li>It is a good sunscreen, but it is hard to rub on to the face.</li>
            <li>It does the job very well</li>
            <li>I have to say I really wanted to like this product, but it made me itch to the point I couldn&#x27;t sleep.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>I spent weeks researching all kinds of healthy sunscreens and I decided to go with this one.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>But highly recommended!</li>
            <li>The Pros: I did not have an allergic reaction, I did not get burned, the product really has no smell.</li>
            <li>She really like the sunscreen because it does not cause problems with her skin.  </li>
            <li>this product was recommended by my dermatologist, I react very severely to sun exposure</li>
            <li>I used to get sores on my forearms from too much sun, until I started using this product.  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen works very well.</li>
            <li>I like this sunscreen very well.  </li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t sink into your skin very well</li>
            <li>I would only recommend this to someone who couldn&#x27;t comfortably use anything else.</li>
            <li>Although I appreciated the products</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>With kids, it&#x27;s a much easier application process.</li>
            <li>NOW THE WHOLE FAMILY IS USING IT.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this sunscreen!</li>
            <li>Now the whole family uses it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>The Vanicream sunblocks work very well on me.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t sweat much, and I was out for about 4 hours.</li>
            <li>But it really saved my skin.</li>
            <li>Vanicream is medical grade, chemical free, physical mineral sunblock free of irritants, etc.</li>
            <li>But I have no problem with it absorbing into skin and disappearing.</li>
            <li>It was very noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I really like this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Be ready for a shiny face.</li>
            <li>Sunscreen absorbs fast and non-greasy.</li>
            <li>Nice texture and feel, but it was not really for sensitive skn, as it made my face feel like a desert and made it flake.</li>
            <li>I tried many physical sunscreen brands, and this is the favor one so far.</li>
            <li>goes on thick and must be rubbed in fairly well</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and this product is the first one I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t irritate.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen doesn&#x27;t stain clothes like many other sunscreens do.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m scraping the bottom and ordering more even though I have 4 other sunblocks.</li>
            <li>A light, transparent formula that provides high sunscreen protection without the use of chemical sunscreens which is a big lie,&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>My 7 months old baby has eczema, and this product works very gentle on her skin.</li>
            <li>When first applied it will feel somewhat more heavy than a normal moisturizer</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin like me, do a patch test first.</li>
            <li>I was in direct sun all day in the hot 95-degree sun.</li>
            <li>Most recently, I have started experiencing severe reactions to sunscreen, but only on my face.  </li>
            <li>I also found that I could not use it on my face without using powder since it makes you look extra shiny once you&#x27;ve been able to get the white streaks out!</li>
            <li>The main ingredient is zinc oxide</li>
            <li>My children with allergies and very sensitive skin have responded very well to Vanicream.  </li>
            <li>my daughter has very sensitive skin and is prone to eczema and this product works very well for her.</li>
            <li>Great for my little one who is allergic to other sunscreens.</li>
            <li>I highly recommed it for anyone with roseacia or who is prone to eczema, like me.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this lotion for those with chemical sensitivities.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for babies too.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>my favorite a little expensive but works great</li>
            <li>It has absolutely &amp;#34;no&amp;#34; odor and is truly skin sensitive... and keeps me from getting sunburned.</li>
            <li>It really protects and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin at all.</li>
            <li>Works great, but a bit difficult to get off your face.</li>
            <li>I bought a few chem-free sunscreens from the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s recommended list, and this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Kids were allergic to normal sunscreens so we decided to try this one...</li>
            <li>I get migraines from fragrance and have trouble with the smell of most sunscreens.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear makeup, so it&#x27;s not a huge deal to me, but I cannot imagine how anyone would be able to apply makeup over this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>i guess i can live with it</li>
            <li>This is my new go-to sunblock.</li>
            <li>I went to a water parker in New Braunsfels Texas.</li>
            <li>This new formulation remains quite chalky.</li>
            <li>I live in the southwest part of the country, where the sun beats down and causes skin to become dry and more prone to sun damage; plus I have many allergies and must be careful about products/ingredients that I use.  </li>
            <li>Works really well, but it easily gets on your clothes/ bathing suit and it&#x27;s super hard to get off not only your suit but also your skin.</li>
            <li>I should&#x27;ve listened to the reviews because it does leave a huge white cast on your face when you finally get it all rubbed in.</li>
            <li>would say it is much more fluid than i expected and its just downright sticky.&lt;br /&gt;Though</li>
            <li>My two year old niece also has sensitive skin and is very fair-complected and her dermatologist recommended this one for her.</li>
            <li>Because my face is very sensitive to lotions and sunscreens it was suggested I try Vanicream Sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen was recommend by my dermatologist because I very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This product was recommended by my dermatologist as my skin is very sensitive to sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive and flaky but combination skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and normally develop a rash from sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>, this is the first sunscreen that turned my skin blue.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t burn, but it didn&#x27;t seem to protect much better than any other sunscreen in the same circumstances</li>
            <li>Love the creamy texture, how it makes my skin glow; I use it year round!</li>
            <li>The only thing I wished for was that the SPF was higher than 30.</li>
            <li>it is pretty goopy with a texture similar to Elmers glue.</li>
            <li>once its on it gets very slimy and does not dry easily,but if it works  </li>
            <li>my husband and I own a small nursery (plants) and I work out in the open for 4 months a year.</li>
            <li>My daughter has moderate eczema and pretty sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>My 5 year old has always had very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I also like Neutragena free and clear for babies, but this is much less greasy, so I rate it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a delicate flower and am very sensitive to the chemicals in most sunscreens.</li>
            <li>This is far less taxing sun-wise than most of my activities, and yet, when I came back, I discovered \\&quot;sun socks\\&quot; on my lower legs---they had tanned as though I had on no sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Next to pure zinc</li>
            <li>I liked the lite lotion, but the sunscreen is very thick and makes my skin greasy.</li>
            <li>I feel like I&#x27;m pulling the skin on my face which might actually cause more skin damage than a little sun exposure...</li>
            <li>Simply a product you cannot do without.&lt;br /&gt;Non-irritating, very creamy.</li>
            <li>After my husband and I did a lot of research because I have sensitive skin and rosacea.</li>
            <li>I would like to find the old formula if there is one floating around somewhere...</li>

            <li>[[ASIN:B000ZJ2842 Vanicream Sunscreen, Sensitive Skin, SPF 30, 4-Ounce&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is completely odorless.</li>
            <li>This works for me, although it does leave your skin a bit white unless you really work it in.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my sensitive skin from burning.  </li>
            <li>but it is truly for sensitive skin and has no odor.</li>
            <li>No breakouts for my highly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Had to learn not to use too much; my face was white from the cream</li>

            <li>Recommended by our dermatologist for our daughters sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It was recommended by my dermatologist since I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My 5 kids have sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;My 2 and 7 year old break out in rashes,</li>
            <li>This is a cream supposed to make my skin soft and</li>
            <li>My aesthetician recommended vanicream as I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I just used this for 3 days straight, all day reapplying, and only washing it off at the end of each day.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen does not make my sensitive skin break out.</li>
            <li>one is Cotz brand for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I would suggest this to people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Offers additional protection from UVA rays as well as UVB rays.</li>
            <li>Vanicream Sunscreen SPF30 for Sensitive Skin prevents sunburn and does not irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>works well for sensitive skin people who can not tolerate all the ingredients that many common sun blocks include.</li>
            <li>Methylisozolinone, I suggest you google it if you have broken out in a rash after using any kind of skin care or hair care product containing this - a lot of people are allergic).  </li>
            <li>Some of the other sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried might be fine for a day at the beach, but this one wins as my everyday, under makeup sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several other brands and all of them left white residue on my clothing because of the Titanium dioxide and Zinc oxide ingredients that are necessary in any good sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>one feels very safe, I can feel that this will protect my skin from sun light, but I cannot wear them everyday, a little greasy and heavy for me.</li>
            <li>its really important to use daily sun protection but not easy to find a high SPF that works well under makeup.  </li>
            <li>Perfect base for my Bare Minerals make up.</li>
            <li>it is a little on the thick side when applying but outside of that i am happy.</li>
            <li>(normally I have to buy a face sunscreen and then regular).</li>
            <li>After I stopped using Vanicream, it took 2 weeks for my skin to calm down.</li>
            <li>Goes on greasy and white, it&#x27;s extremely hard to rub in and seems to sit on top of the skin.</li>
            <li>A few things I like and dislike:&lt;br /&gt;- Legitimately safe for sensitive skin, unlike other &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>This cream actually creates a new problem - skin rashes.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing for my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Nearly 18 years later, a dermatologist gave me some samples of the Vanicream Sunscreen for Sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Now, this version does not go on skin smoothly, but instead goes on unevenly and when smoothed out still has a white shadow on skin.  </li>
            <li>It works well however it goes on thick, so it&#x27;s not as easy to spread around as Neutrogena, for instance.</li>
            <li>I had a mild breakout after a few days.</li>
            <li>right at Walgreens down the road from my house.</li>
            <li>My child has very sensitive skin, and this is the only product out there that he doesn&#x27;t seem to react to.  </li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal Sublime Sun Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 30 on my body</li>
            <li>It is just thick and harder to get on and you have to use more than normal.</li>
            <li>Although applying it can take some time and it does leave a little shine, it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>And, it hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts (generally a sunscreen problem fo me).</li>
            <li>Considering the general price point of the brand, it&#x27;s not a sunscreen I would want to use from head to toe.  </li>
            <li>Considering the general price point of the brand, it&#x27;s not a sunscreen I would want to use from head to toe.  </li>
            <li>It does go on clear and feels very sheer; it&#x27;s not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>Some tubes of Sunscreenhas separation problems, clear fluid is expressed instead of sunscreen paste.</li>
            <li>It was definitely easier on my son&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>There are barely 4 full-body applications in one tube of this product, so</li>
            <li>This is the only sunscreen that I have found so far that I&#x27;m not allergic too.</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend for those with allergies or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is terrific for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I was surprised when I saw the email confirming my order the next morning.  </li>
            <li>So far, they are the only ones that truly, truly don&#x27;t bother my skin in any way.</li>
            <li>Natural sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t make you white!</li>
            <li>One last thing I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It certainly did the job of keeping my face protected and didn&#x27;t make my face break out like other sunscreens</li>
            <li>It is rather thick, seems to rub in better in the summer, my face is so dry in the winter.</li>
            <li>At first my skin didn&#x27;t react that badly (slight redness), but within a couple of weeks my skin was screaming and started itching.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t usually review, but I just want to make sure people are aware of the very possible negative side effects.</li>
            <li>Vanicream Sunscreen, even though the active ingredients are Titanium dioxide and Zinc oxide, does not make my skin look white even when first applied, and it does not transfer visibly to my clothing.  </li>
            <li>Also significant worries about using it on my body as you&#x27;ll notice EVERYTHING you touch with it on your hands ends up with a thick greasy film....</li>
            <li>Of course I wear a hat and big sunglasses and try to stay out of the direct sun as much as possible, too.  </li>
            <li>My facial skin is only sensitive to sunscreens.</li>
            <li>This is the only one I have tried (including multiple products for sensitive skin and or baby skin) that does not give me a rash.  </li>
            <li>However, the product I was using was recently relabeled as &amp;#34;not broad</li>
            <li>this is absolutely not an option for use on my face - it DOES rub in clear (though is white when you first apply and needs rubbing in), but the thick, sticky, greasy texture and SIGNIFICANT sheen left on the face (even after waiting over an hour) require extra time and steps to use oil blotting linens (about 5) and brush on a layer of powder (defeating the purpose of my new facial regimen and avoiding makeup and other skin clogging layers).</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin and have tried lots of other sunscreens that are supposed to be for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This new formula leaves a dry, white coating on my skin that does not sink in.....</li>
            <li>It is very thick and does not blend it easily.  </li>
            <li>so I recommend starting with a little and rubbing that in first</li>
            <li>so I recently bough several different brands that are organic or for sensitive skin from the internet (only place I can find sunscreen that does not cause a reaction)</li>
            <li>I have previously used are full of chemicals that break down the sun&#x27;s rays.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Happy with this product.  </li>
            <li> This product is amazing!</li>
            <li> More like a moisturizer than sunscreen, but provides awesome protection.  </li>
            <li> Stays on good, no irritation at all.</li>
            <li> The great thing about these ingredients is that they are effective immediately.  </li>
            <li> His advice was wise.</li>
            <li> Living in Texas, good sun protection is a year-round &amp;#34;must&amp;#34; for extended driving and outdoor activities.  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a good product if you&#x27;re allergic to sunscreen as I am.</li>
            <li> I chose it for a good rating on the EWG website.  </li>
            <li> Good quality and my dermatologist recommended it.  </li>
            <li> I have fair skin prone to irregular moles</li>
            <li> Good quality sunscreen cream recommend to me by a Dermotologist.</li>
            <li> now i dont haveto.order two products for protection its good for the face also.</li>
            <li> I do have fair skin, however, so</li>
            <li> so I put on a good slathering and he looks even paler til it absorbs.</li>
            <li> This is a good non-allergenic sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I often forget to wear makeup because it looks so good.</li>
            <li> Leaving for trip to the Rockies, and needed good sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Good for deli ate skin.</li>
            <li> Good for 3 months of once a day application to face, neck, chest.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s stickier and whiter than chemical sunscreens, but once it soaks in, it&#x27;s perfect (and worth it!).</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and burn quite easily</li>
            <li> I used it a number of times and was very pleased, even though it requires a lot of rubbing.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with product and supplier.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> I am allergic to many sunscreens, but this works great for me.  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Also, my husband has a photosensitive allergic reaction to most sunscreens (think of the allergic reaction in \\&quot;Hitch\\&quot; and that&#x27;s my husband after a day of hiking-yikes!)</li>
            <li> Love my vanicream moisturizers!</li>
            <li> I was using Shisiedo, which I love but at $38 for about 1/3 the product!</li>
            <li> Better on the skin than micro-zinc IN the skin-yuck!</li>
            <li> From more than one sunscreen (including california baby!)</li>
            <li> Fabulous!!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li> So glad I found it!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!!!!</li>
            <li> so I was very excited when I didn&#x27;t turn into a lobster after using this!</li>
            <li> It feels smooth and and is a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> if you have Eczema thus is for you and ut amazingly heals skin as well as protects.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen has been amazing in helping to reduce my fare ups.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I have been using his product for 7 years and really liked it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite everything, it is a nice sunscreen.</li>
            <li> managed a nice tan even with the spf 30 and neither of us</li>
            <li> NICE TEXTURE..</li>
            <li> In theory it seemed perfect for my very acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> be effective.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best mineral sunscreen I have tried.</li>
            <li> and maybe I should take a break and try to warm up.  </li>
            <li> Vanicream Sunscreen for Sensitive Skin, SPF 30 has been the perfect answer for me, and it also works as a good moisturizer as well.  </li>
            <li> I am fair skinned and my boyfriend is significantly darker but we both needed a good sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Easy to apply good for babies and all ages and skin types.</li>
            <li> So it is very easy to appy and blends into the skin on contact.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Really good price, well packaged and quick delivery - cannot ask for more!  </li>
            <li> My sensitive skin is happy!</li>
            <li> I found another that is just as effective and safe and goes on smoother because it contains olive oil.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for ultra sensitive skin esp.</li>
            <li> NO stains on clothes and easy to apply!</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, and isn&#x27;t super-thick either!  </li>
            <li> Very good for highly reactive skin.</li>
            <li> There are barely 4 full-body applications in one tube of this product, so my hunt for the perfect body sunscreen continues...</li>
            <li> I live in Florida and the sun is so strong here that you need real good protection.</li>
            <li> I am very fair and have had no complaints regarding sunburn when using this, nor any reaction for sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li> but it settles into what I call the perfect finish - not greasy and not dry.  </li>
            <li> This product is effective and very gentle on the face!!</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> But I do love it</li>
            <li> I bought all of the top name brands for sensative skin and he still broke out in a rash/hives.</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> It made my skin look healthy, hydrated, and was odorless.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; sunscreen products but to no avail.  </li>
            <li> I guess that&#x27;s the most important thing!</li>
            <li> Many have the preferred zinc/titanium dioxide but are so greasy that they aggravate my roseacia acne.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and my face is incredibly sun sensitive.</li>
            <li> I decided to try Vanicream because it has zinc oxide and titanium dioxide that serve to deflect the rays and it works much better and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not awful, just not what I&#x27;m going for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confident in the product&#x27;s effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I love Vanicream Sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Love the cream.</li>
            <li> this is lighter and much more spreadable.  </li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> glad i checked this out here.</li>
            <li> IN MOST OF THE STORE SUNSCREENS....</li>
            <li> ow anyone would be able to apply makeup over this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> This sunscreen is fabulous!</li>
            <li> Soooo glad my dermatologist recommended Vanicream 35 to me</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fabulous!  </li>
            <li> We love ALL of Vanicream products.</li>
            <li> But it sure covers well...</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I was sure I would have to return it as I had tried Vanicream sunscreen years ago</li>
            <li> I applied it to my lower legs, as the top and knee were covered by yoga pants.</li>
            <li> I ordered this on a friend&#x27;s recommendation and am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I wear it on my face mostly under my makeup and over my moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s unscented and does not cause me a rash.</li>
            <li> Works okay for me.  </li>
            <li> It is also much more water resistant (I applied this to my son&#x27;s face after taking him in the water after applying Babo Botanicals and I could see that one just running off his face in the pool).  </li>
            <li> I have rosacea and many sunscreens burn my face, make my eyes water and start the itch.</li>
            <li> Physical sunscreen is the best pick for my skin.</li>
            <li> I love both.</li>
            <li> Wish it had a hinged top instead of screw cap.</li>
            <li> I used to carry around two sunscreen bottles and this is way more convenient.</li>
            <li> I have used it on my face for more than 3 years without problems.</li>
            <li> There is something in most suncreens that cause me to break out.  </li>
            <li> I get an allergic reaction to all of the spray kinds for sure.  </li>
            <li> This is a very good sunscreen goes on easy and clear.</li>
            <li> I like it, seems pretty good.</li>
            <li> Great price for great product if you want heavy protection.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few and this is the best for not causing any rash or breakouts, plus it blends in nicely.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this sunscreen works great.</li>
            <li> best sunblock I&#x27;ve found for surfing, tried many other products and everything else I&#x27;ve tried has to be reapplied way too often, this stays on for hours while I&#x27;m in the water and keeps me from getting burnt.</li>
            <li> This does the trick, and relies largely on zinc (good)</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and went to an all-day car show last weekend.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen was recommended to me by a dermatologist which was so great for people with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Most important of all, though, Vanicream does not cause tears when applied close to the eyes</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> i have eczema also Great product Vanicream for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Great if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> great sun screen for allergy sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Great sunscreen for me and my daughter who both are hyper sensitive to sunscreens.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the zinc, which is the most important ingredient.  </li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great for people and kids with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> As others say, this is high rated as Safest and Most effective of sunscreens on EWG SkinDeep safe cosmetics database.</li>
            <li> This was the true test!</li>
            <li> It has almost no smell and blends/disappears easily.  </li>
            <li> had to use alot because it dosen&#x27;t spread easily</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, easy to pack and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Also this also had very quick shipping.</li>
            <li> My skin burns easy and Vanicream keep my skin from burning like I use too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i did try a product that I was initially impressed with until I developed a very itchy rash that I did not get any relief from for 14 days.</li>
            <li> The smell is strong (I can tell when she wears it), but you get use to it after awhile.</li>
            <li> They say this one is fine, and wont pull away when i apply it.</li>
            <li> So I now use less and it is great!!</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and spreads easily.</li>
            <li> but it seems to work just fine.</li>
            <li> This one isn&#x27;t as smooth as the others and doesn&#x27;t rub in as easy as the light lotion</li>
            <li> Our whole family uses it, very gentle and effective!</li>
            <li> This stuff is very moisturizing-a bit too much for acne break out areas of the face but great for the eyes and body.  </li>
            <li> Huge fan.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and keep the skin moist.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a GREAT sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I would never have been able to enjoy an event like that in a bathing suit without worrying about getting burnt, and it&#x27;s a good thing because I was in a wedding 2 days later!</li>
            <li> And my dermatologist introduced me to it with a free sample.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love that this takes longer, but it&#x27;s worth it for a gentle effective sunscreen.</li>
            <li> With use of Vanicream I am now itch free and bump free.  </li>
            <li> This sunscreen goes on smooth and stays on.  </li>
            <li> We spend alot of time on the water either fishing or boating to enjoy the day.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product, I have used it regularly for a couple of weeks now.</li>
            <li> I had been searching for a hypoallergenic, fragrance free, gluten free sunscreen that didn&#x27;t make me break out in hives or cause a burning sensation for quite some time.</li>
            <li> no reactions and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> I used it for morning runs as well as daytime under light make up.</li>
            <li> I like it because it is fragrance free.  </li>
            <li> Also the cost is fantastic.</li>
            <li> and I look like I&#x27;ve had a light tan instead of burning.</li>
            <li> It is also a bit shiny on face... a light powder remedies</li>
            <li> We use several Vanicream products and happily use the sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> my daughter has sensitive skin,my friend told me this brand Sunscreen, her daughter used and felt good.</li>
            <li> Good sunscreen for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have discoid lupus, which means that my skin is so sensitive to the sun that I have to wear a very good high SPF sunscreen at all times on any exposed skin.  </li>
            <li> Clean with no annoying coconut odor.</li>
            <li> My new favorite sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Aqua Rich Waterly Essence Sunscreen 50g Spf50</li>
            <li> Well worth the purchase price!</li>
            <li> It takes a bit of work to rub it in, but it is worth it!</li>
            <li> The best for sensitive skin, and no white pasty look.</li>
            <li> Thrilled to find a sunscreen for my very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry about whether or not I&#x27;m doing more harm than good with this sunscreen, because the active ingredients are just zinc oxide and titanium dioxide.  </li>
            <li> Nice to be major chemical free, and it does eventually absorb, so you lose the &#x27;ghost face&#x27; effect.  </li>
            <li> Has a good consistency, needs to be rubbed in well, but that is not a big deal to me.  </li>
            <li> Works just as well or better as the California Baby brand I paid twice as much for.  </li>
            <li> This is not as good as a similar product by Vanicream that I meant to buy which is Vanicream sport 35.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Love Vanicream Sunscreens: absolutely nothing in it to bother skin, while still getting protection.</li>
            <li> With skin  cancer the problem there can never  be enough good sun screens</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 10 years and love it so much.  </li>
            <li> Love to surf and am in the Florida sun much a lot.  </li>
            <li> My skin has no bad reactions.  </li>
            <li> This cream doesn&#x27;t blend in as well and doesn&#x27;t seem to make my skin as happy as the other cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many, many physical sunscreens that are chemical-free, but this is the one I stick with.</li>
            <li> had to get to the pool quick, so</li>
            <li> actually does rub into your skin much better than most.</li>
            <li> Would highly tell you to try this- you will love it.</li>
            <li> This sun block is highly recommended by EWG as safe.  </li>
            <li> The new formula has NDC 4534-353-04 printed on top of the container.</li>
            <li> First off, this stuff is thick as peanut butter, best of luck spreading it around your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hands down the best sunscreen I have ever tried for my sensitive rosacea-prone middle-aged skin.  </li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> I wish they made a higher SPF!</li>
            <li> Nice and smooth especially if you moisturize first otherwise</li>
            <li> Which is exactly what I wanted!  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend Vanicream products to anyone who has allergies!!!</li>
            <li> and it was quite visible on my friends&#x27; and my faces as we beaded with sweat in the hot Las Vegas sun yesterday!</li>
            <li> I looked real hard for the right kind of sunscreen for scars that can&#x27;t be in the sun, which i think is all of them lol.</li>
            <li> Because of the super effective zinc oxide the cream is white</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen for kids/babies with sensitive skin including my toddler who has eczema, the only downside is the sunscreen isn&#x27;t super easy to apply and if it gets in their hair, it looks really greasy and oily.</li>
            <li> But, it soaks in so quickly that I&#x27;m able to immediately apply my makeup with no heavy or greasy feel.  </li>
            <li> I have never written a review on Amazon, but I have to say this product is amazing for me and hopefully for anyone with a similar issue.  </li>
            <li> On top of the container box the number NDC 45334-333-04 appears for the old formula.  </li>
            <li> Guess it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s as close to natural as you can get.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Love that it has no harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> Skin has a whitish tinge when applied, but worth it for those allergic to sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non sensitizing, is not white on skin and is effective.  </li>
            <li> and I guess I was a more sensitive to the sun than I realized.</li>
            <li> kept my skin soft but safe from the harshness of the sun exposure.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t done an all day outside kind of thing</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth the effort.</li>
            <li> and we all have success with this product.</li>
            <li> Luckily the baby didn&#x27;t get burned but I&#x27;ll be super cautious for awhile until I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s effective for his delicate skin.</li>
            <li> If you get too much you&#x27;ll be looking like Casper the Friendly Ghost.  </li>
            <li> so I need sunscreen even indoors with UV lighting (which is almost everywhere right now).</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;d prefer one with more natural ingredients (these sound like chemicals), it is a barrier cream that is far easier to apply that all the others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> We live in a city and have well water which makes a Huge difference in the products we can and can not use.  </li>
            <li> This product offers all the ingredients you need to keep your scar safe and It pretty much does everything it says.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find this cream to be a very important part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li> I loved the SPF 30 -- it was a little shiny</li>
            <li> But, when you see a blue girl at the pool, and you&#x27;re a nice older lady, you have to say something to try to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel any heavier on my face than Aveeno or Neutragena, and there&#x27;s no weird fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first because everything including items that are for &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; always cause an adverse reaction on my face.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a small price to pay for a great, gentle moisturizer with sunblock.</li>
            <li> I would rate higher</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it has worked for others but it totally backfired on my end.</li>
            <li> In hot weather it might feel sticky for a while</li>
            <li> At first glance I thought this was a return bc</li>
            <li> product is exactly what it says it is and works exactly as it is suppose to.</li>
            <li> first found this a Mayo Clinic..</li>
            <li> But Vanicream was gentle and he did not break out at all!  </li>
            <li> I have tried any others and this is the first that did not cause a burning sensation to my face.</li>
            <li> It is the first sunscreen that my kids have used that didn&#x27;t make them break out in hives.  </li>
            <li> Sunscreen rubbed in better than Blue Lizard.  </li>
            <li> When I first apply it, my face literally looks like I rubbed cooking oil on it.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to do that with sunscreen before without developing a severe rash and possibly hives.  </li>
            <li> and I stay pretty brown year</li>
            <li> Love it finally found something I can use without allergy issues!&lt;br</li>
            <li> like it enough I&#x27;ve recommended it to people and they are pleased.</li>
            <li> Good spf coverage without all the harsh chemicals the drugstore brands have.</li>
            <li> the smell is mild to me (and I am generally not into strong scents).</li>
            <li> I was breakout free because it is very friendly to sensitive skin - it just felt like a mask the entire time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is rare to find any sunscreen that does not elicit eye burning or be so mild that it is completely ineffective.  </li>
            <li> We both have an extreme sensitivity to the ingredients in many of the popular sunscreens and my husband had a severe rash on his arms recently when her tried another product.  </li>
            <li> It took a week for his skin to clear up enough to even attempt Vanicream and I love it!</li>
            <li> Also, my eyes are SUPER sensitive, but I can put this right up to my eyes w</li>
            <li> really liked the other product that I had been using for years until it was discontinued.</li>
            <li> This would be great for folks with sensitive skin not sure if it worth the price for non-sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I ended up with Vanicream because it&#x27;s broad spectrum SPF 30 (also available in SPF 60), and it&#x27;s noncomedogenic (doesn&#x27;t clog pores).  </li>
            <li> ; when it goes on, I believe, are people not familiar with the nature of this overall type of (safest and most effective) sunscreens made with zinc oxide.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I should have patch tested, and am positive it was not a sensitivity reaction.</li>
            <li> I settled on this brand not merely for the manufacturer&#x27;s quality reputation, but because it really stays on well without being all shiny on my skin.  </li>
            <li> The bottle lasts a long time too, buying more now for the summer.</li>
            <li> Makeup can go over it and it offers full protection for the face.</li>
            <li> For a physical sun block, the cream went on easily which was a plus.</li>
            <li> The Cotz brand is thicker and better for winter dry skin.</li>
            <li> SPF 30 seems strong enough for even a mid-day surf.  </li>
            <li> It is very gentle, non irritating and is very effective.  </li>
            <li> Vanicream is free of several major skin irritants, such as chemical sunscreens, lanolin, dyes, all fragrances (including masking fragrances), parabens, and preservatives...which is a nice bonus.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this at first because I breakout in a rash from all regular drugstore-available sunscreens.</li>
            <li> It is a good sunscreen, but it is hard to rub on to the face.</li>
            <li> It does the job very well</li>
            <li> I have to say I really wanted to like this product, but it made me itch to the point I couldn&#x27;t sleep.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> I spent weeks researching all kinds of healthy sunscreens and I decided to go with this one.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> But highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The Pros: I did not have an allergic reaction, I did not get burned, the product really has no smell.</li>
            <li> She really like the sunscreen because it does not cause problems with her skin.  </li>
            <li> this product was recommended by my dermatologist, I react very severely to sun exposure</li>
            <li> I used to get sores on my forearms from too much sun, until I started using this product.  </li>
            <li> This sunscreen works very well.</li>
            <li> I like this sunscreen very well.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t sink into your skin very well</li>
            <li> I would only recommend this to someone who couldn&#x27;t comfortably use anything else.</li>
            <li> Although I appreciated the products</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> With kids, it&#x27;s a much easier application process.</li>
            <li> NOW THE WHOLE FAMILY IS USING IT.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Now the whole family uses it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> The Vanicream sunblocks work very well on me.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t sweat much, and I was out for about 4 hours.</li>
            <li> But it really saved my skin.</li>
            <li> Vanicream is medical grade, chemical free, physical mineral sunblock free of irritants, etc.</li>
            <li> But I have no problem with it absorbing into skin and disappearing.</li>
            <li> It was very noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I really like this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Be ready for a shiny face.</li>
            <li> Sunscreen absorbs fast and non-greasy.</li>
            <li> Nice texture and feel, but it was not really for sensitive skn, as it made my face feel like a desert and made it flake.</li>
            <li> I tried many physical sunscreen brands, and this is the favor one so far.</li>
            <li> goes on thick and must be rubbed in fairly well</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and this product is the first one I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t irritate.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen doesn&#x27;t stain clothes like many other sunscreens do.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m scraping the bottom and ordering more even though I have 4 other sunblocks.</li>
            <li> A light, transparent formula that provides high sunscreen protection without the use of chemical sunscreens which is a big lie,&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> My 7 months old baby has eczema, and this product works very gentle on her skin.</li>
            <li> When first applied it will feel somewhat more heavy than a normal moisturizer</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin like me, do a patch test first.</li>
            <li> I was in direct sun all day in the hot 95-degree sun.</li>
            <li> Most recently, I have started experiencing severe reactions to sunscreen, but only on my face.  </li>
            <li> I also found that I could not use it on my face without using powder since it makes you look extra shiny once you&#x27;ve been able to get the white streaks out!</li>
            <li> The main ingredient is zinc oxide</li>
            <li> My children with allergies and very sensitive skin have responded very well to Vanicream.  </li>
            <li> my daughter has very sensitive skin and is prone to eczema and this product works very well for her.</li>
            <li> Great for my little one who is allergic to other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I highly recommed it for anyone with roseacia or who is prone to eczema, like me.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this lotion for those with chemical sensitivities.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for babies too.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> my favorite a little expensive but works great</li>
            <li> It has absolutely &amp;#34;no&amp;#34; odor and is truly skin sensitive... and keeps me from getting sunburned.</li>
            <li> It really protects and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin at all.</li>
            <li> Works great, but a bit difficult to get off your face.</li>
            <li> I bought a few chem-free sunscreens from the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s recommended list, and this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Kids were allergic to normal sunscreens so we decided to try this one...</li>
            <li> I get migraines from fragrance and have trouble with the smell of most sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup, so it&#x27;s not a huge deal to me, but I cannot imagine how anyone would be able to apply makeup over this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> i guess i can live with it</li>
            <li> This is my new go-to sunblock.</li>
            <li> I went to a water parker in New Braunsfels Texas.</li>
            <li> This new formulation remains quite chalky.</li>
            <li> I live in the southwest part of the country, where the sun beats down and causes skin to become dry and more prone to sun damage; plus I have many allergies and must be careful about products/ingredients that I use.  </li>
            <li> Works really well, but it easily gets on your clothes/ bathing suit and it&#x27;s super hard to get off not only your suit but also your skin.</li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve listened to the reviews because it does leave a huge white cast on your face when you finally get it all rubbed in.</li>
            <li> would say it is much more fluid than i expected and its just downright sticky.&lt;br /&gt;Though</li>
            <li> My two year old niece also has sensitive skin and is very fair-complected and her dermatologist recommended this one for her.</li>
            <li> Because my face is very sensitive to lotions and sunscreens it was suggested I try Vanicream Sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> This sunscreen was recommend by my dermatologist because I very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist as my skin is very sensitive to sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive and flaky but combination skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and normally develop a rash from sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> , this is the first sunscreen that turned my skin blue.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t burn, but it didn&#x27;t seem to protect much better than any other sunscreen in the same circumstances</li>
            <li> Love the creamy texture, how it makes my skin glow; I use it year round!</li>
            <li> The only thing I wished for was that the SPF was higher than 30.</li>
            <li> it is pretty goopy with a texture similar to Elmers glue.</li>
            <li> once its on it gets very slimy and does not dry easily,but if it works  </li>
            <li> my husband and I own a small nursery (plants) and I work out in the open for 4 months a year.</li>
            <li> My daughter has moderate eczema and pretty sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> My 5 year old has always had very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I also like Neutragena free and clear for babies, but this is much less greasy, so I rate it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a delicate flower and am very sensitive to the chemicals in most sunscreens.</li>
            <li> This is far less taxing sun-wise than most of my activities, and yet, when I came back, I discovered \\&quot;sun socks\\&quot; on my lower legs---they had tanned as though I had on no sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Next to pure zinc</li>
            <li> I liked the lite lotion, but the sunscreen is very thick and makes my skin greasy.</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;m pulling the skin on my face which might actually cause more skin damage than a little sun exposure...</li>
            <li> Simply a product you cannot do without.&lt;br /&gt;Non-irritating, very creamy.</li>
            <li> After my husband and I did a lot of research because I have sensitive skin and rosacea.</li>
            <li> I would like to find the old formula if there is one floating around somewhere...</li>
            <li> I have been allergic to sunscreen (and therefore haven&#x27;t worn any) since I was twelve years old.  </li>
            <li> I have eczema and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My eyes are REALLY sensitive to sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I have developed an allergy to chemical sunscreens, so I tried this.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and sunscreens</li>
            <li> I wore it on my body but it is far too greasy for your face.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000ZJ2842 Vanicream Sunscreen, Sensitive Skin, SPF 30, 4-Ounce&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is completely odorless.</li>
            <li> This works for me, although it does leave your skin a bit white unless you really work it in.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my sensitive skin from burning.  </li>
            <li> but it is truly for sensitive skin and has no odor.</li>
            <li> No breakouts for my highly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Had to learn not to use too much; my face was white from the cream</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, but have no problem using this Vanicream sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I am 37 years old</li>
            <li> This is what I needed as have sensitive skin and if you apply like you would a lotion</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this sunscreen for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It dries completely matte, but it takes awhile.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I really cannot use it and go out in public.  </li>
            <li> I still have some of the old 60SPF sport</li>
            <li> Works wonder for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My two year old doesn&#x27;t react to any if the ingredients.</li>
            <li> For sensitive skin,&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> Recommended by our dermatologist for our daughters sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It was recommended by my dermatologist since I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My 5 kids have sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;My 2 and 7 year old break out in rashes,</li>
            <li> This is a cream supposed to make my skin soft and</li>
            <li> My aesthetician recommended vanicream as I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I just used this for 3 days straight, all day reapplying, and only washing it off at the end of each day.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen does not make my sensitive skin break out.</li>
            <li> one is Cotz brand for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I would suggest this to people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Offers additional protection from UVA rays as well as UVB rays.</li>
            <li> Vanicream Sunscreen SPF30 for Sensitive Skin prevents sunburn and does not irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> works well for sensitive skin people who can not tolerate all the ingredients that many common sun blocks include.</li>
            <li> Methylisozolinone, I suggest you google it if you have broken out in a rash after using any kind of skin care or hair care product containing this - a lot of people are allergic).  </li>
            <li> Some of the other sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried might be fine for a day at the beach, but this one wins as my everyday, under makeup sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other brands and all of them left white residue on my clothing because of the Titanium dioxide and Zinc oxide ingredients that are necessary in any good sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> one feels very safe, I can feel that this will protect my skin from sun light, but I cannot wear them everyday, a little greasy and heavy for me.</li>
            <li> its really important to use daily sun protection but not easy to find a high SPF that works well under makeup.  </li>
            <li> Perfect base for my Bare Minerals make up.</li>
            <li> it is a little on the thick side when applying but outside of that i am happy.</li>
            <li> (normally I have to buy a face sunscreen and then regular).</li>
            <li> After I stopped using Vanicream, it took 2 weeks for my skin to calm down.</li>
            <li> Goes on greasy and white, it&#x27;s extremely hard to rub in and seems to sit on top of the skin.</li>
            <li> A few things I like and dislike:&lt;br /&gt;- Legitimately safe for sensitive skin, unlike other &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> This cream actually creates a new problem - skin rashes.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing for my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Nearly 18 years later, a dermatologist gave me some samples of the Vanicream Sunscreen for Sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Now, this version does not go on skin smoothly, but instead goes on unevenly and when smoothed out still has a white shadow on skin.  </li>
            <li> It works well however it goes on thick, so it&#x27;s not as easy to spread around as Neutrogena, for instance.</li>
            <li> I had a mild breakout after a few days.</li>
            <li> right at Walgreens down the road from my house.</li>
            <li> My child has very sensitive skin, and this is the only product out there that he doesn&#x27;t seem to react to.  </li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Sublime Sun Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 30 on my body</li>
            <li> It is just thick and harder to get on and you have to use more than normal.</li>
            <li> Although applying it can take some time and it does leave a little shine, it is worth it.  </li>
            <li> And, it hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts (generally a sunscreen problem fo me).</li>
            <li> Considering the general price point of the brand, it&#x27;s not a sunscreen I would want to use from head to toe.  </li>
            <li> Considering the general price point of the brand, it&#x27;s not a sunscreen I would want to use from head to toe.  </li>
            <li> It does go on clear and feels very sheer; it&#x27;s not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Some tubes of Sunscreenhas separation problems, clear fluid is expressed instead of sunscreen paste.</li>
            <li> It was definitely easier on my son&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> There are barely 4 full-body applications in one tube of this product, so</li>
            <li> This is the only sunscreen that I have found so far that I&#x27;m not allergic too.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend for those with allergies or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is terrific for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was surprised when I saw the email confirming my order the next morning.  </li>
            <li> So far, they are the only ones that truly, truly don&#x27;t bother my skin in any way.</li>
            <li> Natural sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t make you white!</li>
            <li> One last thing I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It certainly did the job of keeping my face protected and didn&#x27;t make my face break out like other sunscreens</li>
            <li> It is rather thick, seems to rub in better in the summer, my face is so dry in the winter.</li>
            <li> At first my skin didn&#x27;t react that badly (slight redness), but within a couple of weeks my skin was screaming and started itching.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t usually review, but I just want to make sure people are aware of the very possible negative side effects.</li>
            <li> Vanicream Sunscreen, even though the active ingredients are Titanium dioxide and Zinc oxide, does not make my skin look white even when first applied, and it does not transfer visibly to my clothing.  </li>
            <li> Also significant worries about using it on my body as you&#x27;ll notice EVERYTHING you touch with it on your hands ends up with a thick greasy film....</li>
            <li> Of course I wear a hat and big sunglasses and try to stay out of the direct sun as much as possible, too.  </li>
            <li> My facial skin is only sensitive to sunscreens.</li>
            <li> This is the only one I have tried (including multiple products for sensitive skin and or baby skin) that does not give me a rash.  </li>
            <li> However, the product I was using was recently relabeled as &amp;#34;not broad</li>
            <li> this is absolutely not an option for use on my face - it DOES rub in clear (though is white when you first apply and needs rubbing in), but the thick, sticky, greasy texture and SIGNIFICANT sheen left on the face (even after waiting over an hour) require extra time and steps to use oil blotting linens (about 5) and brush on a layer of powder (defeating the purpose of my new facial regimen and avoiding makeup and other skin clogging layers).</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and have tried lots of other sunscreens that are supposed to be for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This new formula leaves a dry, white coating on my skin that does not sink in.....</li>
            <li> It is very thick and does not blend it easily.  </li>
            <li> so I recommend starting with a little and rubbing that in first</li>
            <li> so I recently bough several different brands that are organic or for sensitive skin from the internet (only place I can find sunscreen that does not cause a reaction)</li>
            <li> I have previously used are full of chemicals that break down the sun&#x27;s rays.  </li>
            <li> Some what thick but vanishes when absorbed.  </li>
            <li> After breaking out from numerous other sunscreens, this is the one sunscreen that I have used since my daughter was 6 months old.  </li>
            <li> I love vanicream cream and tried to use their sport version of sun block, but it also was very irritating.</li>
            <li> My daughters have sensitive skin (other sunscreens give them rashes), but don&#x27;t react to this, and it prevents sunburns when they&#x27;re out in the midday sun for a couple hours.</li>
            <li> I am extremely sun sensitive and get itchy bumps if I don&#x27;t use sun block.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely acne prone and sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I did not have any negative reactions from this product and would highly recommend this for others with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Natural active ingredients</li>
            <li> It gets 5 stars because it&#x27;s a normal sunscreen texture and hasn&#x27;t caused my little guy to have an outbreak or get sunburn.</li>
            <li> A little heavy for the face as its white til really absorbed.</li>
            <li> Of course it is thick and must be rubbed in but unlike other sunscreens, it doesn&#x27;t smell super chemically and gross</li>
            <li> I am pale and freckly and I live in Southern California</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that a small amount works very well.</li>
            <li> First of all, I was not looking for a sunscreen - I ordered this late one night after I had taken sleeping medicine.  </li>
            <li> And is long lasting, would recommend this product to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> Lasts long enough for a two or three hour session in the water.  </li>
            <li> I wear sunscreen on my face everyday and normally just use a moisturizer with SPF.  </li>
            <li> It is thick so be aware of this.  </li>
            <li> I bought this sunscreen for my 12 month old son who normally has mild eczema, but gets bad flare ups caused by ingredients in soap, laundry detergent, lotions and sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> which is great; however, it unfortunately goes on EXTREMELY greasy, thick, and sticky.</li>
            <li> But all that changes very quickly if you sweat so 80 minutes is meaningless.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any trouble using regular sensitive skin sun products, so I am going to stick with them.</li>
            <li> It is super thick and only takes a little bit.</li>
            <li> I love the vaniply cream and ointment but the sun screen is very thick and makes my already white face very pale but it works for moisture.</li>
            <li> and I had a hard time getting it back to normal.</li>
            <li> I have about 20 bottles of suncreen in the house because I live in Southern California and spend almost my entire weekends outside, plus at least an hour every other day.</li>
            <li> We tried everything from the cheap stuff to expensive organic creams.  </li>
            <li> and we know that it doesn&#x27;t contain ingredients that can be harmful in the long run.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time,my dermitoligist recomended it</li>
            <li> I recently spent 4 hours on boat, applied the sunscreen only once (spf 60), and didn&#x27;t burn, nor did I have a reaction!  </li>
            <li> It goes a long way, when you rub it in.  </li>
            <li> I never go out in the sun for long</li>
            <li> This product stays on long and dodes not cause a rash.</li>
            <li> Wonder if it is manufacturers processing problem or the sunscrren material sat too long on the shelf</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s absolutely NO smell, he&#x27;s not breaking out and it seems to provide enough sunblock to our Arizona sun!</li>
            <li> At first I found it pretty thick and heavy as compare to my usual sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> As an example, if you normally burn without sunscreen in 30 minutes, proper use of a SPF 15 sunblock would mean you could remain in the sun for 30 min</li>
            <li> It does leave a slight white sheen on my legs if I don&#x27;t rub it in well enough.</li>
            <li> After rubbing it in thoroughly there is still a little white especially on my chin.</li>
            <li> I found this to be greasier than other similar products.</li>
            <li> Unlike other sunscreens, this one doesn&#x27;t leave white residue on my skin.  </li>
            <li> ;  The ingredients will turn the skin white,  A little rubbing of some facial/hand cream with it will help diminish the white.  </li>
            <li> After I&#x27;ve applied the product and it dries to a matte look, my face is still greasy to the touch for a very, very long time (like, 2 hours).</li>
            <li> The Biore doesn&#x27;t dry me out.  </li>
            <li> I had lots of expectation, because I really want to wear sunscreen everyday without feeling heavy on my face.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> My baby is an &amp;#34;eczema baby&amp;#34; so we are extremely limited in what we can put on his skin.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t imagine my clothes would be any different but not worth the risk of ruining them.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to blend in - most times</li>
            <li> Since it is winter, and not much is needed, except on face, neck and hands, I haven&#x27;t minded, but when summer rolls around, it will take a long time to get it all blended in on arms and legs, as well.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, especially on the face.</li>
            <li> I mix my bronzer with it to counter the slight white tint it leaves.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update now my skin hates this stuff, not sure what happened but in breaking out in places I never had before, the amount of rubbing feels more damaging to my skin and counter productive to using sunscreen to prevent premature aging, and I can&#x27;t for the life of me get this off daily its white and impossible to remove without tugging</li>
            <li> However, despite what appeared to be complete skin coverage, my son burned in a few spots even though he was in the sun for just an hour and a half.</li>
            <li> Others described it as not being thick but in my opinion, it&#x27;s super thick.</li>
            <li> It does have a slight white tint that mostly goes away if you keep rubbing, but for a zinc sunscreen, it&#x27;s not as bad as others that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Have tried the other companie&#x27;s usual sensitive skin products with no luck..  </li>
            <li> This has a little white in it that has to be rubbed in to get rid of it.  </li>
            <li> It is very thick, however, and hard to smooth on.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I did not notice this has only an SPF30 rating.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I rubbed on the Vanicream and my dark skin turned dark blue.  </li>
            <li> One of a few that actually blocks the harmful rays of the sun with Titanium Dioxide (3%), Zinc Oxide (6%).  </li>
            <li> Only used once on my 2 yr old who has crazy sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s even harder to spread than the SPF 50</li>
            <li> Be careful...</li>
            <li> Goes on thick, but completely absorbs into skin.  </li>
            <li> Just a bit thick, but does the trick for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It just makes my skin sooo dry!!</li>
            <li> This product delivers plain and simple.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s enough coverage.</li>
            <li> , it goes on easier than the other chem-free sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried, and it doesn&#x27;t burn my skin.  </li>
            <li> These &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; mineral based sunscreens are not safe in the sun, especially the UVB protection.  </li>
            <li> Vanicream protects against sunburn without the allergic reactions I have had from other sunblocks.  </li>
            <li> I have a couple of kids who cannot wear ANY other sunscreen b/c</li>
            <li> Have allergies to the chemicals in other broad-spectrum sun blocks/lotions.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cause itching like other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena all my life because of allergic responses to other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Works on my 3yo son who started having allergic reactions on his face to other &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; skin sunscreens like Neutrogena/Coppertone Baby.</li>
            <li> I should have paid attention to the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> I USE ALL THE VANICREAM PRODUCT LINE DUE TO MCS.</li>
            <li> With Vanicream,I had no reaction (with other sunscreens, my skin would feel on fire or I would break out in hives).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for four years now - will not put any other sunscreen on my kids, one of which is a redhead.  </li>
            <li> and  I am allergic to other lotions and sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I have tried other baby sun block lotions but the excema flares up with them.</li>
            <li> There are other zinc oxide sunscreens that don&#x27;t leave me looking like Violet Beauregarde.</li>
            <li> Needed a product to help protect against the sun other products cause side effects.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cause my face to swell up like every other product did, I can go in the sun, and stay without burn for hours.  </li>
            <li> My dauhter has eczema and she does not use any other product.</li>
            <li> For some reason, I break out with every other &amp;#34;hypoallergenic&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Little expensive, but worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Active Ingredients: titanium dioxide 3.4%, zinc oxide</li>
            <li> This is truly one of the only non irritating facial sunscreens i have found.</li>
            <li> My son has sensitive skin (couldn&#x27;t even use baby wipes when he was younger as his poor little bum would break out with little read bumps after even one use).</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, a very concerned older lady accosted me after my swim to express concern that I looked very cold</li>
            <li> my face broke out had  a lot of hard red bumps all over face</li>
            <li> It is expensive but very high quality.  </li>
            <li> He complains about having to rub it in so long, lazy bum.</li>
            <li> Vanicream re-vamped their sunscreens late last year (2013).</li>
            <li> I have been testing out a bunch of zinc oxide sunscreens the past few weeks because I am suddenly allergic to the mainstream sunscreens I used to use (</li>
            <li> The only complaint is that it has the consistency of mud.  </li>
            <li> I thought this product was too thick and present on my skin.</li>
            <li> Plus, because the ingredients in the &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; lotion are comparable to Cetaphil or CeraVe cream, I don&#x27;t have to worry about &#x27;natural ingredients&#x27; irritating the heck out of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I ended up using this on half my face and Shisiedo on the other half, convinced that it&#x27;d look greasy by the afternoon, but no.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen is a little hard to push though, the only down side to the product.</li>
            <li> I had read a few bad reviews that also warned of sunburn, but I tried it since Vanicream&#x27;s lotion is the only lotion sensitive enough for my eczema ridden skin.</li>
            <li> On Amazon, however, it was nearly half that price, and with my Prime membership, shipped</li>
            <li> and it was a greasy mess on my face.  </li>
            <li> When i emailed them about the 30+ they said i ordered that, which is not true because i can get the 30</li>
            <li> I wish it were a little less viscous.</li>
            <li> After the first day we couldn&#x27;t apply any lotions to his skin because it hurt so badly that we spent the rest of the weekend inside.</li>
            <li> Not only was this product way too thick, but it left a white cast, no matter how much I rubbed, and the transfer was terrible.</li>
            <li> Like this less heavy than 50.</li>
            <li> I do not like to be without this product; I place one, one and a half pea sized drops on my palm, wait a few seconds for drops to melt and continue to spread across my face, and repeat the procedure for my neck and decollete areas.</li>
            <li> Once rubbed in, it does leave a little bit of a shine to my skin - it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, just shines.</li>
            <li> Broke out in little water blisters, and no one could figure it out....</li>
            <li> Prevents burns, does not cause breakouts, feels like it moisturizes a little bit--I&#x27;m into it.</li>
            <li> I am grateful that this product exists so I can take my little redhead into the pool without worrying about sunburn.  </li>
            <li> Hmm... I&#x27;m a little puzzled.</li>
            <li> Just use a little bit and rub it in well or you will see it all over</li>
            <li> Goes on a little thick (not too bad), and rubs in easily.</li>
            <li> This is very thick and makes my skin appear a little white</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to rub in enough so that my face doesn&#x27;t look a couple of shades lighter, and because it&#x27;s hard to rub in</li>
            <li> Terribly messy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Aveeno or Neutragena, both feel a bit heavy on my face and sometimes burn my skin.  </li>
            <li> They look very similar, thus I got confused.</li>
            <li> Useless compared to the old version of vanicream.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday under my makeup.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended Vanicream sunscreen a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to use as an everyday face lotion.</li>
            <li> The cream does not leave your face feeling heavy,  cakey or shiny.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I have been using Vanicream sunscreen for a few years.  </li>
            <li> but, after leaving it on a few minutes, I can apply makeup over it with no problems.  </li>
            <li> I wear everyday.</li>
            <li> As an aesthetian, I prefer the zinc/ titanium dioxide combo-but  this left me way too  pale and also blended poorly with my Channal makeup...</li>
            <li> It dried my skin out terribly, just like most other sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other expensive brands but always come back to Vanicream.</li>
            <li> and if I didn&#x27;t like it, I could just use it as a body sunscreen along with all the other failed facial sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> it is a little greasy feeling so apply a small dab and adjust as needed.</li>
            <li> What a mess!</li>
            <li> While in Mexico over a long weekend he had a bad reaction to a Banana Boat broad spectrum product.</li>
            <li> Given enough time, it soaks in a little, but it is difficult to wear it under makeup.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little thick and heavy to put on</li>
            <li> It is rather thick, and rubbing it into my skin takes a little time.  </li>
            <li> This sunscreen is a little thick</li>
            <li> It is a little difficult to rub in, but I found that minor compared to the burning and itching.  </li>
            <li> I want to use sunscreen (I am prone to getting sunburns), but I&#x27;ve had many terrible experiences.</li>
            <li> I put on my face around 8 am, and by 2 pm, my face was covered with small bumps.</li>
            <li> Small price to pay.  </li>
            <li> it was thick and seemed greasy, but it blends well and after a few minutes the result is a dewey look.</li>
            <li> I do use this twice a day in the summer as my days are usually from 6am to 6pm in the summer outdoors.</li>
            <li> but I just can&#x27;t because it leaves my skin such a weird color.</li>
            <li> I have been using the sunscreen for a couple weeks now and no more itching after being in the sun.  </li>
            <li> I usually mix with a lotion for my body.  </li>
            <li> This is a small trade off for not breaking out</li>
            <li> only complaint is that it is thick and somewhat difficult to apply evenly, but it works and our skin has no adverse reaction.</li>
            <li> Was less irritating to my baby&#x27;s eyes</li>
            <li> It was hard to find, and it was over $20 a bottle.  </li>
            <li> I have been told the apothecary can mix a cream for you, if your doctor prescribes it, but that seems like hard work.</li>
            <li> Hard to rub into skin.  </li>
            <li> It has no sunflower oil, which is hard to find.  </li>
            <li> Not greasy or hard to apply.  </li>
            <li> The sport version does absorb all the way and looks matte, or at least not shiny.&lt;br</li>
            <li> At least some of it also comes off when you sweat</li>
            <li> but is thick and needs to be worked in well.</li>
            <li> The texture is thick--</li>
            <li> It is thick but works well.</li>
            <li> The problem with Vanicream is that if you&#x27;ve never used their cream, you are going to find that it is quite thick and will make you look quite chalky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and chalky.</li>
            <li> Too thick.  </li>
            <li> Too Thick and Goopy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, stays on well, and you don&#x27;t have to reapply every 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands of sunscreen, some quite expensive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed and guess I developed a sensitivity to it.</li>
            <li> but I had a serious problem.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to find a sunprotector of this standard in Sweden today.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That is shocking amount of chemicals to be applied on any human&#x27;s skin especially when it has the TO toxin which causes rash.</li>
            <li> It is a little bit greasy and difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> This is a sticky, hard to remove product that is especially uncomfortable on the face and in hot weather.</li>
            <li> One click Amazon shopping and sleeping medicine is a potential bad combo.  </li>
            <li> I do recommend but to people who don&#x27;t mind how thick this sunscreen is!</li>
            <li> found it very hard to apply,very pasty.</li>
            <li> My skin is very hard to taking care of.  </li>
            <li> Overall not worth the risk of clogged/smothered pores and horrible oil-slicked appearance.</li>
            <li> Very thick</li>
            <li> she has broken out in photodermatitis.</li>
            <li> It makes sense that their 30spf  fares even worse.  </li>
            <li> You have to massage it in, but that doesn&#x27;t make your face feel worse.  </li>
            <li> It was worse than when I don&#x27;t use sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s a bad sunscreen other than the way it looks on me; but, I won&#x27;t be using this again.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t try to take it off (it&#x27;s a heavy oily base, so hard to remove).  </li>
            <li> I gave it a 5 rating because it is very thick and difficult to rub into the skin.  </li>
            <li> Vanicream reformulated this sunscreen for SPF 30 for sensitive skin and it&#x27;s awful.  </li>
            <li> I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, or hard-to-find.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t think of putting this on my face as it&#x27;s a greasy nasty paste that would make me break out instantly.</li>
            <li> It is expensive and it will not protect you or your children</li>
            <li> I use to have a terrible reaction after being in the sun with other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of rashes that make me itch like crazy and this leads to scars because I can&#x27;t help but</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m once again afraid to use sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was in the mid-70s, but it wasn&#x27;t that cold in the water.  </li>
            <li> It is very difficult to apply.  </li>
            <li> they get a BAD allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li> Too bad it tends to be greasy.</li>
            <li> product is worthless, stay away at all costs.</li>
            <li> but in a not-so-natural base.  </li>
            <li> (i&#x27;ve had a lot of bad experiences with that!).  </li>
            <li> Was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> This was awful.  </li>
            <li> It is just awful.  </li>
            <li> My daughter  gets terrible rashes from sunscreen.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This sunscreen doesn&#x27;t stain clothes like many other sunscreens do. It does the job very well and we know that it doesn&#x27;t contain ingredients that can be harmful in the long run.</li>
            <li> Vanicream is the only sunscreen I have found that I can apply daily without having it aggravate my rosacea.  Goes on white but blends in well.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this. It is just thick and harder to get on and you have to use more than normal. But I do love it and I use it on my face and body (normally I have to buy a face sunscreen and then regular). I do recommend but to people who don&#x27;t mind how thick this sunscreen is!</li>
            <li> My oldest son all of a sudden became allergic to suncreen! I bought all of the top name brands for sensative skin and he still broke out in a rash/hives. He works out in the sun all day and had to have something that worked and Vanicream is the BEST! Stays on good, no irritation at all. You need to reaply as you need to. Would highly tell you to try this- you will love it.</li>
            <li> This was awful.  I looked like I&#x27;d put vaseline all over my face.  Terribly messy.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend at all.  Should have returned it.</li>
            <li> First off, this stuff is thick as peanut butter, best of luck spreading it around your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, it doesn&#x27;t work at all.  After applying, I sat on the beach on a cloudy day for 2 hours.  Later that day I was lobster red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is worthless, stay away at all costs.</li>
            <li> Simply a product you cannot do without.&lt;br /&gt;Non-irritating, very creamy. Great protection&lt;br /&gt;At an affordable price.  My sensitive skin is happy!</li>
            <li> This does the trick, and relies largely on zinc (good) but it&#x27;s still greasy, and still just SPF 30.  I wish they made a higher SPF!</li>
            <li> I like this sunscreen because it doesn&#x27;t leave a white tint to the skin. It goes on smooth and keep the skin moist. Not sure if it&#x27;s enough coverage. I still get tan with this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time,my dermitoligist recomended it and I love it,I wont use any thing else.</li>
            <li> It works well however it goes on thick, so it&#x27;s not as easy to spread around as Neutrogena, for instance.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my wife to use (replacing another product) and she will provide the review below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked the other product that I had been using for years until it was discontinued. My dermatologist recommended this product as a replacement. After my husband and I did a lot of research because I have sensitive skin and rosacea. This is my second tube and it is working okay but is thick and needs to be worked in well. After rubbing it in thoroughly there is still a little white especially on my chin. Overall I do like it.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and have struggled with beauty products my entire life.  Most recently, I have started experiencing severe reactions to sunscreen, but only on my face.  My allergist recommended that I purchase Vanicream sunscreen, so off to the pharmacy I went.  It was hard to find, and it was over $20 a bottle.  On Amazon, however, it was nearly half that price, and with my Prime membership, shipped free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is incredible, but does have some drawbacks.  It is rather thick, and rubbing it into my skin takes a little time.  Once rubbed in, it does leave a little bit of a shine to my skin - it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, just shines. Although applying it can take some time and it does leave a little shine, it is worth it.  I have not had a reaction at all this summer!</li>
            <li> This is the best chemical-free sunscreen I have found. I&#x27;ve tried many, many physical sunscreens that are chemical-free, but this is the one I stick with. Yes, it&#x27;s stickier and whiter than chemical sunscreens, but once it soaks in, it&#x27;s perfect (and worth it!). The sun protection is also very good. Overall, this is a GREAT sunscreen. Don&#x27;t hesitate to get it!</li>
            <li> This sun block is highly recommended by EWG as safe.  It is very thick and does not blend it easily.  I found another that is just as effective and safe and goes on smoother because it contains olive oil.</li>
            <li> Vanicream reformulated this sunscreen for SPF 30 for sensitive skin and it&#x27;s awful.  This sunscreen was recommended to me by a dermatologist which was so great for people with sensitive skin.  It made my skin look healthy, hydrated, and was odorless.  I have been using his product for 7 years and really liked it.  I have no idea why they changed the ingredients.  This new formula leaves a dry, white coating on my skin that does not sink in.....it stays on the surface of my skin all day and makes me look like a ghost.  It has a metallic odor to boot.  It is just awful.  I don&#x27;t know why they made this change.  I am not a lifeguard working at the beach.  I only use this for my facial skin and do not spend a lot of time in the sun or go to the beach swimming.  All In need is something for regular sun protection.  I would like to find the old formula if there is one floating around somewhere...otherwise I have to start looking for another sunscreen.  On top of the container box the number NDC 45334-333-04 appears for the old formula.  The new formula has NDC 4534-353-04 printed on top of the container.</li>
            <li> Great for my little one who is allergic to other sunscreens. Great product</li>
            <li> I have been allergic to sunscreen (and therefore haven&#x27;t worn any) since I was twelve years old.  Can&#x27;t even use makeup, chapstick, etc with it in it.  Broke out in little water blisters, and no one could figure it out....so I&#x27;ve just gone without.  Nearly 18 years later, a dermatologist gave me some samples of the Vanicream Sunscreen for Sensitive skin.  Eureka!  I have never written a review on Amazon, but I have to say this product is amazing for me and hopefully for anyone with a similar issue.  I recently spent 4 hours on boat, applied the sunscreen only once (spf 60), and didn&#x27;t burn, nor did I have a reaction!  This was the true test! I would never have been able to enjoy an event like that in a bathing suit without worrying about getting burnt, and it&#x27;s a good thing because I was in a wedding 2 days later!</li>
            <li> Has a good consistency, needs to be rubbed in well, but that is not a big deal to me.  Good spf coverage without all the harsh chemicals the drugstore brands have.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this sunscreen works great. It does have a slight white tint that mostly goes away if you keep rubbing, but for a zinc sunscreen, it&#x27;s not as bad as others that I&#x27;ve tried.  I have not had any skin reaction it and it works great all day.</li>
            <li> I bought a few chem-free sunscreens from the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s recommended list, and this is my favorite.  I&#x27;ve been using Aveeno or Neutragena, both feel a bit heavy on my face and sometimes burn my skin.  I like the Vanicream, it goes on easier than the other chem-free sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried, and it doesn&#x27;t burn my skin.  It feels like applying a moisturizer, and I can blot up any oily feeling with a bit of face powder.  It doesn&#x27;t feel any heavier on my face than Aveeno or Neutragena, and there&#x27;s no weird fragrance.  Some of the other sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried might be fine for a day at the beach, but this one wins as my everyday, under makeup sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I want to use sunscreen (I am prone to getting sunburns), but I&#x27;ve had many terrible experiences. I have eczema and sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve been through thousands of sunscreens and nothing has worked. I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of rashes that make me itch like crazy and this leads to scars because I can&#x27;t help but scratch (a lot). So when I came by Vanicream, which a lot of people were raving about, I decided to give it a try. I have to say I really wanted to like this product, but it made me itch to the point I couldn&#x27;t sleep. At first my skin didn&#x27;t react that badly (slight redness), but within a couple of weeks my skin was screaming and started itching. After I stopped using Vanicream, it took 2 weeks for my skin to calm down. Now I&#x27;m once again afraid to use sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vanicream gets 3 stars because I&#x27;ve given the sunscreen to my sister and she likes it. The smell is strong (I can tell when she wears it), but you get use to it after awhile. She also has to pat her skin after she puts it on because it leaves white shiny streaks on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite everything, it is a nice sunscreen. Just wish it worked for me.</li>
            <li> My eyes are REALLY sensitive to sunscreen.  I&#x27;ve tried so many \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; sunscreen products but to no avail.  Itching, burning, stinging, ahhhh!  But then I tried Vanicream.  This stuff is very moisturizing-a bit too much for acne break out areas of the face but great for the eyes and body.  I use it on my eyes every day. And when I go to the beach I cover my body with it and, even though I go in the ocean, there&#x27;s no sunburn.  I know it&#x27;s not supposed to be water proof but it seems to stay on.  I am pale and freckly and I live in Southern California so I am very experienced with sunscreens.  Also, my husband has a photosensitive allergic reaction to most sunscreens (think of the allergic reaction in \\&quot;Hitch\\&quot; and that&#x27;s my husband after a day of hiking-yikes!) but he has had no reaction to Vanicream.  He complains about having to rub it in so long, lazy bum. (;&lt;br /&gt; I give this stuff 5 stars!</li>
            <li> This is a very good sunscreen goes on easy and clear. And is long lasting, would recommend this product to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> Check Consumer Reports on this one. These &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; mineral based sunscreens are not safe in the sun, especially the UVB protection.  And my dermatologist introduced me to it with a free sample. Yikes!  I&#x27;ll have to educate him about it next time.</li>
            <li> I did not have any negative reactions from this product and would highly recommend this for others with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My go-to sunscreen for my face. Prevents burns, does not cause breakouts, feels like it moisturizes a little bit--I&#x27;m into it.</li>
            <li> Because my face is very sensitive to lotions and sunscreens it was suggested I try Vanicream Sunscreen.  I was hesitant at first because everything including items that are for &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; always cause an adverse reaction on my face. However, I used the Vanicream and my face did not break out in a rash!  Finally, I can have sunscreen protection on my face.</li>
            <li> I have developed an allergy to chemical sunscreens, so I tried this.  It does not cause me to get red and puffy and itchy, but it is a bit sticky.  Given enough time, it soaks in a little, but it is difficult to wear it under makeup.  It does keep me from burning if I&#x27;m out in the sun, so I guess that&#x27;s the most important thing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of products and, altho recommended by my dermatologist, none have worked with NO irritation like this one does.Many have the preferred zinc/titanium dioxide but are so greasy that they aggravate my roseacia acne. I love vanicream cream and tried to use their sport version of sun block, but it also was very irritating. Not this. I highly recommed it for anyone with roseacia or who is prone to eczema, like me. The great thing about these ingredients is that they are effective immediately.  I also like Neutragena free and clear for babies, but this is much less greasy, so I rate it number one!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this sunblock.  One of a few that actually blocks the harmful rays of the sun with Titanium Dioxide (3%), Zinc Oxide (6%).  It has almost no smell and blends/disappears easily.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Vanicream protects against sunburn without the allergic reactions I have had from other sunblocks.  My allergist suggested I try it.  His advice was wise.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Vanicream SPF 30 Sunscreen for quite a while now.  Living in Texas, good sun protection is a year-round &amp;#34;must&amp;#34; for extended driving and outdoor activities.  I settled on this brand not merely for the manufacturer&#x27;s quality reputation, but because it really stays on well without being all shiny on my skin.  Most important of all, though, Vanicream does not cause tears when applied close to the eyes (i&#x27;ve had a lot of bad experiences with that!).  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Love my vanicream moisturizers! This one isn&#x27;t as smooth as the others and doesn&#x27;t rub in as easy as the light lotion but it&#x27;s a small price to pay for a great, gentle moisturizer with sunblock. Stays on through sweaty tennis matches.</li>
            <li> perfect product if you want to avoid fragrance and parabens</li>
            <li> It is a good sunscreen, but it is hard to rub on to the face. It is rather thick, seems to rub in better in the summer, my face is so dry in the winter. I had a pre-cancer on my nose, so my skin docter recommended this cream for my face.</li>
            <li> I would rate higher but I had a serious problem. I&#x27;m allergic to regular sunscreen I can&#x27;t have all the fragrance and stuff. I used this stuff Saturday and Sunday afternoon when I got up I had rashes all over my arms. This isn&#x27;t a good product if you&#x27;re allergic to sunscreen as I am. I&#x27;m sure it has worked for others but it totally backfired on my end.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a scar I got on my face. I looked real hard for the right kind of sunscreen for scars that can&#x27;t be in the sun, which i think is all of them lol. This product offers all the ingredients you need to keep your scar safe and It pretty much does everything it says.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great product scar or no scar! It&#x27;s a perfect sunscreen!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like this stuff. I spent weeks researching all kinds of healthy sunscreens and I decided to go with this one. Others described it as not being thick but in my opinion, it&#x27;s super thick. It&#x27;s hard to rub in enough so that my face doesn&#x27;t look a couple of shades lighter, and because it&#x27;s hard to rub in I feel like I&#x27;m pulling the skin on my face which might actually cause more skin damage than a little sun exposure...</li>
            <li> I put on my face around 8 am, and by 2 pm, my face was covered with small bumps. It is my fault that I didn&#x27;t tried on a small area first. If you have sensitive skin like me, do a patch test first.</li>
            <li> My daughters have sensitive skin (other sunscreens give them rashes), but don&#x27;t react to this, and it prevents sunburns when they&#x27;re out in the midday sun for a couple hours.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is th best that I have ever used. I have very fair skin and went to an all-day car show last weekend. I was in direct sun all day in the hot 95-degree sun. When I came home, I did not have even a trace of sunburn. The Vanicream did not feel greasy and did not stain my clothing. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have eczema and my face is incredibly sun sensitive. I purchased this sunscreen based on Amazon Reviews because I was determined I was not going to have my face blow up on a recent trip to Florida. Of course I wear a hat and big sunglasses and try to stay out of the direct sun as much as possible, too.  This sunscreen was great. It is super thick and only takes a little bit. If you get too much you&#x27;ll be looking like Casper the Friendly Ghost.  It certainly did the job of keeping my face protected and didn&#x27;t make my face break out like other sunscreens tend to do. Great stuff!!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and sunscreens I have previously used are full of chemicals that break down the sun&#x27;s rays.  I decided to try Vanicream because it has zinc oxide and titanium dioxide that serve to deflect the rays and it works much better and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> used in mayo clinic for cancer patients.  one of the best affordable spfs you can buy</li>
            <li> Bought this after trying a sample of it from my dermatologist.  Nice to be major chemical free, and it does eventually absorb, so you lose the &#x27;ghost face&#x27; effect.  I use it only for my face, as I use a different sunscreen for my body.  But highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have a couple of kids who cannot wear ANY other sunscreen b/c they get a BAD allergic reaction.  They can wear this with no reaction!</li>
            <li> I am allergic to regular store bought sunscreen so I recently bough several different brands that are organic or for sensitive skin from the internet (only place I can find sunscreen that does not cause a reaction) As for this product-  The Pros: I did not have an allergic reaction, I did not get burned, the product really has no smell. My aunt is a dermatologist and recommends this sunscreen.  Cons- I found this to be greasier than other similar products. I wore it on my body but it is far too greasy for your face.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000ZJ2842 Vanicream Sunscreen, Sensitive Skin, SPF 30, 4-Ounce&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband and I have been using this sunscreen for about a year.  We both have an extreme sensitivity to the ingredients in many of the popular sunscreens and my husband had a severe rash on his arms recently when her tried another product.  We are sold on Vanicream which was recommended by our dermatologist.  The dermatologist told him he should never use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it is thick and somewhat difficult to apply evenly, but it works and our skin has no adverse reaction.</li>
            <li> Went to two dermatologists and both recommended it! Guess it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this review because I wanted to share info wish I knew before I purchased this product. I was debating between this formula and the Vanicream 35 SPF Sport. The non-sport formula left my skin a bit shiny looking. It did not totally absorb. It&#x27;s not awful, just not what I&#x27;m going for. The sport version does absorb all the way and looks matte, or at least not shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For both the Sport and regular the smell is mild to me (and I am generally not into strong scents). The texture is thick-- you do have to pick an area of the face, apply, go to the next area. I don&#x27;t love that this takes longer, but it&#x27;s worth it for a gentle effective sunscreen. And, it hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts (generally a sunscreen problem fo me).</li>
            <li> My baby is an &amp;#34;eczema baby&amp;#34; so we are extremely limited in what we can put on his skin. I am grateful that this product exists so I can take my little redhead into the pool without worrying about sunburn.  It gets 5 stars because it&#x27;s a normal sunscreen texture and hasn&#x27;t caused my little guy to have an outbreak or get sunburn.</li>
            <li> Not only was this product way too thick, but it left a white cast, no matter how much I rubbed, and the transfer was terrible. I got Vanicream on every surface I touched for the entire day.</li>
            <li> I like this. I&#x27;m confident in the product&#x27;s effectiveness. It is completely odorless.</li>
            <li> Great product!! The only sunscreen that my kids can use that doesn&#x27;t irritate there skin. Love that it&#x27;s as close to natural as you can get. Very thick so I recommend starting with a little and rubbing that in first</li>
            <li> Have allergies to the chemicals in other broad-spectrum sun blocks/lotions.  This works for me, although it does leave your skin a bit white unless you really work it in.  Small price to pay.  I used to use the SPF 50, but they changed the formulary and I didn&#x27;t like it at all, so I&#x27;m sticking with the SPF 30.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this every day (or tells me he does!) Clean with no annoying coconut odor.</li>
            <li> My child has very sensitive skin, and this is the only product out there that he doesn&#x27;t seem to react to.  Have tried the other companie&#x27;s usual sensitive skin products with no luck..  I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, or hard-to-find.</li>
            <li> Vanicream not only blocks the sun but once it soaks into your skin it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  In hot weather it might feel sticky for a while but I have found it to last all day and I could swear it last into the next.  I am extremely sun sensitive and get itchy bumps if I don&#x27;t use sun block.  With use of Vanicream I am now itch free and bump free.  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love Vanicream Sunscreen.  It goes a long way, when you rub it in.  It keeps my sensitive skin from burning.  I use the 30 SPF for my body.  This sunscreen has no scent, and it doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes.</li>
            <li> Tried this sunscreen and then my wife started using it! She really like the sunscreen because it does not cause problems with her skin.  It is thick but works well.</li>
            <li> My kids claim that some brands of sunscreen sting their scrapes and cuts. They say this one is fine, and wont pull away when i apply it. I chose it for a good rating on the EWG website.  Happy with it and will buy again.</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen!  works great and doesn&#x27;t irritate my toddler&#x27;s horrendous eczema.  Works just as well or better as the California Baby brand I paid twice as much for.  This is my #1 pick for sunscreen.</li>
            <li> works well for sensitive skin people who can not tolerate all the ingredients that many common sun blocks include. it is a little on the thick side when applying but outside of that i am happy.</li>
            <li> found it very hard to apply,very pasty. had to use alot because it dosen&#x27;t spread easily .also once its on it gets very slimy and does not dry easily,but if it works  i guess i can live with it</li>
            <li> This is very thick and makes my skin appear a little white but it is truly for sensitive skin and has no odor.</li>
            <li> Do it buy from Amazon. Mines looked used when I got it in the mail. Yuck!! Then my husband mistakenly used iron my daughter and it burned her eyes big time!!! Do not buy!</li>
            <li> I was using Shisiedo, which I love but at $38 for about 1/3 the product! Oh, and I&#x27;ve tried plenty (bc sunblock/skincare research is a hobby of mine). At first glance I thought this was a return bc it was thick and seemed greasy, but it blends well and after a few minutes the result is a dewey look. I ended up using this on half my face and Shisiedo on the other half, convinced that it&#x27;d look greasy by the afternoon, but no. I did this for weeks expecting clogged pores, better looking skin w the expensive product, no difference. Also, my eyes are SUPER sensitive, but I can put this right up to my eyes w no stinging! I&#x27;ve even used it on my lips. Now I&#x27;m scraping the bottom and ordering more even though I have 4 other sunblocks. This is my new go-to sunblock.</li>
            <li> my face broke out had  a lot of hard red bumps all over face</li>
            <li> Great price for great product if you want heavy protection.</li>
            <li> Was less irritating to my baby&#x27;s eyes but I put it on my chest and for some reason got fried. Luckily the baby didn&#x27;t get burned but I&#x27;ll be super cautious for awhile until I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s effective for his delicate skin.</li>
            <li> Best cosmetic line on the market!</li>
            <li> Excellent product!! I have never used a Vanicream product that I didn&#x27;t like.  This product is effective and very gentle on the face!! I will purchade again.</li>
            <li> this product was recommended by my dermatologist, I react very severely to sun exposure and I work out doors all day every day. I do use this twice a day in the summer as my days are usually from 6am to 6pm in the summer outdoors. my husband and I own a small nursery (plants) and I work out in the open for 4 months a year. I used to get sores on my forearms from too much sun, until I started using this product.  product is exactly what it says it is and works exactly as it is suppose to.</li>
            <li> This is not as good as a similar product by Vanicream that I meant to buy which is Vanicream sport 35. They look very similar, thus I got confused. This cream doesn&#x27;t blend in as well and doesn&#x27;t seem to make my skin as happy as the other cream. I had a mild breakout after a few days.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen works very well. Goes on thick, but completely absorbs into skin.  Moisturizers your skin as an added bonus.  We have used it for over a year and haven&#x27;t had a sunburn yet.  Highly recommend!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I went to a water parker in New Braunsfels Texas. It worked perfectly. No breakouts for my highly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> first found this a Mayo Clinic.. it is the best sun screen...use in the boat and on my morning walk...</li>
            <li> Came in on time. Product as describe.  Love the cream.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cause itching like other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Good quality and my dermatologist recommended it.  Nice and smooth especially if you moisturize first otherwise the zinc tends to bead up on the skin.  Better on the skin than micro-zinc IN the skin-yuck!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen goes on smooth and stays on.  We spend alot of time on the water either fishing or boating to enjoy the day.  Living in the sunshine 365 days a year this is our only sunscreen that we use. Easy to apply, easy to pack and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Only used once on my 2 yr old who has crazy sensitive skin. No sunburn or reaction. Love that it has no harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I have used it regularly for a couple of weeks now.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is great for sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena all my life because of allergic responses to other sunscreens. The problem with Vanicream is that if you&#x27;ve never used their cream, you are going to find that it is quite thick and will make you look quite chalky. I also found that I could not use it on my face without using powder since it makes you look extra shiny once you&#x27;ve been able to get the white streaks out!</li>
            <li> Next to pure zinc this is lighter and much more spreadable.  It is rare to find any sunscreen that does not elicit eye burning or be so mild that it is completely ineffective.  I also like the fact that a small amount works very well.</li>
            <li> great product. does not irritate skin. goes on thick and must be rubbed in fairly well but i do not mind that. does not remain greasy.</li>
            <li> Thrilled to find a sunscreen for my very sensitive skin.  No pimples, no skin redness. Hurray!  Had to learn not to use too much; my face was white from the cream and I had a hard time getting it back to normal. So I now use less and it is great!!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, but have no problem using this Vanicream sunscreen.  It has no scent, which I prefer.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> NO stains on clothes and easy to apply! After extensive searching for a sunscreen that does not stain clothes, I found reviews on this product.  We live in a city and have well water which makes a Huge difference in the products we can and can not use.  My husband and I apply this on a daily basis and found putting some in our hands warms the lotion.  So it is very easy to appy and blends into the skin on contact.  Will reorder another tube for friends and family who come to visit us in Florida. Also this also had very quick shipping.</li>
            <li> We are bought is three times now....Kids were allergic to normal sunscreens so we decided to try this one...works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still searching for the perfect sunscreen but this one is awful. It&#x27;s thick and chalky. Goes on greasy and white, it&#x27;s extremely hard to rub in and seems to sit on top of the skin. I wouldn&#x27;t think of putting this on my face as it&#x27;s a greasy nasty paste that would make me break out instantly.</li>
            <li> I bought this sunscreen for my 12 month old son who normally has mild eczema, but gets bad flare ups caused by ingredients in soap, laundry detergent, lotions and sunscreens.  This sunscreen has worked perfectly!  All &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; sunscreens that are sold at department stores have caused my son to instantly get red rashes and he cries and cries from a burning sensation.  But Vanicream was gentle and he did not break out at all!  And he did not even tan with this sunscreen on!  Which is exactly what I wanted!  I also purchased the Vanicream lotion for after his baths and throughout the day, and that has worked wonders on his skin!  I am so happy to have found this on amazon.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I thought this product was too thick and present on my skin. I prefer lighter skin creams. As far as sun protection I have no real way to gage its usefulness.</li>
            <li> This is a sticky, hard to remove product that is especially uncomfortable on the face and in hot weather. Caveat emptor.</li>
            <li> I had lots of expectation, because I really want to wear sunscreen everyday without feeling heavy on my face.&lt;br /&gt;This one feels very safe, I can feel that this will protect my skin from sun light, but I cannot wear them everyday, a little greasy and heavy for me. But you need to consider this. I am 37 years old and I have never worn any cream on my face up until 3 months ago. I guess I am not a standard person to give objective feedback.</li>
            <li> One of the best sunscreens out there. Makeup can go over it and it offers full protection for the face. Of course it is thick and must be rubbed in but unlike other sunscreens, it doesn&#x27;t smell super chemically and gross</li>
            <li> Conditions the skin as well as protects.</li>
            <li> I still burned! Useless compared to the old version of vanicream. I put it on liberally and have burned everytime.</li>
            <li> Great for eczema patients</li>
            <li> Vanicream re-vamped their sunscreens late last year (2013). I loved the SPF 30 -- it was a little shiny but it was a physical suncreen with no harmful ingredients, well rated by consumer groups, AND it disappeared on your face. This new formulation remains quite chalky. I had to return it.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen was recommend by my dermatologist because I very sensitive skin. It feels smooth and and is a great moisturizer. Perfect base for my Bare Minerals make up.</li>
            <li> My facial skin is only sensitive to sunscreens. I&#x27;ve tried other expensive brands but always come back to Vanicream. I have fair skin prone to irregular moles so Vanicream is my go-to sunscreen. Because of the super effective zinc oxide the cream is white but I put some makeup over it so I don&#x27;t look like Casper the ghost. Still the best sunscreen out there.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product. I have tried any others and this is the first that did not cause a burning sensation to my face. Love it</li>
            <li> My 5 year old has always had very sensitive skin. From more than one sunscreen (including california baby!) she has broken out in photodermatitis. I mentioned it to a dermatologist once and he recommended this brand. We&#x27;ve tried it and no reaction! We&#x27;ve been using it for years now, and plan to never switch! Our whole family uses it, very gentle and effective!</li>
            <li> Great stuff as always.</li>
            <li> Good quality sunscreen cream recommend to me by a Dermotologist.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this at first because I breakout in a rash from all regular drugstore-available sunscreens. I used it a number of times and was very pleased, even though it requires a lot of rubbing. But last week II used it, and then a week later used it again and had rashes develop on my arms and legs where I had used it.  I&#x27;m so disappointed and guess I developed a sensitivity to it. Now I&#x27;m back to square one with no sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It deserves three stars for the sun shielding - this it did fantastically.&lt;br /&gt;Bought it for a trip to the DR. I am fair skinned and my boyfriend is significantly darker but we both needed a good sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;I managed a nice tan even with the spf 30 and neither of us burned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say it is much more fluid than i expected and its just downright sticky.&lt;br /&gt;Though I was breakout free because it is very friendly to sensitive skin - it just felt like a mask the entire time.&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, I don&#x27;t think it will become a staple at our house.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to find a sunprotector of this standard in Sweden today. Either the sunfilters are chemical or the creams are scented. I have been told the apothecary can mix a cream for you, if your doctor prescribes it, but that seems like hard work. I&#x27;d rather use something tried and tested. I&#x27;m so happy I can buy this stuff through the services of amazon.com!</li>
            <li> I like this sunscreen very well.  No odor.  My skin has no bad reactions.  Some what thick but vanishes when absorbed.  Very moisturizing for my dry skin.  Wish this came in a larger size.  Does not sting my eyes.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist for sunscreen allergies. Works well. Skin has a whitish tinge when applied, but worth it for those allergic to sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It dried my skin out terribly, just like most other sunscreens.  Was very disappointed.  I now use **Biore Sarasara Uv Aqua Rich Waterly Essence Sunscreen 50g Spf50+ Pa+++ for Face and Body** on my face as well as **L&#x27;Oreal Sublime Sun Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 30 on my body**.  The Biore doesn&#x27;t dry me out.  L&#x27;Oreal is oily but not too oily.  Been using these for the last 2 summers.  I have systemic lupus erythematosus so I need sunscreen even indoors with UV lighting (which is almost everywhere right now).</li>
            <li> My Dermatologist told me to uae this so i have been using the soap moisteriser even the lite lotion now i cant find the sunscreenin the store except Eucerin which is not lite enough i have eczema also Great product Vanicream for sensitive skin glad i checked this out here. will be placing my order now i dont haveto.order two products for protection its good for the face also.</li>
            <li> Only sunscreen I can use on my face that does not cause a rash or a break out.</li>
            <li> Repeat buyer.  Great product</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen for kids/babies with sensitive skin including my toddler who has eczema, the only downside is the sunscreen isn&#x27;t super easy to apply and if it gets in their hair, it looks really greasy and oily.</li>
            <li> After trying several sunscreens we called our dermatologist and they recommended Vanicream.  It is the first sunscreen that my kids have used that didn&#x27;t make them break out in hives.  We tried everything from the cheap stuff to expensive organic creams.  this is the best out there.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and spreads easily. I mix my bronzer with it to counter the slight white tint it leaves.</li>
            <li> GREAT SUNSCREEN WITHOUT ALOT OF THE  CHEMICALS IN MOST OF THE STORE SUNSCREENS....NICE TEXTURE..CAN WEAR UNDER MAKEUP WITH NO PROBLEM</li>
            <li> Used this on a trip to Hawaii and it worked perfectly! I have very sensitive skin so this product worked great for me</li>
            <li> This vanicream was recommended by my dermatologist and I do think it does the job of keeping me from sunburn while not disrupting my rosecea, but it is a bit greasy going on and it doesn&#x27;t sink into your skin very well, so you look sweaty when you put it on your face.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because my allergist suggested Vanicream products. I liked the lite lotion, but the sunscreen is very thick and makes my skin greasy. I don&#x27;t have any trouble using regular sensitive skin sun products, so I am going to stick with them. I would only recommend this to someone who couldn&#x27;t comfortably use anything else.</li>
            <li> Sunscreen rubbed in better than Blue Lizard.  Worked well too and no rashes!  This would be great for folks with sensitive skin not sure if it worth the price for non-sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Non smell and works great.</li>
            <li> Great if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Too thick.  Hard to rub into skin.  Makes your skin look white because of the zinc.</li>
            <li> For a physical sun block, the cream went on easily which was a plus. It was definitely easier on my son&#x27;s sensitive skin. However, despite what appeared to be complete skin coverage, my son burned in a few spots even though he was in the sun for just an hour and a half. Next time, we will reapply at the one hour mark to avoid it wearing off.</li>
            <li> I gave it a 5 rating because it is very thick and difficult to rub into the skin.  I wish it were a little less viscous.</li>
            <li> I had been searching for a hypoallergenic, fragrance free, gluten free sunscreen that didn&#x27;t make me break out in hives or cause a burning sensation for quite some time. I had almost given up when I gave this product a try. This product is amazing! It didn&#x27;t react with my skin at all, it didn&#x27;t cause respiratory problems (from perfumes which I&#x27;m also allergic to) and it actually works! I have very fair skin and burn quite easily so I was very excited when I didn&#x27;t turn into a lobster after using this! I would highly recommend Vanicream products to anyone who has allergies!!!</li>
            <li> great sun screen for allergy sensitive skin.  no reactions and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen did not work at all. My husband and I ended up with extensive burns after a day in the sun, even when reapplying throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I used it for morning runs as well as daytime under light make up. Although I appreciated the products dewy feel (my skin tends to be dehydrated), my husband and children teased me about how white my face looked all day. As an aesthetian, I prefer the zinc/ titanium dioxide combo-but  this left me way too  pale and also blended poorly with my Channal makeup...</li>
            <li> This is what I needed as have sensitive skin and if you apply like you would a lotion it is a little greasy feeling so apply a small dab and adjust as needed.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen is great! It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and it protects well. It also doesn&#x27;t come off in water. I&#x27;ve worn in tubing two weekends in a row and still have no sun burns!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this sunscreen for my sensitive skin.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.  Little expensive, but worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This sunblock was recommended by my daughters dermatologist, and it&#x27;s the only sunblock that hasn&#x27;t caused her to breakout in hives. Goes on a little thick (not too bad), and rubs in easily.</li>
            <li> Definitely works and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  Very difficult to blend in - most times I look like a ghost when wearing it.</li>
            <li> I wear sunscreen on my face everyday and normally just use a moisturizer with SPF.  However, the product I was using was recently relabeled as &amp;#34;not broad spectrum,&amp;#34; so I decided to look for something else.  I ended up with Vanicream because it&#x27;s broad spectrum SPF 30 (also available in SPF 60), and it&#x27;s noncomedogenic (doesn&#x27;t clog pores).  A few things I like and dislike:&lt;br /&gt;- Legitimately safe for sensitive skin, unlike other &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried.  It never burns or stings when I apply it.  Vanicream is free of several major skin irritants, such as chemical sunscreens, lanolin, dyes, all fragrances (including masking fragrances), parabens, and preservatives...which is a nice bonus.&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes...even after I apply it all around my eye area and it gets IN my eyes (yes, I know, it&#x27;s not meant for the eye area, but I do it anyway).&lt;br /&gt;- Natural active ingredients but in a not-so-natural base.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about whether or not I&#x27;m doing more harm than good with this sunscreen, because the active ingredients are just zinc oxide and titanium dioxide.  Plus, because the ingredients in the &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; lotion are comparable to Cetaphil or CeraVe cream, I don&#x27;t have to worry about &#x27;natural ingredients&#x27; irritating the heck out of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;- Unlike other sunscreens, this one doesn&#x27;t leave white residue on my skin.  I do have fair skin, however, so I don&#x27;t know whether or not it would leave a visible residue on darker skin.&lt;br /&gt;Some cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Until it dries, this is the greasiest looking sunscreen I have ever seen (even though it is supposedly oil-free).  When I first apply it, my face literally looks like I rubbed cooking oil on it.  It dries completely matte, but it takes awhile.&lt;br /&gt;- After I&#x27;ve applied the product and it dries to a matte look, my face is still greasy to the touch for a very, very long time (like, 2 hours). I don&#x27;t wear makeup, so it&#x27;s not a huge deal to me, but I cannot imagine how anyone would be able to apply makeup over this sunscreen.  I may try using a hair dryer on a warm/low setting to see if that speeds up the drying process.&lt;br /&gt;- Considering the general price point of the brand, it&#x27;s not a sunscreen I would want to use from head to toe.  There are barely 4 full-body applications in one tube of this product, so my hunt for the perfect body sunscreen continues...ow anyone would be able to apply makeup over this sunscreen.

            <li> I like it because it is fragrance free.  I never go out in the sun for long but it seems to work just fine.</li>
            <li> This is the only brand of sunscreen I can use on my face without a flare up of rosacea.</li>
            <li> Too Thick and Goopy. Bought it for my face and it&#x27;s even harder to spread than the SPF 50+ stuff that you buy to use at the pool.</li>
            <li> My children with allergies and very sensitive skin have responded very well to Vanicream.  I wish it came in a larger size.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey but the only cream that doesn&#x27;t cause allergic reaction for our son.</li>
            <li> Works on my 3yo son who started having allergic reactions on his face to other &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; skin sunscreens like Neutrogena/Coppertone Baby. The main ingredient is zinc oxide so I put on a good slathering and he looks even paler til it absorbs. Haven&#x27;t had a problem with rashes/hives since we switched to this.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is fabulous! I use it everyday under my makeup. There&#x27;s no sunscreen smell. It doesn&#x27;t run and make my eyes sting and water. And best of all, it moisturizers my face while protecting my skin without causing breakouts. Soooo glad my dermatologist recommended Vanicream 35 to me</li>
            <li> This is a good non-allergenic sunscreen.  I got it because I am allergic to some chemical sunscreens.  It is very thick, however, and hard to smooth on.  Since it is winter, and not much is needed, except on face, neck and hands, I haven&#x27;t minded, but when summer rolls around, it will take a long time to get it all blended in on arms and legs, as well.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful.  It has absolutely &amp;#34;no&amp;#34; odor and is truly skin sensitive... and keeps me from getting sunburned.</li>
            <li> Really good price, well packaged and quick delivery - cannot ask for more!  Thanks.</li>
            <li> This is the only sunscreen that I have found so far that I&#x27;m not allergic too. Would definitely recommend for those with allergies or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I should have paid attention to the other reviews.  This product has changed formula.  My dermatologist recommended Vanicream sunscreen a few years ago.  I bought it and was impressed with the performance.  Now, this version does not go on skin smoothly, but instead goes on unevenly and when smoothed out still has a white shadow on skin.  I really cannot use it and go out in public.  Also it doesn&#x27;t seem to protect skin as well from UV rays.  I still have some of the old 60SPF sport and it&#x27;s fabulous!  It&#x27;s non sensitizing, is not white on skin and is effective.  Please bring back that one!</li>
            <li> We love ALL of Vanicream products. This sunscreen is the only one that doesn&#x27;t irritate my son&#x27;s skin.  I have it 4stars because I wish it came in a spray form.  With kids, it&#x27;s a much easier application process.</li>
            <li> I USE ALL THE VANICREAM PRODUCT LINE DUE TO MCS. DERMATOLOGIST&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMENDED IT FOR MY SKIN. NOW THE WHOLE FAMILY IS USING IT.</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen for me and my daughter who both are hyper sensitive to sunscreens. It&#x27;s thick, stays on well, and you don&#x27;t have to reapply every 30 minutes. No burns or rashes at all over the summer.  Highly recommend this sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Perfect for those who need sun block and not sun screen.</li>
            <li> I had a reaction on my arms using Eucerin lotion with SPF 15 and had to go see allergist.  She told me to switch to Vani Cream SPF 30.  I use them on my two arms for protection from sun exposure while driving.  It has only been about a month since I started using this cream so I think it is too soon to give it a 5 star rating in this short time.</li>
            <li> Fabulous!!  It had been recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Works wonder for sensitive skin. My two year old doesn&#x27;t react to any if the ingredients. My two year old niece also has sensitive skin and is very fair-complected and her dermatologist recommended this one for her.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as an everyday face lotion. I should&#x27;ve listened to the reviews because it does leave a huge white cast on your face when you finally get it all rubbed in. When I mix with my tinted moisturizer it helps it but you can still see the white casting. I have oily skin and this leaves my skin matte too which shocks me! That&#x27;s probably the biggest pro with this cream. I want to life this cream but I just can&#x27;t because it leaves my skin such a weird color.</li>
            <li> since a sim a lot I apply it before my swimming session.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin so I ordered several products from this line at me derm docs recommendation. It lives a sticky feel on my skin but guess it does the job of a sunscreen. It may not feel that way to everyone.</li>
            <li> Nice texture and feel, but it was not really for sensitive skn, as it made my face feel like a desert and made it flake.</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is terrific for people with sensitive skin. Not greasy and sun protection is great!</li>
            <li> my favorite a little expensive but works great</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this sunscreen. In theory it seemed perfect for my very acne prone skin. In practice, it was everything but. This sunscreen was gooey to the touch and made me breakout all over.</li>
            <li> This lotion is the only thing that won&#x27;t burn my toddler&#x27;s face. Perfect for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I was allergic to this sunscreen, I just can&#x27;t figure out which chemical is causing the reaction.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my sister&#x27;s dermatologist.  A wonderful bargain.  Easy to apply good for babies and all ages and skin types.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a delicate flower and am very sensitive to the chemicals in most sunscreens. Vanicream did the trick! With Vanicream,I had no reaction (with other sunscreens, my skin would feel on fire or I would break out in hives). I would highly recommend this lotion for those with chemical sensitivities.</li>
            <li> Active Ingredients: titanium dioxide 3.4%, zinc oxide 6%&lt;br /&gt;Inactive Ingredients: C20-40 alcohols, caprylyl glycol, cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 dimethicone, cocoglycerides, dicaprylyl carbonate, dimethicone, 1,2 hexanediol, hydrogenated castor oil, hydrogenated polyisobutene, magnesium chloride, octadecene, PEG-30 dipolyhydroxystearate, pentylene glycol, phenyl trimethicone, purified water, silica, silica dimethyl silylate, squalane, stearyl dimethicone, tridecyl salicylate, triethoxycaprylylsilane, ubiquinone (coenzyme Q10)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is shocking amount of chemicals to be applied on any human&#x27;s skin especially when it has the TO toxin which causes rash. Alcohol does not help skin either, it damages skin but yet it is sold;&lt;br /&gt;1. For sensitive skin,&lt;br /&gt;2. A light, transparent formula that provides high sunscreen protection without the use of chemical sunscreens which is a big lie,&lt;br /&gt;3. Water resistant (80 minutes), another lie. As an example, if you normally burn without sunscreen in 30 minutes, proper use of a SPF 15 sunblock would mean you could remain in the sun for 30 min x 15 &#x3D; 450 minutes before burning so SPF 30 will be twice that. But all that changes very quickly if you sweat so 80 minutes is meaningless.</li>
            <li> Because it keeps my skin from getting overexposed and makes it look smoother . I often forget to wear makeup because it looks so good.</li>
            <li> As described and great product.</li>
            <li> Works really well, but it easily gets on your clothes/ bathing suit and it&#x27;s super hard to get off not only your suit but also your skin. Had to take like 3 showers before it would scrub off.</li>
            <li> After breaking out from numerous other sunscreens, this is the one sunscreen that I have used since my daughter was 6 months old.  It provides great protection and does not sting.  She plays outside all the time and has never had any problems with this sunscreen.  Now the whole family uses it.  It is expensive but very high quality.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This has a little white in it that has to be rubbed in to get rid of it.  That&#x27;s the zinc, which is the most important ingredient.  I have very sensitive skin, and this product is the first one I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t irritate.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist as my skin is very sensitive to sunscreens.  It is very gentle, non irritating and is very effective.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Like this less heavy than 50.</li>
            <li> The best for sensitive skin, and no white pasty look.</li>
            <li> I like it, seems pretty good. Doesn&#x27;t leave your face quite as ghastly white as others.</li>
            <li> Very good sunscreen. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!  Leaving for trip to the Rockies, and needed good sunscreen. Very pleased with product and supplier.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, and isn&#x27;t super-thick either!  But it sure covers well... I am very fair and have had no complaints regarding sunburn when using this, nor any reaction for sensitive skin!  Well worth the purchase price!</li>
            <li> Recommended by our dermatologist for our daughters sensitive skin. Such a pain to apply! does the job however.</li>
            <li> This is the only sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t cause the skin on my face to sting. Also makes a great moisturizer to apply make up over. Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I live in the southwest part of the country, where the sun beats down and causes skin to become dry and more prone to sun damage; plus I have many allergies and must be careful about products/ingredients that I use.  The Vanicream sunblocks work very well on me.  I have Vanicream sunblocks in SPF 30, 60 and sporty in various places in my home and auto.  I do not like to be without this product; I place one, one and a half pea sized drops on my palm, wait a few seconds for drops to melt and continue to spread across my face, and repeat the procedure for my neck and decollete areas. The cream does not leave your face feeling heavy,  cakey or shiny. It spreads evenly, leaving your face, neck and chest areas moisturized and protected. I find this cream to be a very important part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li> my pediatric dermatologist recommended this. my daughter has very sensitive skin and is prone to eczema and this product works very well for her.</li>
            <li> I get migraines from fragrance and have trouble with the smell of most sunscreens. This one, however, did not trigger a migraine for me.</li>
            <li> First of all, I was not looking for a sunscreen - I ordered this late one night after I had taken sleeping medicine.  One click Amazon shopping and sleeping medicine is a potential bad combo.  I was surprised when I saw the email confirming my order the next morning.  I was sure I would have to return it as I had tried Vanicream sunscreen years ago and it was a greasy mess on my face.  When it arrived, I decided to just go ahead and try it and if I didn&#x27;t like it, I could just use it as a body sunscreen along with all the other failed facial sunscreens.  I mixed it with the Vanicream moisturizing cream and applied it to my face.  It has the feel that it is going to be greasy but it settles into what I call the perfect finish - not greasy and not dry.  I absolutely love it!  Hands down the best sunscreen I have ever tried for my sensitive rosacea-prone middle-aged skin.  The formula is perfect - I hope they never change it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t had any problem. very good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for four years now - will not put any other sunscreen on my kids, one of which is a redhead.  Have never burned.  Huge fan.</li>
            <li> This is great sunscreen. Yes it&#x27;s a bit greasy but you don&#x27;t need to put on a ton for it be effective.</li>
            <li> Hmm... I&#x27;m a little puzzled. I have about 20 bottles of suncreen in the house because I live in Southern California and spend almost my entire weekends outside, plus at least an hour every other day. Today I pulled out the vanicream before going to the beach, which I had never done. I applied it to my lower legs, as the top and knee were covered by yoga pants. I didn&#x27;t swim. I didn&#x27;t sweat much, and I was out for about 4 hours. This is far less taxing sun-wise than most of my activities, and yet, when I came back, I discovered \\&quot;sun socks\\&quot; on my lower legs---they had tanned as though I had on no sunscreen. I all the years of using sunscreen I have never seen this. And this is purported to be 30 SPF. In to the garbage it goes. Can&#x27;t understand it. Perhaps I was sold an expired one...?</li>
            <li> Love Vanicream Sunscreens: absolutely nothing in it to bother skin, while still getting protection. Non-greasy.</li>
            <li> Perfect if you are looking for a sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts or rashes. It takes a bit of work to rub it in, but it is worth it! It does go on clear and feels very sheer; it&#x27;s not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> It was recommended by my dermatologist since I have extremely sensitive skin and  I am allergic to other lotions and sunscreens.</li>
            <li> My daughter  gets terrible rashes from sunscreen. Vanicream is the only one she can use. Also, I have accidentally put sunscreen too close to my kids&#x27; eyes and it doesn&#x27;t burn. I buy 2-3 tubes a summer.</li>
            <li> My 5 kids have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;My 2 and 7 year old break out in rashes, ezema and this is what the allergist and dermotologist said to use.&lt;br /&gt;Works great!&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my infant too.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin from burning. My skin burns easy and Vanicream keep my skin from burning like I use too.</li>
            <li> I ordered this on a friend&#x27;s recommendation and am so glad I did.  At first I found it pretty thick and heavy as compare to my usual sunscreen.  But, it soaks in so quickly that I&#x27;m able to immediately apply my makeup with no heavy or greasy feel.  Living in south Florida its really important to use daily sun protection but not easy to find a high SPF that works well under makeup.  This product fits the bill.</li>
            <li> if you have Eczema thus is for you and ut amazingly heals skin as well as protects. Also the cost is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and normally develop a rash from sunscreens.  This is the only one I have tried (including multiple products for sensitive skin and or baby skin) that does not give me a rash.  My only complaint is that I did not notice this has only an SPF30 rating.  I thought it was SPF60.</li>
            <li> I heard a rumor that this product will be discontinued. What a shame. With skin  cancer the problem there can never  be enough good sun screens</li>
            <li> My husband has had skin cancer.  This has provided great protection for his face and neck this summer without any itching or irritation.</li>
            <li> Absorbs well without greasy feel or shine. My new favorite sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best mineral sunscreen I have tried. I am literally bubble girl and am allergic to everything. This one does not cause any reactions whatsoever. So glad I found it!</li>
            <li> We use this on face and bodies.  Goes on well, protects, and does not trigger rash on my 2 yo&#x27;s super-sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 10 years and love it so much.  It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  I wear it on my face mostly under my makeup and over my moisturizer.  Highly recommended for babies too.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from eczema my entire life and I guess I was a more sensitive to the sun than I realized. This sunscreen has been amazing in helping to reduce my fare ups. It really protects and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin at all. I use it everyday. Great product!!</li>
            <li> More like a moisturizer than sunscreen, but provides awesome protection.  I have extremely acne prone and sensitive skin and this product does not make me red, or cause me to break out.  Doesn&#x27;t even sting......it&#x27;s actually soothing.</li>
            <li> Very good product. I was pleased with the results. kept my skin soft but safe from the harshness of the sun exposure.</li>
            <li> A little heavy for the face as its white til really absorbed. But it really saved my skin. Love that it&#x27;s unscented and does not cause me a rash.</li>
            <li> I think the cream is expired.  It just makes my skin sooo dry!! it exfoliate. This is a cream supposed to make my skin soft and protected.&lt;br /&gt;I wonder if I can return it. I do not  have the box anymore.&lt;br /&gt;let me know.</li>
            <li> Works great, but a bit difficult to get off your face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few and this is the best for not causing any rash or breakouts, plus it blends in nicely.</li>
            <li> My aesthetician recommended vanicream as I have sensitive skin. However I don&#x27;t think she had ever had a chance to try it herself. Vanicream is medical grade, chemical free, physical mineral sunblock free of irritants, etc. which is great; however, it unfortunately goes on EXTREMELY greasy, thick, and sticky. At least some of it also comes off when you sweat and it was quite visible on my friends&#x27; and my faces as we beaded with sweat in the hot Las Vegas sun yesterday! this is absolutely not an option for use on my face - it DOES rub in clear (though is white when you first apply and needs rubbing in), but the thick, sticky, greasy texture and SIGNIFICANT sheen left on the face (even after waiting over an hour) require extra time and steps to use oil blotting linens (about 5) and brush on a layer of powder (defeating the purpose of my new facial regimen and avoiding makeup and other skin clogging layers). Overall not worth the risk of clogged/smothered pores and horrible oil-slicked appearance. Also significant worries about using it on my body as you&#x27;ll notice EVERYTHING you touch with it on your hands ends up with a thick greasy film.... Can&#x27;t imagine my clothes would be any different but not worth the risk of ruining them.</li>
            <li> I just used this for 3 days straight, all day reapplying, and only washing it off at the end of each day. I&#x27;ve never been able to do that with sunscreen before without developing a severe rash and possibly hives.  The spf 30 did work for me and I look like I&#x27;ve had a light tan instead of burning.</li>
            <li> the sunscreen has the very best ingredients to protect the skin from sunburn.  &amp;#34;Perfect&amp;#34;  The ingredients will turn the skin white,  A little rubbing of some facial/hand cream with it will help diminish the white.  It works for me and eventually the color will disappear.&lt;br /&gt;Manufacturers may not be in favor, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> my daughter has sensitive skin,my friend told me this brand Sunscreen, her daughter used and felt good. I just want to try it.</li>
            <li> Good for deli ate skin.</li>
            <li> Be careful... I was hoping that this would eliminate my son&#x27;s eczema problem triggered by sun exposure. This cream actually creates a new problem - skin rashes. reported to Amazon and they promptly refunded the purchase price.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.  I have tried numerous sun screens over the years and didn&#x27;t understand that you can have an allergic reaction to the chemicals in them.  This product delivers plain and simple. I use to have a terrible reaction after being in the sun with other products. To the point I broke out and had tiny sores that never went away.  I have been using the sunscreen for a couple weeks now and no more itching after being in the sun.  It is a little difficult to rub in, but I found that minor compared to the burning and itching.  A little goes a long way, especially on the face. Heading to the shore and I know I will be protected by this product without the reaction.</li>
            <li> I have a toddler who struggles with excema. I have tried other baby sun block lotions but the excema flares up with them. This sunblock does not make the excema flare up.</li>
            <li> After discovering an allergy to fragrance, I discovered Vanicream products. So far, they are the only ones that truly, truly don&#x27;t bother my skin in any way. This sunscreen is a little thick and it&#x27;s very white. But I have no problem with it absorbing into skin and disappearing. I wear it under my make up for every day and it works great. I haven&#x27;t done an all day outside kind of thing yet but I have mowed my yard with no trace of sun. It&#x27;s the only sunscreen for me.</li>
            <li> did not like this crean bexause it leaves ur skin white!!!!  i waa planning ti use it con My face!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin. Natural sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t make you white!</li>
            <li> I have been using Vanicream sunscreen for a few years.  Works okay for me.  Does not irritate my eyes like some do,.  It also works on kids.  Too bad it tends to be greasy.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent non-hormonal sunscreen that works with our son&#x27;s allergies.  It has no sunflower oil, which is hard to find.  Although I&#x27;d prefer one with more natural ingredients (these sound like chemicals), it is a barrier cream that is far easier to apply that all the others I&#x27;ve tried.  It is also much more water resistant (I applied this to my son&#x27;s face after taking him in the water after applying Babo Botanicals and I could see that one just running off his face in the pool).  It does leave a slight white sheen on my legs if I don&#x27;t rub it in well enough.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and many sunscreens burn my face, make my eyes water and start the itch. This product does not irritate my face or eyes. It is a mineral sunscreen, so it is a bit white going on, but clears after a second rub in. It is also a bit shiny on face... a light powder remedies this unavoidable issue...especially if the sunscreen has time to soak in.  This is truly one of the only non irritating facial sunscreens i have found. banana boat, unscented for babies is also tolerable. Great price. Good for 3 months of once a day application to face, neck, chest.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t rub in well at all so I can&#x27;t use it on my face. I&#x27;ve been using it on my arms and shoulders. Will not be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> I have been testing out a bunch of zinc oxide sunscreens the past few weeks because I am suddenly allergic to the mainstream sunscreens I used to use (Methylisozolinone, I suggest you google it if you have broken out in a rash after using any kind of skin care or hair care product containing this - a lot of people are allergic).  So, I know zinc oxide sunscreens leave a chalky residue and/or make you look ghostly.  I get that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, this is the first sunscreen that turned my skin blue.  My normal skin color is a dark bronze tanned color.  I don&#x27;t intentionally tan, but I&#x27;m outside in the sun a lot, especially in the water and I stay pretty brown year round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I rubbed on the Vanicream and my dark skin turned dark blue.  It was very noticeable.  I looked like a smurf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to get to the pool quick, so I didn&#x27;t try to take it off (it&#x27;s a heavy oily base, so hard to remove).  I wore it into the water and it stayed on well in the water - I know because I was still blue when I got out.  I didn&#x27;t burn, but it didn&#x27;t seem to protect much better than any other sunscreen in the same circumstances (I got tanner, I always do).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, a very concerned older lady accosted me after my swim to express concern that I looked very cold and maybe I should take a break and try to warm up.  It was in the mid-70s, but it wasn&#x27;t that cold in the water.  But, when you see a blue girl at the pool, and you&#x27;re a nice older lady, you have to say something to try to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s a bad sunscreen other than the way it looks on me; but, I won&#x27;t be using this again.  There are other zinc oxide sunscreens that don&#x27;t leave me looking like Violet Beauregarde.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen does not make my sensitive skin break out. It just does it&#x27;s job. I will be buying this from now on!</li>
            <li> Love the creamy texture, how it makes my skin glow; I use it year round!</li>
            <li> Love it finally found something I can use without allergy issues!&lt;br /&gt;Update now my skin hates this stuff, not sure what happened but in breaking out in places I never had before, the amount of rubbing feels more damaging to my skin and counter productive to using sunscreen to prevent premature aging, and I can&#x27;t for the life of me get this off daily its white and impossible to remove without tugging</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an Esthetician. I have very sensitive and flaky but combination skin. What a mess! My skin is very hard to taking care of.  Physical sunscreen is the best pick for my skin. I tried many physical sunscreen brands, and this is the favor one so far. Another favor one is Cotz brand for sensitive skin. The Cotz brand is thicker and better for winter dry skin. This one is lighter in texture. I love both. And there are about the same price.</li>
            <li> Consumer reports just ran an article in which they rated sunscreens.  Vanicream 50spf only offered 17spf protection.  It makes sense that their 30spf  fares even worse.  Do not buy this sunscreen.  It is expensive and it will not protect you or your children</li>
            <li> Needed a product to help protect against the sun other products cause side effects.  This product stays on long and dodes not cause a rash.</li>
            <li> This was suggested by my dermatologist.  I had no allergic reaction to this.  Finally something that works.  I would suggest this to people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My 7 months old baby has eczema, and this product works very gentle on her skin.</li>
            <li> I do like the sport version a little better, because it&#x27;s a little thicker, but this stuff doesn&#x27;t irritate and burn my eyelid area and the rest of my face like every other sunscreen out there. It&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve found that is gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on white, then soaks in and disappears. I reapply it often when I&#x27;m out boating or golfing and I believe it works just great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get it.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is amazing.  It doesn&#x27;t cause my face to swell up like every other product did, I can go in the sun, and stay without burn for hours.  It is thick so be aware of this.  You have to massage it in, but that doesn&#x27;t make your face feel worse.  I have used it on face, arms and chest, and it works everywhere.  Price is terrific, so don&#x27;t feel you are mortgaging your house to buy it.</li>
            <li> Works great on my face.</li>
            <li> Great product. Wish it had a hinged top instead of screw cap.</li>
            <li> This does a great job as a sunscreen. It is the only sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t give me a rash or hives because it doesn&#x27;t contain Zinc Oxide. It is definitely noticeable on your skin, leaving a white sheen, so I don&#x27;t use it on my face. It starts to burn after about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> This is the only sunscreen that my daughter won&#x27;t break out in hives. The only thing I wished for was that the SPF was higher than 30.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for ultra sensitive skin esp. for those with eczema. Just use a little bit and rub it in well or you will see it all over</li>
            <li> My dauhter has eczema and she does not use any other product. It is a little bit greasy and difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> For some reason, I break out with every other &amp;#34;hypoallergenic&amp;#34; sun screen.  My dermotologist recommended this, and it works without adverse reactions.</li>
            <li> According to the website Corner Drugstore carried SPF 60+. When i ordered 2 bottles, they arrived within the time but it was SPF 30 +. When i emailed them about the 30+ they said i ordered that, which is not true because i can get the 30+ right at Walgreens down the road from my house. They are claiming to have 60+ but they ship the 30. Yes you can send it back at your cost, why bother, just a FYI not to trust Corner Drugstore again for future orders.&lt;br /&gt;Carrie</li>
            <li> I really like this sunscreen.  It&#x27;s great for traveling because you can apply this on your face and on your body.  I used to carry around two sunscreen bottles and this is way more convenient.</li>
            <li> Not greasy or hard to apply.  No objectionable scents and no white residue.  Offers additional protection from UVA rays as well as UVB rays.</li>
            <li> Good sunscreen for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Vanicream Sunscreen SPF30 for Sensitive Skin prevents sunburn and does not irritate my skin.  I have used it on my face for more than 3 years without problems. Recently I have started using it regularly on my lips where I had precancerous changes treated.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and have tried lots of other sunscreens that are supposed to be for sensitive skin. I think I hit the jackpot with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I have had sensitivity to sunscreen for 5 years with rash, itching and redness.  Finally I found something that doesn&#x27;t bother my skin!&lt;br /&gt;One drawback... it is pretty goopy with a texture similar to Elmers glue.</li>
            <li> I have discoid lupus, which means that my skin is so sensitive to the sun that I have to wear a very good high SPF sunscreen at all times on any exposed skin.  If not, I break out in lesions that will last several months.  Vanicream Sunscreen for Sensitive Skin, SPF 30 has been the perfect answer for me, and it also works as a good moisturizer as well.  When first applied it will feel somewhat more heavy than a normal moisturizer but, after leaving it on a few minutes, I can apply makeup over it with no problems.  I&#x27;ve tried several other brands and all of them left white residue on my clothing because of the Titanium dioxide and Zinc oxide ingredients that are necessary in any good sunscreen.  Some even made my skin look white.  Vanicream Sunscreen, even though the active ingredients are Titanium dioxide and Zinc oxide, does not make my skin look white even when first applied, and it does not transfer visibly to my clothing.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA+++++++++++++++ Product</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t break out with vanicream.  I have tried other brands of sunscreen, some quite expensive.  I broke out within a couple of days.  I am person who never had any breakouts as a teen.  There is something in most suncreens that cause me to break out.  The only complaint is that it has the consistency of mud.  It is very difficult to apply.  I usually mix with a lotion for my body.  This is a small trade off for not breaking out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i did try a product that I was initially impressed with until I developed a very itchy rash that I did not get any relief from for 14 days.</li>
            <li> As others say, this is high rated as Safest and Most effective of sunscreens on EWG SkinDeep safe cosmetics database. Such mineral sunscreens are white because of zinc. I&#x27;ve tried a number of them and this one is the best. It says it&#x27;s noncomedogenic iirc. I use it on my face so that&#x27;s a plus.&lt;br /&gt;It actually does rub into your skin much better than most. The people who Are complaining here about it being &amp;#34;too white&amp;#34; when it goes on, I believe, are people not familiar with the nature of this overall type of (safest and most effective) sunscreens made with zinc oxide.&lt;br /&gt;I actually can&#x27;t rate effectiveness myself since haven&#x27;t been to beach yet to try it or see how waterproof it is. But I trust EWG opinion on that&lt;br /&gt;I like it enough I&#x27;ve recommended it to people and they are pleased.</li>
            <li> Some tubes of Sunscreenhas separation problems, clear fluid is expressed instead of sunscreen paste. Wonder if it is manufacturers processing problem or the sunscrren material sat too long on the shelf</li>
            <li> Vanicream is the only sunscreen I have found that does not burn my eyes. It&#x27;s a little thick and heavy to put on but it&#x27;s worth the effort. You can wear it while working and sweating and still no eye burn.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to many sunscreens, but this works great for me.  I get an allergic reaction to all of the spray kinds for sure.  I will definitely continue to use and purchase this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> My son has sensitive skin (couldn&#x27;t even use baby wipes when he was younger as his poor little bum would break out with little read bumps after even one use). Over the years we&#x27;ve used regular sunscreens and had an occasional reaction to them. While in Mexico over a long weekend he had a bad reaction to a Banana Boat broad spectrum product. After the first day we couldn&#x27;t apply any lotions to his skin because it hurt so badly that we spent the rest of the weekend inside. It took a week for his skin to clear up enough to even attempt Vanicream and I love it! There&#x27;s absolutely NO smell, he&#x27;s not breaking out and it seems to provide enough sunblock to our Arizona sun!</li>
            <li> Great for people and kids with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Very good for highly reactive skin. I have Rosacea and my dermatologist recommended this.</li>
            <li> My daughter has moderate eczema and pretty sensitive skin.  We use several Vanicream products and happily use the sunscreen.  It protects well - no burns and does not irritate her skin.</li>
            <li> I love the vaniply cream and ointment but the sun screen is very thick and makes my already white face very pale but it works for moisture.</li>
            <li> We use daily as my daughter has an auto immune disease that requires daily sun screed (JDM)</li>
            <li> BEWARE, it gave me a sunburn! I had read a few bad reviews that also warned of sunburn, but I tried it since Vanicream&#x27;s lotion is the only lotion sensitive enough for my eczema ridden skin. I should have patch tested, and am positive it was not a sensitivity reaction. One use of the sunscreen on my face while walking in and out of shade for 45 minutes, and it was as if it attracted the sun&#x27;s rays. It was worse than when I don&#x27;t use sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t usually review, but I just want to make sure people are aware of the very possible negative side effects.</li>
            <li> Love to surf and am in the Florida sun much a lot.  VC Sunscreen works great.  Lasts long enough for a two or three hour session in the water.  SPF 30 seems strong enough for even a mid-day surf.  Does not irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> Just a bit thick, but does the trick for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> best sunblock I&#x27;ve found for surfing, tried many other products and everything else I&#x27;ve tried has to be reapplied way too often, this stays on for hours while I&#x27;m in the water and keeps me from getting burnt. I put it on at home before leaving for the beach so I can wash my hands with dawn dish soap to get it off my hands, otherwise it would be too greasy and your hands would slip when trying to get up on your board. The bottle lasts a long time too, buying more now for the summer. One last thing I have sensitive skin and this product does not make me breakout.</li>
            <li> This product gave me a rash.</li>
            <li> I got it after reading the reviews on amazon. I have very sensitive skin but my skin adapts well to this. The sunscreen is a little hard to push though, the only down side to the product. Other than that it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> Happy with this product.  We have 4 different skin types in my family and we all have success with this product.</li>
            <li> Only sunscreen I can use. I do not break out when I use and it and I do not smell like I have been at the pool!</li>
            <li> Finally! A lotion that doesn&#x27;t irritate my face or my eczema!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very greasy, though. Be ready for a shiny face.</li>
            <li> I wear everyday. I live in Florida and the sun is so strong here that you need real good protection. This is an excellent quality.</li>
            <li> Sunscreen absorbs fast and non-greasy. I recommend it to my friends and this is the only sunscreen I will use from now on</li>
