            <li>I am happy with the product, and will purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Nivea has a great product line for women in Europe -</li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>However, when I use this product I notice a great decrease in dimpling and a great increase in the tightening of my skin.  </li>
            <li>but this week i&#x27;m proud to show off my legs.  </li>
            <li>It is great to apply after the shower and has a pleasant scent also.  </li>
            <li>The smell is awesome too:)</li>
            <li>the rear side of my thighs still shows some dimples, but they are remarkably fewer and the skin is smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a fairly overweight woman</li>
            <li>Loved the gel formula.</li>
            <li>I have noticed good results:  </li>
            <li>Scientists are searching for a cure to the cellulite problem but until then, this is a good idea for anyone concerned with the problem.</li>
            <li>I feel as though it works great for me:)</li>
            <li>I am very confident about my butt after using this...</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see how it will look in 2 more weeks!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product on and off for a while, and I can say that it is my favorite, although it doesn&#x27;t perform miracles!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I do not use this product, the cellulite stays and even seems to dimple more when I the stepping tightens my thighs and butt!  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing product.  </li>
            <li>I liked the scent and figured why not?</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own</li>
            <li>but it was good bye cellulite for me after I used these products for a month :)</li>
            <li>well im using this for maybe two or three years alraedy and to be honest</li>
            <li>I have been using this (and the Good-bye Cellulite patches) for over a week now and am thrilled.  </li>
            <li>After 8 weeks of use, I can honestly say that I lost inches</li>
            <li>the smell is nice too.</li>
            <li>But Nivea does offer great quality products for a very very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I also increased my pilayes doing more leg workouts but nothing cones easy these days!</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, smells good</li>
            <li>The mitt is so much better of an investment, its cheaper</li>
            <li>and it makes it so you don&#x27;t go through as many nivea tubes.</li>
            <li>I look forward to being confident in shorts again.</li>
            <li>I use it twice a day on most days, sometimes just once a day.</li>
            <li>I bought this gel to use along with the patches, since I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the patches I&#x27;m using the gel on</li>
            <li>, the gel has a nice scent and dries smooth on my skin.</li>
            <li>so I thought for sure I would see the results.</li>
            <li>It smells great, spreads very well, and is quite affordable.</li>
            <li>Definitely get the PATCHES, they work best for &#x27;relief&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Well I tried to use it twice a day once in the morning and once at night...and most of the time I did.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m getting more and</li>
            <li>Anyway, love the feel of this product and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d get even more results and eliminate it all</li>
            <li>I &lt;3 Nivea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 36 and have had 2 pregnancies (twins, plus one), 3 children total.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products over the years and this one has done wonders for me.  </li>
            <li>;) ;) :D</li>
            <li>I am better off just using cheap lotion instead.  </li>
            <li>Nivea provides great moisterizing without interfering with your natural skin oil.</li>
            <li>it gets smooth and a lot of the dimples disappear.</li>
            <li>The gel is great for problem areas such as the thighs and buttock.</li>
            <li>and I needed something that would help me smooth out  </li>
            <li>so happy I never had such toned legs since 5 years!</li>
            <li>I recommend using it right after you get out of the shower as it is supposed to absorb better then.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product on and off for years (originally found it circa 2004 when in Europe - Holland</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if there has been any difference in my cellulite, but then, I&#x27;m not following the exercise part of the program which I&#x27;m sure would help on it&#x27;s own, without the gel.  </li>
            <li>Every spring or early summer I start using it to get more confident for wearing shorts and dresses.</li>
            <li>This cream is nothing special.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s certainly cheaper than most skin-firming products.</li>
            <li>She loves it and wants me to order more for her.</li>
            <li>most skin firming products, the application can be time-consuming and the price can seem high.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to start eating right, moving more, and doing massages and scrubs, if you really want to reduce your dimples.</li>
            <li>But if you work out, drink so much water (10 glasses a day) and use this product you will be amazed!!</li>
            <li>On both legs I had gotten huge bumps like large bug bites.</li>
            <li>I say for $10.00 it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in my early 40&#x27;s and fairly slim but my skin is not nearly as firm as it once was</li>
            <li>I rarely ever get zits on my backside.</li>
            <li>Although hey, soft skin means it is more elastic which means cellulite is going away, so there ya go.  </li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t found a better skin line.</li>
            <li>but I have been eating healthy, drinking lots of water and exercising no less than 3 times a week.</li>
            <li>However, there are many other ways to reduce cellulite that work better.</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>I exercise and eat right</li>
            <li>I keep the bottle in the shower so that once I towel off, I may apply it right away to the thigh area--this keeps me from forgetting.  </li>
            <li>unfortunately you can not get most of their cosmetics and great stuff here in the US.</li>
            <li>First, I must begin by saying that I do not work for the company/not getting paid for my great review, this is my personal opinion based on my personal experience.</li>
            <li>I used this product last year and it had better results that this year...</li>
            <li>It does a awesome job on my behind and thighs!</li>
            <li>Works better than a regular lotion.</li>
            <li>For better reference I am 145lbs and work out regularly.</li>
            <li>I use lots of Nivea products and they have never failed me to this day.</li>
            <li>But I use it as a regular skin firming cream, because it is better than nothing.</li>
            <li>my thighs, this the FIRST TIME i try any product for cellulite</li>
            <li>I would and do recommend this to anyone, but remember you need to actually leave your couch and put forth more effort than rubbing in lotion and hoping for a miracle.</li>
            <li>:) My daily goal is 15,000 steps.  </li>
            <li>first I couldn&#x27;t believe that no product can reduce the appearance of cellulite</li>
            <li>noticed that it is more effective when I combine other efforts such as drinking a lot of water and exercising.  </li>
            <li>I dont think it has any real lasting effect, but helps the appearance and that is good enough for me this summer.</li>
            <li>I read the other reviews and figured if it worked that well for so many people, it must be worth a try.  </li>
            <li>think the key here, as with most products, is to have realistic expectations.</li>
            <li>have used countless anti-cellulite products, many of which were very costly and none produced results significant enough to talk about.  </li>
            <li>but certainly out of shape and cellulite is in my DNA.</li>
            <li>After using the whole bottle...</li>
            <li>I really wanted it to work</li>
            <li>The one thing I do every time I use it, is really massage it in.</li>
            <li>I feel like I&#x27;m doing something to fight cellulite, without spending too much money...</li>
            <li>but It really helps.</li>
            <li>i consider my expectation to be reasonable and a 50% favorable change exceeds my expectation.</li>
            <li>if your expectations are reasonable, i would buy and use this product.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have that much cellulite</li>
            <li>There is a course of cellulite reduction program at http[...], this really helps a lot.</li>
            <li>for the most part they have given me softer skin, but no real effect on the cellulite.  </li>
            <li>I am a very athletic woman, and go to the gym about 5 times a week, for 30 or 45 minutes to do cardio.  </li>
            <li>Nivea gel is a fairly thick serum with a bluish color; it spreads and dries quickly and has a light clean smell.</li>
            <li>Satisfaction with this product depends on how much you value the service.</li>
            <li>know, i didn&#x27;t really have cellulite in my life, may be..</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>used up a whole tube already and still, nada.    </li>
            <li>I was really hoping it would help.</li>
            <li>This really does help.  </li>
            <li>Even though its not major results its what you should expect from a home remedy plus ny skin feels nice and firm and reduced bumps in the first week!</li>
            <li>After two weeks you will see a slight difference and after 4 weeks it will look clearly better.</li>
            <li>but this product really reduced the cellulite until now by nearly 70%</li>
            <li>I love the supple, firm feeling it gives me</li>
            <li>It is working to firm up some of my week areas that have been a problem for many years.</li>
            <li>It is recommend to be applied twice daily, but is not an overnight success.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone a few days without using it, and when I start up again, I get more zits (after having them go away when I stop using the product).</li>
            <li>Still normal BMI and not overweight at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only on my 1st week, I can see positive results already!</li>
            <li>On that note, this is a fairly quick product to apply as long as you remember to do it</li>
            <li>but now I think I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Enjoy your new thighs</li>
            <li>I usually do not react this way to new products.</li>
            <li>It has made my skin very very soft....</li>
            <li>I use it anyway, but I will be very surprised if I ever see any results.s</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this crap is actually clogging my pores instead of doing me any good.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve found that it works better than more expensive creams, and maybe my body is just hopeless!</li>
            <li>but I am just too lazy at night :-) )</li>
            <li>I know we&#x27;d all like (I know I would) to just push a button and make things all better but the world and life don&#x27;t usually work that way...  </li>
            <li>I am now using the patches &amp; the gel and after one week, things seem a little better back there!</li>
            <li>I applied the lotion to my whole thigh area, front and back, even though I didn&#x27;t have cellulite on the front of my thighs.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this.</li>
            <li>My skin is extremely soft where I use it.</li>
            <li>I do not expect that this product will completely eliminate every ripple and dimple</li>
            <li>german grandmother raved about Nivea cream my whole life.</li>
            <li>Now as an adult I understand why.</li>
            <li>I think the good reviews on this product must be fake.  </li>
            <li>my skin is definitely firming up as dimples are becoming less visible within 2 weeks as this product claims.</li>
            <li>It is not just something that you can put on and sit back and relax (though, for me, it still made a difference when I did sit back and relax but it is much better to combine other efforts).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More</li>
            <li>Also I read that if you dry brush your cellulite areas first then use a knobby massage tool after applying the lotion that is supposed to help.</li>
            <li>it amazes me how the ratings from the reviewers are all over the map that i have to wonder if it is due to differential expectations for its success.</li>
            <li>If there were, all of the rich and famous people who have money for expensive cosmetic treatments would not have it!</li>
            <li>She had several guests of different body sizes use this product for a month and the results were pretty</li>
            <li>What I did was rub the Nivea lotion over the areas until the skin was pretty wet.</li>
            <li>only so I could clearly see if there was any difference.</li>
            <li>and my skin was definitely tighter, firmer, and the cellulite has been reduced to nearly nil.</li>
            <li>This may be long-winded but might be worth the read.</li>
            <li>I stopped using it for a few days, some of the cellulite has come back but not nearly as bad as before.</li>
            <li>And might not... :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, due to genetics, I have cellulite and have since I was at least 12 years old</li>
            <li>There was little effect on my cellulite however it did make my skin look much firmer and made my stretch marks almost disappear.</li>
            <li>Thought the patches looked like too much work and cream said it would work, so since I have only a little cellulite, gave the cream a try.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I don&#x27;t know if there has been any difference in my cellulite, but then, I&#x27;m not following the exercise part of the program which I&#x27;m sure would help on it&#x27;s own, without the gel.  </li>
            <li> Every spring or early summer I start using it to get more confident for wearing shorts and dresses.</li>
            <li> This cream is nothing special.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s certainly cheaper than most skin-firming products.</li>
            <li> She loves it and wants me to order more for her.</li>
            <li> most skin firming products, the application can be time-consuming and the price can seem high.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to start eating right, moving more, and doing massages and scrubs, if you really want to reduce your dimples.</li>
            <li> But if you work out, drink so much water (10 glasses a day) and use this product you will be amazed!!</li>
            <li> On both legs I had gotten huge bumps like large bug bites.</li>
            <li> I say for $10.00 it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in my early 40&#x27;s and fairly slim but my skin is not nearly as firm as it once was</li>
            <li> I rarely ever get zits on my backside.</li>
            <li> Although hey, soft skin means it is more elastic which means cellulite is going away, so there ya go.  </li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t found a better skin line.</li>
            <li> but I have been eating healthy, drinking lots of water and exercising no less than 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> However, there are many other ways to reduce cellulite that work better.</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> I exercise and eat right</li>
            <li> I keep the bottle in the shower so that once I towel off, I may apply it right away to the thigh area--this keeps me from forgetting.  </li>
            <li> unfortunately you can not get most of their cosmetics and great stuff here in the US.</li>
            <li> First, I must begin by saying that I do not work for the company/not getting paid for my great review, this is my personal opinion based on my personal experience.</li>
            <li> I used this product last year and it had better results that this year...</li>
            <li> It does a awesome job on my behind and thighs!</li>
            <li> Works better than a regular lotion.</li>
            <li> For better reference I am 145lbs and work out regularly.</li>
            <li> I use lots of Nivea products and they have never failed me to this day.</li>
            <li> But I use it as a regular skin firming cream, because it is better than nothing.</li>
            <li> my thighs, this the FIRST TIME i try any product for cellulite</li>
            <li> I would and do recommend this to anyone, but remember you need to actually leave your couch and put forth more effort than rubbing in lotion and hoping for a miracle.</li>
            <li> :) My daily goal is 15,000 steps.  </li>
            <li> first I couldn&#x27;t believe that no product can reduce the appearance of cellulite</li>
            <li> noticed that it is more effective when I combine other efforts such as drinking a lot of water and exercising.  </li>
            <li> I dont think it has any real lasting effect, but helps the appearance and that is good enough for me this summer.</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews and figured if it worked that well for so many people, it must be worth a try.  </li>
            <li> think the key here, as with most products, is to have realistic expectations.</li>
            <li> have used countless anti-cellulite products, many of which were very costly and none produced results significant enough to talk about.  </li>
            <li> but certainly out of shape and cellulite is in my DNA.</li>
            <li> After using the whole bottle...</li>
            <li> I really wanted it to work</li>
            <li> The one thing I do every time I use it, is really massage it in.</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;m doing something to fight cellulite, without spending too much money...</li>
            <li> but It really helps.</li>
            <li> i consider my expectation to be reasonable and a 50% favorable change exceeds my expectation.</li>
            <li> if your expectations are reasonable, i would buy and use this product.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have that much cellulite</li>
            <li> There is a course of cellulite reduction program at http[...], this really helps a lot.</li>
            <li> for the most part they have given me softer skin, but no real effect on the cellulite.  </li>
            <li> I am a very athletic woman, and go to the gym about 5 times a week, for 30 or 45 minutes to do cardio.  </li>
            <li> Nivea gel is a fairly thick serum with a bluish color; it spreads and dries quickly and has a light clean smell.</li>
            <li> Satisfaction with this product depends on how much you value the service.</li>
            <li> know, i didn&#x27;t really have cellulite in my life, may be..</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> used up a whole tube already and still, nada.    </li>
            <li> I was really hoping it would help.</li>
            <li> This really does help.  </li>
            <li> Even though its not major results its what you should expect from a home remedy plus ny skin feels nice and firm and reduced bumps in the first week!</li>
            <li> After two weeks you will see a slight difference and after 4 weeks it will look clearly better.</li>
            <li> but this product really reduced the cellulite until now by nearly 70%</li>
            <li> I love the supple, firm feeling it gives me</li>
            <li> It is working to firm up some of my week areas that have been a problem for many years.</li>
            <li> It is recommend to be applied twice daily, but is not an overnight success.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone a few days without using it, and when I start up again, I get more zits (after having them go away when I stop using the product).</li>
            <li> Still normal BMI and not overweight at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only on my 1st week, I can see positive results already!</li>
            <li> On that note, this is a fairly quick product to apply as long as you remember to do it</li>
            <li> but now I think I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Enjoy your new thighs</li>
            <li> I usually do not react this way to new products.</li>
            <li> It has made my skin very very soft....</li>
            <li> I use it anyway, but I will be very surprised if I ever see any results.s</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this crap is actually clogging my pores instead of doing me any good.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve found that it works better than more expensive creams, and maybe my body is just hopeless!</li>
            <li> but I am just too lazy at night :-) )</li>
            <li> I know we&#x27;d all like (I know I would) to just push a button and make things all better but the world and life don&#x27;t usually work that way...  </li>
            <li> I am now using the patches &amp; the gel and after one week, things seem a little better back there!</li>
            <li> I applied the lotion to my whole thigh area, front and back, even though I didn&#x27;t have cellulite on the front of my thighs.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely soft where I use it.</li>
            <li> I do not expect that this product will completely eliminate every ripple and dimple</li>
            <li> german grandmother raved about Nivea cream my whole life.</li>
            <li> Now as an adult I understand why.</li>
            <li> I think the good reviews on this product must be fake.  </li>
            <li> my skin is definitely firming up as dimples are becoming less visible within 2 weeks as this product claims.</li>
            <li> It is not just something that you can put on and sit back and relax (though, for me, it still made a difference when I did sit back and relax but it is much better to combine other efforts).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More</li>
            <li> Also I read that if you dry brush your cellulite areas first then use a knobby massage tool after applying the lotion that is supposed to help.</li>
            <li> it amazes me how the ratings from the reviewers are all over the map that i have to wonder if it is due to differential expectations for its success.</li>
            <li> If there were, all of the rich and famous people who have money for expensive cosmetic treatments would not have it!</li>
            <li> She had several guests of different body sizes use this product for a month and the results were pretty</li>
            <li> What I did was rub the Nivea lotion over the areas until the skin was pretty wet.</li>
            <li> only so I could clearly see if there was any difference.</li>
            <li> and my skin was definitely tighter, firmer, and the cellulite has been reduced to nearly nil.</li>
            <li> This may be long-winded but might be worth the read.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it for a few days, some of the cellulite has come back but not nearly as bad as before.</li>
            <li> And might not... :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, due to genetics, I have cellulite and have since I was at least 12 years old</li>
            <li> There was little effect on my cellulite however it did make my skin look much firmer and made my stretch marks almost disappear.</li>
            <li> Thought the patches looked like too much work and cream said it would work, so since I have only a little cellulite, gave the cream a try.</li>
            <li> right now my cellulite is the least I have seen it since I started getting it</li>
            <li> Second, I must admit that I was very skeptical of a cream&#x27;s effectiveness, but I had read some reviews of others, and liked what I had read.  </li>
            <li> No effect, complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> The patches are a joke too and you only get a few in a box and they are supposed to be used regularly with the gel over several weeks.  </li>
            <li> My dimples are melting away, and while they are not completely gone, I will continue to use the cream</li>
            <li> bunch of crap,such a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Your not supposed to use the mitt on dry skin, hence the reason I continue to use nivea.</li>
            <li> if you struggle with dry skin...GET Nivea  </li>
            <li> But, as long as you are using a lotion, you may as well use this for the minimal effects.</li>
            <li> funny because last year I was heavier and had worse cellulite then!</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin..</li>
            <li> &amp; it gives a little itchy sensation initially</li>
            <li> I am just starting to notice a little and wanted to try to stop it before I get all lumpy.</li>
            <li> Within two days my minor cellulite was gone, within a week, the average looking cellulite was almost gone.</li>
            <li> I got the cream 2 weeks ago and the patches a few days later, which seemed to speed up the process.  </li>
            <li> After using this product twice a day for a month along with patches three times a week, I see absolutely NO results.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I am slim and have minimal cellulite.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve probably used 10 tubes over the last few years.</li>
            <li> When I stop using it all the cellulite comes back in a few months.</li>
            <li> with within almost a month, my cellulite looks the same, after using it everyday for a month.</li>
            <li> total waste of $15.</li>
            <li> I used a stiff bristle brush and rubbed in circular motions on my skin just prior to using the products.</li>
            <li> So I try this product after reading the other reviews.</li>
            <li> Maybe I need to workout harder!</li>
            <li> They appeared in clusters, one leg had about 10 bumps and the other 4.</li>
            <li> This product is junk just like all the other cellulite creams on the market.  </li>
            <li> i do want to mention that i am a yo-yo dieter and this increase in firmness is novel due to application of this cream.</li>
            <li> The products&#x27; effectiveness probably has to do with a lot of other underlying factors &amp;</li>
            <li> I gave the product 4 not 5 because the cream is a little sticky until it is totally dry</li>
            <li> I took the mitt and massaged in into my skin for 10 minutes twice a day very roughly so bruises came.</li>
            <li> but the appearance of reduced cellulite is very minimal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyhow, sorry for the long-winded review, I&#x27;ve just had a few years to test this product and it has not disappointed me</li>
            <li> used this for 2 weeks twice a day for 20 minutes, massaging it very hard into my skin until I developed bruises.</li>
            <li> since at the very least it makes my skin soft.  </li>
            <li> All I can say is that it has worked extremely well for me!</li>
            <li> Walmart also makes an Equate version for about $8.00, but the gel is very thin which makes the bottle top vulnerable to leaky</li>
            <li> I also saw this on the Tyra Banks show, I waited a little while to check out the reviews on this then decided to just give it a try.</li>
            <li> I am not sure of each product&#x27;s effectiveness without the other.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months.</li>
            <li> I have been using for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> Good-Bye Cellulite Gel does help firm up the skin and reduce the visible signs of cellulite.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend the reoccurring shipments every few months.</li>
            <li> i should also say that i use a skin exfoliating bath cloth everyday and perhaps this helps with the cream&#x27;s absorption or rate of (?).</li>
            <li> It will reduce your cellulite and firm your skin.</li>
            <li> Waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I bought a few bottles of this stuff,what a joke,just exercise the damn cellulite away,lol.</li>
            <li> in the past, my skin has never been this firm as my weight fluctuated up and down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small price to pay for a little self assurance in those shorts and skirts.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product because I am an especially difficult case; I have more than the little &#x27;area&#x27; to tackle, so I didn&#x27;t expect miracles.</li>
            <li> I have used it for about a month, usually twice a day.</li>
            <li> It usually maxes out</li>
            <li> It works to reduce the appearance of cellulite but, unfortunately, it does not actually get rid of cellulite.</li>
            <li> I have used several very expensive other anti-cellulite products and have also paid thousands for endermologie.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve tried expensive name brand cremes and they usually make my skin break out, or my skin becomes really dry.</li>
            <li> I can hardly see a difference, if any.</li>
            <li> At least for me.</li>
            <li> I stopped using product and they are slowly going away.</li>
            <li> This company hasn&#x27;t disappointed so far and continues to amaze me!</li>
            <li> I want to tell all women that I had serious cellulite problems that I thought no product can make it go away</li>
            <li> other factors include i run 3 times a week for 30 mins UNFAITHFULLY</li>
            <li> Even if there&#x27;s no remarkable change on</li>
            <li> I work out 6 days a week very hard and eat a strict diet.</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, my cellulite has gotten WORSE.</li>
            <li> At least I&#x27;m not getting worse!</li>
            <li> Im affraid if i will stop it will be worse....</li>
            <li> Despite being thin, I have some cellulite on my stomach.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t leave reviews on Amazon or any other website but this product really disappointed me!</li>
            <li> disappointed, what a waste of money</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I fell for the trap as well.</li>
            <li> I am always skeptical about these things but after seeing a couple reviews in magazines and on tv I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> and sadly i saw no results, it says results with in a week or 2</li>
            <li> got the wrong product</li>
            <li> (Which sucks!!!)  </li>
            <li> I feel like Nivea is targeting women (and men) who are so fed up with their imperfections that they are desperate for a &#x27;miracle product&#x27;.</li>
            <li> but I was so desperate and tried everything</li>
            <li> Regardless, I think that without this product, this would be impossible.  </li>
            <li> I was using the product twice a day for 5 days, and on the 5th day had bad itching on both my thighs where I had been applying the gel.</li>
            <li> They are not as bad as they were, but defintely haven&#x27;t said &#x27;goodbye&#x27; yet.</li>
            <li> As for all the bad reviews, you can&#x27;t expect using a lotion for a month to undo years of damage.</li>
            <li> It is embarassing and a lot of the times I am shocked to look in the mirror and see all the dimpling, etc.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have terrible cellulite -</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I used this product last year and it had better results that this year...funny because last year I was heavier and had worse cellulite then! The product did change its formula though so maybe thats why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this for 2 weeks twice a day for 20 minutes, massaging it very hard into my skin until I developed bruises. There was little effect on my cellulite however it did make my skin look much firmer and made my stretch marks almost disappear. I love the supple, firm feeling it gives me, I just wish it got rid of cellulite like it claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well! It can! I then bought the Finulite Cellulite Smoothing Massage Mitt. What I did was rub the Nivea lotion over the areas until the skin was pretty wet. I took the mitt and massaged in into my skin for 10 minutes twice a day very roughly so bruises came. Within two days my minor cellulite was gone, within a week, the average looking cellulite was almost gone. I stopped using it for a few days, some of the cellulite has come back but not nearly as bad as before. I&#x27;m going to use it again to make it all go away. The mitt is so much better of an investment, its cheaper and it makes it so you don&#x27;t go through as many nivea tubes. Your not supposed to use the mitt on dry skin, hence the reason I continue to use nivea.</li>
            <li> Does not work! Skinny girl with fat girl legs! I workout 3-4 times a week... And somehow my cellulite never goes away!!! DARN!!!! So I try this product after reading the other reviews. Hopeful I slathered it on 2 times a day... After using the whole bottle... Look in the mirror UGH!!! Still there cellulite everywhere! Don&#x27;t listen to the lies!!! Maybe I need to workout harder!</li>
            <li> I am happy with the results of this product. It is working to firm up some of my week areas that have been a problem for many years.</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews and figured if it worked that well for so many people, it must be worth a try.  I got the cream 2 weeks ago and the patches a few days later, which seemed to speed up the process.  Already I think it&#x27;s about a 70-80% improvement!  I can&#x27;t wait to see how it will look in 2 more weeks!  I look forward to being confident in shorts again.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t leave reviews on Amazon or any other website but this product really disappointed me! I feel like Nivea is targeting women (and men) who are so fed up with their imperfections that they are desperate for a &#x27;miracle product&#x27;. Unfortunately, I fell for the trap as well. After using this product twice a day for a month along with patches three times a week, I see absolutely NO results. As a matter of fact, my cellulite has gotten WORSE. I applied the lotion to my whole thigh area, front and back, even though I didn&#x27;t have cellulite on the front of my thighs. I liked the scent and figured why not? After about three weeks into use, I noticed dimpling on the front of my thighs! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! I&#x27;m only 20 and although I&#x27;m not overweight (I&#x27;m 5&#x27;4, 128 lbs.), I started noticing dimpling in the backs and sides of my thighs but I NEVER  had it on the front of my thighs. PLEASE save your money and invest it in something like a gym membership! That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going to do.. Not only do I have to fix the damage that I have done to my thighs, now I have to repair Nivea&#x27;s product&#x27;s damage..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months. I feel as though it works great for me:) The smell is awesome too:) This is an excellent price as well. $15.00 at the store for 1 bottle:(</li>
            <li> I was using the product twice a day for 5 days, and on the 5th day had bad itching on both my thighs where I had been applying the gel. On both legs I had gotten huge bumps like large bug bites. They appeared in clusters, one leg had about 10 bumps and the other 4. I usually do not react this way to new products. This is just my experience to it and my skins reaction, but I had never seen anything like it! I stopped using product and they are slowly going away.</li>
            <li> This product is like all the others. It simply DOES NOTHING. I am 5&#x27;9\\&quot; and a size 2, but unfortnately have cellulite on my upper thighs and butt. I guess it is just heredity. I work out 3 times a week doing Pilates and feel great but can&#x27;t get rid of the cellulite. So if this stuff is going to work, it&#x27;s going to work for me, right? I rushed to the store after the Tyra Banks show and purchased the cream only. Thought the patches looked like too much work and cream said it would work, so since I have only a little cellulite, gave the cream a try. I intentionally did one leg and butt cheek only so I could clearly see if there was any difference. Difference was ZERO! No effect, complete waste of money. Tyra must be getting paid to push it. I&#x27;m going to call the company and ask for my money back.</li>
            <li> I am on my second tube of the gel, and this is my 4th week of use. I use it twice a day on most days, sometimes just once a day. It has made my skin very very soft....like silk...but the appearance of reduced cellulite is very minimal. I can hardly see a difference, if any.</li>
            <li> This cream is a joke it dont work at all</li>
            <li> I bought this gel to use along with the patches, since I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the patches I&#x27;m using the gel on it&#x27;s own.  I don&#x27;t know if there has been any difference in my cellulite, but then, I&#x27;m not following the exercise part of the program which I&#x27;m sure would help on it&#x27;s own, without the gel.  Even if there&#x27;s no remarkable change on it&#x27;s own, the gel has a nice scent and dries smooth on my skin.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.  I have used this product twice a day for a month and I see ZERO difference in the appearance of cellulite.  I really wanted it to work but it did NOT work at all!  I think the good reviews on this product must be fake.  I am better off just using cheap lotion instead.  Do not waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> This product is junk just like all the other cellulite creams on the market.  It does NOT work.  Save your money.  I am slim and have minimal cellulite.  I exercise and eat right and the product did not make one once of difference in my cellulite.  The patches are a joke too and you only get a few in a box and they are supposed to be used regularly with the gel over several weeks.  You&#x27;d be out of alot of money fooling with this.  There is no cure for cellulite.  If there were, all of the rich and famous people who have money for expensive cosmetic treatments would not have it!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a miracle...this isn&#x27;t it. But, it is a great product. I have used it for about a month, usually twice a day. The one thing I do every time I use it, is really massage it in. I did not use the patches, or the serum.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say there is a 100% improvement, but I would say it&#x27;s about 75%. I am happy with the product, and will purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;I think the key here, as with most products, is to have realistic expectations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product on and off for a while, and I can say that it is my favorite, although it doesn&#x27;t perform miracles! but I&#x27;ve found that it works better than more expensive creams, and maybe my body is just hopeless! It does increase the skin&#x27;s tone with just one application a day. I recommend it! At least I&#x27;m not getting worse! I feel like I&#x27;m doing something to fight cellulite, without spending too much money...</li>
            <li> Thank God I only paid 10 bucks for this cream. I don&#x27;t have a lot of cellulite so I thought for sure I would see the results. Besides, I work out every day.   Well, I have to say I saw nothing. I believe it&#x27;s a psychological thing - you&#x27;ll only see something if you WANT to see something.</li>
            <li> I have lots of experience with this product. I&#x27;ve probably used 10 tubes over the last few years. Every spring or early summer I start using it to get more confident for wearing shorts and dresses. It works, simply put. You have to use it twice a day. After two weeks you will see a slight difference and after 4 weeks it will look clearly better. At least for me. It usually maxes out it&#x27;s effectiveness around week 8 for me. I am very confident about my butt after using this...it gets smooth and a lot of the dimples disappear. I have used several very expensive other anti-cellulite products and have also paid thousands for endermologie. This works just as well. When I stop using it all the cellulite comes back in a few months. I work out 6 days a week very hard and eat a strict diet.</li>
            <li> I have been using for a few weeks now and I don&#x27;t see any improvement</li>
            <li> It is another one check the photos on this before ordering because it&#x27;s not the Q10 skin firming cellulite gel, it&#x27;s skin firming &amp; toning.</li>
            <li> This is miracle in a bottle!  It does a awesome job on my behind and thighs! Bikini season here I come!</li>
            <li> The Nivea Body Good-Bye Cellulite Gel does help firm up the skin and reduce the visible signs of cellulite.  The gel is great for problem areas such as the thighs and buttock. It is recommend to be applied twice daily, but is not an overnight success. It is great to apply after the shower and has a pleasant scent also.  I would recommend the reoccurring shipments every few months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in week 4, and I still have the dreaded dimples. They are not as bad as they were, but defintely haven&#x27;t said &#x27;goodbye&#x27; yet. But, as long as you are using a lotion, you may as well use this for the minimal effects. Works better than a regular lotion. It smells great, spreads very well, and is quite affordable. My skin is extremely soft where I use it. I recommend this product because I am an especially difficult case; I have more than the little &#x27;area&#x27; to tackle, so I didn&#x27;t expect miracles. Definitely get the PATCHES, they work best for &#x27;relief&#x27;. If you have to choose between patches and gel cream, go for the patches if you can afford it. It&#x27;s a small price to pay for a little self assurance in those shorts and skirts.</li>
            <li> I was hesitating purchasing this product after mixed reviews but now I think I can&#x27;t live without it. Even though its not major results its what you should expect from a home remedy plus ny skin feels nice and firm and reduced bumps in the first week! For better reference I am 145lbs and work out regularly. I also increased my pilayes doing more leg workouts but nothing cones easy these days!</li>
            <li> I also saw this on the Tyra Banks show, I waited a little while to check out the reviews on this then decided to just give it a try. I am a fairly overweight woman but I have been eating healthy, drinking lots of water and exercising no less than 3 times a week. I passed on the patches till I gave the cream a try. Well I tried to use it twice a day once in the morning and once at night...and most of the time I did. I have noticed about a 50% reduction in the cellulites appearance and firmer skin. This is no miracle worker but It really helps. I just finished my 1st bottle and I&#x27;m getting more and this time I&#x27;m gonna try the patches too. I say for $10.00 it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> it amazes me how the ratings from the reviewers are all over the map that i have to wonder if it is due to differential expectations for its success. i consider my expectation to be reasonable and a 50% favorable change exceeds my expectation. this is a lotion topically applied and who&#x27;d expect for the lotion to change one&#x27;s genetic makeup? i apply this cream once a day to upper legs and buttocks following a shower. my skin is definitely firming up as dimples are becoming less visible within 2 weeks as this product claims. i do want to mention that i am a yo-yo dieter and this increase in firmness is novel due to application of this cream. in the past, my skin has never been this firm as my weight fluctuated up and down. i am 115lbs but certainly out of shape and cellulite is in my DNA. i should also say that i use a skin exfoliating bath cloth everyday and perhaps this helps with the cream&#x27;s absorption or rate of (?). other factors include i run 3 times a week for 30 mins UNFAITHFULLY and i am a smoker. if your expectations are reasonable, i would buy and use this product.  i am going to.</li>
            <li> I use lots of Nivea products and they have never failed me to this day. In order to reduce cellulite you have to use both, the gel and the patches, and follow directions.  It will reduce your cellulite and firm your skin. Nivea has a great product line for women in Europe - unfortunately you can not get most of their cosmetics and great stuff here in the US. But Nivea does offer great quality products for a very very reasonable price. And I&#x27;ve tried expensive name brand cremes and they usually make my skin break out, or my skin becomes really dry. Nivea provides great moisterizing without interfering with your natural skin oil. I didn&#x27;t have that much cellulite but it was good bye cellulite for me after I used these products for a month :)</li>
            <li> This cream is nothing special. But I use it as a regular skin firming cream, because it is better than nothing. However, there are many other ways to reduce cellulite that work better. I would recommend to start eating right, moving more, and doing massages and scrubs, if you really want to reduce your dimples. There is a course of cellulite reduction program at http[...], this really helps a lot.</li>
            <li> well im using this for maybe two or three years alraedy and to be honest i can&#x27;t see any difference.....why im keep using it ...Im affraid if i will stop it will be worse....</li>
            <li> Everyone knows cellulite potions and lotions don&#x27;t work. I use it anyway, but I will be very surprised if I ever see any results.s</li>
            <li> I found out about this product on the Tyra Banks show.  She had several guests of different body sizes use this product for a month and the results were pretty amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in my early 40&#x27;s and fairly slim but my skin is not nearly as firm as it once was and I have always had cellulite. I have been using this (and the Good-bye Cellulite patches) for over a week now and am thrilled.  My skin&#x27;s firmness has returned to what it was in my 20&#x27;s.  I can already see a difference in my cellulite.  I do not expect that this product will completely eliminate every ripple and dimple but I can see that it is resulting in a massive improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used countless anti-cellulite products, many of which were very costly and none produced results significant enough to talk about.  This is the only product that I have used that I think warrants any type of recommendation and this one gets two thumbs up!  So, rather than using boutique, designer or department store brands save yourself some money and aggravation and try this version!</li>
            <li> Hi. First, I must begin by saying that I do not work for the company/not getting paid for my great review, this is my personal opinion based on my personal experience. Second, I must admit that I was very skeptical of a cream&#x27;s effectiveness, but I had read some reviews of others, and liked what I had read.  I love this product! I noticed a firmness almost instantly and use in combination with the patches, as recommended. I am not sure of each product&#x27;s effectiveness without the other. I also used strictly, according to package - twice a day. I used a stiff bristle brush and rubbed in circular motions on my skin just prior to using the products. After 8 weeks of use, I can honestly say that I lost inches and my skin was definitely tighter, firmer, and the cellulite has been reduced to nearly nil. My mom asked me if I&#x27;d lost weight!   I gave the product 4 not 5 because the cream is a little sticky until it is totally dry &amp; it gives a little itchy sensation initially (although the package says that&#x27;s how you know it&#x27;s working).  The products&#x27; effectiveness probably has to do with a lot of other underlying factors &amp; how faithful you areto the regimen, eating habits, etc.  All I can say is that it has worked extremely well for me!</li>
            <li> I am 42 and have tried all of the various creams, neutrogena, bliss fat girl slim etc. for the most part they have given me softer skin, but no real effect on the cellulite.  I am now using the patches &amp; the gel and after one week, things seem a little better back there! I dont think it has any real lasting effect, but helps the appearance and that is good enough for me this summer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this three weeks ago and began using it as instructed. I chose the 2 times per day route. I find myself looking no different as well as having zits on my backside and my legs. I know that the gel is causing them because they show up within 30 minutes of application. I&#x27;ve gone a few days without using it, and when I start up again, I get more zits (after having them go away when I stop using the product). I rarely ever get zits on my backside. I&#x27;m pretty sure this crap is actually clogging my pores instead of doing me any good. Waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I am always skeptical about these things but after seeing a couple reviews in magazines and on tv I decided to give it a try. I have only used it a couple weeks and already can tell a difference. I don&#x27;t have terrible cellulite - I am just starting to notice a little and wanted to try to stop it before I get all lumpy. Anyway, love the feel of this product and the smell is nice too. I recommend using it right after you get out of the shower as it is supposed to absorb better then. My skin feels and looks smoother. Also I read that if you dry brush your cellulite areas first then use a knobby massage tool after applying the lotion that is supposed to help. As for all the bad reviews, you can&#x27;t expect using a lotion for a month to undo years of damage.</li>
            <li> I work out 5 days out of the week and I needed something that would help me smooth out  my thighs, this the FIRST TIME i try any product for cellulite and sadly i saw no results, it says results with in a week or 2 so i was patient and waited. with within almost a month, my cellulite looks the same, after using it everyday for a month. disappointed, what a waste of money</li>
            <li> I am writing about  Nivea In Shower moisture  lotion...this product is the best thing I have ever found. ..I have very dry skin..this is incredible..if you struggle with dry skin...GET Nivea  In-Shower  Moisture. ..</li>
            <li> Loved the gel formula. It absorbs quickly, smells good and I am seeing results within two weeks. My tummy looks smoother!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I am a very athletic woman, and go to the gym about 5 times a week, for 30 or 45 minutes to do cardio.  I address my problem cellulite areas (butt, thinghs) by working them out and then applying the cream post shower.  After using it for a month, I have noticed a big difference.  My dimples are melting away, and while they are not completely gone, I will continue to use the cream (I didn&#x27;t see any patches), since at the very least it makes my skin soft.  Although hey, soft skin means it is more elastic which means cellulite is going away, so there ya go.  I would and do recommend this to anyone, but remember you need to actually leave your couch and put forth more effort than rubbing in lotion and hoping for a miracle.</li>
            <li> This may be long-winded but might be worth the read. And might not... :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, due to genetics, I have cellulite and have since I was at least 12 years old (I am 37 now). It is embarassing and a lot of the times I am shocked to look in the mirror and see all the dimpling, etc.  I have never been obese, just have gained and lost weight over the years.  I am 5&#x27; 8\\&quot; and go between 135 lbs - 155 lbs.  Currently at 150 lbs.  Still normal BMI and not overweight at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product on and off for years (originally found it circa 2004 when in Europe - Holland I believe - for business) and I can tell you that it works when I use it.  When I stop using it, the dimpling eventually comes back (though it does take a while).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that it is more effective when I combine other efforts such as drinking a lot of water and exercising.  It is not just something that you can put on and sit back and relax (though, for me, it still made a difference when I did sit back and relax but it is much better to combine other efforts).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More recently, I have a routine wherein I drink almost 2 gallons of water a day and if I watch TV or movies at home, instead of just sitting I purchased a Gold&#x27;s Gym stair stepper ($45.00) and \\&quot;walk or run up stairs\\&quot; instead.  :) My daily goal is 15,000 steps.  I wear a pedometer all day.  I do not always make it but I range around 6,000 to 15,000 steps a day and I have a desk job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I do not use this product, the cellulite stays and even seems to dimple more when I the stepping tightens my thighs and butt!  (Which sucks!!!)  However, when I use this product I notice a great decrease in dimpling and a great increase in the tightening of my skin.  I use this on the backs of my upper legs as well as my thighs. I massage it in vigorously and, when I have time, knead the areas I am applying it to as much as possible.  I only do this in the mornings after my shower (maybe if I also applied itbefore bed I&#x27;d get even more results and eliminate it all but I am just too lazy at night :-) ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My stomach is not as prone to dimpling but I use it there from time to time anyhow so as to prevent any from occuring and it does tighten the skin there as well. I swear by Nivea Body Good-Bye Cellulite and right now my cellulite is the least I have seen it since I started getting it (because I have been keeping in my routine). I am investing in a massage machine (also purchased from Amazon) to see if I can eliminate it.  Regardless, I think that without this product, this would be impossible.  I am hoping it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for anyone that say it doesn&#x27;t work, try drinking lots water and exercise.  I know we&#x27;d all like (I know I would) to just push a button and make things all better but the world and life don&#x27;t usually work that way...  Which sucks!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, sorry for the long-winded review, I&#x27;ve just had a few years to test this product and it has not disappointed me so I thought I&#x27;d share.</li>
            <li> I &lt;3 Nivea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 36 and have had 2 pregnancies (twins, plus one), 3 children total. Despite being thin, I have some cellulite on my stomach. My stomach has been my problem area. This is changing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product in preparation for my bikini trip to the Caribbean. I have never tried a firming lotion and bought this on a whim. It works miracles. Only on my 1st week, I can see positive results already! The dimpling is reduced and I look forward to the final results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My german grandmother raved about Nivea cream my whole life. Now as an adult I understand why. I also use Nivea cream on my face and have received numerous compliments on my youthful appearance. When I visit Europe, I buy Nivea makeup. So far I haven&#x27;t found a better skin line. This company hasn&#x27;t disappointed so far and continues to amaze me!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 4 months now; I have found the 6.7 oz bottles in local stores for $9.83 a piece. Walmart also makes an Equate version for about $8.00, but the gel is very thin which makes the bottle top vulnerable to leaky messes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Nivea gel is a fairly thick serum with a bluish color; it spreads and dries quickly and has a light clean smell. In order to achieve results, the gel must be applied daily/regularly. I keep the bottle in the shower so that once I towel off, I may apply it right away to the thigh area--this keeps me from forgetting.  My body type is thin/muscular 5&#x27;8\\&quot;, but I get some cellulite on the back of my legs.  I have noticed good results:  the rear side of my thighs still shows some dimples, but they are remarkably fewer and the skin is smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like most skin firming products, the application can be time-consuming and the price can seem high. Satisfaction with this product depends on how much you value the service. On that note, this is a fairly quick product to apply as long as you remember to do it and it&#x27;s certainly cheaper than most skin-firming products. It works to reduce the appearance of cellulite but, unfortunately, it does not actually get rid of cellulite. Scientists are searching for a cure to the cellulite problem but until then, this is a good idea for anyone concerned with the problem.</li>
            <li> i always use this every summer, it seems working..? idon&#x27;t know, i didn&#x27;t really have cellulite in my life, may be.. because i use this cream regularly? haha</li>
            <li> after seeing the show on Tyra Banks, ran out and bought one at cvs.  used up a whole tube already and still, nada.    total waste of $15.</li>
            <li> bunch of crap,such a complete waste of money.I bought a few bottles of this stuff,what a joke,just exercise the damn cellulite away,lol.</li>
            <li> I used two bottles of Nivea over a two month period. I can&#x27;t see any improvement at all. I was really hoping it would help. It smells good though!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.  I&#x27;ve had breath taking results in a weeks time.  I&#x27;ve tried many products over the years and this one has done wonders for me.  Last week I didn&#x27;t want to wear shorts but this week i&#x27;m proud to show off my legs.  Awesome product!</li>
            <li> This really does help.  I use it every year and start using it 6-8 weeks before bathing suit/shorts season hits.  It does take a while to see the results and you do need to keep using it.  The cellulite will return once you stop using it so it is not a permanent fix.</li>
            <li> got the wrong product</li>
            <li> Actually I couldn&#x27;t believe this product! It says that it will reduce thhe cellulite in 4 weeks and I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks and it actually does what it say!!! I want to tell all women that I had serious cellulite problems that I thought no product can make it go away but this product really reduced the cellulite until now by nearly 70% and I haven&#x27;t finished my 4 weeks yet!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I couldn&#x27;t believe that no product can reduce the appearance of cellulite but I was so desperate and tried everything but nothing worked. Except this one!!! And when you use it with the Nivea Serum Q10 it gives amazing results!! And the 2 packs will actually be enough for u for 4 weeks...&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy I never had such toned legs since 5 years! I have been working out for 6 months and the cellulite wasn&#x27;t going away. But if you work out, drink so much water (10 glasses a day) and use this product you will be amazed!! And believe me I have tried this without using this product and it didn&#x27;t work before!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy your new thighs ;) ;) :D</li>
            <li> Got this at my wife&#x27;s request. She loves it and wants me to order more for her.</li>
