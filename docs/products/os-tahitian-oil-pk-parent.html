            <li>Because it is such a wonderful product, I liked everything about it.</li>

            <li>Then I used it, and I love it for my hair too.  </li>
            <li>I have forever adopted this product especially after blow drying, a drop is all you need to add a perfect shine and healthy look to the hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Super love it :)</li>
            <li>I have used this on both my skin and hair per the suggestion on the bottle and love it on both.  </li>
            <li>The best use yet was for removing a wad of gum from my 5 year old daughter&#x27;s hair right before mass.</li>
            <li>but at this time I would buy again from what I have experienced so far.</li>
            <li>Great for everyday use for soft, silky hair and an excellent pre-product/hairspray/texturizing spray.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my fine, med length hair that always tangles after washing (based on reviews sounded like just what I needed).</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic and it&#x27;s non-greasy</li>
            <li>Also does a fantastic job taming the frizz!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wish I could scent my worth with this stuff!</li>
            <li>It makes my hair extra soft too and it smells wonderful!</li>
            <li>Got this for my daughter&#x27;s curly hair and love it even on my straight hair.</li>
            <li>Good product wish they have it in a bigger size.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>It is a great tropical scent that is not too heavy.  </li>
            <li>bottom line is: worth.</li>
            <li>The smell takes me to the beach ;-)</li>
            <li>It absorbs immediately, and leaves your hair soft and tangle free, regardless of the condition of your hair.</li>
            <li>I make an extra effort to run a pump or two more in the night before I know</li>
            <li>I recently got this product and am in love with the smell.  </li>
            <li>She uses one pump, and after a few minutes is able to easily brush through her hair.  </li>
            <li>So far, I have purchased seven (7) of the Original Sprout products and will be leaving a review for all of them.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good, not amazing.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Whole Foods had a tester out, and I tried it on my hair.</li>
            <li>Wish it detangled a little better.</li>
            <li>and it makes it soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>to cover the areas my skin is so soft after using the Tahitian oil on</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel baby soft but not at all greasy.  </li>
            <li>I initially bought this oil as an organic alternative to bio silk, for use as an anti-drying agent at the beach and under intense sunshine.</li>
            <li>Hydrating and non-greasy and feels organic and natural.</li>
            <li>She is now old enough to take care of her own hair in the morning, but she has very thick, wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>Love this helps tame even dry bleached hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be doing a lot to my hair (major curls, lots of straightening, product, etc) to protect it -</li>
            <li>I am a mixed race, colored girl, and have very rich, thick hair.</li>
            <li>I also tried it on my skin with the same results, absorbed quickly, no oily feeling, and my skin was incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and straight, and gets dry easily from styling and brutal midwestern winters.  </li>
            <li>on my skin it absorbs quickly and you need very little of it as it goes a long&lt;br /&gt;way</li>
            <li>Other reviewers love it, but brings back too many bad memories of tanning with Hawaiian Tropic suntan oil.</li>
            <li>Once dry, my hair is soft and shinny - no oily residue!</li>
            <li>First of all - did NOTHING for the tangles - then left my hair oily and limp.  </li>
            <li>Many serums or oil leave behind that greasy residue, but this product doesn&#x27;t leave any trace that you&#x27;re wearing it - even if you put it on dry hair.</li>

            <li> I was surprised that it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all.  </li>
            <li> I bought this recently for dry hair.  </li>
            <li> ( mine was recently color treated and was dry and brittle feeling).</li>
            <li> use it every night after I get out of the shower and just run two or three pumps through my long hair (focusing on the roots).</li>
            <li> I have long colored treated hair which gets quite dry at the ends.</li>
            <li> works well for dry hair.</li>
            <li> I let my hair dry overnight, so when I wake up in the morning</li>
            <li> All you need is ONE drop, rub it between your hands and put it on your wet hair.  </li>
            <li> I put a couple drops on my hands, rub them together, then slide my fingers through the ends of my wet hair.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll often run it through my dry hair as a detangler or to help reduce the little frizzies on the crown of my head.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves keeping her hair long and enjoys swimming, but she hates swim caps, so her very long, thick hair gets dried out and tangled, making brushing a pain for both of us.</li>
            <li> so it leave my hair moisturized and shiny without being weighed down.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t feel my hair is weighed down with it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Hopefully it does repair the slight dryness in my daughters hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will diffidently buy this product again......</li>
            <li> and it has dried</li>
            <li> This does not feel heavy and greasy</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this for a few weeks before determining if I would buy again for my hair</li>
            <li> I prefer a small drop for my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, course, hair</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s a non-toxic product, I don&#x27;t feel guilty for using it.</li>
            <li> Often, she was unable to detangle her hair, even with layers of leave-in conditioner, detanglers, etc.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed</li>

            <li> I love this for my hair - I have long thick hair and it makes it soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves keeping her hair long and enjoys swimming, but she hates swim caps, so her very long, thick hair gets dried out and tangled, making brushing a pain for both of us. Since we found this oil treatment, I just use this product on her hair once a week and it reverses the pool damage. It makes my hair extra soft too and it smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> Works pretty good, not amazing.  But I like that it isn&#x27;t greasy and it the smell is very good.  Wish it detangled a little better.</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter&#x27;s curly hair and love it even on my straight hair. The smell takes me to the beach ;-)</li>
            <li> I bought this recently for dry hair.  It is amazing!!! All you need is ONE drop, rub it between your hands and put it on your wet hair.  It absorbs immediately, and leaves your hair soft and tangle free, regardless of the condition of your hair. ( mine was recently color treated and was dry and brittle feeling). The smell is delicious!! I also tried it on my skin with the same results, absorbed quickly, no oily feeling, and my skin was incredibly soft. Did I mention the smell was delicious. This is a vegan product, without lavender,tea tree oil, or SLS.  This will definitely be on my shopping list from now on.</li>
            <li> nice product. works well for dry hair.</li>
            <li> the fragrance alone is to die for...my hair glowed and way softened...i asked friends if they noticed anything different...they GOT IT... i felt even more beautiful!</li>
            <li> Too greasy for my hair type</li>
            <li> I love the way this oil feels , I use it more on my skin then I do my hair.&lt;br /&gt;rough areas on my elbows and kneed are gone, I even use it on my face&lt;br /&gt;I guess I should eventually use it on my hair but for now I love the feel of&lt;br /&gt;it on my skin it absorbs quickly and you need very little of it as it goes a long&lt;br /&gt;way to cover the areas my skin is so soft after using the Tahitian oil on it.&lt;br /&gt;I will diffidently buy this product again......</li>
            <li> I use this product on my hair after I&#x27;ve washed it. It smells fantastic and it&#x27;s non-greasy so it leave my hair moisturized and shiny without being weighed down. Since it&#x27;s a non-toxic product, I don&#x27;t feel guilty for using it. It is the only hair product I use now!</li>
            <li> Because it is such a wonderful product, I liked everything about it. It leaves your hair shiny and soooo smooth,  I will recomend it to everyone!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Doesn&#x27;t make hair greasy but moisturizes hair and is especially great in my daughter&#x27;s curly hair! It keeps her curls in order and not all frizzed out!</li>
            <li> Love the Tahitian oil! I have thick, course, hair and it makes it feel like silk. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love using this stuff on my skin.  It makes your skin feel baby soft but not at all greasy.  Highly recommend it!</li>

            <li> The best organic oil ever!!!! Hydrating and non-greasy and feels organic and natural. I have forever adopted this product especially after blow drying, a drop is all you need to add a perfect shine and healthy look to the hair.</li>
            <li> Smells so good and works well with enhancing curls!&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully it does repair the slight dryness in my daughters hair.&lt;br /&gt;Super love it :)</li>
            <li> Absolutely SUPERB product! Great for everyday use for soft, silky hair and an excellent pre-product/hairspray/texturizing spray.

            <li> This is amazing, the smell is luscious and the product works great!  The best oil on the market... but OH!  The scent!!!!  Like Hawaiian tropic sun tan oil, but sweeter (and not sticky)  I wish I could scent my worth with this stuff! Just wonderful.</li>
            <li> Have used the OS product line since birth and for 5 years for our two girls but this oil is too Coconutty for them to like wearing, even though it does do treatments well.</li>
            <li> Love this helps tame even dry bleached hair</li>
            <li> Whole Foods had a tester out, and I tried it on my hair. I really liked the way this product made my hair feel. I am a mixed race, colored girl, and have very rich, thick hair. It&#x27;s not greasy and my hair absorbs it. So far, I have purchased seven (7) of the Original Sprout products and will be leaving a review for all of them. Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I recently got this product and am in love with the smell.  It is a great tropical scent that is not too heavy.  I have used this on both my skin and hair per the suggestion on the bottle and love it on both.  The scent last throughout the day too without being over powering.  This does not feel heavy and greasy and I don&#x27;t feel my hair is weighed down with it.  A full pump is more than needed for the hair but for my skin is a good amount.  I prefer a small drop for my hair.  I will continue to use this for a few weeks before determining if I would buy again for my hair but at this time I would buy again from what I have experienced so far.</li>
