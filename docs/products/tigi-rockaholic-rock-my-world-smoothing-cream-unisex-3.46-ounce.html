            <li> I originally bought this product at a discount store because of the price.  After using it for a month (and running out) I had to have more.  It is a great texturizer and keeps my hair &amp;#34;piecy&amp;#34; looking.  This is a must have for me!  ( I have usually straight hair but like that it keeps it from frizzing)</li>
            <li> Works well to help smooth my fine curly frizzy hair. Be careful though, if you use too much it may make your hair feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  My hairdresser used it on me after highlighting my hair.  It really protects the hair from breakage and leaves my hair feeling sleek and smooth.</li>

The only I can compare it to is like VELVET! But with no residue or shine! Besides the scent, you can&#x27;t even tell you&#x27;re wearing a hair product! It&#x27;s just likehaving naturally soft, healthy, velvet hair!</li>
