            <li>This shampoo has moisturized my hair and keeps it smelling great.</li>
            <li>Smells great and works well for my hair.</li>
            <li>This stuff makes my whole bathroom smell awesome in the  morning.</li>
            <li>Great value, Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I feel my hair is in better condition when I use this shampoo in conjunction with the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>And most importantly for a shampoo, it cleans my hair and leaves it manageable.     </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product, I&#x27;ve been using this product for over ten years and love it.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling clean and has a pleasant, masculine (though not overpowering) scent.</li>
            <li>If the price has not raised significantly I recommend this product.</li>
            <li>American Crew Daily Shampoo has the best formula to prevent your hair getting oily, your scalp fresh and with a nice essence (the three main reasons AC shampoo is my favorite).</li>
            <li>I paid ten dollars which seems fair.</li>
            <li>It cleans my hair without drying it out and leaves it full bodied and shiny when I comb it out.</li>
            <li>I love this so much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Could be worth a try if you&#x27;re suffering</li>
            <li>I also use American Crew Daily Conditioner and both products combined makes your hair look good and very fresh!.</li>
            <li>It is also a very light shampoo with a subtle, but good smelling scent.</li>
            <li>American Crew has created a super product in many ways.</li>
            <li>I recommend checking Amazon and your local store to compare both prices and buy the most convenient.</li>
            <li>This is a very quality product.</li>
            <li>idk... i&#x27;d rather have that classic scent and cancer than have to suffer through smelling this stuff and feeling it burning my head like acid.  </li>
            <li>This particular product helps my scalp.</li>
            <li>I’ve tried other versions of Crew Shampoo and in my opinion this is the best one they offer...... at least for me!</li>
            <li>After trying American Crew&#x27;s Anti- Dandruff Shampoo and finding it working great, I decided to switch my daily shampoo to American Crew Daily Moisturizing Shampoo.     </li>
            <li>This shampoo works as described and, while a bit expensive, is a very good product for daily use.  </li>
            <li>It may be a bit more expensive than normal shampoos, but you are getting your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>OMG, it is for men, it is not described clearly on the website.</li>
            <li>I wish I placed more emphasis on a fairly high number of recent negative reviews before buying this</li>
            <li>This is the first time it has been a white color and a totally different smell.  </li>
            <li>First, it moisturizes the scalp daily so that my dandruff doesn&#x27;t come back.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s generally cheaper on Amazon than the drugstores near me, which is a bonus to the convenience of getting it delivered to my door.</li>
            <li>This is the first shampoo I&#x27;ve found that not only helps to treat dry scalp, but works in preventing it.</li>
            <li>Now my hair is thick, soft, and clean.</li>
            <li>I have been using American Crew for a number of years and the shampoo as always been a clear consistancy.  </li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using American Crew Shampoo bought in local stores for several years and really like it.</li>
            <li>I live in a place where the air is so DARN dry that the atmosphere causes my scalp to feel itchy</li>

            <li> American Crew Daily Shampoo has the best formula to prevent your hair getting oily, your scalp fresh and with a nice essence (the three main reasons AC shampoo is my favorite). I also use American Crew Daily Conditioner and both products combined makes your hair look good and very fresh!. I recommend checking Amazon and your local store to compare both prices and buy the most convenient.</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t smell anything like I remember it.  I&#x27;ve read something about all the goodness being removed so that I don&#x27;t get cancer from using it, but idk... i&#x27;d rather have that classic scent and cancer than have to suffer through smelling this stuff and feeling it burning my head like acid.  I rubbed it in, hesitantly after smelling it for the first time, and was soon standing there in all my naked glory missing the money I had wasted on it.  All of the nicer hair care products I could have gotten for the money flashed through my mind, but only for a moment because soon the panic of the burn set in and I was just hoping it didn&#x27;t trickle down to my nether regions as I furiously tried to get it off my head.  Once I stepped out of the shower, I actually felt like less of a man and my hair looked at me disappointingly in the mirror as if I had rubbed old corn made moonshine on my scalp after trying on a crown of thorns for a few hours and rubbing it into all of the open wounds.  Don&#x27;t waste money on this... you&#x27;ll cry about it and want to drive to China to personally look the seller in the eyes and say, &amp;#34;why did you do this to me?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too choosy about my shampoo. But after years of using Herbal Essences I decided I should probably wash my hair with something that did not smell like a feminine hygiene product. On the other hand I did not want to go the other direction and purchase a Tag or Axe-like shampoo that would leave me smelling like the 19 year-old undergrads that I teach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked at a few designer shampoos, but to be frank, I&#x27;m not going to spend thirty dollars on shampoo. Not on a TA&#x27;s wages, at least. I found this shampoo recommended in a men&#x27;s style magazine and I&#x27;m pleased with it. I paid ten dollars which seems fair. It leaves my hair feeling clean and has a pleasant, masculine (though not overpowering) scent. If the price has not raised significantly I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Seems to leave my hair feeling to oily.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t even smell like Crew.</li>
            <li> I have been using American Crew for a number of years and the shampoo as always been a clear consistancy.  This is the first time it has been a white color and a totally different smell.  Not sure this is really American Crew.</li>
            <li> This is the first shampoo I&#x27;ve found that not only helps to treat dry scalp, but works in preventing it. I&#x27;ve had dry scalp for years, and even expensive shampoos didn&#x27;t really do much. I would still have to use an anti-dandruff shampoo like Selsun Blue about once a week or so. After trying American Crew&#x27;s Anti- Dandruff Shampoo and finding it working great, I decided to switch my daily shampoo to American Crew Daily Moisturizing Shampoo.     American Crew has created a super product in many ways. First, it moisturizes the scalp daily so that my dandruff doesn&#x27;t come back. It is also a very light shampoo with a subtle, but good smelling scent. And most importantly for a shampoo, it cleans my hair and leaves it manageable.     This is a very quality product. It may be a bit more expensive than normal shampoos, but you are getting your money&#x27;s worth. I recommend trying this product if you have had problems with dry scalp in the past.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, I&#x27;ve been using this product for over ten years and love it.</li>
            <li> This particular product helps my scalp. I live in a place where the air is so DARN dry that the atmosphere causes my scalp to feel itchy sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, this moisturizer shampoo is helpful - it can be used Daily to restore moisture back into one&#x27;s hair &amp; scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kudos to the maker of this product.  Of course, everyone&#x27;s hair is different - so it&#x27;s possible this may not work out for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could be worth a try if you&#x27;re suffering</li>
            <li> This shampoo works as described and, while a bit expensive, is a very good product for daily use.  I use it in conjunction with the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I wish I placed more emphasis on a fairly high number of recent negative reviews before buying this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using American Crew Shampoo bought in local stores for several years and really like it. It is very thick and leaves my hair quite manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has a slightly different name than the stuff in the local store and is not the same product. It is very thin and quite often I get a big handful of the stuff if I am not paying attention. No better than the $5 a bottle stuff in the local grocery store.</li>
            <li> bottles were NOT filled with the American crew shampoo thought I was ordering.Some other awful smelling shampoo.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has moisturized my hair and keeps it smelling great. I constantly had dry scalp while using my last brand. Now my hair is thick, soft, and clean. This stuff makes my whole bathroom smell awesome in the  morning.</li>
            <li> Fake formula. Totally different from what you buy at the mall. It seems the shampoo has been mixed with water to just fill out the bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!!! This is the best shampoo I have ever used. It cleans my hair without drying it out and leaves it full bodied and shiny when I comb it out. I’ve tried other versions of Crew Shampoo and in my opinion this is the best one they offer...... at least for me!</li>
            <li> I love this so much. It&#x27;s generally cheaper on Amazon than the drugstores near me, which is a bonus to the convenience of getting it delivered to my door. Smells great and works well for my hair.</li>
            <li> Not a good shampoo for me.  Maybe for others, not for me.  Won&#x27;t buy again.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of $$</li>
            <li> OMG, it is for men, it is not described clearly on the website.</li>
            <li> Like the product a lot.  I feel my hair is in better condition when I use this shampoo in conjunction with the conditioner.  The only issue I have is the leakage that occurs with shipping.</li>
            <li> Great value, Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li> When I received the shampoo, it seemed as if someone had taken some out and watered it down before sending so it left my hair feeling as if I had just washed it with soapy water instead of shampoo. Terribly disappointing.</li>
