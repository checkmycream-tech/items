            <li>wear it for work (I teach) but it could easily be a nice nighttime perfume as well.</li>
            <li>This is a sickeningly sweet re-formulation of what was a beautiful waft of spring.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t apply it for a special date night but great for group outings where you don&#x27;t want to smell too</li>

            <li>I absolutely love this scent whenever I wear it I get compliments.</li>
            <li>I love the this scent.</li>
            <li>I am very glad that I can find it in Amazon, you also provide a great and super fast service.  </li>

            <li>great price and was delivered immediately ... highly recommend</li>
            <li>thank you very much , and received the product, all in good condition.</li>
            <li>I got what I was expecting, 80 ml Nina Ricci Nina, perfect smell for a long time.</li>
            <li>Very sweet smelling.</li>
            <li>Got here safe and sound.</li>
            <li>sure you will enjoy this</li>
            <li>It smells great, the quality is awesome, it last long time</li>
            <li>I was happy to find her a gift that was not only aesthetically pleasing to the senses, it did not possess the nauseating effect that most perfumes have on folks with a sensitivity to smells.</li>
            <li>Such a beautiful bottle and a heaven sent smell.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite perfumes, arrived quickly</li>
            <li>I am always told how nice I smell, but you know that comes with the territory of not wearing perfumes that contain so much alcohol in it.  </li>
            <li>I buy this every year as a gift for my mom,this is the 3rd time i ordered, always happy with my purchase, i used to buy at the mall</li>
            <li>and this is a fantastic deal.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this scent &amp; get a lot of compliments on it.</li>
            <li>This cologne is sweet and spicy without being overwhelming or sickly sweet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally, I like the Nina L&#x27;Elixir more, but it is much brighter and more of a daytime perfume.</li>
            <li>and I also love the smell of it because it reminds me of when we first got together.</li>
            <li>I got this for my wife because i was already familiar with the sent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a very pleasant and subtle fragrance in a stylish bottle.</li>
            <li>It was a sweet and clean scent.</li>
            <li>Would recommend this if you like a clean, sweet, fruity scent.</li>
            <li>The price is pretty much reasonable and the shape of it looks cute!</li>
            <li>This is my special parfume.  </li>
            <li>I particularly love this for the major points that I get every time I gift her one of these :)</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like this a whole lot better.</li>
            <li>it really 100% authentic.</li>
            <li>It smells sweet</li>
            <li>It is so sweet</li>
            <li>Super buen perfume a mi esposa le encanto mucho por la pronta entrega el envase y el olor es espectacular y muy rico</li>
            <li>So light and pretty.</li>
            <li>Even my husband, who generally doesn&#x27;t appreciate perfume, was impressed :) Subtle, sensual, light -</li>
            <li>Such a lovely mixture of sweet, fruit, floral, light woods...</li>
            <li>A great summer fragrance, and does well for everyday wear.</li>
            <li>Great for everyday wear, all seasons.</li>
            <li>Not too over powering and the scent makes me smile.</li>
            <li>as expected , good product , recommended.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this perfume, soft floral notes with almost a hint of citrus.  </li>
            <li>I fell in love with this when I first tried it several years ago, and it remains my absolute favorite.  </li>
            <li>She smelled good the other day.</li>
            <li>My bad...I should have known right away when the bottle wasn&#x27;t Lalique.</li>
            <li>The bottle and color is eye catching and pretty enough to sit out and be decorative.</li>
            <li>Such a sweet and sexy smell.</li>
            <li>but they stopped selling it, i dont know why because it smells better or the same than any other good brand like chanel or estee lauder.</li>
            <li>Would love to buy few more give it as a gift to my sister.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have that real sweet smell that so many of the main streams seem to force down people&#x27;s throats these days.  </li>
            <li>Very well packed!</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>It was the first fragrance I encountered that did not give me a nauseating migraine.</li>
            <li>I ended up purchasing it for my sister who is an avid perfume collector.</li>
            <li>A reorder for me, but was delivered as promised and much cheaper than in stores!</li>
            <li>The apple bottle looks pretty.</li>
            <li>Will continue to purchase more in the future</li>
            <li>They launched Nina more recently.</li>
            <li>And obviously there is the lovely apple as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Overall pleased with the entire product as well as the transaction, loved this brand, and the timely arrival,excited for my next purchase!!!</li>
            <li>Brand new in box shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>I wish it were a little stronger but all in all one of my favorite scents!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very long lasting on me but something nice to apply when stepping out on a Fall evening.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t know the old one and are familiar with this new configuration, then go at it.</li>
            <li>fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell if she&#x27;s using it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satistifed with this product.</li>
            <li>My wife really like it</li>
            <li>thak you sooooooo much</li>
            <li>It is such a light and feminine fragrance, and my husband just loves it.</li>
            <li>It is very flowery...</li>
            <li>but I wear a lot of citrus smells and lemon does really</li>
            <li>so much I buy it for gifts as well as for myself.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s got a fresh apple top note, and then middle notes are flowery and the dry down is warm and spicy.</li>
            <li>Clearly, Nina??? NOT!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overwhelming and quite nice.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a new perfume scent to wear, and settled on Prada...and then found the Nina perfume!  </li>
            <li>I love to shop at Amazon more exclusive and if something happens or I get something wrong</li>
            <li>Smells great, but doesn&#x27;t last long as expected.</li>
            <li>In fact, I would highly recommend this scent to others.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS COLOGNE.</li>
            <li>I used to love the distinctive fragrance of L&#x27;Air du Temps from Nina Ricci although it was a little too &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; for me given it was launched decades ago and my mom used it.</li>
            <li>Smells sweet and fresh, but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>of course I am a big fan of buying stuff from amazon, so the same usual great delivery and packing etc.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get this perfume at any of the stores where I live anymore, so I have to order it here.  </li>
            <li>This is one of my absolute favorites, but it is hard to find in the stores any more.  </li>
            <li>I love this fragrance and usually buy it in a department store.  </li>
            <li>If your significant other doesn&#x27;t want your attention, don&#x27;t buy this stuff.</li>
            <li>I get my box the next day most of the time, and there is no quality issue whatsoever like when I have ordered Nina from other sellers.</li>
            <li>It came at the time, I love the perfume, it&#x27;s very expensive in my country, so I love this</li>
            <li>The scent is also very long lasting which is a huge benefit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This perfume comes in the cutest bottle- a lovely little red apple.</li>
            <li>2.7-Ounces - on the last week of January&#x27;11, and was very disappointed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smell fades faster than the ones you buy directly at the store.</li>
            <li>My husband wants a male version of it !!!!</li>
            <li>I cannot wear musks (I smell like an old person)</li>
            <li>but if she loses that top then shes screwed..</li>
            <li>I was surprised that this perfume has incense and spice tones in the dry down on me and wasn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li>slightly sweet and fruity, subtle and pretty</li>
            <li>The glass container it comes in is cute and a little squirt of the product goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I was worried that the scent would not be as fresh due to the fact that I can no longer find it.</li>
            <li>The apple note is very pleasant, but there are weird sharp overtones that seem to overpower everything, especially the apple.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re expecting the same light, airy scent that was originally created by Nina Ricci, you&#x27;re in for a big and very rude awakening.</li>
            <li>The bottle is fabulous and having dropped it twice, as the cap sometimes get stuck and I pulled too hard, I realized it does not break</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this perfume for past few years and it&#x27;s just amazing.</li>
            <li>I am not very fond of perfumes or colognes in general, but this scent really caught my attention.</li>
            <li>The product arrived much faster than I expected.  </li>
            <li>The bottle top was broken.</li>
            <li>It is hard to recommend parfums that we buy online since we never know if they are or not the original fragance.</li>

            <li> wear it for work (I teach) but it could easily be a nice nighttime perfume as well.</li>
            <li> This is a sickeningly sweet re-formulation of what was a beautiful waft of spring.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t apply it for a special date night but great for group outings where you don&#x27;t want to smell too</li>

            <li> and it&#x27;s good for sweet girls</li>

            <li> great price and was delivered immediately ... highly recommend</li>
            <li> thank you very much , and received the product, all in good condition.</li>
            <li> I got what I was expecting, 80 ml Nina Ricci Nina, perfect smell for a long time.</li>
            <li> Very sweet smelling.</li>
            <li> Got here safe and sound.</li>
            <li> sure you will enjoy this</li>
            <li> It smells great, the quality is awesome, it last long time</li>
            <li> I was happy to find her a gift that was not only aesthetically pleasing to the senses, it did not possess the nauseating effect that most perfumes have on folks with a sensitivity to smells.</li>
            <li> Such a beautiful bottle and a heaven sent smell.  </li>
            <li> One of my favorite perfumes, arrived quickly</li>
            <li> I am always told how nice I smell, but you know that comes with the territory of not wearing perfumes that contain so much alcohol in it.  </li>
            <li> I buy this every year as a gift for my mom,this is the 3rd time i ordered, always happy with my purchase, i used to buy at the mall</li>
            <li> and this is a fantastic deal.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this scent &amp; get a lot of compliments on it.</li>
            <li> This cologne is sweet and spicy without being overwhelming or sickly sweet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally, I like the Nina L&#x27;Elixir more, but it is much brighter and more of a daytime perfume.</li>
            <li> and I also love the smell of it because it reminds me of when we first got together.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife because i was already familiar with the sent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a very pleasant and subtle fragrance in a stylish bottle.</li>
            <li> It was a sweet and clean scent.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this if you like a clean, sweet, fruity scent.</li>
            <li> The price is pretty much reasonable and the shape of it looks cute!</li>
            <li> This is my special parfume.  </li>
            <li> I particularly love this for the major points that I get every time I gift her one of these :)</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like this a whole lot better.</li>
            <li> it really 100% authentic.</li>
            <li> It smells sweet</li>
            <li> It is so sweet</li>
            <li> Super buen perfume a mi esposa le encanto mucho por la pronta entrega el envase y el olor es espectacular y muy rico</li>
            <li> So light and pretty.</li>
            <li> Even my husband, who generally doesn&#x27;t appreciate perfume, was impressed :) Subtle, sensual, light -</li>
            <li> Such a lovely mixture of sweet, fruit, floral, light woods...</li>
            <li> A great summer fragrance, and does well for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> Great for everyday wear, all seasons.</li>
            <li> Not too over powering and the scent makes me smile.</li>
            <li> as expected , good product , recommended.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this perfume, soft floral notes with almost a hint of citrus.  </li>
            <li> I fell in love with this when I first tried it several years ago, and it remains my absolute favorite.  </li>
            <li> She smelled good the other day.</li>
            <li> My bad...I should have known right away when the bottle wasn&#x27;t Lalique.</li>
            <li> The bottle and color is eye catching and pretty enough to sit out and be decorative.</li>
            <li> Such a sweet and sexy smell.</li>
            <li> but they stopped selling it, i dont know why because it smells better or the same than any other good brand like chanel or estee lauder.</li>
            <li> Would love to buy few more give it as a gift to my sister.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have that real sweet smell that so many of the main streams seem to force down people&#x27;s throats these days.  </li>
            <li> Very well packed!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> It was the first fragrance I encountered that did not give me a nauseating migraine.</li>
            <li> I ended up purchasing it for my sister who is an avid perfume collector.</li>
            <li> A reorder for me, but was delivered as promised and much cheaper than in stores!</li>
            <li> The apple bottle looks pretty.</li>
            <li> Will continue to purchase more in the future</li>
            <li> They launched Nina more recently.</li>
            <li> And obviously there is the lovely apple as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Overall pleased with the entire product as well as the transaction, loved this brand, and the timely arrival,excited for my next purchase!!!</li>
            <li> Brand new in box shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I wish it were a little stronger but all in all one of my favorite scents!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very long lasting on me but something nice to apply when stepping out on a Fall evening.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t know the old one and are familiar with this new configuration, then go at it.</li>
            <li> fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell if she&#x27;s using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satistifed with this product.</li>
            <li> My wife really like it</li>
            <li> thak you sooooooo much</li>
            <li> It is such a light and feminine fragrance, and my husband just loves it.</li>
            <li> It is very flowery...</li>
            <li> but I wear a lot of citrus smells and lemon does really</li>
            <li> so much I buy it for gifts as well as for myself.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s got a fresh apple top note, and then middle notes are flowery and the dry down is warm and spicy.</li>
            <li> Clearly, Nina??? NOT!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overwhelming and quite nice.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a new perfume scent to wear, and settled on Prada...and then found the Nina perfume!  </li>
            <li> I love to shop at Amazon more exclusive and if something happens or I get something wrong</li>
            <li> Smells great, but doesn&#x27;t last long as expected.</li>
            <li> In fact, I would highly recommend this scent to others.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS COLOGNE.</li>
            <li> I used to love the distinctive fragrance of L&#x27;Air du Temps from Nina Ricci although it was a little too &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; for me given it was launched decades ago and my mom used it.</li>
            <li> Smells sweet and fresh, but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> of course I am a big fan of buying stuff from amazon, so the same usual great delivery and packing etc.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get this perfume at any of the stores where I live anymore, so I have to order it here.  </li>
            <li> This is one of my absolute favorites, but it is hard to find in the stores any more.  </li>
            <li> I love this fragrance and usually buy it in a department store.  </li>
            <li> If your significant other doesn&#x27;t want your attention, don&#x27;t buy this stuff.</li>
            <li> I get my box the next day most of the time, and there is no quality issue whatsoever like when I have ordered Nina from other sellers.</li>
            <li> It came at the time, I love the perfume, it&#x27;s very expensive in my country, so I love this</li>
            <li> The scent is also very long lasting which is a huge benefit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This perfume comes in the cutest bottle- a lovely little red apple.</li>
            <li> 2.7-Ounces - on the last week of January&#x27;11, and was very disappointed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smell fades faster than the ones you buy directly at the store.</li>
            <li> My husband wants a male version of it !!!!</li>
            <li> I cannot wear musks (I smell like an old person)</li>
            <li> but if she loses that top then shes screwed..</li>
            <li> I was surprised that this perfume has incense and spice tones in the dry down on me and wasn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li> slightly sweet and fruity, subtle and pretty</li>
            <li> The glass container it comes in is cute and a little squirt of the product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I was worried that the scent would not be as fresh due to the fact that I can no longer find it.</li>
            <li> The apple note is very pleasant, but there are weird sharp overtones that seem to overpower everything, especially the apple.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re expecting the same light, airy scent that was originally created by Nina Ricci, you&#x27;re in for a big and very rude awakening.</li>
            <li> The bottle is fabulous and having dropped it twice, as the cap sometimes get stuck and I pulled too hard, I realized it does not break</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this perfume for past few years and it&#x27;s just amazing.</li>
            <li> I am not very fond of perfumes or colognes in general, but this scent really caught my attention.</li>
            <li> The product arrived much faster than I expected.  </li>
            <li> The bottle top was broken.</li>
            <li> It is hard to recommend parfums that we buy online since we never know if they are or not the original fragance.</li>
            <li> Think this was probably soem old stock as the smell was a bit off other bottles I have.  </li>
            <li> It lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent does not last long compared with the one I had in the past</li>
            <li> And it arrived the day as expected.</li>
            <li> is at least this much for the small bottle.</li>
            <li> Subtle, yet classy, if that is a smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> same quality and product as purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> Compared to other places where you can buy this bottle, this was a bargain.</li>
            <li> If the apple note was stronger and the sharp notes weaker</li>
            <li> Just as I expected!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to find here locally and prices vary widely as result.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be a display item or even a fake one.&lt;br /&gt;I am really surprised given the reviews above!</li>
            <li> This is the scent I would choose to wear for the rest of my life if I was forced to use only one perfume until the end of time.</li>
            <li> this is a gift and the box looked old and dusty  </li>
            <li> and there were black tint all over the bottle.</li>
            <li> Smell didnt last long, maybe is a fake verson</li>
            <li> Little lady loves it.</li>
            <li> Seems like it was water with a little scent.  </li>
            <li> ,it is a little bit heavier scent than \\&quot;L&#x27;Air du Temps\\&quot;and maybe a little hint of spice or woods.</li>
            <li> A little dab</li>
            <li> Shipped on time and the bottle size will last for at least a year!</li>
            <li> I decided to buy online when it was not available in the store.  </li>
            <li> I used to wear this scent long time ago, at first I&#x27;m kinda skeptical about ordering this product, but it proved me wrong</li>
            <li> It was a waste of time, and all this for the ineptitude of those who did the packing.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> And she is not easy to please.</li>
            <li> For the past 4 years she is been using bottles and bottles of it.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day and needs no refreshing.  </li>
            <li> Waste of time and money!</li>
            <li> The contend leaked in the package because the valve was broken so it had less that the 2.7 ozin</li>
            <li> I have allergies and a lot of perfumes make it hard for me to breathe, but not this one.</li>
            <li> What a big disappointment.  </li>
            <li> And it is not overpowering at all, a complaint that I have against a lot of woman&#x27;s perfume.&lt;br</li>
            <li> no more getting that out of the bottle!</li>
            <li> It was not only already used but also in bad shape for selling.</li>
            <li> The package came without the wraping paper and the valve of the parfum was broken.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve smelled this perfum before, at stores, so, at the time I smelled the perfume, I realized it&#x27;s not original!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad they don&#x27;t sell it in the stores anymore</li>
            <li> I get complimented on it by random strangers all the time.  </li>
            <li> The perfume came in a broken bottle!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look fake to</li>
            <li> the scent is very vague</li>
            <li> This made me physically sick.</li>
            <li> i wish that policy was stated during checkout. :(  </li>
            <li> It has a wonder scent with a cedar base tone.</li>
            <li> Horrible item &amp; customer service from Amazon.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this perfume for past few years and it&#x27;s just amazing.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent.  I have been wearing it for years and I always get compliments on how good I smell.  Not too over powering and the scent makes me smile.</li>
            <li> Excellent, exactly as described! Very well packed!</li>
            <li> Yes I love this perfume.</li>
            <li> Order is as described.  Fast delivery! Shipped immediately and arrived quickly, great price.  Perfume is as amazing as if I were to have bought it at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite scents, and the price was great.  The product arrived much faster than I expected.  I am glad I purchased online.</li>
            <li> Uno de los mejores perfumes...</li>
            <li> I am satisfied by the product</li>
            <li> I am not very fond of perfumes or colognes in general, but this scent really caught my attention. It was the first fragrance I encountered that did not give me a nauseating migraine. It was a sweet and clean scent. I ended up purchasing it for my sister who is an avid perfume collector. I was happy to find her a gift that was not only aesthetically pleasing to the senses, it did not possess the nauseating effect that most perfumes have on folks with a sensitivity to smells. In fact, I would highly recommend this scent to others.</li>
            <li> I received this item - Nina By Nina Ricci For Women. Eau De Toilette Spray 2.7-Ounces - on the last week of January&#x27;11, and was very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;The scent does not last long compared with the one I had in the past and there were black tint all over the bottle. It seems to be a display item or even a fake one.&lt;br /&gt;I am really surprised given the reviews above!</li>
            <li> I love this scent, great deal!</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume. Everyone comments on how great it smells. I&#x27;m sad they don&#x27;t sell it in the stores anymore</li>
            <li> A reorder for me, but was delivered as promised and much cheaper than in stores!</li>
            <li> My wife has been an ardent fan of this perfume for a couple of years now, ever since I picked one up at the Heathrow duty free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very pleasant and subtle fragrance in a stylish bottle. I particularly love this for the major points that I get every time I gift her one of these :)</li>
            <li> Got here safe and sound. Little lady loves it. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Smell fades faster than the ones you buy directly at the store.</li>
            <li> great product. fast delivery. very good packaging.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> thank you very much , and received the product, all in good condition.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite fragrance. I use this all the time and get so many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> as expected , good product , recommended.</li>
            <li> this product was amazing. I loved the smell of it. its a perfect gift. perfect size as well. I just love it</li>
            <li> Perfect for a thank you gift.....</li>
            <li> I got this for my girlfriend. It was supposed to be a Christmas gift but didn&#x27;t get it to her until January. I can&#x27;t really tell if she&#x27;s using it. I&#x27;ll ask her. She smelled good the other day. Maybe it was this. But she smells good all the time.</li>
            <li> My Wife is a &#x27;devoted&#x27; to this perfume. For the past 4 years she is been using bottles and bottles of it. A fruity and floral combination, which is very pleasant and gentle on the skin</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance and usually buy it in a department store.  It lasts all day and needs no refreshing.  I decided to buy online when it was not available in the store.  What a big disappointment.  Ten minutes after applying there is no indication that I ever applied a fragrance. I would have to re-apply every ten minutes in order have even a whiff of the scent.  Seems like it was water with a little scent.  I will never buy a fragrance product online again. I will stick to the department store for future purchases.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume. It has a wonder scent with a cedar base tone.</li>
            <li> Horrible item &amp; customer service from Amazon. I would not recommend item or Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is my special parfume.  I am very glad that I can find it in Amazon, you also provide a great and super fast service.  The parfum is delicious.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It&#x27;s the only scent I wear since the day I discovered it. Everyone compliments my parfume all the time. And men love it!</li>
            <li> Smells sweet and fresh, but doesn&#x27;t last long. A good summer scent, but I won&#x27;t buy it again because of how quickly it fades.</li>
            <li> This cologne is sweet and spicy without being overwhelming or sickly sweet. I also use Coach-Poppy and it has similar undertones. A great summer fragrance, and does well for everyday wear. It lasts a long time. I bought this product on Amazon because of the great price for the size of the bottle. Most retail places I have priced this -it is at least this much for the small bottle. This is the larger bottle. Shipping service was impeccable and timely. Great job once again, Amazon!</li>
            <li> Its a freshly smell give u a feeling of happiness irrecommend this perfume for a day n morning&#x27;s time in luv with it</li>
            <li> This product buy the gift for Valentine&#x27;s Day to my wife, and already using. Est wonder, very happy. The product is very good, I recommend it 100%, Greetings ...</li>
            <li> Overall pleased with the entire product as well as the transaction, loved this brand, and the timely arrival,excited for my next purchase!!!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite perfumes, arrived quickly</li>
            <li> Great scent.  I was worried that the scent would not be as fresh due to the fact that I can no longer find it. Totally happy with it!</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this perfume, soft floral notes with almost a hint of citrus.  this is my go to scent for date night.</li>
            <li> It came at the time, I love the perfume, it&#x27;s very expensive in my country, so I love this, everyone ask me for the name...</li>
            <li> I love this scent for my wife, Its one of those perfumes where your like &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; , and I have a &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; wife so they go hand in hand</li>
            <li> In love with the fragance, it&#x27;s drive everybody attention.</li>
            <li> The apple bottle looks pretty. If you are planing to buy it for re-selling or for a gift it will works. It is hard to recommend parfums that we buy online since we never know if they are or not the original fragance. I prefer to go to Macy&#x27;s, tyry it and after that buy it, if it is for me.</li>
            <li> One of my very favorite perfumes! Always lovely</li>
            <li> same quality and product as purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume! I&#x27;ve worn it for 5+ years and it is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I have worn this fragrance for years.  slightly sweet and fruity, subtle and pretty</li>
            <li> Really great smell. I bought it for my girlfriend, and she loved it!!!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume. Always get compliments whenever I wear it</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter as a gift. The bottle and color is eye catching and pretty enough to sit out and be decorative. Excellent value for the price in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Bought this for the wife -- it&#x27;s her favorite perfume, and I love the way it smells on her.  It doesn&#x27;t have that real sweet smell that so many of the main streams seem to force down people&#x27;s throats these days.  Subtle, yet classy, if that is a smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to find here locally and prices vary widely as result.  Glad Amazon is offering this.  I will buy again for her.</li>
            <li> Bought this for the wife and she loves it...this has a,sweet sexy smell.  This is one that the only place I can find it is on Amazon.</li>
            <li> If you like Nina Ricci perfumes then you will like this one,it is a little bit heavier scent than \\&quot;L&#x27;Air du Temps\\&quot;and maybe a little hint of spice or woods.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get this perfume at any of the stores where I live anymore, so I have to order it here.  It is hands down the best smelling perfume I own!  I get complimented on it by random strangers all the time.  I have also gotten a couple of friends and my daughters teacher hooked on it too.</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD, SERVICE EXCELENT</li>
            <li> very original. recommend the product. very good fragrance.</li>
            <li> This perfume is so great. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell of it.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend too much!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure you will like also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting this fragrance for years.  Now that I have it it does quite smell the way I&#x27;d hope.</li>
            <li> As expected, bought to replenish my old bottle.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells SO good. If your significant other doesn&#x27;t want your attention, don&#x27;t buy this stuff. Compared to other places where you can buy this bottle, this was a bargain.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this two years ago and it would not leave my mind. This stuff is spectacular!</li>
            <li> Such a sweet and sexy smell. I can not walk by someone without them saying how good I smell.</li>
            <li> This perfume comes in the cutest bottle- a lovely little red apple. I&#x27;m not so fond of the scent, however. The apple note is very pleasant, but there are weird sharp overtones that seem to overpower everything, especially the apple. If the apple note was stronger and the sharp notes weaker I&#x27;d like this a whole lot better.</li>
            <li> Love the smell. great buy. delivery on schedule.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. I&#x27;m very satistifed with this product. I&#x27;ve used this perfume for years now and have no issues.</li>
            <li> Excelente producto! Todo en orden... Recomendado totalmente! Todo el proceso resulto satisfactorio, no hay nada de lo que pueda quejarme.</li>
            <li> I used to wear this scent long time ago, at first I&#x27;m kinda skeptical about ordering this product, but it proved me wrong it really 100% authentic. And it arrived the day as expected.</li>
            <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite perfume.  It&#x27;s not overwhelming and quite nice.  The bottle is a beautiful addition to any dresser or vanity!</li>
            <li> Super buen perfume a mi esposa le encanto mucho por la pronta entrega el envase y el olor es espectacular y muy rico</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this</li>
            <li> Nice perfum. My wife really like it</li>
            <li> These are by far my wifeâ€™s best perfumes.  Smells good.</li>
            <li> Mom loved it and it smells truly amazing. Just the smell for her. And she is not easy to please. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I just receive it today!!!!! thak you sooooooo much</li>
            <li> my favorite scent.  great price and was delivered immediately ... highly recommend</li>
            <li> Just as described... works great!!</li>
            <li> One of my all time favorites. Very sweet smelling.</li>
            <li> One of my favorites perfumes of all, a great smell in a great bottle.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved it!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume! It smells great, the quality is awesome, it last long time and I always get compliments.</li>
            <li> Fantastic! Even my husband, who generally doesn&#x27;t appreciate perfume, was impressed :) Subtle, sensual, light - I even couldn&#x27;t suppose how good it was.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this if you like a clean, sweet, fruity scent. The glass container it comes in is cute and a little squirt of the product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> excellent service, would recommend</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for a friend and was just what they were looking for, very good product and great fragrance.</li>
            <li> My gf just loves it, hence I bought it for her twice. She smells great when she wears this. And it is not overpowering at all, a complaint that I have against a lot of woman&#x27;s perfume.&lt;br /&gt;And of course I am a big fan of buying stuff from amazon, so the same usual great delivery and packing etc.</li>
            <li> The perfume came in a broken bottle! I bought this perfume for a birthday! and I could not change it. It was a waste of time, and all this for the ineptitude of those who did the packing. Waste of time and money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve smelled this perfum before, at stores, so, at the time I smelled the perfume, I realized it&#x27;s not original!!!!</li>
            <li> My favorite.  They no longer sell this porduct at Carsons or Maceys  shame shame.  The price I got it for, remarkable.  Such a beautiful bottle and a heaven sent smell.  A little dab a do you.  I am always told how nice I smell, but you know that comes with the territory of not wearing perfumes that contain so much alcohol in it.  I am................... In-Love-Nina</li>
            <li> I gave this gift of perfume for my girlfriend, and just loved it. It&#x27;s a great perfume, with excellent fixation, extending the skin per hour.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure you will enjoy this classic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for the warm climate of Brazil.</li>
            <li> I have worn this for years and love love love it.  I always get complimented on my scent and people ask what it is and where they can find it.</li>
            <li> This is the scent I would choose to wear for the rest of my life if I was forced to use only one perfume until the end of time. Amazon has the cheapest price, with Prime I get my box the next day most of the time, and there is no quality issue whatsoever like when I have ordered Nina from other sellers.</li>
            <li> This is a perfume my girlfriend had been wanting for quite some time and after I got it for her I understood why, it is awesome!</li>
            <li> I buy this every year as a gift for my mom,this is the 3rd time i ordered, always happy with my purchase, i used to buy at the mall but they stopped selling it, i dont know why because it smells better or the same than any other good brand like chanel or estee lauder. I personally buy estee lauder for myself, but only because i dont want to wear the same perfume as my mom. She gets compliments all the time,( for 3-4 years now) about how good she smells. All women get jeolous and want to know where does she get it!</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted this perfume for three years so I finally got it for her this year and she was over the moon about it</li>
            <li> Just as I expected! My favorite fragrance! Shipped on time and the bottle size will last for at least a year!</li>
            <li> The price is pretty much reasonable and the shape of it looks cute! My favorite apple shape LOL~ It smells sweet and it&#x27;s good for sweet girls</li>
            <li> Delivered fastly, nice product</li>
            <li> this is a gift and the box looked old and dusty  I did not open the box  I hope the prfume is how  I know it to be</li>
            <li> She loves it, it is her favorite perfume, and I like it too! I have allergies and a lot of perfumes make it hard for me to breathe, but not this one.</li>
            <li> smooth product in perfect condition</li>
            <li> Amazing perfume. My husband wants a male version of it !!!!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PERFUME!!! I get compliments all the time when I wear it!!</li>
            <li> I always get compliments when I wear this. It is such a light and feminine fragrance, and my husband just loves it. When I run out he makes me buy more!</li>
            <li> No tengo quejas, se me envi&amp;oacute; lo que esperaba, en el tiempo requerido. el producto es excelente.&lt;br /&gt;Espero otras promociones como estas</li>
            <li> Love this perfume, it is light and refreshing - not overpowering at all - pleasant to smell. Will continue to purchase more in the future</li>
            <li> smells good however the scent is very vague I would suggest the L&#x27;Elixir perfume better dont bother getting this one get Nina&#x27;s stronger apple one</li>
            <li> My wife love this perfume. Smells great</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new perfume scent to wear, and settled on Prada...and then found the Nina perfume!  I absolutely love the lighter fragrance for the spring and summer time.  It is very flowery...and this is a fantastic deal.</li>
            <li> The package came without the wraping paper and the valve of the parfum was broken. Conclusion: It was not only already used but also in bad shape for selling. The contend leaked in the package because the valve was broken so it had less that the 2.7 ozin it. I DON&#x27;T RECOMEND!</li>
            <li> My wife started wearing it one year now I won&#x27;t let her stop. It smells of love, beauty, and sex.</li>
            <li> I love to shop at Amazon more exclusive and if something happens or I get something wrong Amazon has always made me free and better; acquires another company uses Amazon are excellent, Amazon is always an excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;this fragrance, for example, I love the way all I can even give gende and love and is also author of Through Amazon, as well as any product I buy, is truly exquisite.</li>
            <li> I got what I was expecting, 80 ml Nina Ricci Nina, perfect smell for a long time. Seems to be made in France, bar-code shows the same.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this when I first tried it several years ago, and it remains my absolute favorite.  Such a lovely mixture of sweet, fruit, floral, light woods...it&#x27;s just so very lovely.  Great for everyday wear, all seasons.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the product. It&#x27;s my girlfriend&#x27;s favorite perfume and I also love the smell of it because it reminds me of when we first got together. The product was well packaged and it cam a lot sooner than the delivery date given. I&#x27;m very happy with the product and the distributor.</li>
            <li> Speedy shipping and a very excellent price! This is my favorite perfume, I love it!!! I recommend this to everyone who likes to smell amazing.</li>
            <li> MY DAUGHTER LOVE THE COLOGNE. THE SMELL IS KIND OF SMOOTH. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS COLOGNE.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife because i was already familiar with the sent. I have to say, I was not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;ordered from amazon.com warehouse. Doesn&#x27;t look fake to me.&lt;br /&gt;i love this scent.</li>
            <li> I used to love the distinctive fragrance of L&#x27;Air du Temps from Nina Ricci although it was a little too &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; for me given it was launched decades ago and my mom used it. They launched Nina more recently. This fragrance smells like fall and winter - toffee apples and cinnamon spice. Warm and spicy. It&#x27;s not very long lasting on me but something nice to apply when stepping out on a Fall evening. The bottle is fabulous and having dropped it twice, as the cap sometimes get stuck and I pulled too hard, I realized it does not break easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got a fresh apple top note, and then middle notes are flowery and the dry down is warm and spicy. It&#x27;s like taking a walk in an apple orchard in the fall. Despite all the crafting, it&#x27;s not too distinctive. It&#x27;s just nice. I wouldn&#x27;t apply it for a special date night but great for group outings where you don&#x27;t want to smell too overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;Top Notes: Calabrian Lemon, Caipirinha Lime&lt;br /&gt;Middle Notes: Peony Petals, Moonflower, Vanilla-infused Red Toffee Apple&lt;br /&gt;Base Notes: Applewood, White Cedar</li>
            <li> I bought this without ever having smelled it and was very pleased at what I got!&lt;br /&gt;This is a gorgeous smell. I cannot wear musks (I smell like an old person) but I wear a lot of citrus smells and lemon does really well on me.&lt;br /&gt;So I was surprised that this perfume has incense and spice tones in the dry down on me and wasn&#x27;t overwhelming. And obviously there is the lovely apple as well.&lt;br /&gt;I wear it for work (I teach) but it could easily be a nice nighttime perfume as well. The scent is also very long lasting which is a huge benefit.&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I like the Nina L&#x27;Elixir more, but it is much brighter and more of a daytime perfume.</li>
            <li> The bottle top was broken. And also a package was opened. I don&#x60;t recommend this product. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This is one of my absolute favorites, but it is hard to find in the stores any more.  Everybody compliments it everywhere I go.  So light and pretty. It is a staple for me</li>
            <li> Think this was probably soem old stock as the smell was a bit off other bottles I have.  The box came and soem had spilled as well.  woudl not recommend</li>
            <li> Smell didnt last long, maybe is a fake verson</li>
            <li> Brand new in box shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this scent and this was a GREAT deal!</li>
            <li> El articulo perfecto. Me gusto bastante. Lo recomiendo 100%. Es de buena calidad. Si volver&amp;iacute;a a comprarle a este vendedor.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend and after the first time using it the spray top broke!! Are you kidding me! It still works but if she loses that top then shes screwed.. no more getting that out of the bottle!</li>
            <li> Una sola palabra riqu&amp;iacute;simo</li>
            <li> Recipient was estatic!!</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift to my wife, she loves the fragrance. Would love to buy few more give it as a gift to my sister.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite lady perfumes. Smells great on my wife!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Nina for over 30 years. If you&#x27;re expecting the same light, airy scent that was originally created by Nina Ricci, you&#x27;re in for a big and very rude awakening. This is a sickeningly sweet re-formulation of what was a beautiful waft of spring. This made me physically sick. If you don&#x27;t know the old one and are familiar with this new configuration, then go at it. Otherwise, farewell, \\&quot;Nina.\\&quot; This is not what you&#x27;re looking for. My bad...I should have known right away when the bottle wasn&#x27;t Lalique. Clearly, Nina??? NOT!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scent whenever I wear it I get compliments. It is fruity and sweet, and smells awesome with my chemistry.</li>
            <li> I love the this scent. It is so sweet and I always get complimented on how amazing it smells. I wish it were a little stronger but all in all one of my favorite scents!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this scent &amp; get a lot of compliments on it. I like it so much I buy it for gifts as well as for myself.</li>
            <li> Smells great, but doesn&#x27;t last long as expected. I brought the larger bottle thinking that it would work as it did before. And Amazon does not except returns for perfumes.....i wish that policy was stated during checkout. :(  So from now on i will be buying perfume in the store.</li>
