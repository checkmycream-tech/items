            <li>I did not realize the significant amount of almond oil that is in the salve.  </li>

            <li>It works very well if you can stand the the scent of this salve, I however can not :) so I now use tea tree oil ointment for his face and its working out</li>

            <li>To my surprise the slave worked great the redness and soreness clear within in two days and the smell of the slave is securely hidden inside his diaper :) .</li>
            <li>The ingredients are simple and it absorbs into the skin nicely.</li>
            <li>The container I got was filled completely to the top, so no joking around on how much product you get.</li>
            <li>Anyway, my son rarely gets diaper rash..</li>
            <li>Oh well, was worth a try.</li>
            <li>so I feel it will be useful.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth the results you get.  </li>
            <li>Had tried other types of Neem salves I found this to be just as good and the price was right.  </li>
            <li>Oz is once again right about what works.</li>
            <li>Salve is soft in the tin and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I am very much in favor of naturals.  </li>
            <li>It works, but was hoping it was better than using vaseline or Watkins to heal open sores.</li>
            <li>Like the neem uses, and have used this on various skin breakouts, and even some sunburn and love it.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>After using it regularly it looks a lot better.</li>
            <li>She said it&#x27;s the first time that she had something that would help her stop scratching AND also healed where she had already scratched.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I have it on hand for future needs.</li>
            <li>I only used the salve a couple of times, when I was sure that I would not be around him.  </li>
            <li>Was using the tin can type of salve made by Watkins,  and wanted to try something new, but this stuff isn&#x27;t anything special.</li>

            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent at all.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know what the problem is.</li>
            <li>My son had a diaper rash that became really severe, with blisters that started to bleed.</li>
            <li>Nothing else really worked on it</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>fast delivery.</li>
            <li>This is a healing salve that is nice to keep near my big old chair where I watch t.v.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Product is in a nice tin and is small enough to fit in a pocket.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am impressed and will be taking this with me on my next trip to the dermatologist to show her how a simple salve for under $10 has helped more than the prescription products and expensive over the counter products !</li>
            <li>I just add a small amount of lavender oil for a nice scent.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li>It really helps clear up blemishes.  </li>
            <li>container should last a really long time, I hope I will be able to purchase another when I run out of this salve in probably a year.</li>
            <li>better off with petroleum, does the same for dry skin</li>
            <li>This is an age old remedy in india and I highly suggest this product.</li>
            <li>The only thing I can say is I am totally satisfied by this product and other products I am using.</li>
            <li>But last week he got his first rash of the summer, I didn&#x27;t have rash cream on hand ...</li>
            <li>I bathed him in all kinds of stuff and wiped down the counters with diluted Kleen free spray.  </li>
            <li>I like the way it feels and is easily absorbed in to the dry areas of skin.</li>
            <li>It really is a non issue.&lt;br /&gt;The salve worked very well on my dry elbows.</li>
            <li>sure enough it cleared it up in about a week and half.</li>
            <li>I was actually surprised.</li>
            <li>I far cry form the sensitive skin care products on the market which have tons of ingredients, and had been ineffective for me.</li>
            <li>YOU WANT TO GO NATURAL</li>
            <li>There was one unexpected use that I was thankful for.</li>
            <li>Really does help on face, especially!</li>
            <li>Within seconds, I feel soft skin.  </li>
            <li>Using this directly on eczema then using the lotion I also bought and apply a bandage the change has been a blessing.</li>
            <li>It is not as thick as petroleum jelly, but much better than hand lotion for conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;Works to keep my cuticles and lips from chapping.</li>
            <li>The scent was mild and smelled a little like a cooking herb.</li>
            <li>I like neem anyway, but this was for dry spots on my foot and it worked very well.</li>
            <li>It is an ointment and therefore is greasy but the relief it gives my skin is worth dealing with a little greasiness.</li>
            <li>This soothing formula fixed my exzema in several days.</li>
            <li>It is unbelievable how quickly it works in healing paper cuts, breakouts, etc.</li>
            <li>No, as it&#x27;s all due to her diabetes, but what it has done is give her a tool to keep her hands away from the lesions and not scratch helping them heal at a much faster rate.  </li>
            <li>it was hot here in CA and it arrived a little melted but acceptable as the seal was still in place.</li>
            <li>but petroleum is a lot cheaper, not worth the money, thanks to the&lt;br /&gt;dr.</li>
            <li>I prefer natural products for my little one especially for his sensitive areas.</li>

            <li> This is an age old remedy in india and I highly suggest this product.</li>
            <li> The only thing I can say is I am totally satisfied by this product and other products I am using.</li>
            <li> But last week he got his first rash of the summer, I didn&#x27;t have rash cream on hand ...</li>
            <li> I bathed him in all kinds of stuff and wiped down the counters with diluted Kleen free spray.  </li>
            <li> I like the way it feels and is easily absorbed in to the dry areas of skin.</li>
            <li> It really is a non issue.&lt;br /&gt;The salve worked very well on my dry elbows.</li>
            <li> sure enough it cleared it up in about a week and half.</li>
            <li> I was actually surprised.</li>
            <li> I far cry form the sensitive skin care products on the market which have tons of ingredients, and had been ineffective for me.</li>
            <li> YOU WANT TO GO NATURAL</li>
            <li> There was one unexpected use that I was thankful for.</li>
            <li> Really does help on face, especially!</li>
            <li> Within seconds, I feel soft skin.  </li>
            <li> Using this directly on eczema then using the lotion I also bought and apply a bandage the change has been a blessing.</li>
            <li> It is not as thick as petroleum jelly, but much better than hand lotion for conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;Works to keep my cuticles and lips from chapping.</li>
            <li> The scent was mild and smelled a little like a cooking herb.</li>
            <li> I like neem anyway, but this was for dry spots on my foot and it worked very well.</li>
            <li> It is an ointment and therefore is greasy but the relief it gives my skin is worth dealing with a little greasiness.</li>
            <li> This soothing formula fixed my exzema in several days.</li>
            <li> It is unbelievable how quickly it works in healing paper cuts, breakouts, etc.</li>
            <li> No, as it&#x27;s all due to her diabetes, but what it has done is give her a tool to keep her hands away from the lesions and not scratch helping them heal at a much faster rate.  </li>
            <li> it was hot here in CA and it arrived a little melted but acceptable as the seal was still in place.</li>
            <li> but petroleum is a lot cheaper, not worth the money, thanks to the&lt;br /&gt;dr.</li>
            <li> I prefer natural products for my little one especially for his sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> We are still in early use but feel it equals other slaves or exceeds them.</li>
            <li> I have come to rely on this particular brand of Neem for chapped lips, dry skin, acne, yeast infections, bug bites and any topical skin trouble.  </li>
            <li> My 5 year old son came down with scabies.</li>
            <li> Will be a long term repeat customer.</li>
            <li> So far I have only used the salve to moisturize small areas of  dry skin on elbows and heels.</li>
            <li> i would only  buy it for other things ..</li>
            <li> I have used it on cuts, dry skin, acne, and sunburn.</li>
            <li> Helps dry skin on feet and elbows as well.</li>
            <li> I have a severe case of eczema on my right hand and left foot (weird, huh?)</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit.</li>
            <li> One never really knows what gets rid of scabies, you just know when it and and its after effects or gone.</li>
            <li> During the last few weeks, in my attempt to help stop the itching , i started using this product.</li>
            <li> I use this for rough skin and for insect bites and rashes.</li>
            <li> I found if I use it regulary it only takes a few days for it to work.</li>
            <li> A little of this product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for q few days but the salve is working on my eczema!</li>
            <li> I have been using the container for several weeks and have hardly made a dent in the container.</li>
            <li> But, I decided the chance of the oil causing my grandson harm was not worth it.  </li>
            <li> It is a little container though</li>
            <li> Its healing power exceeds ordinary other creams and salves.</li>
            <li> I used this on a few spots that I have that just don&#x27;t seem to go away.</li>
            <li> no more crying.</li>
            <li> They look like small rashes or irritations on the skin and nothing antifungal, antibiotic, or anything else</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work, claimed to work for psoriasis, it didn&#x27;t do anything for my small patch.  </li>
            <li> Have applied this 5 times a day on my excema (small patch on my face)</li>
            <li> The only reason I give it a four star rating is because it is a little inconvenient to use because of the greasiness</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I learned the hard way that this is not the strongest thing to use when trying to use a birth control .I</li>
            <li> I was not sure about ordering this since several reviewers stated that the smell was bad.</li>
            <li> If I am having a bad break out I will use the cortisone cream and then alternate with the salve.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this will not cure your scabies.</li>
            <li> I am using it on troubled spots on my skin.</li>
            <li> Also seems to work well on cold sores, deters them.  </li>
            <li> Also I recommend TheraNeem mouthwash for cold sores.</li>
            <li> And it DOESN&#x27;T smell bad at all.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very dangerous , damages the skin (this i know) and can hurt their eyes badly if it gets on their eyes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate it, but it does not work!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product works very good. I was actually surprised. It will not perform miracles but it will work. I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> After seeing a program on Dr. Oz, I began using neem products and they are great for skin conditions as well as dental use. The salve is neem suspended in a sunflower oil ~ only 3 ingredients! I far cry form the sensitive skin care products on the market which have tons of ingredients, and had been ineffective for me. After spending hundreds of dollars on creams &amp; lotions and getting no relief, I tried the neem and it eased my symptoms greatly! I am impressed and will be taking this with me on my next trip to the dermatologist to show her how a simple salve for under $10 has helped more than the prescription products and expensive over the counter products ! Neem is an antiviral, antibacterial, and is great for burns, mosquito bites and much much more. Truly a wonderous plantI also purchased neem lotion, face wash and toothpaste. This is an age old remedy in india and I highly suggest this product. Only problem is summer shipping. it was hot here in CA and it arrived a little melted but acceptable as the seal was still in place.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old son came down with scabies. We never scraped for it but given the itching finally spread to his groin..that was the suspicion.  We were lucky to find a dermatologist who diagnosed it right away.  One never really knows what gets rid of scabies, you just know when it and and its after effects or gone. The constant itching just finally subsides.  During the last few weeks, in my attempt to help stop the itching , i started using this product. It&#x27;s odorless and oily .. like a vaniply or an aquafor.  Neem , from what i read, messes up the hormonal response in scabies.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this will not cure your scabies. That requires a doctor&#x27;s attention.  He went through 2 rounds of permithrin , 6days apart and 2 doses of invermectin (stromectol) 14 days apart (he weighs 15kg/ 34 lbs) and then sometime in the 4 weeks after that, the itching subsided but honestly there should be  a support group for surviving this. I tried almost every product associated with the amazon website that helps with scabies except naturasil.  This was the product that seemed to do no harm and maybe it helped but I will never know.  It seemed to soothe.. Also note , he was the only one in the family to have this disease after possibly 5 months of infection. We also washed bedding and vacuumed a bit more than normal. I bathed him in all kinds of stuff and wiped down the counters with diluted Kleen free spray.  Again .. you never will know.. pls dont bathe your child in Kleen free however- it&#x27;s very dangerous , damages the skin (this i know) and can hurt their eyes badly if it gets on their eyes. This is a good product to soothe.  It arrived promptly with 4 tins. You only need a little bit. The tins are the size of a lip salve tin. (they fit in your palm).</li>
            <li> I used this product to prevent pregnancy, as a  birth control product. And it has done the trick! I have been using off and on for a year now, and no kids! Love this product, lasts a long time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I learned the hard way that this is not the strongest thing to use when trying to use a birth control .I have since started using 100% Neem Oil from the same manufacturer. Smell is stronger but it is stronger too. Give that a try instead.</li>
            <li> Used this on bug bites, break outs, you name it, and it really helps it heal almost over night.  I highly recommend this.  It is a little container though</li>
            <li> This product works so well, I am ordering more today for my hubby and some friends, too! It is unbelievable how quickly it works in healing paper cuts, breakouts, etc. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  Came as promised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for q few days but the salve is working on my eczema!</li>
            <li> I seem to have miss placed it cant find it. But im sure I would have liked it</li>
            <li> Was using the tin can type of salve made by Watkins,  and wanted to try something new, but this stuff isn&#x27;t anything special. Its petroleum jell and some neem in it. It works, but was hoping it was better than using vaseline or Watkins to heal open sores. Its just like the others, works the same.</li>
            <li> To be honest I haven&#x27;t used this yet.  I use Neem&#x27;s toothpaste and since I love that so much, I ordered the skin salve also.  I&#x27;m sure I will be pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This salve is fantastic.  I could not find it in my local health store so I took a chance.  The ingredients are simple and it absorbs into the skin nicely.</li>
            <li> I love this salve.  I get cuts on my hands often and there was nothing that would work to heal those cuts, until I got this product.  I put a dab of this on my cut, cover it with a band aid and in 3 days, it&#x27;s healed.  I recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> Our dog has an ear condition that really needed surgery, but the Neem ointment is working so no surgery weill be required!!  Love it.</li>
            <li> The only thing I can say is I am totally satisfied by this product and other products I am using.</li>
            <li> For a Neem salve, I thought this would stink. It doesn&#x27;t have that strong smell like most neem products do. I don&#x27;t mind the smell of neem though. It doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent at all. The container I got was filled completely to the top, so no joking around on how much product you get. I used this on a few spots that I have that just don&#x27;t seem to go away. They look like small rashes or irritations on the skin and nothing antifungal, antibiotic, or anything else works, this got them to start disappearing in a couple days and within a week, they were gone. These are things that will be on my skin for months or as a couple cases, years. It&#x27;s an effect of having lupus.&lt;br /&gt;This container should last a really long time, I hope I will be able to purchase another when I run out of this salve in probably a year. lol</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I found this salve. Like the neem uses, and have used this on various skin breakouts, and even some sunburn and love it. I will probably get more.  would rather use this than burt&#x27;s bees products.</li>
            <li> I thought I requested a replacement for this item. The container received by me had NO smell and was ineffective for any skin issues!</li>
            <li> Best all round cream I&#x27;ve ever used for misc. skin problems.  This is my second order!</li>
            <li> This product worked good but ,it doesnt heal up excema ,at all ,so i wont be buying this for that i would only  buy it for other things ..</li>
            <li> love it, helped scabies and ear ache and sore throat.</li>
            <li> I use this for rough skin and for insect bites and rashes. Clears up all my skin problems. Leaves skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This salve is great for anything. I have used it on cuts, dry skin, acne, and sunburn.</li>
            <li> YOU WANT TO GO NATURAL THIS IS THE BEST SKIN CARE OIL TO HAVE&lt;br /&gt;FOR ITCHING SKIN AND BRUISES I RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> This soothing formula fixed my exzema in several days. I truly adore ayurvedic herbs and neem oil is a force to be reckoned with.</li>
            <li> Those was sealed and packaged well.I am using it on troubled spots on my skin. I will update later if I see results. I bought the faace wash, toothpaste n face pack from different sellers.</li>
            <li> I initially purchased this for my son as a facial moisturizer. It works very well if you can stand the the scent of this salve, I however can not :) so I now use tea tree oil ointment for his face and its working out great I just add a small amount of lavender oil for a nice scent. Anyway, my son rarely gets diaper rash.. But last week he got his first rash of the summer, I didn&#x27;t have rash cream on hand ... so I decided to use Neem-Aura. To my surprise the slave worked great the redness and soreness clear within in two days and the smell of the slave is securely hidden inside his diaper :) . I prefer natural products for my little one especially for his sensitive areas. This salve works well it heals and moisturizes very quickly. It lasts a long time, the price is right, and this is my new swear by ointment for diaper rash :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the Neem Aura works great for preventing bug bites, treating bites and rashes including heat rashhttp://www.amazon.com/Neem-Herbal-Outdoor-Spray-Multi-Pack/dp/B001E0T4S4/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_sbs_bt_10?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;refRID&#x3D;0YJAGPK2HZTVYFC5S0W8</li>
            <li> I like this for the price that I paid for it. I have used better for twice the price. I use it for a lip salve when I&#x27;m outside.</li>
            <li> I was not sure about ordering this since several reviewers stated that the smell was bad. I really don&#x27;t know what the problem is. The scent was mild and smelled a little like a cooking herb. It was not bad at all and I could only smell it when I had the can open. It really is a non issue.&lt;br /&gt;The salve worked very well on my dry elbows. I tend to get exzema patches there. After using it regularly it looks a lot better. If I am having a bad break out I will use the cortisone cream and then alternate with the salve. I have reordered this two times already. I now get the three pack.</li>
            <li> I like neem anyway, but this was for dry spots on my foot and it worked very well.</li>
            <li> better off with petroleum, does the same for dry skin but petroleum is a lot cheaper, not worth the money, thanks to the&lt;br /&gt;dr. Oz show I tried it, didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I first purchased this after reading all the reviews and let me say, I was not disappointed. There was one unexpected use that I was thankful for. My son had a diaper rash that became really severe, with blisters that started to bleed. I was in a panic especially when Desitin wasn&#x27;t working. So I decided to try this salve and the rash was gone by the next day and my son was certainly more comfortable, no more crying. I read later that what he had was actually a yeast infection. Anyways, thank goodness this product was created, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the millions of uses!</li>
            <li> I really liked this stuff.  Very soothing and seemed to heal fast!</li>
            <li> I learned the term neem from one of Dr. Oz&#x27;s show. I have residual water blisters in both of my hands. As soon as I stopped using my steroid cream, the blisters would reappear. I looked here on Amazon and for the price, I decided to give this balm a try. It arrived yesterday. I put on several applications and I&#x27;m amazed this morning. The inflammation has reduced quite a bit. I&#x27;m hopeful that it will continue to work.</li>
            <li> First thing I&#x27;ve ever tried that took care of psoriasis!  And it DOESN&#x27;T smell bad at all.  Smells like chocolate malt. I love it and will continue using it after it was recommended by Dr Oz.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work, claimed to work for psoriasis, it didn&#x27;t do anything for my small patch.  Oh well, was worth a try.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, I initially bought this for my husband psoriasis and have noticed a difference (it works if he applies it ). I keep some in my purse for just in case.</li>
            <li> Have applied this 5 times a day on my excema (small patch on my face) it was better after 24 hours just about gone and its been a week. Awesome!</li>
            <li> I buy this salve for a dear friend who has diabetic lesions.  She has suffered from them for years with nothing to relieve the itching until I stumbled upon this salve.  I gave her a can as a &amp;#34;Happy&amp;#34; and explained the benefits of neem for our skin.  She started using it and loves it.  She said it&#x27;s the first time that she had something that would help her stop scratching AND also healed where she had already scratched.  I have since bought several cans for her and she still swears by it.  Have the lesions stopped? No, as it&#x27;s all due to her diabetes, but what it has done is give her a tool to keep her hands away from the lesions and not scratch helping them heal at a much faster rate.  Excellent product that always packaged carefully and arrives quickly.</li>
            <li> Neemaura Naturals Neem Skin Salve, 1 oz (30 ml). Use this every day. Really does help on face, especially! moisturizes &amp; improves skin on face. Love it!</li>
            <li> This should in no way devalue the product, the only reason I&#x27;m giving 1 star is because I believe I&#x27;m allergic to the product. It caused a burning sensation when I applied it to the rash on my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product, goes on oily at first but soaks in completely very very quickly.  Within seconds, I feel soft skin.  Using on psoriasis with extremely wonderful results!  Will be a long term repeat customer.</li>
            <li> Love this salve.. good for burns, cuts, insect bites, etc</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. May help with arthritis - I have a finger that gets tingly and sore and when I put this on it liberally it seems to make it better for 1-3 days.  Please respond to this review if you have such an experience or not.  Informal study.  Also seems to work well on cold sores, deters them.  Also I recommend TheraNeem mouthwash for cold sores. Neem products are a crucial component of my medical cabinet.</li>
            <li> I have eczema on hands, left foot. The results for my foot using this salve have amazed me. Using this directly on eczema then using the lotion I also bought and apply a bandage the change has been a blessing. The price was very reasonable, delivery was on time, I would recommend this highly for anyone that has eczema who wants to quit cortisone use. This isn&#x27;t a wonder salve for everyone but I&#x27;ve had wonderful results.</li>
            <li> Works well on skin irritations.  Smell is not a factor as some have stated.  Have purchased another since this one.  Helps dry skin on feet and elbows as well.</li>
            <li> This is a healing salve that is nice to keep near my big old chair where I watch t.v.&lt;br /&gt; Now and then I reach over and rub this salve on to my hands and lips.&lt;br /&gt;Dr Oz is once again right about what works.</li>
            <li> good stuff, doesn&#x27;t work quickly though.</li>
            <li> Product is in a nice tin and is small enough to fit in a pocket.&lt;br /&gt;It melts well when touched so that it applies nicely to hands, arms, or face. I used it on my cuticles and lips. Depending on the weather I have used it on my arms, hands and cheeks. Goes on nice. It is not as thick as petroleum jelly, but much better than hand lotion for conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;Works to keep my cuticles and lips from chapping. Easy to use and works well. I had oily skin and now has gone to more dry. I don&#x27;t like oily feel and this salve is a nice weight.</li>
            <li> This salve is great for dry skin. I have a severe case of eczema on my right hand and left foot (weird, huh?) and this product does relieve the symptoms quickly. For a product containing neem, it is very good value. It is an ointment and therefore is greasy but the relief it gives my skin is worth dealing with a little greasiness. A little of this product goes a long way. I have been using the container for several weeks and have hardly made a dent in the container. I will purchase this again and would recommend it to a friend. The only reason I give it a four star rating is because it is a little inconvenient to use because of the greasiness but it is a very good product.</li>
            <li> So far I have only used the salve to moisturize small areas of  dry skin on elbows and heels. I like the way it feels and is easily absorbed in to the dry areas of skin. I am glad I have it on hand for future needs.</li>
            <li> This product has worked well for me. I&#x27;ve been using it for over 8 weeks now. I found if I use it regulary it only takes a few days for it to work. I love it.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the salve and the results</li>
            <li> Had tried other types of Neem salves I found this to be just as good and the price was right.  I will order again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate it, but it does not work! I won&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I did not realize the significant amount of almond oil that is in the salve.  I have a grandson who is allergic to all kinds of nuts, including almonds.  I only used the salve a couple of times, when I was sure that I would not be around him.  It seemed to work well.  But, I decided the chance of the oil causing my grandson harm was not worth it.  I no longer use it.  My mistake in not paying enough attention to the ingredients when shopping for a product.</li>
            <li> Just figured I would give it a shot on my psoriassis and sure enough it cleared it up in about a week and half. Nothing else really worked on it but this did. Amazing! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This stuff soothes instantly.</li>
            <li> I am very much in favor of naturals.  Have not used this product enough to give rating but recommended by Dr Oz so I feel it will be useful.</li>
            <li> Great response for irritated skin and a friend found it helpful for a burn on the back of the hand. While at first thought to be a small amount, it goes a long way as it seems barely used. We are still in early use but feel it equals other slaves or exceeds them. Its healing power exceeds ordinary other creams and salves.</li>
            <li> Salve is soft in the tin and easy to use.  Used it on scratches on my arm and salve helped to heal them.</li>
            <li> Makes mosquito bites disappear in 15 minutes and the itch even faster.  Applied before going out, it keep the insects away</li>
            <li> I have come to rely on this particular brand of Neem for chapped lips, dry skin, acne, yeast infections, bug bites and any topical skin trouble.  The stuff is magic.  It used to be a darker color so I am hoping that the recipe has not changed!&lt;br /&gt;Very fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  It really helps clear up blemishes.  The smell takes some getting used to but it&#x27;s worth the results you get.  Will keep this in my medicine cabinet.  I even showed it to my dermatologist. Please keep it in stock.</li>
    </ol>
