            <li>but I love the fact that you can throw them in the washing machine.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d always imagined there was something out there that was a bit softer and hopefully, more permanent.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought them and will do again when these wear out one day, if they do.  </li>
            <li>Better than the cheapies in the pharmacy style stores.</li>

            <li>Extremely pleased to find these sponges.  </li>
            <li>There seems to be something magical</li>
            <li>They last, wash out easily and allow for excellent application of liquid foundation.  </li>
            <li>Update 4/15/07  Have washed 2 sponges in washing machine and am pleased that they came out just fine.  </li>
            <li>They come out nice and fresh.</li>
            <li>These are sturdy and easy to hold.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smear your foundation around and are easy to wash by hand.  </li>
            <li>Easy application and can be run through the washing machine.</li>
            <li>Easily rinsed after use.  </li>
            <li>Good product, thanks for having available to purchase.  </li>
            <li>Nothing like the cheap wedges or foundation brushes that just move the liquid or cream foundation around.</li>
            <li>These last, they feel great and you can wash them.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re are extremely soft and feel good on my face.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for years for a soft, reusable, good quality makeup sponge</li>
            <li>The important thing is that they were definitely clean.</li>
            <li>May cost a little more but the quality is excellent and they really hold up.</li>
            <li>so friendly in your hand</li>
            <li>Over time they are really worth the money!   </li>
            <li>Soft, plyable and effective.</li>
            <li>Also, they&#x27;re nice and big and an easy shape to hold.</li>
            <li>Lastly, they give such a wonderful finish to your foundation.</li>
            <li>I use them for each phase of my morning routine in order to create a consistent finish and to smooth or buff out and unevenness in coverage.</li>
            <li>Have been looking for a good makeup sponge for a long time.  </li>
            <li>Just drop these babies into your next load and out they&#x27;ll come, nice and clean again.</li>
            <li>These are a little pricy, but great quality.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.    </li>
            <li>These biodegradable sponges respect a sensitive face, yet are sturdy and hold up over many months.</li>
            <li>Did not like this product as it absorbed the make-up rather than blending.</li>
            <li>definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re really worth the money.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I seem to be using more foundation than I used to with my old makeup sponge.  </li>
            <li>I had looked for several years to replace a makeup sponge that I really liked.  </li>
            <li>Just the right size, too.</li>
            <li>This sponge is just the right size and texture for spreading foundation evenly.  </li>
            <li>They are softer and more flexible and they dont sound like a wiper on a dry windshield,</li>
            <li>[ok that may be a bit over the top] about the way these little guys blend foundation, mineral [AKA powder]</li>
            <li>Very good quality sponges for make up, cheaper in Sephora though, found out too late!</li>
            <li>You can wash them over and over and they are like new!!!</li>
            <li>But it works very well!</li>
            <li>And I believe these will be the last, cause I love them.</li>
            <li>Such better quality than drugstore makeup pads.</li>
            <li>Will order more at a later date.</li>
            <li>First, these babies are anti-bacterial.</li>
            <li>Plus they are great price for how long they last.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the foundation seems to be absorbed into the sponge too much &amp; doesn&#x27;t spread very well on my face...</li>
            <li>, they last a very long time and you can throw them in the washer and they hold up nice application for any liquid foundation!</li>
            <li>Ultralon Large Foundation Sponges.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Figure in less waste and fewer trips to the drugstore to buy the cheaper sponges, and it becomes clear that spending more now is a great investment over time.</li>
            <li>They blend my foundation well without absorbing all the product.</li>
            <li>You save from wasting your product that costs so much today.</li>
            <li>so, they work really well.</li>
            <li>As I prefer a lighter application anyway, I&#x27;ve found that this helps blend the foundation into my skin very well.</li>
            <li>I will never go back to cheap drugstore sponges.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many other sponges, trying to avoid purchasing these because there is no Laura Mercier retailer in my immediate are.</li>
            <li>These are good, durable, long lasting, and soft.  </li>
            <li>If you wear a darker colored pigmant of foundation, some color may be left behind but they will still be nice and fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>The size was good; don&#x27;t like the size of those round white ones you buy in the drugstore, so this size was perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The other sponge I washed came out almost totally pink all over but to be fair</li>
            <li>I used to buy way more than $7 a year of those little triangles.    </li>
            <li>I find I have more control than with that little wedge.    </li>
            <li>I like these much better than the little sponge that comes in the compact.  </li>
            <li>compeer to the other product its easy to break they have smell too</li>
            <li>At first I thought the price was expensive for 4 sponges--(I always bought the cheap makeup sponges in the drugstore--they were convenient and cheap)  </li>
            <li>If I new these were out there</li>
            <li>They are man made and very, very soft.  </li>
            <li>Love these sponges I usually buy on LM site</li>
            <li>I do not like using &#x27;natural&#x27; sponges as killing a live entity</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t used that sponge as long as the first one.  </li>
            <li>they hold up very well after being washed after several application uses.</li>
            <li>/&gt;to replace with no luck so far.</li>
            <li>BONUS, if you are gentle in means of washing and drying they will last quite a while.</li>
            <li>If they last as long as some of the reviewers say they do they will be well worth the price.</li>
            <li>However, I ALWAYS return to these regardless of how many other other sponge options may be floating around my make-up area.</li>
            <li>The other reviewer is right on the money.  </li>
            <li>Thick and easy to wash out.</li>
            <li>I wanted a sponge that was bigger and thicker and smoothed my base makeup perfectly.  </li>
            <li>No matter how sloppy my initial application, these sponges are effective in resolving my mistakes.</li>
            <li>I tried the fat teardrop shaped kind and found them hard to use (I actually cut them in half to have a flat side to work with).</li>

            <li> They last a long time too.</li>
            <li> I bought extras thinking they wouldn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> Although more expensive than the usual sponge, these are high quality and four of them will last me for a very long while.  </li>
            <li> Last a very long time.</li>
            <li> would have never wasted all the $ I wasted.</li>
            <li> Like the other reviewers have said these are not like the white pie shape sponge.</li>
            <li> Third, they don&#x27;t crumble when using them like those little white wedges do.</li>
            <li> They can be used moist or dry.</li>
            <li> Once you touch those little white triangles to your face, you have to throw them away because they breed bacteria.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never much cared for makeup sponges, because the disposable triangle versions, the ones you buy in bulk, scratch my face and are a burden on the environment.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years due to a latex sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> The sponges are a little harder than other makeup sponges I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> After their little trip round and round, just let them air dry.     </li>
            <li> It also means I use less foundation over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> they came 2 in&lt;br /&gt;a package that has a dark green background &amp; it says &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; printed on the side.  </li>
            <li> They can be cleaned with a little soap and water.</li>
            <li> a little too stiff</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve always had a hard time blending with other sponges.  </li>
            <li> These makeup sponges are hard to find.  </li>
            <li> No more!  </li>
            <li> Only bad thing is you always get samples on LM site not here.</li>
            <li> They absorb a lot of the makeup, though, so they are not good for application.</li>
            <li> But when I started using these sponges for liquid makeup and one for blush everyday The Quality Can&#x27;t be Beat!!!!  </li>
            <li> and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was wrong!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very happy this these.  They are quality and do not fall apart like the cheaper sponges do.  They blend my foundation well without absorbing all the product.</li>
            <li> Love these sponges.  They&#x27;re are extremely soft and feel good on my face.  Haven&#x27;t washed any yet but I love the fact that you can throw them in the washing machine.  Well worth the money.    Update 4/15/07  Have washed 2 sponges in washing machine and am pleased that they came out just fine.  No difference in texture. One sponge was stained with my makeup but since I only use them for putting on my tinted moisturizer it doesn&#x27;t bother me.  Washed sponges with regular load of clothes so I don&#x27;t know if that makes a difference or not. The other sponge I washed came out almost totally pink all over but to be fair I hadn&#x27;t used that sponge as long as the first one.  The important thing is that they were definitely clean.</li>
            <li> These makeup sponges are hard to find.  They are man made and very, very soft.  I do not like using &#x27;natural&#x27; sponges as killing a live entity is what has to be done.</li>
            <li> Fantastic! These are sturdy and easy to hold. They last a long time too.</li>
            <li> The only way to go to apply makeup, evenly applies your foundation and concealer,(cream or stick). Nothing like the cheap wedges or foundation brushes that just move the liquid or cream foundation around. You save from wasting your product that costs so much today.</li>
            <li> My girl friend loves these!</li>
            <li> Yeah so, they work really well. I use it to put foundation on (haven&#x27;t used for anything else yet) But it works very well! And all I do to clean it is rinse it under some water and squeeze it and suchles and viola! :D</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never much cared for makeup sponges, because the disposable triangle versions, the ones you buy in bulk, scratch my face and are a burden on the environment. I&#x27;d always imagined there was something out there that was a bit softer and hopefully, more permanent. The day I walked up to a Laura Mercier counter, my search ended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sold on texture alone. These biodegradable sponges respect a sensitive face, yet are sturdy and hold up over many months. Since they&#x27;re washable, there&#x27;s no need to worry about bacteria build-up. They absorb quite a bit, but one Mercier makeup artist taught me the neat trick of dampening the sponge a bit with water before squeezing out the foundation. As I prefer a lighter application anyway, I&#x27;ve found that this helps blend the foundation into my skin very well. It also means I use less foundation over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Figure in less waste and fewer trips to the drugstore to buy the cheaper sponges, and it becomes clear that spending more now is a great investment over time. Your face will thank you.</li>
            <li> These sponges are really the best I have every used!!!!  At first I thought the price was expensive for 4 sponges--(I always bought the cheap makeup sponges in the drugstore--they were convenient and cheap)  But when I started using these sponges for liquid makeup and one for blush everyday The Quality Can&#x27;t be Beat!!!!  I wash them everyday with a little dish soap and water and they both come out clean--Thank you, Thank you Laura Mercier!!!!  I will never go back to cheap drugstore sponges.</li>
            <li> And I believe these will be the last, cause I love them. Like the other reviewers have said these are not like the white pie shape sponge. They are softer and more flexible and they dont sound like a wiper on a dry windshield, lol thats how I feel about the white ones. These blend your makeup into your skin evenly and just easier to use. Glad I bought them and will do again when these wear out one day, if they do.  +</li>
            <li> Such better quality than drugstore makeup pads. I love these!</li>
            <li> Did not like this product as it absorbed the make-up rather than blending. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> a little too stiff but it gets the job done</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these sponges for about 6 months and yep they go in the washing machine!  Great texture, easy to work with, and after many washings they have held up great!</li>
            <li> Have been looking for a good makeup sponge for a long time.  No more!  These are a little pricy, but great quality.  Will buy again.  Doesn&#x27;t smear your foundation around and are easy to wash by hand.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Very good quality sponges for make up, cheaper in Sephora though, found out too late! Better than the cheapies in the pharmacy style stores.</li>
            <li> If I new these were out there would have never wasted all the $ I wasted. so friendly in your hand</li>
            <li> The other reviewer is right on the money.  These last, they feel great and you can wash them.  Over time they are really worth the money!   &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Been using mine for over 3 months, and no sign of wear and tear yet. definitely worth the price. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Get these and you won&#x27;t be disappointed. No weird smell, no flaking/tearing, and makeup application is flawless. They also wash well, for repeated use.</li>
            <li> Love these sponges for powder application...they hold up very well after being washed after several application uses.</li>
            <li> this sponge is really good sponge ! compeer to the other product its easy to break they have smell too</li>
            <li> Soft, plyable and effective. Just the right size, too. Will order more at a later date. Laura Mercier knows makeup.</li>
            <li> These sponges are perfect for blending. They absorb a lot of the makeup, though, so they are not good for application.</li>
            <li> Happy with product and service.</li>
            <li> perfect size and weight. smooth application, works great.  Good product, thanks for having available to purchase.  A bit pricey though.</li>
            <li> The best foundation pads I&#x27;ve been using them for over a decade</li>
            <li> Love these sponges I usually buy on LM site but they were out of my foundation color so i bought on amazon. Only bad thing is you always get samples on LM site not here. Still a great foundation sponge i always use , they last a very long time and you can throw them in the washer and they hold up nice application for any liquid foundation!</li>
            <li> I know what you&#x27;re thinking . . . why spend $14 for these when you can get a whole bag of wedges for a few dollars. I thought the same thing, but there are some definite advantages to these sponges:     First, these babies are anti-bacterial. The others are one-time-use only disposables. Once you touch those little white triangles to your face, you have to throw them away because they breed bacteria. Yuck! These won&#x27;t grow a thing. One of them lasts me six months so it takes me two years to use all four sponges in the pack. I used to buy way more than $7 a year of those little triangles.    Second, you can wash them in the washing machinne. Yep, let me say that again. You can wash them in the washing machine. Just drop these babies into your next load and out they&#x27;ll come, nice and clean again. You can&#x27;t do that with the white triangles. If you wear a darker colored pigmant of foundation, some color may be left behind but they will still be nice and fresh and clean. After their little trip round and round, just let them air dry.     Third, they don&#x27;t crumble when using them like those little white wedges do. Also, they&#x27;re nice and big and an easy shape to hold. I find I have more control than with that little wedge.    Lastly, they give such a wonderful finish to your foundation. They don&#x27;t leave it streaky like I&#x27;ve seen the white wedges do. Just dampen them lightly with water (as Laura recommends for the best finish) and blend, blend, blend away. Beautiful!</li>
            <li> This sponge is just the right size and texture for spreading foundation evenly.  I&#x27;m picky about makeup sponges and these are perfect.  May cost a little more but the quality is excellent and they really hold up.</li>
            <li> Love these Laura Mercier make-up sponges.  They&#x27;re so durable and never fall apart.  I&#x27;ve been using them for years and they&#x27;re really worth the money.</li>
            <li> I like these much better than the little sponge that comes in the compact.  They are thicker and easier to handle.</li>
            <li> These sponges are great!!! I bought extras thinking they wouldn&#x27;t last long.  I was wrong!! You can wash them over and over and they are like new!!!</li>
            <li> I recommend these sponges to everyone who uses liquid foundation.  Easy application and can be run through the washing machine.</li>
            <li> These are the best sponges ever!  I have used many cosmetic sponges and these are by far the best I have tried.  They last, wash out easily and allow for excellent application of liquid foundation.  I will order more of these when they are needed.</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve ever used. Last a very long time. Thick and easy to wash out. I split the 4-pack, and share with my daughter, who also loves her&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The size was good; don&#x27;t like the size of those round white ones you buy in the drugstore, so this size was perfect.&lt;br /&gt;However, the foundation seems to be absorbed into the sponge too much &amp; doesn&#x27;t spread very well on my face...&lt;br /&gt;I seem to be using more foundation than I used to with my old makeup sponge.  Does anyone know where I can&lt;br /&gt;buy Ultralon Large Foundation Sponges.  I can&#x27;t remember where I bought them &amp; I LOVE them....they came 2 in&lt;br /&gt;a package that has a dark green background &amp; it says &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; printed on the side.  This is what I&#x27;m trying&lt;br /&gt;to replace with no luck so far.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for years for a soft, reusable, good quality makeup sponge and I have found it!  I don&#x27;t use liquid foundation; just stick concealer and I&#x27;ve always had a hard time blending with other sponges.  This sponge blends perfectly and is so soft.</li>
            <li> Great product for applying liquid foundation.  Easily rinsed after use.  I have been using this product for years due to a latex sensitivity.  These cause no reaction on my skin at all.</li>
            <li> These sponges are great. I tried the fat teardrop shaped kind and found them hard to use (I actually cut them in half to have a flat side to work with). These work well when moistened and give me good even coverage. At the end of the week I put them in a mesh laundry bag and wash them with my whites. They come out nice and fresh. My Mac Studio Fix makeup tends to leave some staining, but that doesn&#x27;t affect how the sponge works at all. If they last as long as some of the reviewers say they do they will be well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Extremely pleased to find these sponges.  They apply makeup smoothly and evenly, providing a perfect finish.  Incredibly durable and can be washed in your washing machine or your dishwasher.  One sponge will last years!</li>
            <li> I order these all the time and I think they are wonderful!</li>
            <li> These are good, durable, long lasting, and soft.  They are washable and blend my liquid makeup well.  I don&#x27;t think anyone would regret buying these.  Plus they are great price for how long they last.</li>
            <li> I had looked for several years to replace a makeup sponge that I really liked.  I wanted a sponge that was bigger and thicker and smoothed my base makeup perfectly.  These sponges do just that.  Although more expensive than the usual sponge, these are high quality and four of them will last me for a very long while.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many other sponges, trying to avoid purchasing these because there is no Laura Mercier retailer in my immediate are. However, I ALWAYS return to these regardless of how many other other sponge options may be floating around my make-up area. There seems to be something magical [ok that may be a bit over the top] about the way these little guys blend foundation, mineral [AKA powder] foundations, concealer, BB cream, even sunscreen. I use them for each phase of my morning routine in order to create a consistent finish and to smooth or buff out and unevenness in coverage. No matter how sloppy my initial application, these sponges are effective in resolving my mistakes. They can be used moist or dry. BONUS, if you are gentle in means of washing and drying they will last quite a while.</li>
            <li> The sponges are a little harder than other makeup sponges I&#x27;ve used.  I been using this sponge for about 2 months now and I&#x27;m sort of getting used to them.  They appear to be durable and one sponge will probably last for several months.  They can be cleaned with a little soap and water.</li>
