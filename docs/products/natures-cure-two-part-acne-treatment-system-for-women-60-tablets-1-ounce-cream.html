            <li>I really liked this product it helped a lot</li>
            <li>I had tried every kind of salicylic acid wash, cream, cleanser, pore pads, scrubs...</li>
            <li>This is very effective and cheap.</li>
            <li>Well worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li>I have had acne ever since puberty (I&#x27;m 47) &amp; this has been the best way to keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li>this product is PERFECT for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>but I find taking these and washing my face with a Dove bar for sensitive skin keep my skin in wonderful shape.  </li>
            <li>This has by far been the best option for me.  </li>
            <li>It is very cheap.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough wonderful things about this product.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to purchase this product at Kroger and every so often at Drug Mart, but it seems everyone stopped carry it.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different brands and products and this is the very best thing I have used to control my cystic acne.  </li>
            <li>Wishing it works for you too :-)</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>I have been taking the pills religiously for a month now and the results are awesome!</li>
            <li>It was for me :)</li>
            <li>Love these, noticed results in a week.</li>
            <li>I no longer get zits :)</li>
            <li>I love it because it works, wait about a week</li>
            <li>i love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;i love that you dont need to swallow it with water.</li>
            <li>and this is totally the best way to go with that!</li>
            <li>Overall this is the BEST thing I have found in 10 years</li>
            <li>I have tried multiple products for acne and have found the Nature&#x27;s Cure to be working the best for me.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that the lotion does not over-dry my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve began getting cystic acne and wasn&#x27;t able to find anything that helped...even tried Proactiv.  </li>
            <li>Both work like magic.  </li>
            <li>I had since stopped using it because i wasn&#x27;t able to find it anymore.  </li>
            <li>The sulfur worked ok for some of the acne but nothing (and i tried it all) would get rid of those blackheads.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now 42, and can&#x27;t believe it took so many years to find this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best to only use the cream on the spot itself and then use witchhazel on the rest of your face to help prevent acne but make sure you have a moisturizer thats not greasy</li>
            <li>Love this product so much, had to write a review!!!!</li>
            <li>skin is PERFECT finally at 30 years old LOL</li>
            <li>The spot treatment is pretty good, but the pills did literally nothing for me.</li>
            <li>This is an all-natural product, so there are no harsh chemicals entering her body, and that makes me happy.</li>
            <li>easy as that.</li>
            <li>The chewable tablets are convenient and easy to take.  </li>
            <li>The lotion is strong.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for having Natures&#x27; cure Available!!  </li>
            <li>I love Nature&#x27;s Cure (the tablets actually have a pleasant taste) and</li>
            <li>Great Deal,,this is the ONLY place I can find this!!!  </li>
            <li>I just wanted to be free...</li>
            <li>and it was great, but suddenly seemed to stop working wonders (for the cost)</li>
            <li>It took about 3 weeks for me to be acne free but now at 25</li>
            <li>I stuck it out and by the beginning of the third week my cystic acne greatly improved.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product after I researched and saw that this would be effective for the hormonal balance that an older person would need.</li>
            <li>and nothing has made any significant difference.  </li>
            <li>Within a three weeks of taking this product (twice a day), her face was significantly clearer.  </li>
            <li>The natures cure I used then, helped me significantly.</li>
            <li>I happened to come across this on amazon and was so excited.</li>
            <li>works great when used properly and consistently.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Needs continuous, twice-daily use for full benefit.</li>
            <li>Yes, she still has some breakouts, but it&#x27;s not nearly as bad as it was.  </li>
            <li>I have mild acne that seems to come and go and</li>
            <li>My skin is showing great improvments and its been less than a month.</li>
            <li>It actually made me  break out even more!</li>
            <li>I love waking up to clear skin!</li>
            <li>Nature&#x27;s cure is amazing, I only need to wash my face with cetaphil to remove my makeup</li>
            <li>I also love that it is natural and has no side effects!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, love the fact that it is a natural prodcut.</li>
            <li>I rarely use the cream, just a spot treatment here and there.</li>
            <li>I love that it is all natural.</li>
            <li>I was really upset when the stores stopped selling this product and really love that I can still buy it  because it really works for me</li>
            <li>It is worth a try if you have suffered from acne.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t begin to describe how exciting this is.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>I mean, I still get a couple small blemishes a week, so I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll never have flawless skin w/o some kind of acne treatment.</li>
            <li>and I was right.</li>
            <li>this pill just wipes it right out</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I see good results, less breakouts, works for me, I already got a supply for another 3 months.</li>
            <li>I was very very sad.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>After close  to two months of seeing no improvement and  my skin breaking out even more, I finally stopped.</li>
            <li>a pill would and it has helped so much!</li>
            <li>She has always been very prone to acne!</li>
            <li>I got more acne after starting to use this product.</li>
            <li>Then they will come up to a head quicker and \\&quot;self clean\\&quot; and push the debris and gunk out (hot pack stubborn ones)-</li>
            <li>I promise, you will be a believer by the time you finish the box and at $11-12 a month, its very inexpensive!</li>
            <li>so I ordered  a three month supply from American Wholesale 2 weeks in advance to make sure it arrived on time.</li>
            <li>I have been taking a prescription that was prescribed by my dermatologist, and thought that I would be able to stop taking the nature&#x27;s cure - when I did, the cystic acne came back.</li>
            <li>The Nature&#x27;s Cure Pills really work!</li>
            <li>Sure enough, benzoyl peroxide saves the day!</li>
            <li>It was literally the only thing that has saved my face :)</li>
            <li>I have battled cystic acne for so many years, took antibiotics and when I was on birth control it seemed to keep it in check, but as soon as I stopped taking it, it came back with a vengeance.</li>
            <li>If you are a first time user it takes some time for the medication to work.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nature&#x27;s Cure works like gangbusters, and consistently so.  </li>
            <li>We have literally tried DOZENS of products as well as many &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; remedies and this has been the only product that has worked for us!</li>
            <li>The blemish cream that comes in the pack is great for white head and black head breakouts, dries them up pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>It takes a couple of months of twice daily use of the tablets for me to get the full benefit, but it is so worth it!  </li>
            <li>keep face clean and stop make up until clear.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first i dont like the idea of taking acne pills, yet i took risk and it works amazingly!!</li>
            <li>First of all, let me say i used to be able to find this locally when i was in high school.</li>
            <li>Just a warning in case you have a sensitivity to certain herbs.</li>
            <li>THANKS GOD</li>
            <li>this works on your insides to balance your skin and your hormones gently.  </li>
            <li>The product is fast and reliable.</li>
            <li>But it really helps.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m talking fast delivery bro..</li>
            <li>This item is an absolute must for me.</li>
            <li>This one absolutely does.</li>
            <li>really works.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, I had to increase my dosage to about 3-4 pills per day to really keep my cystic acne in check.</li>
            <li>I never had much acne as a teenager, except during &amp;#34;that&amp;#34; time of the month.  </li>
            <li>I didnt use the cream it didnt do much on me like the pills.</li>
            <li>The benzoyl is great a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>We have tried many other products but none have worked like this.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These tablets used to be $9.99 retail, so on sale you could easily get a 1 month supply for $7.99, but alas, not any more.</li>
            <li>I used it for about a year with great success, then couldn&#x27;t find it for a couple of months, and my face reverted to terrible breakouts, so I was thrilled to find this again on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve taken homeopathic medicines as a teenager for acne and while at times I broke out first, it did tend to subside and clear up my skin.</li>
            <li>This plus my routine( if consistent) keeps my skin clear.</li>
            <li>I still have a few break outs around that time of the month but the rest of the time my face is more clear than it has ever been and the cream really helps with redness and stuff without drying the skin too much.</li>
            <li>You may also want to take cod liver oil and a high dose of pantothenic acid.</li>
            <li>I have also stopped eating a lot of products high in sugar.  </li>
            <li>i highly recommend giving this a try.</li>
            <li>Clear skin!!</li>
            <li>Will continue to get these as they keep my skin clear!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the cream since I am sensitive to Benzyl Peroxide, but the tablets really make a difference in keeping my acne under control.  </li>
            <li>This product really works for acne (adult, in my case).</li>
            <li>I paid an extra $20 and it was well worth it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve tried Proactive and most of the three part skin plans, as well as a few others.  </li>
            <li>not hard to remember!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Anyway, I&#x27;m placing my order right now and thought I would finally add my two cents about this product!</li>
            <li>I also noticed that a natural diet, meaning little to no preservatives, makes a huge difference as we&#x27;ll,, if you can stick to it!</li>
            <li>I have to learn to live with acne...</li>
            <li>To my surprise, around age 25 I developed mild to moderate adult acne.  </li>
            <li>It will clear your skin up within 3 months!</li>
            <li>This is my lifesaver as a 41 year old with hormonal acne!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got clear skin no matter what time of the month (which is enough of a selling point for me) and my skin is much prettier on the whole.  </li>
            <li>I can not say enough positive things about Nature&#x27;s Cure.  </li>
            <li>is not fully clear</li>
            <li>My face used to be covered in cystic acne and since taking the system EVERYONE noticed how clear my face is.</li>
            <li>They have no taste and if you want clear skin don&#x27;t forget to take them.</li>
            <li>but my skin is clear</li>
            <li>It took about 3 weeks, but my face is clear yet again.</li>
            <li>then you will notice your skin starts to clear up.</li>
            <li>It seemed that within two weeks my skin was clear.  </li>
            <li>Every woman with adult acne needs to try this - give it about 2-3 weeks to start seeing results.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin that breaks out from just about anything I use on my face (lotions, face wash, make-up, etc.)</li>
            <li>; this really has been the only solution to help.</li>
            <li>I am 33 years old.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been struggling a lot lately and was glad to see they still sold it.</li>
            <li>Religiously took these pills for the whole 3 months and saw zero changes.</li>
            <li>She is in her early 20&#x27;s and has used it since she was a teenager.</li>
            <li>My acne is adult hormonal acne</li>
            <li>acne lesions will shrink and not be as sore or red or have as much gunk in them.  </li>
            <li>I am 30 years old now</li>
            <li>My 13 yer old daughter was struggling as her forehead and chin were breaking out continuosly.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try to solve the issue at the root with this natural alternative and its been a miracle.  </li>
            <li>Finally..... after doctors, expensive facials, and EVERY over the counter soap, lotion and medicine available - we are pleased to announce WE HAVE FOUND SOMETHING THAT</li>
            <li>used accutane with cleared me completely (</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been suffering from cystic acne since I was about 15 years old.</li>
            <li>especially considering how much they cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I was a teen I don&#x27;t think they had this specific female friendly formula.</li>
            <li>but you will notice that once again, the pimples you get are small and easy to heal.  </li>
            <li>I have oily skin and its easy for my face to break out and ever since I used this product it has eliminate some of my small acne but not a miracle work.</li>
            <li>I also bought the male formulation for my son all thru high school</li>
            <li>As for the cream it is basically very drying if applied to areas of the skin for too long.</li>
            <li>Instead of getting huge cystic pimples I get little white heads.</li>
            <li>I wish I could go to my local drug store whenever I needed a new box.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get any new breakouts when I take it religiously.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my 15 year old daughter and the male version for my 13 year old son.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone and even bought the male form for my teenage son to try.</li>
            <li>Anyone who has experienced cystic acne, knows how painful they are.  </li>
            <li>After the second month my face was so clear.</li>
            <li>I use this product in addition to Neutrogena Body Clear and Purifying Facial Cleanser.  </li>
            <li>This is the ONLY product that treats my adult hormonal acne.</li>
            <li>I tried several products or natural cures online.  </li>
            <li>my pores have closed up so much on my nose</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it with success in the past (in my early twenties).</li>
            <li>/&gt;it didnt make my skin worse then better.</li>
            <li>it will get worse before it gets better, but keep taking it twice per day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s at least worth a try!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve tried absolutely *every* other acne treatment</li>
            <li>I spent so much money on cleaners, scrubs, acid peels, spot treatments plus countless hours on YouTube and Google researching solutions!!!!</li>
            <li>I have only taken half of my first pack and my face is completely clear, with no new breakouts!!  </li>
            <li>My skin is clear and other than one odd pimple that shows up around my chin just before my periods, my skin looks much healthier.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> First of all I would like to say this product is Amazing!!!</li>
            <li> it just made my skin better within two weeks!</li>
            <li> your skin will go thru a kind of \\&quot;cleaning phase\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I really liked this product it helped a lot</li>
            <li> I had tried every kind of salicylic acid wash, cream, cleanser, pore pads, scrubs...</li>
            <li> This is very effective and cheap.</li>
            <li> Well worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li> I have had acne ever since puberty (I&#x27;m 47) &amp; this has been the best way to keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li> this product is PERFECT for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> but I find taking these and washing my face with a Dove bar for sensitive skin keep my skin in wonderful shape.  </li>
            <li> This has by far been the best option for me.  </li>
            <li> It is very cheap.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough wonderful things about this product.</li>
            <li> I used to be able to purchase this product at Kroger and every so often at Drug Mart, but it seems everyone stopped carry it.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different brands and products and this is the very best thing I have used to control my cystic acne.  </li>
            <li> Wishing it works for you too :-)</li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> I have been taking the pills religiously for a month now and the results are awesome!</li>
            <li> It was for me :)</li>
            <li> Love these, noticed results in a week.</li>
            <li> I no longer get zits :)</li>
            <li> I love it because it works, wait about a week</li>
            <li> i love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;i love that you dont need to swallow it with water.</li>
            <li> and this is totally the best way to go with that!</li>
            <li> Overall this is the BEST thing I have found in 10 years</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple products for acne and have found the Nature&#x27;s Cure to be working the best for me.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that the lotion does not over-dry my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve began getting cystic acne and wasn&#x27;t able to find anything that helped...even tried Proactiv.  </li>
            <li> Both work like magic.  </li>
            <li> I had since stopped using it because i wasn&#x27;t able to find it anymore.  </li>
            <li> The sulfur worked ok for some of the acne but nothing (and i tried it all) would get rid of those blackheads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now 42, and can&#x27;t believe it took so many years to find this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best to only use the cream on the spot itself and then use witchhazel on the rest of your face to help prevent acne but make sure you have a moisturizer thats not greasy</li>
            <li> Love this product so much, had to write a review!!!!</li>
            <li> skin is PERFECT finally at 30 years old LOL</li>
            <li> The spot treatment is pretty good, but the pills did literally nothing for me.</li>
            <li> This is an all-natural product, so there are no harsh chemicals entering her body, and that makes me happy.</li>
            <li> easy as that.</li>
            <li> The chewable tablets are convenient and easy to take.  </li>
            <li> The lotion is strong.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for having Natures&#x27; cure Available!!  </li>
            <li> I love Nature&#x27;s Cure (the tablets actually have a pleasant taste) and</li>
            <li> Great Deal,,this is the ONLY place I can find this!!!  </li>
            <li> I just wanted to be free...</li>
            <li> and it was great, but suddenly seemed to stop working wonders (for the cost)</li>
            <li> It took about 3 weeks for me to be acne free but now at 25</li>
            <li> I stuck it out and by the beginning of the third week my cystic acne greatly improved.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after I researched and saw that this would be effective for the hormonal balance that an older person would need.</li>
            <li> and nothing has made any significant difference.  </li>
            <li> Within a three weeks of taking this product (twice a day), her face was significantly clearer.  </li>
            <li> The natures cure I used then, helped me significantly.</li>
            <li> I happened to come across this on amazon and was so excited.</li>
            <li> works great when used properly and consistently.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Needs continuous, twice-daily use for full benefit.</li>
            <li> Yes, she still has some breakouts, but it&#x27;s not nearly as bad as it was.  </li>
            <li> I have mild acne that seems to come and go and</li>
            <li> My skin is showing great improvments and its been less than a month.</li>
            <li> It actually made me  break out even more!</li>
            <li> I love waking up to clear skin!</li>
            <li> Nature&#x27;s cure is amazing, I only need to wash my face with cetaphil to remove my makeup</li>
            <li> I also love that it is natural and has no side effects!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, love the fact that it is a natural prodcut.</li>
            <li> I rarely use the cream, just a spot treatment here and there.</li>
            <li> I love that it is all natural.</li>
            <li> I was really upset when the stores stopped selling this product and really love that I can still buy it  because it really works for me</li>
            <li> It is worth a try if you have suffered from acne.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t begin to describe how exciting this is.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> I mean, I still get a couple small blemishes a week, so I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll never have flawless skin w/o some kind of acne treatment.</li>
            <li> and I was right.</li>
            <li> this pill just wipes it right out</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I see good results, less breakouts, works for me, I already got a supply for another 3 months.</li>
            <li> I was very very sad.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> After close  to two months of seeing no improvement and  my skin breaking out even more, I finally stopped.</li>
            <li> a pill would and it has helped so much!</li>
            <li> She has always been very prone to acne!</li>
            <li> I got more acne after starting to use this product.</li>
            <li> Then they will come up to a head quicker and \\&quot;self clean\\&quot; and push the debris and gunk out (hot pack stubborn ones)-</li>
            <li> I promise, you will be a believer by the time you finish the box and at $11-12 a month, its very inexpensive!</li>
            <li> so I ordered  a three month supply from American Wholesale 2 weeks in advance to make sure it arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I have been taking a prescription that was prescribed by my dermatologist, and thought that I would be able to stop taking the nature&#x27;s cure - when I did, the cystic acne came back.</li>
            <li> The Nature&#x27;s Cure Pills really work!</li>
            <li> Sure enough, benzoyl peroxide saves the day!</li>
            <li> It was literally the only thing that has saved my face :)</li>
            <li> I have battled cystic acne for so many years, took antibiotics and when I was on birth control it seemed to keep it in check, but as soon as I stopped taking it, it came back with a vengeance.</li>
            <li> If you are a first time user it takes some time for the medication to work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nature&#x27;s Cure works like gangbusters, and consistently so.  </li>
            <li> We have literally tried DOZENS of products as well as many &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; remedies and this has been the only product that has worked for us!</li>
            <li> The blemish cream that comes in the pack is great for white head and black head breakouts, dries them up pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> It takes a couple of months of twice daily use of the tablets for me to get the full benefit, but it is so worth it!  </li>
            <li> keep face clean and stop make up until clear.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first i dont like the idea of taking acne pills, yet i took risk and it works amazingly!!</li>
            <li> First of all, let me say i used to be able to find this locally when i was in high school.</li>
            <li> Just a warning in case you have a sensitivity to certain herbs.</li>
            <li> THANKS GOD</li>
            <li> this works on your insides to balance your skin and your hormones gently.  </li>
            <li> The product is fast and reliable.</li>
            <li> But it really helps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m talking fast delivery bro..</li>
            <li> This item is an absolute must for me.</li>
            <li> This one absolutely does.</li>
            <li> really works.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, I had to increase my dosage to about 3-4 pills per day to really keep my cystic acne in check.</li>
            <li> I never had much acne as a teenager, except during &amp;#34;that&amp;#34; time of the month.  </li>
            <li> I didnt use the cream it didnt do much on me like the pills.</li>
            <li> The benzoyl is great a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> We have tried many other products but none have worked like this.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These tablets used to be $9.99 retail, so on sale you could easily get a 1 month supply for $7.99, but alas, not any more.</li>
            <li> I used it for about a year with great success, then couldn&#x27;t find it for a couple of months, and my face reverted to terrible breakouts, so I was thrilled to find this again on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken homeopathic medicines as a teenager for acne and while at times I broke out first, it did tend to subside and clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> This plus my routine( if consistent) keeps my skin clear.</li>
            <li> I still have a few break outs around that time of the month but the rest of the time my face is more clear than it has ever been and the cream really helps with redness and stuff without drying the skin too much.</li>
            <li> You may also want to take cod liver oil and a high dose of pantothenic acid.</li>
            <li> I have also stopped eating a lot of products high in sugar.  </li>
            <li> i highly recommend giving this a try.</li>
            <li> Clear skin!!</li>
            <li> Will continue to get these as they keep my skin clear!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the cream since I am sensitive to Benzyl Peroxide, but the tablets really make a difference in keeping my acne under control.  </li>
            <li> This product really works for acne (adult, in my case).</li>
            <li> I paid an extra $20 and it was well worth it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve tried Proactive and most of the three part skin plans, as well as a few others.  </li>
            <li> not hard to remember!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Anyway, I&#x27;m placing my order right now and thought I would finally add my two cents about this product!</li>
            <li> I also noticed that a natural diet, meaning little to no preservatives, makes a huge difference as we&#x27;ll,, if you can stick to it!</li>
            <li> I have to learn to live with acne...</li>
            <li> To my surprise, around age 25 I developed mild to moderate adult acne.  </li>
            <li> It will clear your skin up within 3 months!</li>
            <li> This is my lifesaver as a 41 year old with hormonal acne!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got clear skin no matter what time of the month (which is enough of a selling point for me) and my skin is much prettier on the whole.  </li>
            <li> I can not say enough positive things about Nature&#x27;s Cure.  </li>
            <li> is not fully clear</li>
            <li> My face used to be covered in cystic acne and since taking the system EVERYONE noticed how clear my face is.</li>
            <li> They have no taste and if you want clear skin don&#x27;t forget to take them.</li>
            <li> but my skin is clear</li>
            <li> It took about 3 weeks, but my face is clear yet again.</li>
            <li> then you will notice your skin starts to clear up.</li>
            <li> It seemed that within two weeks my skin was clear.  </li>
            <li> Every woman with adult acne needs to try this - give it about 2-3 weeks to start seeing results.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin that breaks out from just about anything I use on my face (lotions, face wash, make-up, etc.)</li>
            <li> ; this really has been the only solution to help.</li>
            <li> I am 33 years old.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling a lot lately and was glad to see they still sold it.</li>
            <li> Religiously took these pills for the whole 3 months and saw zero changes.</li>
            <li> She is in her early 20&#x27;s and has used it since she was a teenager.</li>
            <li> My acne is adult hormonal acne</li>
            <li> acne lesions will shrink and not be as sore or red or have as much gunk in them.  </li>
            <li> I am 30 years old now</li>
            <li> My 13 yer old daughter was struggling as her forehead and chin were breaking out continuosly.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try to solve the issue at the root with this natural alternative and its been a miracle.  </li>
            <li> Finally..... after doctors, expensive facials, and EVERY over the counter soap, lotion and medicine available - we are pleased to announce WE HAVE FOUND SOMETHING THAT</li>
            <li> used accutane with cleared me completely (</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering from cystic acne since I was about 15 years old.</li>
            <li> especially considering how much they cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I was a teen I don&#x27;t think they had this specific female friendly formula.</li>
            <li> but you will notice that once again, the pimples you get are small and easy to heal.  </li>
            <li> I have oily skin and its easy for my face to break out and ever since I used this product it has eliminate some of my small acne but not a miracle work.</li>
            <li> I also bought the male formulation for my son all thru high school</li>
            <li> As for the cream it is basically very drying if applied to areas of the skin for too long.</li>
            <li> Instead of getting huge cystic pimples I get little white heads.</li>
            <li> I wish I could go to my local drug store whenever I needed a new box.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get any new breakouts when I take it religiously.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 15 year old daughter and the male version for my 13 year old son.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone and even bought the male form for my teenage son to try.</li>
            <li> Anyone who has experienced cystic acne, knows how painful they are.  </li>
            <li> After the second month my face was so clear.</li>
            <li> I use this product in addition to Neutrogena Body Clear and Purifying Facial Cleanser.  </li>
            <li> This is the ONLY product that treats my adult hormonal acne.</li>
            <li> I tried several products or natural cures online.  </li>
            <li> my pores have closed up so much on my nose</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it with success in the past (in my early twenties).</li>
            <li> /&gt;it didnt make my skin worse then better.</li>
            <li> it will get worse before it gets better, but keep taking it twice per day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s at least worth a try!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve tried absolutely *every* other acne treatment</li>
            <li> I spent so much money on cleaners, scrubs, acid peels, spot treatments plus countless hours on YouTube and Google researching solutions!!!!</li>
            <li> I have only taken half of my first pack and my face is completely clear, with no new breakouts!!  </li>
            <li> My skin is clear and other than one odd pimple that shows up around my chin just before my periods, my skin looks much healthier.</li>
            <li> I tried Proactiv, AcneFree and a plethora of other products natural and otherwise.  </li>
            <li> We have been using this for a few months now and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the pills really do much,</li>
            <li> I spent a big amount of money in each treatment...</li>
            <li> We will continue to use it as long as it continues to work!</li>
            <li> As an adult I&#x27;ve tried proactive, the new Jessica Simpson line that just came out (only worked for wrinkles and dark circles, my acne was worse) and even using products (prescription) from the dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a very long time.</li>
            <li> and i have very minor breakouts anymore.</li>
            <li> It dries up ur skin and even if u stop application ur skin wil still be dry and irritated for days and days.</li>
            <li> but it started to dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried quite a few different acne products over the years including ProActive and a bunch of different face cleaners and creams.</li>
            <li> I used it religiously and now i know why my skin was so tame back then.</li>
            <li> The first two weeks my break outs did get worse.</li>
            <li> When I take it regularly my breakouts are much less</li>
            <li> I do wish the manufacture can make another version without cream, which i don&#x27;t use that often due to dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> Be careful where you get your products because they may never arrive.</li>
            <li> Each of the products that I tried dried my face out, left my skin greasy or had no impact.  </li>
            <li> I tried every acne product from high end to drugstore, alas, nothing worked until i saw this.</li>
            <li> At the beginning my acne got worse, after 2 months it was improving and after 3 months my acne is completely gone!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried their other products.</li>
            <li> I work in a hospital and turned some other people on to it.</li>
            <li> I am currently on my period and instead of my skin breaking out everywhere, I have 2 or 3 small pimples.</li>
            <li> I did purchase other items to help speed things along</li>
            <li> I went from having acne on my back and cystic acne on my face to no more acne.  </li>
            <li> Just an FYI, my skin had a really bad break out the first and second week before it started clearing.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really get a ton of acne as a teen besides a few random breakouts, usually on my nose.</li>
            <li> We tried every over the counter product with no success.  </li>
            <li> Now that I am in my late 30s, acne came back.</li>
            <li> Over that span i slowly started noticing blackheads all over my nose and moderate acne on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> but I stopped because I was afraid of becoming immune and they interfere with birth control - topical treatments, and other expensive treatments from my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few acne creams I have tried that doesn&#x27;t make my skin dry and flaky after a few uses.</li>
            <li> In fact, I cut down my sugar and have been exercising every day</li>
            <li> I am not sure it works well for African American skin, because it made my skin worse after just one day.</li>
            <li> but then I looked on the box and noticed one of the ingredients was black Cohosh.</li>
            <li> I did my research and in some cases, black cohosh has been known to induce menstrual bleeding.</li>
            <li> This is not a quick fix-</li>
            <li> Found it slightly cheaper at walmart.com</li>
            <li> I used to have a pizza face (no cysts, just a lot of oil and little zits).</li>
            <li> Some worked for a while, but never long term, which is extremely frustrating -</li>
            <li> I had pretty awful skin in high school</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Buy it online because it&#x27;s in not available in the drugstores around me  anymore.</li>
            <li> As for the cream, it is too harsh on skin.</li>
            <li> I take one teaspoon of cod liver oil and 3 capsules of 500mg pantothenic acid 3 times everyday.</li>
            <li> I just chew the tabs, too, so it&#x27;s nice that I don&#x27;t have to drink nasty lukewarm water from the tap to take them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes a few weeks</li>
            <li> It does not feel heavy when I use it.  </li>
            <li> you have had a lot of trouble finding something that works for you,</li>
            <li> I think the homeopathic medicine is also helpful to prevent breakouts, but it does seem to take a few weeks to start working.</li>
            <li> I even beg my mom to take me to a dermatologist but she said it&#x27;s just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I just want to sneak it in the conversation when I meet someone who might be having trouble with acne, though it seems rude or something</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything over the past 10 years including changing my diet, oral antibiotics - which worked</li>
            <li> Tired of the antibiotics and other prescriptions that dermatologists prescribed over the years, I figured I had nothing to lose</li>
            <li> and when I do get one, it is no where near as bad as it was.</li>
            <li> I always throw out the cream because I used it once and got bleach spots on some brand new towels. :(</li>
            <li> It calms my skin though I would still get one or big pimples here and there during the bad days.</li>
            <li> even worse than I did before and even after a month of twice-daily use, my acne did not subside.</li>
            <li> My acne stopped getting worse after I discontinued.</li>
            <li> the summer is the worse looks like slathered baby oil all over my face.</li>
            <li> If anything it has made my face even worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just sorry they are no longer in supermarkets.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I am now resorting to ordering it online.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it did not arrive and my face started breaking out three days after I ran out.</li>
            <li> Difficult to find a product that does what it promise.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too expensive and has no side effects.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Natures Cure for years and it hasn&#x27;t failed me yet.</li>
            <li> It was always bad and nothing helped.</li>
            <li> My skin was ugly from acne scars</li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t break out as a teenager but started breaking out at 25 and I was freaking out.  I spent so much money on cleaners, scrubs, acid peels, spot treatments plus countless hours on YouTube and Google researching solutions!!!! My skin was ugly from acne scars and I was so self-conscious when I wasn&#x27;t wearing makeup. I discovered this by accident when I was ordering from Vitacost and it&#x27;s been the ONLY thing that cleared up my skin. I get a pimple here and there once in a while but it&#x27;s controllable and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Vitacost doesn&#x27;t have the product anymore so I&#x27;ll be ordering from Amazon from now on. Love this product so much, had to write a review!!!! Every woman with adult acne needs to try this - give it about 2-3 weeks to start seeing results.</li>
            <li> My 11-year-old daughter has been battling acne for a couple of years now.  We have tried everything--proactiv, anything over-the-counter, etc. and nothing has made any significant difference.  I decided to purchase this, and she decided to give it a try.  Within a three weeks of taking this product (twice a day), her face was significantly clearer.  Yes, she still has some breakouts, but it&#x27;s not nearly as bad as it was.  She still exfoliates and uses a benzoyl peroxide face wash and has a topical acne medication with antibiotics in it, but this has worked!  You have to stick it out, though.  Use it for a month before making a decision.  This is an all-natural product, so there are no harsh chemicals entering her body, and that makes me happy.</li>
            <li> Great Deal,,this is the ONLY place I can find this!!!  Thanks for having Natures&#x27; cure Available!!  I will Soon need MORE!!</li>
            <li> Nature&#x27;s Cure has been a great gift.  When taken as directed, it truly makes a difference and prevents break-outs.  Sometimes I just want to sneak it in the conversation when I meet someone who might be having trouble with acne, though it seems rude or something so I don&#x27;t.  But yes!  Give this a try.  After 1-2 months you will see improvement.  I don&#x27;t use the cream, only the tablets.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough wonderful things about this product. Just try it. Please</li>
            <li> These always work well. I&#x27;m just sorry they are no longer in supermarkets.</li>
            <li> I used to be able to purchase this product at Kroger and every so often at Drug Mart, but it seems everyone stopped carry it. It&#x27;s a shame. This has been the only product to work for me. I tried just about every medication in me teen years, nothing worked. As an adult I&#x27;ve tried proactive, the new Jessica Simpson line that just came out (only worked for wrinkles and dark circles, my acne was worse) and even using products (prescription) from the dermatologist. Nothing has worked for me except the Nature&#x27;s cure two-part acne system. I haven&#x27;t tried their other products. I have gone about 2 1/2-3 months without the pills since my last pack ran out, but I have continued using the cream as one tube lasts me about 2 months. My face is just now starting to break out again. Unfortunately, I am now resorting to ordering it online. I have really sensitive skin that breaks out from just about anything I use on my face (lotions, face wash, make-up, etc.); this really has been the only solution to help. It&#x27;s even allowed me to use make-up without breaking out the same day/next day. Hope this helps someone out. It&#x27;s at least worth a try!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different brands and products and this is the very best thing I have used to control my cystic acne.  I don&#x27;t use the cream since I am sensitive to Benzyl Peroxide, but the tablets really make a difference in keeping my acne under control.  I used it for about a year with great success, then couldn&#x27;t find it for a couple of months, and my face reverted to terrible breakouts, so I was thrilled to find this again on Amazon.  It takes a couple of months of twice daily use of the tablets for me to get the full benefit, but it is so worth it!  I also love that it is natural and has no side effects!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Best thing I&#x27;ve found for hormonal, cystic acne.&lt;br /&gt;Good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t purchase tablets separately.&lt;br /&gt;Needs continuous, twice-daily use for full benefit.</li>
            <li> Hi!&lt;br /&gt;This product is amazing!!!I I am so grateful to God for having found it. I am 33 years old. I have struggled with acne since I was teenager. I have tried a lot of products.I spent a big amount of money in each treatment... but nothing worked .... I just wanted to be free...Finally, I thought: I will have acne all my life, it is genetic. I can not do anything. I have to learn to live with acne...I was very very sad.&lt;br /&gt;But THANKS GOD I tried this stuff. It is very cheap. You need to know that takes time to start working . At the beginning my acne got worse, after 2 months it was improving and after 3 months my acne is completely gone!! So don&#x27;t give up. Be persistent. Wishing it works for you too :-)</li>
            <li> I got an allergy shock by taking one of the pills. So I had to throw them all. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Takes a few weeks to work but has cleared up my acne and helped my skin to look so much smoother. Also, love the fact that it is a natural prodcut.</li>
            <li> When I was a teen I don&#x27;t think they had this specific female friendly formula. The natures cure I used then, helped me significantly. I&#x27;ve been struggling a lot lately and was glad to see they still sold it. I began taking it and within a week (warning TMI) I began spotting. I couldn&#x27;t figure out why I was having another period when I just ended 10 days prior. Im also always regular in that dept. I couldn&#x27;t figure out why it was but then I looked on the box and noticed one of the ingredients was black Cohosh. I did my research and in some cases, black cohosh has been known to induce menstrual bleeding. It actually made me  break out even more! I finally stopped taking it and within a day, my period had ended. Just a warning in case you have a sensitivity to certain herbs. May affect everyone differently.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken homeopathic medicines as a teenager for acne and while at times I broke out first, it did tend to subside and clear up my skin. However this product didn&#x27;t do anything but just made me breakout even worse than I did before and even after a month of twice-daily use, my acne did not subside. After close  to two months of seeing no improvement and  my skin breaking out even more, I finally stopped. My acne stopped getting worse after I discontinued. In fact, I cut down my sugar and have been exercising every day and it&#x27;s been great. My skin is clear and other than one odd pimple that shows up around my chin just before my periods, my skin looks much healthier.</li>
            <li> It calms my skin though I would still get one or big pimples here and there during the bad days. I do wish the manufacture can make another version without cream, which i don&#x27;t use that often due to dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I have tried quite a few different acne products over the years including ProActive and a bunch of different face cleaners and creams. I finally decided if none of that worked maybe a pill would and it has helped so much! I still have a few break outs around that time of the month but the rest of the time my face is more clear than it has ever been and the cream really helps with redness and stuff without drying the skin too much. I have been using this for years and will continue to!</li>
            <li> I love this product even thou my face is not fully clear but I can see some different, , it been two months now&lt;br /&gt;Just give it a try but be patient</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY product that treats my adult hormonal acne. I tried it on a whim a couple of years ago after seeing it on Walmart&#x27;s clearance shelf. Tired of the antibiotics and other prescriptions that dermatologists prescribed over the years, I figured I had nothing to lose and I was right. I rarely use the cream, just a spot treatment here and there. I love Nature&#x27;s Cure (the tablets actually have a pleasant taste) and I wish I could go to my local drug store whenever I needed a new box. Anyway, I&#x27;m placing my order right now and thought I would finally add my two cents about this product!</li>
            <li> The pills are great for acne, my side effect is a pain in my livers and my lower abs. The lotion is strong.  I continue shopping this item for my skin looks very beautifully.</li>
            <li> I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS ITEM  TO EVERYONE.  IT IS A  VERY GOOD PRODUCT AND IT IS VERY  EASY TO GET!!</li>
            <li> Great product!  Wonderful for preventing acne!  The 3-pack is an excellent deal, and the pills work like a charm!  Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I got this product because of the great reviews. I am not sure it works well for African American skin, because it made my skin worse after just one day.</li>
            <li> I have had acne ever since puberty (I&#x27;m 47) &amp; this has been the best way to keep my skin clear. Well worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li> works great when used properly and consistently. was face and apply, don&#x27;t forget the pills. keep face clean and stop make up until clear.</li>
            <li> Experiencing some hormonal acne after stopping birth control and was hoping this would do the trick.  Religiously took these pills for the whole 3 months and saw zero changes.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a very long time. Buy it online because it&#x27;s in not available in the drugstores around me  anymore. It helps maintain acne like a miracle worker.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my daughter. She is in her early 20&#x27;s and has used it since she was a teenager. She has always been very prone to acne! My oldest daughter dicovered Nature&#x27;s Cure while she was still in college and told us about it since it worked so well for her. It has made such a difference for both daughters, but especially for my younger daughter. I have had times when I have lapsed in repurchasing Nature&#x27;s Cure and you can SEE the difference in her skin as she starts with break outs all over again! You take one tablet in the morning and one at night, and it is holistic so I don&#x27;t have to worry about her taking it all the time. The blemish cream that comes in the pack is great for white head and black head breakouts, dries them up pretty quickly. i definitely recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> Homeopathic tablets helps the inside and controls my oily skin. My skin is so oily I have to blot my face often and the summer is the worse looks like slathered baby oil all over my face. Tablets helps me keep that matte finish. The benzoyl is great a little goes a long way. My face used to be covered in cystic acne and since taking the system EVERYONE noticed how clear my face is. Once in a while I get hormonal pimple 1 or 2!!! That is REMARKABLE! I work in a hospital and turned some other people on to it. I would rather do this than Accutane. Homeopathic is the way to go! THANK YOU NATURES CURE!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I got more acne after starting to use this product. As for the cream, it is too harsh on skin. It dries up ur skin and even if u stop application ur skin wil still be dry and irritated for days and days. It does not work at all, buy something else unless u want to damage your skin.</li>
            <li> I tend to get acne on my chin. I didn&#x27;t really get a ton of acne as a teen besides a few random breakouts, usually on my nose. Once I hit my mid 20&#x27;s I started getting nasty zits on my chin. I&#x27;ve tried several face washes and nothing seemed to help me. I purchased this product after I researched and saw that this would be effective for the hormonal balance that an older person would need. When I take it regularly my breakouts are much less and when I do get one, it is no where near as bad as it was. I don&#x27;t get any new breakouts when I take it religiously. I forgot to take it on vacation with me and by the time I came back I had another big bump forming.</li>
            <li> I tried this for two months and saw almost no improvement in my acne.  My acne is adult hormonal acne so maybe that&#x27;s why it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> when I stopped using this to see what would happen, the zits came back! This is very effective and cheap. If you are on the fence about buying, go for it. Note: it takes a month or two to start working</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 15 years! Im one of those people who&#x27;s acne has never gone away- except when I take this.  And when I dont, then I start breaking out again.  I dont even use the BP lotion- this product is PERFECT for sensitive skin cuz you dont have to put anything on your face.  I still get a pimple here and there but they are much much smaller and gone in a day or two instead of a week.  I also bought the male formulation for my son all thru high school and it works just as well- Im a nurse and theres no way I would let my kid take accutane or antibiotics every day!!!! You will start seeing changes within 2 weeks- acne lesions will shrink and not be as sore or red or have as much gunk in them.  Then they will come up to a head quicker and \\&quot;self clean\\&quot; and push the debris and gunk out (hot pack stubborn ones)- your skin will go thru a kind of \\&quot;cleaning phase\\&quot; i guess- but you will notice that once again, the pimples you get are small and easy to heal.  This is not a quick fix- this works on your insides to balance your skin and your hormones gently.  I promise, you will be a believer by the time you finish the box and at $11-12 a month, its very inexpensive!</li>
            <li> Works great for my daughter&#x27;s acne.  Found it slightly cheaper at walmart.com</li>
            <li> I always come back to natures cure. The product is fast and reliable. I had a severe breakout that wasn&#x27;t going away with the use of benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid. One week of using this product and bam! Clear skin!! I have moderate acne that flares up with hormones.. This product keeps that in check! I love waking up to clear skin! I recommend adding this to your daily regimen. You may also want to take cod liver oil and a high dose of pantothenic acid. I take one teaspoon of cod liver oil and 3 capsules of 500mg pantothenic acid 3 times everyday. It&#x27;s not a cure all... But it really helps. Instead of getting huge cystic pimples I get little white heads. This plus my routine( if consistent) keeps my skin clear. I also noticed that a natural diet, meaning little to no preservatives, makes a huge difference as we&#x27;ll,, if you can stick to it! Lolol! Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> It works if you dont have severe acne. I have oily skin and its easy for my face to break out and ever since I used this product it has eliminate some of my small acne but not a miracle work.</li>
            <li> Works great with the combo of dabber and if you take the medicine best to chew not swallow. I noticed the treatment sped up when I started to chew them.</li>
            <li> I have moderate acne and this didn&#x27;t help at all and I was religious about taking it.  But what did help is changing my diet to fruits vegetables, nuts and protein only.  Oh ya and goats cheese.  Also started using aloe vera gel as my moisturizer!!!!&lt;br /&gt;My skin is PERFECT finally at 30 years old LOL</li>
            <li> This is the only product I have purchased besides accutane that has given me results. I have been taking the pills religiously for a month now and the results are awesome! I am currently on my period and instead of my skin breaking out everywhere, I have 2 or 3 small pimples. Just an FYI, my skin had a really bad break out the first and second week before it started clearing. Try it, it could be the answer to your prayers! It was for me :)</li>
            <li> First of all I would like to say this product is Amazing!!! l have tried it all and this product works! It takes time to work so be patience! After the second month my face was so clear. I was so thankful so I ordered  a three month supply from American Wholesale 2 weeks in advance to make sure it arrived on time. Unfortunately it did not arrive and my face started breaking out three days after I ran out. So I had to order through another company Vitacost to over night it. I paid an extra $20 and it was well worth it. I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM AMERICAN WHOLESALE EVER AGAIN! Well Amazon handled it great and gave me a gift card so I didn&#x27;t have to wait 30 days to get my $ back. Be careful where you get your products because they may never arrive. This product is wonderful and for now on I will keep plenty on hand! By the way I don&#x27;t use the cream just the chew two pills twice a day. They have no taste and if you want clear skin don&#x27;t forget to take them. Thank you God for Natures Cure!</li>
            <li> Dude, Johnny on the spot man !!!!!  I&#x27;m talking fast delivery bro..</li>
            <li> I bought this along with the Nature&#x27;s Cure Anti-Acne Skin Care System Kit about 5 months ago and it doesn&#x27;t work at all. If anything it has made my face even worse.</li>
            <li> Love these, noticed results in a week. Will continue to get these as they keep my skin clear!!</li>
            <li> It worked for a while</li>
            <li> We just use th cream, works wonder, only option seems to buy it online as Pharmacies do not carry it anymore</li>
            <li> I have suffered from acne for years, and this is the ONLY product that works. I have been taking a prescription that was prescribed by my dermatologist, and thought that I would be able to stop taking the nature&#x27;s cure - when I did, the cystic acne came back. This not only makes my skin glow, it helps my hair and nails as well! I love that it is all natural. I will be stopping the use of my prescribed medication after my next appointment with my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I have mild acne that seems to come and go and this pill just wipes it right out</li>
            <li> The spot treatment is pretty good, but the pills did literally nothing for me.</li>
            <li> I used to have a pizza face (no cysts, just a lot of oil and little zits). Nature&#x27;s cure is amazing, I only need to wash my face with cetaphil to remove my makeup and then I&#x27;m good to go. I no longer get zits :)</li>
            <li> This item is an absolute must for me. I had pretty awful skin in high school (I used to apply foundation like 3 times a day. Bleah) and this stuff finally made my skin bearable my senior year, or so. Discovered and used Proactiv for about 9 months in college and it was great, but suddenly seemed to stop working wonders (for the cost), so I went back to Natures Cure. I am 30 years old now and I have considered going off this item, wondering if it&#x27;s still really necessary, but I get too freaked out. lol. I mean, I still get a couple small blemishes a week, so I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll never have flawless skin w/o some kind of acne treatment. I just chew the tabs, too, so it&#x27;s nice that I don&#x27;t have to drink nasty lukewarm water from the tap to take them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These tablets used to be $9.99 retail, so on sale you could easily get a 1 month supply for $7.99, but alas, not any more. Now they are easily going for $12.99 a box, so buying in bulk is the best way to get your money&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;-ERIN</li>
            <li> My 13 yer old daughter was struggling as her forehead and chin were breaking out continuosly.  We tried every over the counter product with no success.  I took a chance and ordered these tablets.  Her face has cleared up in 3 weeks and she is thrilled with the results!!!  I did not want to put her on antibiotics or continue to use the drying products that did not seem to help.</li>
            <li> I had never had acne issues in my life.  To my surprise, around age 25 I developed mild to moderate adult acne.  I tried Proactiv, AcneFree and a plethora of other products natural and otherwise.  Each of the products that I tried dried my face out, left my skin greasy or had no impact.  I decided to try to solve the issue at the root with this natural alternative and its been a miracle.  It takes a few weeks you have to be patient and stick with it but I find taking these and washing my face with a Dove bar for sensitive skin keep my skin in wonderful shape.  I can not say enough positive things about Nature&#x27;s Cure.  I will not be without these ever again.</li>
            <li> After juz 2 weeks of using my pimples on my forehead dries up and my skin got clearer.this is a miracle for me.</li>
            <li> My skin is showing great improvments and its been less than a month. I did purchase other items to help speed things along but my skin is clear</li>
            <li> This product really works for acne (adult, in my case). I&#x27;ve used it with success in the past (in my early twenties). Now that I am in my late 30s, acne came back. My dermatologist suggested hormone therapy, or &amp;#34;water pill&amp;#34; to deal with this problem. None was acceptable to me. So I tried Nature&#x27;s Cure again. It took about 3 weeks, but my face is clear yet again. Thank you Nature&#x27;s Cure!</li>
            <li> Difficult to find a product that does what it promise. This one absolutely does. I&#x27;ve been using it for a while w great results keeping my acne under control</li>
            <li> Finally..... after doctors, expensive facials, and EVERY over the counter soap, lotion and medicine available - we are pleased to announce WE HAVE FOUND SOMETHING THAT works!!!&lt;br /&gt;So grateful for this product!!!</li>
            <li> I love it because it works, wait about a week then you will notice your skin starts to clear up.</li>
            <li> I was really upset when the stores stopped selling this product and really love that I can still buy it  because it really works for me</li>
            <li> i love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it didnt make my skin worse then better. it just made my skin better within two weeks! and please know that i have severe acne!&lt;br /&gt;back acne and face acne! and im a 16 year old!&lt;br /&gt;ive used accutane with cleared me completely ( but then i stopped using it cause my mom never took my back for my second dose but anyways...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this stuff really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i love that you dont need to swallow it with water. alll you do it eat it! easy as that. not hard to remember!&lt;br /&gt;i got the 3 pack one because im so pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;plus// summer is soon and i plan to wear no make up and this is totally the best way to go with that!</li>
            <li> I went from having acne on my back and cystic acne on my face to no more acne.  I use this product in addition to Neutrogena Body Clear and Purifying Facial Cleanser.  I have also stopped eating a lot of products high in sugar.  I had been going to the dermatologist for twelve years, and I was still having issues.  I finally gave up on the dermatologist, and decided to try something different.  I tried several products or natural cures online.  This has by far been the best option for me.  It is worth a try if you have suffered from acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering from cystic acne since I was about 15 years old. It was always bad and nothing helped. I&#x27;ve tried everything over the past 10 years including changing my diet, oral antibiotics - which worked but I stopped because I was afraid of becoming immune and they interfere with birth control - topical treatments, and other expensive treatments from my dermatologist. Before buying Nature&#x27;s Cure I tried taking Pantothenic Acid that I found on Amazon. I did not have any luck with the Pantothenic Acid and the pills upset my digestion. The Nature&#x27;s Cure Pills really work! It took about 3 weeks for me to be acne free but now at 25 I&#x27;m really happy to have found something!! Also, I had to increase my dosage to about 3-4 pills per day to really keep my cystic acne in check. I always throw out the cream because I used it once and got bleach spots on some brand new towels. :( Overall this is the BEST thing I have found in 10 years and if you&#x27;re like me and having issues with deep cystic acne try Nature&#x27;s Cure!!</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple products for acne and have found the Nature&#x27;s Cure to be working the best for me.  It seemed that within two weeks my skin was clear.  I love the fact that the lotion does not over-dry my skin.  It does not feel heavy when I use it.  The chewable tablets are convenient and easy to take.  I will definitely reorder this product.</li>
            <li> I never had much acne as a teenager, except during &amp;#34;that&amp;#34; time of the month.  However, now that I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s I&#x27;ve began getting cystic acne and wasn&#x27;t able to find anything that helped...even tried Proactiv.  Then I came across Nature&#x27;s Cure.  I have only taken half of my first pack and my face is completely clear, with no new breakouts!!  I can&#x27;t begin to describe how exciting this is.  Anyone who has experienced cystic acne, knows how painful they are.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone and even bought the male form for my teenage son to try.</li>
            <li> I see good results, less breakouts, works for me, I already got a supply for another 3 months.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product it helped a lot but it started to dry out my skin. I went to a dermatologist instead and my skin is clearing up. If you have medical that covers derm I suggest you use it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 15 year old daughter and the male version for my 13 year old son.  Both work like magic.  We have tried many other products but none have worked like this.  I was amazed that the acne started clearing up within days.  If they stop using this the acne comes back but once they restart the acne clears up almost instantly. We have been using this for a few months now and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> First of all, let me say i used to be able to find this locally when i was in high school. I used it religiously and now i know why my skin was so tame back then. I had since stopped using it because i wasn&#x27;t able to find it anymore.  Over that span i slowly started noticing blackheads all over my nose and moderate acne on my cheeks.  I had tried every kind of salicylic acid wash, cream, cleanser, pore pads, scrubs... i even tried sulfur based products to try to get rid of it (they smell!!). The sulfur worked ok for some of the acne but nothing (and i tried it all) would get rid of those blackheads. I happened to come across this on amazon and was so excited. Sure enough, benzoyl peroxide saves the day! my pores have closed up so much on my nose and i have very minor breakouts anymore. Compared to what it was like, i would consider this a miracle!!!  Not sure if the pills really do much, but i still take them just in case.&lt;br /&gt;If you have had a lot of trouble finding something that works for you, i highly recommend giving this a try. It was literally the only thing that has saved my face :)</li>
            <li> This is one of the few acne creams I have tried that doesn&#x27;t make my skin dry and flaky after a few uses. I think the homeopathic medicine is also helpful to prevent breakouts, but it does seem to take a few weeks to start working.</li>
            <li> This is my lifesaver as a 41 year old with hormonal acne! It will clear your skin up within 3 months! Try it and you&#x27;ll see!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 3 weeks now. The first two weeks my break outs did get worse. Otter buyers stated the same...it will get worse before it gets better, but keep taking it twice per day. I stuck it out and by the beginning of the third week my cystic acne greatly improved. I am now at the end of week 4 and I&#x27;ve already ordered my next month of pills. I have battled cystic acne for so many years, took antibiotics and when I was on birth control it seemed to keep it in check, but as soon as I stopped taking it, it came back with a vengeance. I am hoping this will continue to work. I&#x27;m now 42, and can&#x27;t believe it took so many years to find this. It&#x27;s definitely worth a try. It&#x27;s not too expensive and has no side effects.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Natures Cure for years and it hasn&#x27;t failed me yet. If you are a first time user it takes some time for the medication to work. As for the cream it is basically very drying if applied to areas of the skin for too long. It&#x27;s best to only use the cream on the spot itself and then use witchhazel on the rest of your face to help prevent acne but make sure you have a moisturizer thats not greasy or else you&#x27;re just wasting your time because whats the point of using the medication if you&#x27;re going to be slathering greasy moisturizer on your face.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve tried absolutely *every* other acne treatment but I&#x27;ve tried Proactive and most of the three part skin plans, as well as a few others.  Some worked for a while, but never long term, which is extremely frustrating - especially considering how much they cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nature&#x27;s Cure works like gangbusters, and consistently so.  I&#x27;ve got clear skin no matter what time of the month (which is enough of a selling point for me) and my skin is much prettier on the whole.  Like, to the point where people mention it to me.  I don&#x27;t even wear makeup anymore (apart from eye makeup).  If Nature&#x27;s Cure ever goes out of business, I&#x27;m screwed.</li>
            <li> We have literally tried DOZENS of products as well as many &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; remedies and this has been the only product that has worked for us! Both of my kids have used it (my son used the For Male and my daughter used this one) and it was worked wonders on both of them. We will continue to use it as long as it continues to work!</li>
            <li> I started to have acne when i was 20 and it&#x27;s tottaly all over my face. It came to the point where i don&#x27;t want to go out, i dont want to see myself in the mirror and i cried myself out every night because i dont know what to do with it. I even beg my mom to take me to a dermatologist but she said it&#x27;s just a waste of money.I tried every acne product from high end to drugstore, alas, nothing worked until i saw this. I was skeptical at first i dont like the idea of taking acne pills, yet i took risk and it works amazingly!! For only 3months my face cleared up and now i have to deal with my acne scars. The only thing i dont like about it is that it dries out my skin but that&#x27;s how acne products do its job anyways. I didnt use the cream it didnt do much on me like the pills.</li>
