            <li>Great value, and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is very soft, beautiful, and it fits beautifully to me.</li>
            <li>Very good quality for the price worth the wait for coming from China.</li>
            <li>and I got a lot of comments saying nice hair amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing , still using it after months.</li>
            <li>I was so suprised that a wig this great could be so cheap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this wig is an amazing deal.</li>
            <li>It is absolutely amazing, for being a $10 wig.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Some nice.....</li>
            <li>some not so nice.</li>
            <li>Which is a nice length for in case someone would like to cut it shorter for one reason or</li>
            <li>So I try to rig it to sit on top of my head and wear a headband, doesn&#x27;t look good...</li>
            <li>I liked this wig.</li>
            <li>I liked it a lot</li>
            <li>I smiled and said \\&quot;No</li>
            <li>The hair is nice</li>
            <li>I really like this wig and for the price it is excellent.</li>
            <li>Wonderful, everyone who saw me thought it was my real hair</li>
            <li>I own a LOT of wigs.</li>
            <li>It still looked good and the material is better than the ones you see at costume</li>
            <li>I do own plastic ones cuz they were on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have wore it for Halloween, I wore it to an Anime convention (makes a nice Orihime from \\&quot;Bleach\\&quot; wig)</li>
            <li>Its a really nice wig for the price.</li>
            <li>I may order another and experiment with length and adjustments with this one, thats the nice thing about this wig.</li>
            <li>It gave the wig a nice scent.</li>
            <li>So I went on the hunt for a nice wig.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m kind of hating it..</li>
            <li>After reading some of the reviews on this item I as kind of sceptical of buying this.</li>
            <li>cool2day is awesome btw, very helpful, very kind and always available to answer any questions! :)</li>
            <li>Love love love  it!!</li>
            <li>Love Love Love it!!.</li>
            <li>What was surprising is the the company sent me a email letting me know it was coming and to let them know if their was a problem they were there to make sure I was satisfied.</li>
            <li>The product tangles very easily</li>
            <li>It is also very easy to put on.</li>
            <li>This also tangles very easily.</li>
            <li>I just wish that it came in more color choices so that I could buy one better suited for me!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;VE ALREAY PLACED ANOTHER ORDER FROM THIS SELLER AND WILL BE MAKING MANY MORE!</li>
            <li>All in all I love it and will be buying from the seller more often!</li>
            <li>For the most part though, it looks amazing</li>
            <li>Nice for a night on the town and many complements on hair.</li>
            <li>It comes with a nice wig cap, but I prefer using the wig without it, as it stays on my head better.  </li>
            <li>Looks great, takes awhile to ship because its coming from china but worth the wait.</li>
            <li>So for me tht was a perfect length, it was incredibly soft for synthetic hair.</li>
            <li>And the curls are kinda like soft curls, maybe 1.5\\&quot; curls but very beautiful.</li>
            <li>Very impressed with the quality and how soft the hair is.</li>
            <li>The hair quality was actually really good, it fit well</li>
            <li>The price was cheap when I bought the wig, so it was a really good deal.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend giving it a try!</li>
            <li>: It still sheds but after a week it&#x27;s still holding strong!</li>
            <li>i love love love this company!</li>
            <li>As soon as I got the wig in the mail, I immediately tried it on because I was that excited about it, and it looked good until I started noticing hair falling all over the place.  </li>
            <li>It looks very real and many people commented how beautiful it is.</li>
            <li>B005KO7NK6 Stunning beautiful long LIGHT BROWN curly wave wig full wigs jf010023]] very happy with the product arrived on time good quolity and no problem with anything</li>
            <li>Great size, Great quality so pleased with my purchase arrived fast and well packaged / a great value  and a must for any adult mannequin</li>
            <li>and my husband sure loves it, probably more so than my own hair pre-folliculitis.  </li>
            <li>This would be a great cosplay/costume wig, but I don&#x27;t think it would really fool anyone if you wanted it to look like your own hair in person.</li>
            <li>This felt great to wear...and real!</li>
            <li>so PRETTY lol.</li>
            <li>but hey I&#x27;m fine with that!</li>
            <li>wig is very light weight</li>
            <li>Though, with the right outfit, it looked amazing!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Drawbacks: Being a fairly thick-haired wig, it&#x27;s pretty warm.</li>
            <li>This wig was absolutely stunning, realistic, gorgeous!</li>
            <li>The color is gorgeous and it looks very real!</li>
            <li>good looking, good cut, very natural looking.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful realistic color.</li>
            <li>I even had to cut off a good inch because of the way it tangled within the first day!</li>
            <li>I was super excited to get this because I read all the wonderful reviews and they were not wrong!</li>
            <li>packaging wasa very protective of wig and my wife loves to have a large selection and this was a perfect addition with a nice wave and layercut look.</li>
            <li>It was a nice color and very pretty!</li>
            <li>If the seller could take PICTURES OF THE INSIDE, That would be a lot better.</li>
            <li>Kudos to those who love it and can wear it.</li>
            <li>Currently my favorite wig ever.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li>Okay, so, I am in love with this wig.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this wig for anyone. :)</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it and will order from this company more often.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure about the hooks for tightening the wig.</li>
            <li>wig did come with a couple extras, one of those things being a free wig cap!</li>
            <li>They wrote just to make sure I didn&#x27;t have any questions or concerns!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I never thought of wearing a wig because I thought I&#x27;d look for lack of a better word, \\&quot;crazy.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>Who knows if everyone is convinced that it&#x27;s my real hair, I feel like it looks great</li>
            <li>I just bought three more so that I&#x27;d have backup.  </li>
            <li>I just washed mine using non-sulfate shampoo and it came out looking even better than before.  </li>
            <li>Wen products or something without detergent is probably the safe way to go if you don&#x27;t have wig shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Immediately wanted to try it on... and cant even fit it on my head!  </li>
            <li>and when I just go to arrange the hairs, many hairs fall out/not tied in correctly.  </li>
            <li>I got it for a costume, and it seems okay.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>This wig is already helping me feel more confident.</li>
            <li>But I would wear it more....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always best to wear a wig cap for me, especially with thinner wigs.</li>
            <li>Mine is more of a chestnut color.</li>
            <li>,I love it</li>
            <li>I know this is a just a $15 wig, but shouldn&#x27;t it hold just a bit better than that?  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s probably more of a user error thing with me not knowing what the *</li>
            <li>Absolutley love this wig.</li>
            <li>Love this wig.</li>
            <li>This was the most ill-fitting wig I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>even so nooo am nit satisfied will not buy ever never again</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased several wigs from them, and have always been really impressed.</li>
            <li>And, i love the color, a medium brown, with some reddish highlights..</li>
            <li>and i love them</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I really love these Cool2day wigs.</li>
            <li>It came fast, hope everyone else is happy with it to.</li>
            <li>The curls are cute and not over-exaggerated or under done</li>
            <li>and I just really love it.</li>
            <li>Love this wig.</li>
            <li>It reached the top ot my breasts.</li>
            <li>Was really comfortable to wear too make it my wig of choice!</li>
            <li>I need to find a more sturdy one</li>
            <li>THOUGH THEY CAN BE SWEPT TO EITHER SIDE, I CUT MINE BECAUSE IT&#x27;S A BETTER LOOK FOR ME.</li>
            <li>UNLIKE MANY SYNTHETIC WIGS, IT DIDN&#x27;T SPLINTER WHEN I TRIMMED IT</li>
            <li>this wig is BETTER  than the picture.</li>
            <li>I got so many compliments on this wig.  </li>
            <li>Way better than any Halloween store.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>and I take every opportunity to wear it :)</li>
            <li>I will order more of these if I can.  </li>
            <li>It looks so much better than the picture.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying one or two more just in case</li>
            <li>and initially many people didn&#x27;t recognize me</li>
            <li>Some times it may require a bit more attention to restore it.</li>
            <li>than that, this is one of my favorite wigs.</li>
            <li>Love the wig, didn&#x27;t have to trim the bangs or anything</li>
            <li>The hair was more wavy than curly though.</li>
            <li>For the price I was wowed and most people dont realize its a wig.</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m sure this wig is not up to that quality, it sure beats spending those bucks if it works.  </li>
            <li>I was able to cut them out without compromising the wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this item</li>
            <li>Also cute name. :-)</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, this wig looks better in person than on the picture shown.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lovely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s longer than what it show on the picture, but either than that I love it.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m sure there are some things that could be done</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t quite sure I could pull it off.</li>
            <li>I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this wig.</li>
            <li>but it looks really cute like that anyways.</li>
            <li>It arrived on time w a cute pair of socks and wig cap.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the bangs pictures, but I like it better without.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no way I can wear this thing without a hat over the top..</li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t a huge problem, seeing that it&#x27;s still a nice wig.</li>
            <li>I guess it would be better than nothing for someone who needs a wig, but my advice would be to spend the money and get one that looks better than this one does.</li>
            <li>I love the color</li>
            <li>and I love the cap size.  </li>
            <li>I would feel confident going out with it on.  </li>
            <li>and I love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit snug for me.&lt;br /&gt;-No combs or tabs to make sure it lines up correctly with your hairline.&lt;br /&gt;-SHIPPING:</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an okay wig.</li>
            <li>ok with it</li>
            <li>Such a great wig, Thank you!</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>definitely use this company for any wig situation!! :D</li>
            <li>It looks real and feels great.</li>
            <li>but they are cute.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a truly wonderful product.</li>
            <li>For the price, it was an okay wig.</li>
            <li>The wig is much shorter, but it&#x27;s great regardless.</li>
            <li>Okay, let me be clear by saying that this wig is indeed beautiful.</li>
            <li>At first i didnt know if i made a good decision</li>
            <li>It looks nice and feels nice but is sheds so much that it&#x27;s more of a costume wig than anything else.</li>
            <li>but for that price it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>But, for every once in a while, this wig is a pretty good one.</li>
            <li>You really cannot beat this nice of a wig for the price!</li>
            <li>I was SO excited to get this wig in the mail today!</li>
            <li>I ordered another wig from this seller and I am now extremely excited to get it!</li>
            <li>very good quality for the price, i was pleasently surprised and liked it very much.</li>
            <li>these are amazing quality amazing price look real</li>
            <li>Paired with a hat, I&#x27;d stay super warm.</li>
            <li>I have a slightly big head, but the wig still fit almost perfectly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very pretty and flows nicely.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to get this wig because it was so popular and everyone was saying it was strawberry-blonde like in the light.</li>
            <li>The color is a rich medium brownish red, very attractive.</li>
            <li>It is VERY true to the images provided by the seller.  </li>
            <li>will enjoy it more.</li>
            <li>Even though it doesn&#x27;t looks that natural, its still fantastic and beautiful.</li>
            <li>:) quickest i&#x27;ve ever got an item.&lt;br /&gt;pretty wig, color is just like it&#x27;s stated, a light brown.</li>
            <li>This is my first wig and I&#x27;m so very pleased.</li>
            <li>Mine looked more strawberry-blonde than light brown.</li>
            <li>A bit too shiny to look real, but worth more than what you pay, a great buy for a mid-length wig.</li>
            <li>The color is gorgeous and my sister, who is a hairstylist, thought it was a real hair wig, not a synthetic one.</li>
            <li>the seller contacted me directly and was very nice and told me if i had any questions to email</li>
            <li>So if it fools people sitting next to you and stylists, it&#x27;s a good purchase in my mind!</li>
            <li>I read most of the customer reviews and read all of the product info about this wig and was really excited about buying this, but it turned out to be one of my biggest disappointments.  </li>
            <li>However, I love this wig, it is so fun!</li>
            <li>Looks beautiful and like real hair, however, it does tangle pretty easily.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t seem like they would stay in place easily.</li>
            <li>it tangles to easily</li>
            <li>It tangles easily</li>
            <li>Easy to care for,</li>
            <li>Easy to take care of.</li>
            <li>I can easily brush it but it does shed.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t tangle easy</li>
            <li>Do not use it every day though, or it will shed easily...</li>
            <li>However, it does easily tangle.</li>
            <li>It tangles extremely easily but handle it with care.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is easy to brush through without tangling.  </li>
            <li>It does get tangled really easily.</li>
            <li>It combs easily and they bangs can easily be combed to the side.</li>
            <li>It was easily tangled..</li>
            <li>It does get tangled easily though.</li>
            <li>You can easily tell this is a wig from the back!&lt;br /&gt;Other than that i like the wig.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t tangle easily, brushes out like a dream.</li>
            <li>i cannot wait to wear this and have long beautiful curly hair :)</li>
            <li>and I fall in love with it right after I tried it on!</li>
            <li>It is pretty amazing for the price.  </li>
            <li>In conclusion, the wig is beautiful, but it&#x27;s just too low a quality for me and also way too shiny and wiggy.</li>
            <li>pretty nice.</li>
            <li>it looks just like natual human hair, beautiful color</li>
            <li>Pretty color and nice texture.</li>
            <li>i feel human again and beautiful</li>
            <li>It is very natural looking and even the top remembles a real scalp with beautiful hair.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s fine because pushing them to the side looks cuter</li>
            <li>It withstands brushing just fine.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>VERY soft, good quality.</li>
            <li>It looks super realistic, adjusts to fit, and will make my Lara Croft costume absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li>I absolutely fell in love with this wig!</li>
            <li>I was super surprised by the great quality of this wig.</li>
            <li>color is a little darker than what I imagined from the picture and description, however it matches my color perfectly.  </li>
            <li>It makes a huge difference in how well the wig fits.</li>
            <li>and when you put the wig on it doesnt really fit to your head shape well.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t even fit on the manikin and</li>
            <li>if it fit.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more just to wear for fun.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten great use out of this despite the price and the fact that it isn&#x27;t human hair.</li>
            <li>Hopefully it will be odor free soon.</li>
            <li>It is just amazing and it looks like real hair.</li>
            <li>when I get done writing this review I liked it so much.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d consider it 100% light brown.</li>
            <li>I know it is cheap</li>
            <li>Even if I could remove some of the shine, it wouldn&#x27;t fit my dog&#x27;s head, let alone mine.</li>
            <li>It feels so comfortable ,on my head..</li>
            <li>Cheap quality product.wear it make be urgly girl.</li>
            <li>Well ..... Looks cheap</li>
            <li>For the price you would think this is just another cheap costume wig</li>
            <li>it fit well.  </li>
            <li>Fit 10.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While described as a light brown...</li>
            <li>cheap.</li>
            <li>that was a big win for</li>
            <li>cap fit well with</li>
            <li>the cap is well constructed and the fibers are sewn in securely (on this one they are)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>there was a free wig cap and a pair of sock along with it.</li>
            <li>The color was light</li>
            <li>The length is great, especially if you put detangler in it and brush it out well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered this guy because it was so cheap</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t really say or comment about the delivery, to be honest</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe this wig was so cheap.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s such a great price.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t believe it when I read such great reviews on a $10 wig....</li>
            <li>The wig is like a cheap doll&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>I liked this one so much</li>
            <li>The hair is smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>Amazing  Thanks  Jackie</li>
            <li>I bought this because it was cheap</li>
            <li>The wig is a good replica of natural looking hair.  </li>
            <li>and when I got this wig in the mail and put it on, it is almost the exact color of my natural hair, so my hair and the wig blend together beautifully</li>
            <li>All in all a good wig as far as I know</li>
            <li>Easy to brush threw specially when you start from the tips and move up.</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful, light brown very long wig.</li>
            <li>This wig seems to be very high quality and looks very authentic!&lt;br /&gt;After holding it up to my face, I don&#x27;t believe that it&#x27;s the best color for my particular skin tone.</li>
            <li>Very fun wig, very worth 10 dollars.</li>
            <li>The seller was very nice and included a hair net along with a pair of socks that I couldn&#x27;t use because I am a size 12 1/2 mens but gave to my sister who was helping me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hardly noticeable though and the wig is perfect in every other way! :D</li>
            <li>Due to health problems and medications I take, my hair has been thinning incredibly.</li>
            <li>This was exactly &amp;#34;worth the price&amp;#34; as its very cheap.</li>
            <li>The hair falls out super easy.</li>
            <li>Looks very realy and is very easy to manage.</li>
            <li>I wear the wig kind of high up on my forehead</li>
            <li>This was perfect for my Playboy costume, and I&#x27;ve even worn to it a couple of other things!!!</li>
            <li>only gripe I have about it is that it does tangle easy, but just comb it through with your fingers and you are good to go.</li>
            <li>All I know is that I payed for my wig and it got here very quickly and packaged really well :-).</li>
            <li>The hair on the wig doesn&#x27;t come off easily like many wig does , it is actually very stable.</li>
            <li>I was originally looking to buy extensions when I had seen some wigs as well.</li>
            <li>i was really excited when i got this wig.</li>
            <li>But ,it was SO worth it!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still fun!</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S ORIGINAL SHAPE INSTEAD OF</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I made all my first timer mistakes on a \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; wig.</li>
            <li>wig is a great substitute for my long hair  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It fit comfortably and is good for every day use, actually!</li>
            <li>In pictures it look pretty convincing.</li>
            <li>first I wasn&#x27;t sure...</li>
            <li>Which I don&#x27;t usually go for, but perfect for the wedding!</li>
            <li>Came in good packaging and includes its own hair net, which is greatly appreciated.</li>
            <li>Yes, it is itchy (yet again, it is the first time I have ever worn a wig) and yes it tangles up easily (but its really easy to brush out the knots)</li>
            <li>There are ways to reduce shine on a hair piece (dry shampoo - you&#x27;re welcome), but it was still lighter than what was shown.</li>
            <li>Beautiful color, many long layers and very soft.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t reccomend during the day or special occastions</li>
            <li>and i wore it right out of the package!</li>
            <li>super fun!</li>
            <li>The color is also a little off as it is more of an auburn color, but honestly the color looks better in person than in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but for the most part very beautiful, soft wig and of course as all wigs it was a little on the shiny side</li>
            <li>The package also came with a complimentary wig cap and some cute girl socks (which my man feet can&#x27;t fit into haha).</li>
            <li>Overall, I am pretty happy with the product.</li>
            <li>Had my guy friend wear it and he walked around school in full makeup and a girly outfit and no one recognized him and thought he was a hottie XD</li>
            <li>I bought this for a playboy bunny halloween costume (full disclosure, I am a man).</li>
            <li>Has really cute flowing curls and looks like real hair.</li>
            <li>i love it so much.</li>
            <li>The only thing about this wig that I wasn&#x27;t expecting was that the length of the bangs was a good bit linger than the picture depicted.</li>
            <li>the company cool 2 day was a pleasure to order from.</li>
            <li>the wig is cool</li>
            <li>I have never been more complimented on a wig in my whole life.</li>
            <li>/&gt;that was the only good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I was expecting a whole lot more from the 5 star reviews on here..</li>
            <li>I think the color looks true to the picture, idk what everyone else was talking about.</li>
            <li>The wig, even though it is a beautiful color, is kind of thin.</li>
            <li>Besides the color issue, its not bad.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was very soft, but it tangled very easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so thankful that it turned out to be the right color, size and fit for me</li>
            <li>This is a cheaply made wig and it takes some time to make it look right on your head.</li>
            <li>The color is awesome, its a little shorter than pictured which I actually prefer, and its just so realistic,so amazing value for this price, Definitely worth</li>
            <li>I figured out looking at some other wigs today and looking inside lol.</li>
            <li>Fit quite nice, some styling required, but overall not a bad hairpeace for the money.</li>
            <li>Honestly I was a bit let down, but it&#x27;s still a nice wig worth the 7 dollars I paid for it.</li>
            <li>The customer-contributed photos are the most accurate to its appearance as far as color and ways that it can be styled.</li>
            <li>and I got several compliments on my hair from my family and they all asked me what I did to my hair to make it look so healthy and shiny :-).</li>
            <li>is a fun and flirty wig and if you only have a couple dollars to spend, then this is a good option.</li>
            <li>But it QUICKLY looses that smell and is replace with your smell(your perfume/soap/lotion and whatever).</li>
            <li>/&gt;It arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>the light brown really was LIGHT</li>
            <li>Serves its purpose to hide hair for a quick performance.</li>
            <li>It is going to go great with The Halloween Custom, the wig looks very natural and we got it at a fantastic low price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;M 100% SATISFIED, AND HIGHLY RECCOMEND</li>
            <li>but you have to do that with most wigs, even high priced ones.</li>
            <li>I like the darker colored one better because it matched better with my eyebrows and had a little more curl to it.</li>
            <li>u see of the model is pretty darn accurate, depending on the lighting.</li>
            <li>The color is very pretty....</li>
            <li>was pretty excited to find it on my door step within a couple days with Prime shipping, but I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect after reading so many reviews stating that the wig was a different color than the one pictured.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s honestly a very pretty wig</li>
            <li>But it is very pretty.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very pretty that I didn&#x27;t want to cut it up to match the character.</li>
            <li>and it was my very first wig ever.</li>
            <li>The color of the wig is a bit darker than depicted on the picture but it still looks very natural and it&#x27;s very smooth.</li>
            <li>It seemed to be a good quality and lasted a long time.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I received many compliments on how healthy \\&quot;my hair\\&quot; was, and frequently asked what products I was using to get such a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>The hair quality is good though, it is very long in length.</li>
            <li>The shine isn&#x27;t too much, and it doesn&#x27;t frizz, and you can easily unknot it with your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It tangles easily, but my real hair extensions do that too</li>
            <li>The bangs look fantastic and the color is very realistic.</li>
            <li>The wig fit perfectly, There are little hook like things that allow you to adjust the size of the inner band.</li>
            <li>They are very well made, fit my head well, and have places to sew clips</li>
            <li>It barely fit on my head without some struggling and you have to be gentle so as not to tangle it.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t even worth returning.</li>
            <li>But, fun.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun and flirty.</li>
            <li>It will more than likely fit you regardless of head size, though.</li>
            <li>This wig looks really nice considering the low price.</li>
            <li>I love the longer bangs and the soft layers</li>
            <li>My husband bought this wig for me thinking it would be worth a try and</li>
            <li>It was definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>and he said it looked like real hair so that made me even more confident to go out in public with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this wig for both fun purposes and for Halloween.</li>
            <li>Great quality product for a crazy good price.</li>
            <li>Defiantly worth buying.</li>
            <li>The color is more like a light blonde also.</li>
            <li>Took awhile to get here since it&#x27;s coming from overseas, but definately worth it.</li>
            <li>The color of the wig in real life is very different than in the pictures- in a good way.  </li>
            <li>I love the feel of it, it&#x27;s so soft, but it is a bit shiny in pictures</li>
            <li>Worth it.</li>
            <li>hue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this is a fun wig.</li>
            <li>This wig was more auburn red than light brown.</li>
            <li>I purchased it as part of a Halloween costume, but is nice enough to wear every day.</li>
            <li>Product was correct color as pictured it is a golden brown</li>
            <li>This is a lovely wig and looks natural.</li>
            <li>Ordered this item for fun.</li>
            <li>The wig is for fun</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s much more natural.</li>
            <li>last thing: the wig was packaged quite nicely.</li>
            <li>I have a smaller head than most adults, and as a petite person, it would be nice to have been told that the wig would only fit the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; head, not a petite adult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are much better products available for the same price</li>
            <li>It is  worth $2.99 maybe.  </li>
            <li>For what I payed it was worth it</li>
            <li>For the price its worth a shot.</li>
            <li>The wig was nice, but mine came a bit red.</li>
            <li>The only thing I&#x27;d say that gives it away is the nonexistant part, so I wear it with a slouchy knit beanie and it looks nice.</li>
            <li>I took it out of the wrapper, and was SO happy, to see it was so long, and silky soft!</li>
            <li>It got super tangled as I tried wearing it the first time.</li>
            <li>Under certain lights, the shine is more apparent, but I took some photos in diffuse light</li>
            <li>but if you do I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be fine for a long time.</li>
            <li>A wig is supposed to lie nice and flat on your head, not all scrunched up.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this wig and am so far pretty happy with it.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t want another dark brown wig, and I already have hair this length, and my own haircut is better.</li>
            <li>I had to cut on the front to make it look right.</li>
            <li>and I have it on right now</li>
            <li>so i got to try it on right away .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it for a cosplay right now</li>
            <li>Its a really great wig, extremely soft &amp; its about 19\\&quot; long.</li>
            <li>You do not have bald spots, it can be easily combed and looks very natural</li>
            <li>IT EVEN CAME WITH A FREE GIFT OF CUTE PINK ANKE SOCKS, WHICH IS PRETTY COOL.</li>
            <li>Hair piece is very large.</li>
            <li>I had to cut the bangs down to the right length for it to look good on me.  </li>
            <li>It has beautiful hi lights and low lights, light copper brown with medium brown low lights, it looks very natural.</li>
            <li>Its not bad really.</li>
            <li>but theyre too long, despite being shorter than my own (which r side bangs so</li>
            <li>Some other people said that the bangs are too long but mine were cut perfectly.</li>
            <li>Nice and long, just like photo&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is the same color as my natural hair (light chestnut brown), it&#x27;s got a great wave, and after a quick soak in some cool water and a little bit of hairspray, it looks almost as good as the real thing (human hair).</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this because of the high reviews.</li>
            <li>I would consider the color light red rather than light brown</li>
            <li>It arrived super fast.</li>
            <li>Nice for costume or kids play but can&#x27;t really use for yourself out in public.</li>
            <li>I am very very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li>It is not a high quality wig, but it looks like a nice wig.</li>
            <li>The synthetic hair looks very real, even up close.</li>
            <li>Looks very real for synthetic hair.</li>
            <li>Arrived earlier than expected, is good quality for an inexpensive price!</li>
            <li>my kids age are wearing wigs and really, this one compares good with all the other wigs the girls wear.</li>
            <li>The bangs seem a bit long, and it tangles very easily.</li>
            <li>Im so excited to get all dolled up today with my new hair.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much ;))</li>
            <li>Its hard to manage but looks great as a costume accessory.</li>
            <li>Very pretty color and feels super soft.</li>
            <li>The ONLY issue I had is the wig cap is HUGE!</li>
            <li>Also when I bought it there were more pictures showing the wig from side and back, I don&#x27;t know why they removed them.</li>
            <li>This is the first wig I&#x27;ve ever purchased for myself.</li>
            <li>or I looked funny in</li>
            <li>I would say that it&#x27;s more of a deep honey-toned chestnut brown.</li>
            <li>The hair looks almost real!  </li>
            <li>The color is two, three shades darker than on the picture making it more dark honey blond than light</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased a lot of cheap costume wigs, some nice cosplay wigs, and worn even more expensive ones.</li>
            <li>When it came it really pretty</li>
            <li>If you are on the market for a wig or you just want an inexpensive wig to try out, definitely get this one, you won&#x27;t regret it :-).</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was my first wig ever</li>
            <li>At first I though it was my hair; then I realized it was the wig.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought they looked rather shorter than the product images, but after putting it on, it relaxes to a length of about mid-back.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty.</li>
            <li>This wig is the first one I have ever purchased.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly as mentioned and shown in the description.</li>
            <li>first wig I ever bought, and I&#x27;ve had PLENTY.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty, but not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still just as pretty as when I bought it.</li>
            <li>looks real!</li>
            <li>One drawback is that the color is a bit different from the picture, but I like this color better.</li>
            <li>This wig is really pretty and does the job.  </li>
            <li>The color is pretty close to the one in the picture.</li>
            <li>(this was my first wig.)</li>
            <li>It is well worth the money an looks exactly like real hair.</li>
            <li>First things first...</li>
            <li>I really want that wig!</li>
            <li>The wave in it is pretty but  not as wavy as the picture.</li>
            <li>It comes with a wig cap which works pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>VERY flattering!</li>
            <li>This is my first wig</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not expensive</li>
            <li>which is funny</li>
            <li>The wig still has a definite wave going on but its now longer and much more</li>
            <li>This wig feels very close to real hair and is able to be brushed and styled as such (I&#x27;ve read that a warm curling iron can be used too</li>
            <li>If you are considering to buy this wig, and dont know if you should or not, you totally should, you wont regret it! :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really soft and light.</li>
            <li>It looks exactly as it does in the picture.</li>
            <li>This wig is pretty.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it any time!!</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>is the first wig I bought in awhile.</li>
            <li>But I would recommend this wig to all my friends and family ;)</li>
            <li>It is the first one I have ever owned and</li>
            <li>The first time I wore it, I received so many complements saying I looked like a completely different person!</li>
            <li>, I absolutely recommend it to anyone out there!</li>
            <li>But that is ok because I will not wear this wig on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>The color was more of reddish and it was to big</li>
            <li>Not the color stated and would be ok for Halloween but not for going out or anything public.</li>
            <li>and the color was pretty.</li>
            <li>It is pretty shiny.  </li>
            <li>will definitely buy more from this company.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too hot for summer</li>
            <li>I ordered this on June 2nd and it just got here today :-)</li>
            <li>I love the wig , the only problem is</li>
            <li>First of all, I never wrote any review before.</li>
            <li>And this is my first time that I feel like I should share my experience about this wig.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So my hair is naturally a light brown, but I haven&#x27;t seen my natural color in ages.</li>
            <li>Wore it for Halloween and nobody recognized me, even the guys ask if it was real!</li>
            <li>I have worn it several times and love the way it looks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the price though, just be gentle with it.</li>
            <li>I wear it everyday and it is still in good condition.</li>
            <li>not the synthetic, usually enredarce a little, but it&#x27;s amazing how long and beautiful it is to love....</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really like it right now.</li>
            <li>This product was very cheaply made and not even worth the money I spent on it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know how long it will last yet, but I love it. :-)</li>
            <li>But for an occasional dress up or party I would have to say have fun with it!!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know much about wigs, but this one is stunning compared to the costume wig I bought my daughter for Halloween last year</li>
            <li>I own several wigs and this one is one of my favorites as far as styles and color.</li>
            <li>This wig looks very real and is super soft.</li>
            <li>It came right on time, and is way better than what I expected of it.</li>
            <li>Might need to trim them but the back is very full.</li>
            <li>Came fast &amp; was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>first time getting a wig, feel like real hair.</li>
            <li>The waves are very bouncy and pretty.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first wig I&#x27;ve ever purchased and it looks totally real.</li>
            <li>This wig is pretty, but to me it doesn&#x27;t look real when you wear it.  </li>
            <li>This wig is pretty much as shown.</li>
            <li>I flat ironed it since I know straight hair looks better on me</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s long so that u can cut it the way u want it to look :)</li>
            <li>It came in the right color and it&#x27;s very soft!</li>
            <li>I usually just wear a cute hat to cover it and it looks fine.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would complain about is that I wish the quality of the hair wasn&#x27;t as &amp;#34;shiny&amp;#34; making it appear more wig-like rather than realistic.</li>
            <li>I love long wigs!</li>
            <li>Overall, it is nice and super long!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t do many hair styles in the front of the hair and the bangs are very long.</li>
            <li>Hangs well, very long, and not terribly shiny.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gag gift to a coworker and for the price it has a very realistic look.</li>
            <li>It is definitely BROWN and just a pretty light shiny brown.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very very pleased especially considering I only paid 6.49</li>
            <li>was quite satisfied with it, except it was not as long as the picture, doesn&#x27;t have as much volume as the picture</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a weird shine to it many wigs can have, but looks like very healthy, brown hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the hair, texture, looks real but didn&#x27;t like the bang, too long, maybe a hairstylist can help</li>
            <li>and it certainly helped with the tangling.</li>
            <li>While the wig itself is very beautiful, the quality (at least in my personal opinion) is very very very cheap and not worth the $15.99 that I paid.  </li>
            <li>I am going to order same wig from different seller because when I first got it I really liked it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely easy to brush and as far as I think, looks perfectly natural.</li>
            <li>However, it is still very manageable and can be brushed or trimmed easily to style.</li>
            <li>It does not have as much hair as the picture suggests, but it is very pretty and natural looking.</li>
            <li>I saw that the reviews were pretty decent and for $20</li>
            <li>It is really pretty and realistic indoors tho</li>
            <li>It is straight except for one large and obnoxious curl up at the bottom.</li>
            <li>I would&#x27;ve given 3 stars, but then it came along with a free necklace and free wig cap, so i guess it makes it up a little bit?</li>
            <li>The top of the wig seems a little unnatural but with a cute hat, it blends it in to look natural and it FEELS natural.</li>
            <li>It was comfortable and people that didn&#x27;t know I had short hair thought it was my real hair.</li>
            <li>coz u know, it was a huge change from my really short hair</li>
            <li>I received the product 3 weeks after purchasing which is fast for coming from Hong Kong.</li>
            <li>Very wavy.</li>
            <li>This seller has not replied to any of the emails I have sent except the very fist one.</li>
            <li>The bangs are much longer than pictured, though, so you will have to cut them yourself, or just push them to the side.</li>
            <li>I wanted something that was reasonably priced, just in case</li>
            <li>I give this product 5* just because I can&#x27;t really be bothered to contact them about the quality.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t bother me quite that much.</li>
            <li>I really like this wig.</li>
            <li>I got my wig really fast, weeks before the estimated date, and put it on the day after it came.</li>
            <li>My fiancé asked if I had gone and gotten my hair cut into bangs, he thought it looked so real.</li>
            <li>I am VERY satistified with this wig.</li>
            <li>Trying to gently comb it with both my hands and wig comb has a lot of hairs coming out.</li>
            <li>The adjustable straps on the inside are very durable.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know how to described the smell.</li>
            <li>I bought this wig very nervous because I had never bought a wig before let alone one without looking at it in person.</li>
            <li>After that they thought it was a real hair wig and not synthetic</li>
            <li>My mom wants one now just to play around and change up her hair :</li>
            <li>everyone thinks its my real hair .</li>
            <li>It looks real,</li>
            <li>There is so much hair coming out of the wig that&#x27;s</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s so much hair coming out of the wig just from trying it on once</li>
            <li>My mother saw that it was a wig as soon as I showed it to her, and I lied saying that I had my hair done, but she knew it wasn&#x27;t real</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll try it out in the real world now.</li>
            <li>When I ordered this wig I was really apprehensive.</li>
            <li>So much gaudier in real life.</li>
            <li>so a real bargain.</li>
            <li>But, it really doesn&#x27;t matter..</li>
            <li>the delivery faster than I expected..this people really care for customers..</li>
            <li>I really do.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a much darker brown and quite a bit shorter.</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>thanks for absolutely nothing LOLI.</li>
            <li>I will start by saying this: the hair on this wig both looks and feels real.</li>
            <li>The bangs are also much longer than the ones in the picture, so you&#x27;ll have to cut them to get them out of your eyes.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t expect it this fast.</li>
            <li>Really curly.</li>
            <li>I really want to buy like 10 and wear them forever...</li>
            <li>Those who didn&#x27;t thought it was real hair.</li>
            <li>There isnt a ton of waves in it, fairly straight hair.</li>
            <li>and I swear it looks real in person and in the photographs.</li>
            <li>it feels real too.</li>
            <li>Very silky and shiny.</li>
            <li>People who did not know me thought this was my real hair.  </li>
            <li>I sewed in wig clips to keep it on, as it didn&#x27;t feel secure with only the rubber.  </li>
            <li>It gives me so much confidence.</li>
            <li>It looked real and</li>
            <li>You would never guess it was such a cheap wig.  </li>
            <li>Ok so I bought this wig for drag (I&#x27;m a guy)</li>
            <li>The wig looks absolutely real.</li>
            <li>This wig looks much better than I expected for the price.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I bought this wig for a Halloween costume and liked it so much I&#x27;m thinking about buying a second for personal use!</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect.</li>
            <li>To much messing anymore.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>When I have worn this wig I&#x27;ve been asked if it was my real hair.</li>
            <li>but it is better than I expected.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s cheap only in price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And now I can play with styling the wig much easier.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and/or are very &amp;#34;costumey&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>The wig is VERY shiny..</li>
            <li>I would recommend washing the wig, because it IS really shiny.</li>
            <li>but when I put it on the wig was very itchy and kept knotting up.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>Having said that, I don&#x27;t have much experience with caring for wigs.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how real this wig looks.  </li>
            <li>This wig could pass for her real hair.</li>
            <li>There is no doubt that it looks incredibly real.</li>
            <li>It looks like real hair.</li>
            <li>It shipped really fast</li>
            <li>really.</li>
            <li>This product i bought it after reading all the reviews..it doesn&#x27;t look real at all..</li>
            <li>However, I went ahead and did so since it was such a cheap price.</li>
            <li>I really wanted the one pictured here.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, and still worth the money.</li>
            <li>Looks real when worn.</li>
            <li>I tried to gently brush is and the hair started coming out immediatly.</li>
            <li>It came much faster than anticipated!&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I really don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li>I bought this for some one who is going bald, you can not even tell it is not their real hair.</li>
            <li>It looks and moves like real hair.</li>
            <li>the color light brown is the same as show in the picture.</li>
            <li>Very pretty.&lt;br /&gt;makes</li>
            <li>A couple of people even thought it was my real hair.</li>
            <li>So overall I give this only a 2 stars for the nice color and softness.  </li>
            <li>I thought the color was more brown than red and had lots of natural looking tones to it.</li>
            <li>depending on the lighting, the hair color looks different, which I think is pretty cool, if u ask me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color and the slight curls match the pictures, but it tangles very easily.</li>
            <li>I have been buying wigs left and right in order to wear out on the weekends for fun, you know, wigging out.</li>
            <li>The side-swept bangs are the right length, hair looks natural.</li>
            <li>Tangles easily, but, the long wigs always do.  </li>
            <li>use an old very large afro hair pick to style it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will most likely trim the wig along the sides for a more natural length and find some way to tone down the shine.</li>
            <li>The wig does look fake but good for a night out or for halloween!  </li>
            <li>I got this wig for a halloween costume and it was SO much better than I expected!</li>
            <li>Also, the length is shorter than what I see in the image, and I imagine it&#x27;s due to the curls being more defined.  </li>
            <li>and I would have been willing to put a little more towards it.</li>
            <li>I spent $10 max on this, and it is better than any wig that I could get around here (where I live.)</li>
            <li>Very natural, and much better quality than I expected for the money.</li>
            <li>i currently have this one and my pink and white one together and they look great</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and silky and very well cut!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, does not smell funny or anything.</li>
            <li>It is more like dark strawberry blond.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It looked soft and pretty when I took it out of the package</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, it came after 8 days.(I live in Norway)&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>you pay more at the halloween shops for a lot less wig.  </li>
            <li>Just be careful, since it tangles easily.</li>
            <li>Also, it gets tangled easy which is to be expected because its so long.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>: This is THE MAIN CON I HAVE-the netting.</li>
            <li>But it was soft, really shiny and didn&#x27;t shed to much.</li>
            <li>Surely the wig has a tiny red hue</li>
            <li>so i bought this wig because the reviews were decent and i wanted to wear it on a weekend trip to the city.</li>
            <li>It came early and it really was a high quality wig for the price!</li>
            <li>It was a big hit at work and around family that is more used to my blue hair.</li>
            <li>it was very soft and silky!</li>
            <li>Wig looks pretty real but very shiny especially in pictures with a flash.</li>
            <li>it sheds a lot and doesnt last long at all, but then they are like 15 dollars so you can buy several for the price of one good quality synthetic.</li>
            <li>I have a tiny head though and the cap seems to be the right size for my head without much</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>is one I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a wig.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>definitely, HIGHLY recommend this wig.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a high quality product..</li>
            <li>This wig tangles very easily just from very little wear.</li>
            <li>I cant make this wig look remotely natural due to not being able to put it on all the way.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more orange though.</li>
            <li>I do own those plastic ones but they are SO hard to maintain.</li>
            <li>The natural color and cut makes it look like it&#x27;s my real hair -</li>
            <li>It looks completely and utterly real.</li>
            <li>It comes with a wig cap and a few interesting trinkets (cell phone chain).</li>
            <li>First, I do admit that people might get crappier ones if they are unlucky, since there are so many negative reviews.</li>
            <li>only thing that does give the wig away is the shine many synthetic wigs have, a shine you don&#x27;t see in natural human hair.</li>
            <li>can be used to normal or formal.</li>
            <li>Its okay too, but not light brown like i ordered.</li>
            <li>Overall, its worth the money, yes.</li>
            <li>It is VERY wavy and a little curly, easily gets frizzy however.</li>
            <li>and I was super surprised when it came it that it was of such high quality.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does shed a bit just being handled, but I learned that that&#x27;s normal for a new wig.</li>
            <li>The company had sent me an email right after the product shipped telling me personally who I could contact if I have any problems.</li>
            <li>and it came right above my hip.</li>
            <li>Also, the color is NOT monotone and dull, you can see light brown and dark brown individual hairs, sort of with a reddish tint (just like my own hair color)!  </li>
            <li>This is a super long wig with an almost &#x27;ombre effect from L. Brown to a auburn-ish tip.</li>
            <li>Light and fluffy with decent length and great bangs that hang down over half my face.</li>
            <li>I think I actually need a much darker color for it to look natural on me, but I think this is the only color available for this wig on Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>It also tangles very easily and is pretty thin on the bottom.</li>
            <li>Used a regular round brush to sweep the bang to one side because they were a bit long for my face and it looked great.</li>
            <li>make it look a little more natural.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this wig especially if it&#x27;s going to be your first wig.</li>
            <li>When I got my new haircut</li>
            <li>I called to order a new one, they said they sent it</li>
            <li>, i dont think they ever sent a new one of my choice.</li>
            <li>I wore it out ,shopping with my husband,and,i really felt pretty ,having long hair, again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent over 50.00 for wigs that aren&#x27;t as nearly comfortable or look as natural as this one.</li>
            <li>When looking at it closely you&#x27;ll notice that there&#x27;s not enough hair sewn in to make it look truly real, but for the price point how can you really</li>
            <li>The color is a tiny bit more auburn than expected</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a wig that is long, straight kinda curly, and  has pretty bangs that are pre-trimmed for you, this is the wig for you.</li>
            <li>The first one held up for a long time and was very well made...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and quite realistic looking beyond maybe being too shiny if you want to nitpick.</li>
            <li>Anyway when I touched the wig, it was very soft.</li>
            <li>looks very natural.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m wearing it now very natural looking.</li>
            <li>Looks very natural, I am thinking of wearing it every day.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised, because you CAN straighten and curl this wig.</li>
            <li>and it looks so very natural</li>
            <li>Its very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>The first thing that I noticed was that the color was different from the pictures.</li>
            <li>I ordered 2 of these lovely wigs, in case I wanted to cut one in a shorter style  and make additional wefts for the other for extra thickness.  </li>
            <li>item,,,she could not believed I paid under ten dollars for a high quality wig!!</li>
            <li>I bought this for a pirate costume (female) and wore it under a bandana (the bangs fell funny along my face) and a pirate hat.</li>
            <li>They were only willing to replace the item.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even explain how surprised I was at the quality of this wig!</li>
            <li>but I had several people said it looked real!</li>
            <li>Wow again!</li>
            <li>I will say you probably have to cut the bangs a little tiny bit more depending on your forehead, to frame the face a little more.  </li>
            <li>I am actually surprised with how well the quality of this turned out to be!</li>
            <li>Not lovely, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>I got it on an impulse as an accessory and thought it would be fun to wear my hair this long every once in a while, but I haven&#x27;t even worn it out of the bathroom yet.  </li>
            <li>(I was only gently finger-combing!</li>
            <li>so I was skeptical, but when I got it, the texture was very close to real hair, and the cut was nice.</li>
            <li>The bangs were a little longer than I expected, but overall I&#x27;m very pleased with the product, and the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li>At least then it would look more realistic.</li>
            <li>Does not look like typical cheap wigs</li>
            <li>It has only shed slightly , so far, but this is my first day.  </li>
            <li>I loved this wig and its long and thick</li>
            <li>but I like more the one in person, not very bright, so betrays</li>
            <li>It has a little bit of a shine to it but that is fine.</li>
            <li>Speaking of which, please buy your own: the one provided is a weak mesh one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good quick fix for a bad hair day.  </li>
            <li>Wish it was less red and more brown tho.</li>
            <li>I read online that some either wet, wash or baby powder their wigs to make them look less shiny and more like real hair.  </li>
            <li>I actually chopped it a little bit and looked better now.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;ll tangle fairly quick and use a wide toothed brush!</li>
            <li>Without a wig cap I can make it work, but the wig pulls back and it&#x27;s hard to manage my own hair underneath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only thing I can really say about it is that it lingers all over your natural hair.</li>
            <li>natural looking, not too shiny.</li>
            <li>it like an hour ago and do far</li>
            <li>Falls naturally, and the cap fits me well-</li>
            <li>I bought this wig about 3 weeks ago (Near the beginning of March).</li>
            <li>I showed my sister and she thought it was professional</li>
            <li>fibers are soft and the wavy texture looks natural.</li>
            <li>I was so pleasantly surprised at the quality and fullness of this wig.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that really bothers me is the scent of the wig.</li>
            <li>I was delivered on time and it&#x27;s incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>and when I took it out of the box I was pleasantly surprised :</li>
            <li>and I was getting so self conscious and didn&#x27;t know what to do.</li>
            <li>but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Also, it didn&#x27;t tangle at all, so far..</li>
            <li>Looks quite natural, the hairline is well blended.</li>
            <li>It has all these highlights and lowlights that bring out the color, which for mine wasn&#x27;t too far off from the product photo.</li>
            <li>Wow, this is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>IT LOOKS QUITE NATURAL AFTER.</li>
            <li>so i would to buy at least three more.  </li>
            <li>So I got this one thinking it was natural</li>
            <li>and everyone thought it was my natural hair.</li>
            <li>And so far, it has worked.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really soft and natural looking wig.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The color and cut are so natural that I suspect almost anyone could wear it without feeling self-conscious.</li>
            <li>I cannot afford real hair wigs (Starting price $700!!).</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was the length, it wasn&#x27;t too long</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>It is soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I bought this wig and thought wow.</li>
            <li>One can&#x27;t complain too much, because the cost is so low.</li>
            <li>The waves are really natural looking as is the color.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised when I receive this.</li>
            <li>It does tangle fairly fast, but the quality and overall product cancels that out.</li>
            <li>The second, not so much.</li>
            <li>The hair itself is silky soft.</li>
            <li>As far as construction goes, you can&#x27;t see any of the wefts when you wear it.</li>
            <li>It is quite soft and not too shiny.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its soft and</li>
            <li>The fringe is straight across/ish, not blunt but blends back out longer and longer, into the rest of the hair.</li>
            <li>theres enough room for a full head of long hair inside.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about bangs, but not much I can do about that.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it sheds and tangles pretty easily.</li>
            <li>Other synthetic wigs cost 5 times as much and don&#x27;t have the feel of real hair</li>
            <li>A little to shiny to be real, but no one would know at first glance.</li>
            <li>length was OK, but not as long as expected from the picture (the model was obviously a very short person.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that straight out of the box, it&#x27;s a bit shiny, but that&#x27;s easily solved with some baby powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>I am interested in hatural human hair, is this wig made from 100% human hair?</li>
            <li>When rec&#x27;d this wig was amazed at the softness and length, only thing was displeased with is that get&#x27;s snarly when brushed and putting on, being first wig once get use to putting on</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent wig especially for the price.</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty short, now, and dyed blonde..</li>
            <li>The picture made me worry that it might be dark blonde light brown</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, it has enough volume and length to be a decent wig.</li>
            <li>not too shiny, and very silky smooth softness to it, not a lot of shedding when i brushed it only a few fibers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely light compared to my other wig, yet has more than enough coverage and looks very thick.</li>
            <li>I like it because his very beautifull long</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s pretty good, but the cap is too small and makes it sore and achey behind my ears after a day&#x27;s wear.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>the wig itself looks very dark strawberry blonde in the light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not real hair, it very shiny but soft nonetheless, I suppose human-made means that it wasn&#x27;t done by a machine.</li>
            <li>Coo2day is they deliver fast and send you a wig cover (for you to put on before the wig) and socks (random, I know but who doesn&#x27;t love</li>
            <li>The only way I can wear it so that it looks real is if I hide the \\&quot;scalp\\&quot;, because of the way it parts and how it makes my head look bigger than it is.</li>
            <li>I am nearly 60 and have very very long mostly grey golden brown mixed hair</li>
            <li>I had gone through and read all the reviews and while the good reviews spoke highly of this wig, the bad ones made me hesitant.</li>
            <li>The wig looked very real, I had at least a dozen people ask if it was my real hair.</li>
            <li>a cosplayers (and all my cosplayers friends agree) - buy 100% Japanese Kanekalon (high quality one) made fiber ONLY.</li>
            <li>But for a wig at such a low price, it was surprisingly high quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if would fit someone with a larger size head.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had multiple people come up to me and compliment my hair, asking what products I use to get it so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>My problem is that it&#x27;s much shorter than I expected, probably because the girl on the picture is so petite.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m only 26 years old)</li>
            <li>I barely touched it.  </li>
            <li>Plus, the sleek, shine to the hair makes me feel like I&#x27;m in a professional shampoo commercial!  </li>
            <li>What I received barely resembles the image.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, it does look real enough and it feels soft.</li>
            <li>I MODEL FOR A LIVING, AND OFTEN USE WIGS AS MY NATURAL HAIR IS VERY SHORT,</li>
            <li>wig net to hold one&#x27;s natural hair.  </li>
            <li>but I actually wanted a wig I could wear out that looks natural.</li>
            <li>I recently dyed my hair and had to have a natural color for the work place.</li>
            <li>, I was just curious and did not expect much -</li>
            <li>but my natural hair is red, so</li>
            <li>/&gt;requires trimming/styling (if you don&#x27;t know how)&lt;br /&gt;smaller than a regular wig&lt;br /&gt;shinier than natural hair</li>
            <li>wore this as an everyday wig adored it even got a few cosplays out of it not shiny realistic and easy to style a bit of shedding though</li>
            <li>I love this wig it is thin but covers all of the netting underneath.</li>
            <li>Bought to help cheer self up a wee bit more as a very rough year, lost my second leg above the knee, and hair is leaving due to all meds am on.....</li>
            <li>am using this daily, it gets tangled a little quick</li>
            <li>long however a few quick snips with the scissors fixed that.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not super soft or anything which doesn&#x27;t really bug me and isn&#x27;t unnaturally shiny or anything.</li>
            <li>This wig is gorgeous, it tangles easily, but not so horrible</li>
            <li>The make is a bit sloppy but the outcome is ok.</li>
            <li>Super long front bangs, it covers half of my face.</li>
            <li>The wig doesn&#x27;t have as much hair as the picture shows, and the bangs are really long and need extensive trimming because they don&#x27;t sweep to the side at all, they hang straight down.</li>
            <li>cause it was a little over the top for everyday wear and got tangled alot.</li>
            <li>Hair is a little thin, but it&#x27;s a good quality.</li>
            <li>It requires a gentle brushing at least once a day, but is durable and looks real.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been around artificial or real hair wigs at all, but when this came in I was extremely pleased with the quality.</li>
            <li>its a little darker and it looks soooooo real!</li>
            <li>The crown part where the hair changes direction lays a little funny.</li>
            <li>Just have a little bit of patience and be willing to work with it.</li>
            <li>It was pretty cool the first few times but now its just a hard to untangle mess</li>
            <li>It smells like new clothes of a new car, a little like plastic and factory.</li>
            <li>Has great length and color but was disappointed in quality</li>
            <li>it looked that high-quality (because of my general knowledge of wigs prior to buying this one).</li>
            <li>The wig arrived within three weeks, and I was happily surprised to find it&#x27;s not complete junk for the price.</li>
            <li>I bought this exact wig off of ebay a few months ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, the only problem Im noticing is it&#x27;s a little itchy at first, but now I don&#x27;t feel it.</li>
            <li>The wig cap runs a little small, but I just pinned it in more, and it stayed in place all night.</li>
            <li>This wig is really soft, wavy, glamorous,and long!</li>
            <li>I wore this for less than an hour and the whole bottom layer was tangled in a rats nest.</li>
            <li>The length doesn&#x27;t feel as long as the picture in fact it&#x27;s only two inches longer than my natural hair.</li>
            <li>The only thing that was a little iffy on my wig was the color (dark brown instead of light brown), but I ended up liking the color I got instead of the one I ordered xp.</li>
            <li>The color is a dark toned dirty blonde color, great for almost any skin tone.</li>
            <li>I got a free pair of hot pink socks with it, kinda random</li>
            <li>The color looks to be blended with darker, lighter, and reddish fibers for a real-looking brown... not flat and one dimensional like a lot of the wigs I see around.</li>
            <li>Not much different than the dark long wig but pretty.</li>
            <li>I have dark brown hair and this wig was even darker than my own hair, really only reaches the shoulders, and has straight bangs (I really, really hate straight bangs.)</li>
            <li>It is very small and I cant even pull it down all the way, so it rides up on top of my scalp.  </li>
            <li>The bangs also came much longer than in the picture, but I don&#x27;t mind because I like them a little longer anyway</li>
            <li>(i got it really short to get rid of my old bleached hair) and also I havent had my hair this long (chest length now) since kindergarten!!!.</li>

            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> It is really cute!</li>

            <li> I love this wig!</li>
            <li> I also got a wig cap and a cute  pair of purple socks!</li>
            <li> If all goes well with this wig, which I believe it will, I&#x27;ll be sure to buy from this company again!</li>
            <li> I look so sexy wearing this hair!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this wig!</li>
            <li> Love the color, length and just everything about this wig!</li>
            <li> I love the waves too!</li>
            <li> I bought this wig bc of the reviews, and I am pleased!</li>
            <li> Great value, and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is very soft, beautiful, and it fits beautifully to me.</li>
            <li> Very good quality for the price worth the wait for coming from China.</li>
            <li> and I got a lot of comments saying nice hair amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing , still using it after months.</li>
            <li> I was so suprised that a wig this great could be so cheap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this wig is an amazing deal.</li>
            <li> It is absolutely amazing, for being a $10 wig.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Some nice.....</li>
            <li> some not so nice.</li>
            <li> Which is a nice length for in case someone would like to cut it shorter for one reason or</li>
            <li> So I try to rig it to sit on top of my head and wear a headband, doesn&#x27;t look good...</li>
            <li> I liked this wig.</li>
            <li> I liked it a lot</li>
            <li> I smiled and said \\&quot;No</li>
            <li> The hair is nice</li>
            <li> I really like this wig and for the price it is excellent.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, everyone who saw me thought it was my real hair</li>
            <li> I own a LOT of wigs.</li>
            <li> It still looked good and the material is better than the ones you see at costume</li>
            <li> I do own plastic ones cuz they were on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have wore it for Halloween, I wore it to an Anime convention (makes a nice Orihime from \\&quot;Bleach\\&quot; wig)</li>
            <li> Its a really nice wig for the price.</li>
            <li> I may order another and experiment with length and adjustments with this one, thats the nice thing about this wig.</li>
            <li> It gave the wig a nice scent.</li>
            <li> So I went on the hunt for a nice wig.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m kind of hating it..</li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews on this item I as kind of sceptical of buying this.</li>
            <li> cool2day is awesome btw, very helpful, very kind and always available to answer any questions! :)</li>
            <li> Love love love  it!!</li>
            <li> Love Love Love it!!.</li>
            <li> What was surprising is the the company sent me a email letting me know it was coming and to let them know if their was a problem they were there to make sure I was satisfied.</li>
            <li> The product tangles very easily</li>
            <li> It is also very easy to put on.</li>
            <li> This also tangles very easily.</li>
            <li> I just wish that it came in more color choices so that I could buy one better suited for me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE ALREAY PLACED ANOTHER ORDER FROM THIS SELLER AND WILL BE MAKING MANY MORE!</li>
            <li> All in all I love it and will be buying from the seller more often!</li>
            <li> For the most part though, it looks amazing</li>
            <li> Nice for a night on the town and many complements on hair.</li>
            <li> It comes with a nice wig cap, but I prefer using the wig without it, as it stays on my head better.  </li>
            <li> Looks great, takes awhile to ship because its coming from china but worth the wait.</li>
            <li> So for me tht was a perfect length, it was incredibly soft for synthetic hair.</li>
            <li> And the curls are kinda like soft curls, maybe 1.5\\&quot; curls but very beautiful.</li>
            <li> Very impressed with the quality and how soft the hair is.</li>
            <li> The hair quality was actually really good, it fit well</li>
            <li> The price was cheap when I bought the wig, so it was a really good deal.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend giving it a try!</li>
            <li> : It still sheds but after a week it&#x27;s still holding strong!</li>
            <li> i love love love this company!</li>
            <li> As soon as I got the wig in the mail, I immediately tried it on because I was that excited about it, and it looked good until I started noticing hair falling all over the place.  </li>
            <li> It looks very real and many people commented how beautiful it is.</li>
            <li> B005KO7NK6 Stunning beautiful long LIGHT BROWN curly wave wig full wigs jf010023]] very happy with the product arrived on time good quolity and no problem with anything</li>
            <li> Great size, Great quality so pleased with my purchase arrived fast and well packaged / a great value  and a must for any adult mannequin</li>
            <li> and my husband sure loves it, probably more so than my own hair pre-folliculitis.  </li>
            <li> This would be a great cosplay/costume wig, but I don&#x27;t think it would really fool anyone if you wanted it to look like your own hair in person.</li>
            <li> This felt great to wear...and real!</li>
            <li> so PRETTY lol.</li>
            <li> but hey I&#x27;m fine with that!</li>
            <li> wig is very light weight</li>
            <li> Though, with the right outfit, it looked amazing!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Drawbacks: Being a fairly thick-haired wig, it&#x27;s pretty warm.</li>
            <li> This wig was absolutely stunning, realistic, gorgeous!</li>
            <li> The color is gorgeous and it looks very real!</li>
            <li> good looking, good cut, very natural looking.  </li>
            <li> Beautiful realistic color.</li>
            <li> I even had to cut off a good inch because of the way it tangled within the first day!</li>
            <li> I was super excited to get this because I read all the wonderful reviews and they were not wrong!</li>
            <li> packaging wasa very protective of wig and my wife loves to have a large selection and this was a perfect addition with a nice wave and layercut look.</li>
            <li> It was a nice color and very pretty!</li>
            <li> If the seller could take PICTURES OF THE INSIDE, That would be a lot better.</li>
            <li> Kudos to those who love it and can wear it.</li>
            <li> Currently my favorite wig ever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li> Okay, so, I am in love with this wig.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this wig for anyone. :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it and will order from this company more often.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure about the hooks for tightening the wig.</li>
            <li> wig did come with a couple extras, one of those things being a free wig cap!</li>
            <li> They wrote just to make sure I didn&#x27;t have any questions or concerns!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I never thought of wearing a wig because I thought I&#x27;d look for lack of a better word, \\&quot;crazy.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> Who knows if everyone is convinced that it&#x27;s my real hair, I feel like it looks great</li>
            <li> I just bought three more so that I&#x27;d have backup.  </li>
            <li> I just washed mine using non-sulfate shampoo and it came out looking even better than before.  </li>
            <li> Wen products or something without detergent is probably the safe way to go if you don&#x27;t have wig shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Immediately wanted to try it on... and cant even fit it on my head!  </li>
            <li> and when I just go to arrange the hairs, many hairs fall out/not tied in correctly.  </li>
            <li> I got it for a costume, and it seems okay.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> This wig is already helping me feel more confident.</li>
            <li> But I would wear it more....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always best to wear a wig cap for me, especially with thinner wigs.</li>
            <li> Mine is more of a chestnut color.</li>
            <li> ,I love it</li>
            <li> I know this is a just a $15 wig, but shouldn&#x27;t it hold just a bit better than that?  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s probably more of a user error thing with me not knowing what the *</li>
            <li> Absolutley love this wig.</li>
            <li> Love this wig.</li>
            <li> This was the most ill-fitting wig I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> even so nooo am nit satisfied will not buy ever never again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several wigs from them, and have always been really impressed.</li>
            <li> And, i love the color, a medium brown, with some reddish highlights..</li>
            <li> and i love them</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> I really love these Cool2day wigs.</li>
            <li> It came fast, hope everyone else is happy with it to.</li>
            <li> The curls are cute and not over-exaggerated or under done</li>
            <li> and I just really love it.</li>
            <li> Love this wig.</li>
            <li> It reached the top ot my breasts.</li>
            <li> Was really comfortable to wear too make it my wig of choice!</li>
            <li> I need to find a more sturdy one</li>
            <li> THOUGH THEY CAN BE SWEPT TO EITHER SIDE, I CUT MINE BECAUSE IT&#x27;S A BETTER LOOK FOR ME.</li>
            <li> UNLIKE MANY SYNTHETIC WIGS, IT DIDN&#x27;T SPLINTER WHEN I TRIMMED IT</li>
            <li> this wig is BETTER  than the picture.</li>
            <li> I got so many compliments on this wig.  </li>
            <li> Way better than any Halloween store.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> and I take every opportunity to wear it :)</li>
            <li> I will order more of these if I can.  </li>
            <li> It looks so much better than the picture.  </li>
            <li> I will be buying one or two more just in case</li>
            <li> and initially many people didn&#x27;t recognize me</li>
            <li> Some times it may require a bit more attention to restore it.</li>
            <li> than that, this is one of my favorite wigs.</li>
            <li> Love the wig, didn&#x27;t have to trim the bangs or anything</li>
            <li> The hair was more wavy than curly though.</li>
            <li> For the price I was wowed and most people dont realize its a wig.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m sure this wig is not up to that quality, it sure beats spending those bucks if it works.  </li>
            <li> I was able to cut them out without compromising the wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this item</li>
            <li> Also cute name. :-)</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this wig looks better in person than on the picture shown.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lovely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s longer than what it show on the picture, but either than that I love it.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m sure there are some things that could be done</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t quite sure I could pull it off.</li>
            <li> I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this wig.</li>
            <li> but it looks really cute like that anyways.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time w a cute pair of socks and wig cap.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the bangs pictures, but I like it better without.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no way I can wear this thing without a hat over the top..</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t a huge problem, seeing that it&#x27;s still a nice wig.</li>
            <li> I guess it would be better than nothing for someone who needs a wig, but my advice would be to spend the money and get one that looks better than this one does.</li>
            <li> I love the color</li>
            <li> and I love the cap size.  </li>
            <li> I would feel confident going out with it on.  </li>
            <li> and I love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit snug for me.&lt;br /&gt;-No combs or tabs to make sure it lines up correctly with your hairline.&lt;br /&gt;-SHIPPING:</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is an okay wig.</li>
            <li> ok with it</li>
            <li> Such a great wig, Thank you!</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> definitely use this company for any wig situation!! :D</li>
            <li> It looks real and feels great.</li>
            <li> but they are cute.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a truly wonderful product.</li>
            <li> For the price, it was an okay wig.</li>
            <li> The wig is much shorter, but it&#x27;s great regardless.</li>
            <li> Okay, let me be clear by saying that this wig is indeed beautiful.</li>
            <li> At first i didnt know if i made a good decision</li>
            <li> It looks nice and feels nice but is sheds so much that it&#x27;s more of a costume wig than anything else.</li>
            <li> but for that price it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> But, for every once in a while, this wig is a pretty good one.</li>
            <li> You really cannot beat this nice of a wig for the price!</li>
            <li> I was SO excited to get this wig in the mail today!</li>
            <li> I ordered another wig from this seller and I am now extremely excited to get it!</li>
            <li> very good quality for the price, i was pleasently surprised and liked it very much.</li>
            <li> these are amazing quality amazing price look real</li>
            <li> Paired with a hat, I&#x27;d stay super warm.</li>
            <li> I have a slightly big head, but the wig still fit almost perfectly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very pretty and flows nicely.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this wig because it was so popular and everyone was saying it was strawberry-blonde like in the light.</li>
            <li> The color is a rich medium brownish red, very attractive.</li>
            <li> It is VERY true to the images provided by the seller.  </li>
            <li> will enjoy it more.</li>
            <li> Even though it doesn&#x27;t looks that natural, its still fantastic and beautiful.</li>
            <li> :) quickest i&#x27;ve ever got an item.&lt;br /&gt;pretty wig, color is just like it&#x27;s stated, a light brown.</li>
            <li> This is my first wig and I&#x27;m so very pleased.</li>
            <li> Mine looked more strawberry-blonde than light brown.</li>
            <li> A bit too shiny to look real, but worth more than what you pay, a great buy for a mid-length wig.</li>
            <li> The color is gorgeous and my sister, who is a hairstylist, thought it was a real hair wig, not a synthetic one.</li>
            <li> the seller contacted me directly and was very nice and told me if i had any questions to email</li>
            <li> So if it fools people sitting next to you and stylists, it&#x27;s a good purchase in my mind!</li>
            <li> I read most of the customer reviews and read all of the product info about this wig and was really excited about buying this, but it turned out to be one of my biggest disappointments.  </li>
            <li> However, I love this wig, it is so fun!</li>
            <li> Looks beautiful and like real hair, however, it does tangle pretty easily.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t seem like they would stay in place easily.</li>
            <li> it tangles to easily</li>
            <li> It tangles easily</li>
            <li> Easy to care for,</li>
            <li> Easy to take care of.</li>
            <li> I can easily brush it but it does shed.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t tangle easy</li>
            <li> Do not use it every day though, or it will shed easily...</li>
            <li> However, it does easily tangle.</li>
            <li> It tangles extremely easily but handle it with care.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is easy to brush through without tangling.  </li>
            <li> It does get tangled really easily.</li>
            <li> It combs easily and they bangs can easily be combed to the side.</li>
            <li> It was easily tangled..</li>
            <li> It does get tangled easily though.</li>
            <li> You can easily tell this is a wig from the back!&lt;br /&gt;Other than that i like the wig.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t tangle easily, brushes out like a dream.</li>
            <li> i cannot wait to wear this and have long beautiful curly hair :)</li>
            <li> and I fall in love with it right after I tried it on!</li>
            <li> It is pretty amazing for the price.  </li>
            <li> In conclusion, the wig is beautiful, but it&#x27;s just too low a quality for me and also way too shiny and wiggy.</li>
            <li> pretty nice.</li>
            <li> it looks just like natual human hair, beautiful color</li>
            <li> Pretty color and nice texture.</li>
            <li> i feel human again and beautiful</li>
            <li> It is very natural looking and even the top remembles a real scalp with beautiful hair.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s fine because pushing them to the side looks cuter</li>
            <li> It withstands brushing just fine.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> VERY soft, good quality.</li>
            <li> It looks super realistic, adjusts to fit, and will make my Lara Croft costume absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> I absolutely fell in love with this wig!</li>
            <li> I was super surprised by the great quality of this wig.</li>
            <li> color is a little darker than what I imagined from the picture and description, however it matches my color perfectly.  </li>
            <li> It makes a huge difference in how well the wig fits.</li>
            <li> and when you put the wig on it doesnt really fit to your head shape well.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t even fit on the manikin and</li>
            <li> if it fit.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more just to wear for fun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten great use out of this despite the price and the fact that it isn&#x27;t human hair.</li>
            <li> Hopefully it will be odor free soon.</li>
            <li> It is just amazing and it looks like real hair.</li>
            <li> when I get done writing this review I liked it so much.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d consider it 100% light brown.</li>
            <li> I know it is cheap</li>
            <li> Even if I could remove some of the shine, it wouldn&#x27;t fit my dog&#x27;s head, let alone mine.</li>
            <li> It feels so comfortable ,on my head..</li>
            <li> Cheap quality product.wear it make be urgly girl.</li>
            <li> Well ..... Looks cheap</li>
            <li> For the price you would think this is just another cheap costume wig</li>
            <li> it fit well.  </li>
            <li> Fit 10.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While described as a light brown...</li>
            <li> cheap.</li>
            <li> that was a big win for</li>
            <li> cap fit well with</li>
            <li> the cap is well constructed and the fibers are sewn in securely (on this one they are)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> there was a free wig cap and a pair of sock along with it.</li>
            <li> The color was light</li>
            <li> The length is great, especially if you put detangler in it and brush it out well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered this guy because it was so cheap</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t really say or comment about the delivery, to be honest</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this wig was so cheap.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s such a great price.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t believe it when I read such great reviews on a $10 wig....</li>
            <li> The wig is like a cheap doll&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> I liked this one so much</li>
            <li> The hair is smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> Amazing  Thanks  Jackie</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was cheap</li>
            <li> The wig is a good replica of natural looking hair.  </li>
            <li> and when I got this wig in the mail and put it on, it is almost the exact color of my natural hair, so my hair and the wig blend together beautifully</li>
            <li> All in all a good wig as far as I know</li>
            <li> Easy to brush threw specially when you start from the tips and move up.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful, light brown very long wig.</li>
            <li> This wig seems to be very high quality and looks very authentic!&lt;br /&gt;After holding it up to my face, I don&#x27;t believe that it&#x27;s the best color for my particular skin tone.</li>
            <li> Very fun wig, very worth 10 dollars.</li>
            <li> The seller was very nice and included a hair net along with a pair of socks that I couldn&#x27;t use because I am a size 12 1/2 mens but gave to my sister who was helping me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hardly noticeable though and the wig is perfect in every other way! :D</li>
            <li> Due to health problems and medications I take, my hair has been thinning incredibly.</li>
            <li> This was exactly &amp;#34;worth the price&amp;#34; as its very cheap.</li>
            <li> The hair falls out super easy.</li>
            <li> Looks very realy and is very easy to manage.</li>
            <li> I wear the wig kind of high up on my forehead</li>
            <li> This was perfect for my Playboy costume, and I&#x27;ve even worn to it a couple of other things!!!</li>
            <li> only gripe I have about it is that it does tangle easy, but just comb it through with your fingers and you are good to go.</li>
            <li> All I know is that I payed for my wig and it got here very quickly and packaged really well :-).</li>
            <li> The hair on the wig doesn&#x27;t come off easily like many wig does , it is actually very stable.</li>
            <li> I was originally looking to buy extensions when I had seen some wigs as well.</li>
            <li> i was really excited when i got this wig.</li>
            <li> But ,it was SO worth it!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still fun!</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S ORIGINAL SHAPE INSTEAD OF</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I made all my first timer mistakes on a \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; wig.</li>
            <li> wig is a great substitute for my long hair  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It fit comfortably and is good for every day use, actually!</li>
            <li> In pictures it look pretty convincing.</li>
            <li> first I wasn&#x27;t sure...</li>
            <li> Which I don&#x27;t usually go for, but perfect for the wedding!</li>
            <li> Came in good packaging and includes its own hair net, which is greatly appreciated.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is itchy (yet again, it is the first time I have ever worn a wig) and yes it tangles up easily (but its really easy to brush out the knots)</li>
            <li> There are ways to reduce shine on a hair piece (dry shampoo - you&#x27;re welcome), but it was still lighter than what was shown.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color, many long layers and very soft.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t reccomend during the day or special occastions</li>
            <li> and i wore it right out of the package!</li>
            <li> super fun!</li>
            <li> The color is also a little off as it is more of an auburn color, but honestly the color looks better in person than in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but for the most part very beautiful, soft wig and of course as all wigs it was a little on the shiny side</li>
            <li> The package also came with a complimentary wig cap and some cute girl socks (which my man feet can&#x27;t fit into haha).</li>
            <li> Overall, I am pretty happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Had my guy friend wear it and he walked around school in full makeup and a girly outfit and no one recognized him and thought he was a hottie XD</li>
            <li> I bought this for a playboy bunny halloween costume (full disclosure, I am a man).</li>
            <li> Has really cute flowing curls and looks like real hair.</li>
            <li> i love it so much.</li>
            <li> The only thing about this wig that I wasn&#x27;t expecting was that the length of the bangs was a good bit linger than the picture depicted.</li>
            <li> the company cool 2 day was a pleasure to order from.</li>
            <li> the wig is cool</li>
            <li> I have never been more complimented on a wig in my whole life.</li>
            <li> /&gt;that was the only good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I was expecting a whole lot more from the 5 star reviews on here..</li>
            <li> I think the color looks true to the picture, idk what everyone else was talking about.</li>
            <li> The wig, even though it is a beautiful color, is kind of thin.</li>
            <li> Besides the color issue, its not bad.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was very soft, but it tangled very easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so thankful that it turned out to be the right color, size and fit for me</li>
            <li> This is a cheaply made wig and it takes some time to make it look right on your head.</li>
            <li> The color is awesome, its a little shorter than pictured which I actually prefer, and its just so realistic,so amazing value for this price, Definitely worth</li>
            <li> I figured out looking at some other wigs today and looking inside lol.</li>
            <li> Fit quite nice, some styling required, but overall not a bad hairpeace for the money.</li>
            <li> Honestly I was a bit let down, but it&#x27;s still a nice wig worth the 7 dollars I paid for it.</li>
            <li> The customer-contributed photos are the most accurate to its appearance as far as color and ways that it can be styled.</li>
            <li> and I got several compliments on my hair from my family and they all asked me what I did to my hair to make it look so healthy and shiny :-).</li>
            <li> is a fun and flirty wig and if you only have a couple dollars to spend, then this is a good option.</li>
            <li> But it QUICKLY looses that smell and is replace with your smell(your perfume/soap/lotion and whatever).</li>
            <li> /&gt;It arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> the light brown really was LIGHT</li>
            <li> Serves its purpose to hide hair for a quick performance.</li>
            <li> It is going to go great with The Halloween Custom, the wig looks very natural and we got it at a fantastic low price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M 100% SATISFIED, AND HIGHLY RECCOMEND</li>
            <li> but you have to do that with most wigs, even high priced ones.</li>
            <li> I like the darker colored one better because it matched better with my eyebrows and had a little more curl to it.</li>
            <li> u see of the model is pretty darn accurate, depending on the lighting.</li>
            <li> The color is very pretty....</li>
            <li> was pretty excited to find it on my door step within a couple days with Prime shipping, but I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect after reading so many reviews stating that the wig was a different color than the one pictured.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s honestly a very pretty wig</li>
            <li> But it is very pretty.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very pretty that I didn&#x27;t want to cut it up to match the character.</li>
            <li> and it was my very first wig ever.</li>
            <li> The color of the wig is a bit darker than depicted on the picture but it still looks very natural and it&#x27;s very smooth.</li>
            <li> It seemed to be a good quality and lasted a long time.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I received many compliments on how healthy \\&quot;my hair\\&quot; was, and frequently asked what products I was using to get such a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> The hair quality is good though, it is very long in length.</li>
            <li> The shine isn&#x27;t too much, and it doesn&#x27;t frizz, and you can easily unknot it with your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It tangles easily, but my real hair extensions do that too</li>
            <li> The bangs look fantastic and the color is very realistic.</li>
            <li> The wig fit perfectly, There are little hook like things that allow you to adjust the size of the inner band.</li>
            <li> They are very well made, fit my head well, and have places to sew clips</li>
            <li> It barely fit on my head without some struggling and you have to be gentle so as not to tangle it.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t even worth returning.</li>
            <li> But, fun.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun and flirty.</li>
            <li> It will more than likely fit you regardless of head size, though.</li>
            <li> This wig looks really nice considering the low price.</li>
            <li> I love the longer bangs and the soft layers</li>
            <li> My husband bought this wig for me thinking it would be worth a try and</li>
            <li> It was definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> and he said it looked like real hair so that made me even more confident to go out in public with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this wig for both fun purposes and for Halloween.</li>
            <li> Great quality product for a crazy good price.</li>
            <li> Defiantly worth buying.</li>
            <li> The color is more like a light blonde also.</li>
            <li> Took awhile to get here since it&#x27;s coming from overseas, but definately worth it.</li>
            <li> The color of the wig in real life is very different than in the pictures- in a good way.  </li>
            <li> I love the feel of it, it&#x27;s so soft, but it is a bit shiny in pictures</li>
            <li> Worth it.</li>
            <li> hue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this is a fun wig.</li>
            <li> This wig was more auburn red than light brown.</li>
            <li> I purchased it as part of a Halloween costume, but is nice enough to wear every day.</li>
            <li> Product was correct color as pictured it is a golden brown</li>
            <li> This is a lovely wig and looks natural.</li>
            <li> Ordered this item for fun.</li>
            <li> The wig is for fun</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s much more natural.</li>
            <li> last thing: the wig was packaged quite nicely.</li>
            <li> I have a smaller head than most adults, and as a petite person, it would be nice to have been told that the wig would only fit the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; head, not a petite adult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are much better products available for the same price</li>
            <li> It is  worth $2.99 maybe.  </li>
            <li> For what I payed it was worth it</li>
            <li> For the price its worth a shot.</li>
            <li> The wig was nice, but mine came a bit red.</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;d say that gives it away is the nonexistant part, so I wear it with a slouchy knit beanie and it looks nice.</li>
            <li> I took it out of the wrapper, and was SO happy, to see it was so long, and silky soft!</li>
            <li> It got super tangled as I tried wearing it the first time.</li>
            <li> Under certain lights, the shine is more apparent, but I took some photos in diffuse light</li>
            <li> but if you do I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be fine for a long time.</li>
            <li> A wig is supposed to lie nice and flat on your head, not all scrunched up.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this wig and am so far pretty happy with it.  </li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t want another dark brown wig, and I already have hair this length, and my own haircut is better.</li>
            <li> I had to cut on the front to make it look right.</li>
            <li> and I have it on right now</li>
            <li> so i got to try it on right away .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it for a cosplay right now</li>
            <li> Its a really great wig, extremely soft &amp; its about 19\\&quot; long.</li>
            <li> You do not have bald spots, it can be easily combed and looks very natural</li>
            <li> IT EVEN CAME WITH A FREE GIFT OF CUTE PINK ANKE SOCKS, WHICH IS PRETTY COOL.</li>
            <li> Hair piece is very large.</li>
            <li> I had to cut the bangs down to the right length for it to look good on me.  </li>
            <li> It has beautiful hi lights and low lights, light copper brown with medium brown low lights, it looks very natural.</li>
            <li> Its not bad really.</li>
            <li> but theyre too long, despite being shorter than my own (which r side bangs so</li>
            <li> Some other people said that the bangs are too long but mine were cut perfectly.</li>
            <li> Nice and long, just like photo&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is the same color as my natural hair (light chestnut brown), it&#x27;s got a great wave, and after a quick soak in some cool water and a little bit of hairspray, it looks almost as good as the real thing (human hair).</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this because of the high reviews.</li>
            <li> I would consider the color light red rather than light brown</li>
            <li> It arrived super fast.</li>
            <li> Nice for costume or kids play but can&#x27;t really use for yourself out in public.</li>
            <li> I am very very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> It is not a high quality wig, but it looks like a nice wig.</li>
            <li> The synthetic hair looks very real, even up close.</li>
            <li> Looks very real for synthetic hair.</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than expected, is good quality for an inexpensive price!</li>
            <li> my kids age are wearing wigs and really, this one compares good with all the other wigs the girls wear.</li>
            <li> The bangs seem a bit long, and it tangles very easily.</li>
            <li> Im so excited to get all dolled up today with my new hair.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much ;))</li>
            <li> Its hard to manage but looks great as a costume accessory.</li>
            <li> Very pretty color and feels super soft.</li>
            <li> The ONLY issue I had is the wig cap is HUGE!</li>
            <li> Also when I bought it there were more pictures showing the wig from side and back, I don&#x27;t know why they removed them.</li>
            <li> This is the first wig I&#x27;ve ever purchased for myself.</li>
            <li> or I looked funny in</li>
            <li> I would say that it&#x27;s more of a deep honey-toned chestnut brown.</li>
            <li> The hair looks almost real!  </li>
            <li> The color is two, three shades darker than on the picture making it more dark honey blond than light</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a lot of cheap costume wigs, some nice cosplay wigs, and worn even more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> When it came it really pretty</li>
            <li> If you are on the market for a wig or you just want an inexpensive wig to try out, definitely get this one, you won&#x27;t regret it :-).</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was my first wig ever</li>
            <li> At first I though it was my hair; then I realized it was the wig.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought they looked rather shorter than the product images, but after putting it on, it relaxes to a length of about mid-back.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty.</li>
            <li> This wig is the first one I have ever purchased.  </li>
            <li> It was exactly as mentioned and shown in the description.</li>
            <li> first wig I ever bought, and I&#x27;ve had PLENTY.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty, but not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still just as pretty as when I bought it.</li>
            <li> looks real!</li>
            <li> One drawback is that the color is a bit different from the picture, but I like this color better.</li>
            <li> This wig is really pretty and does the job.  </li>
            <li> The color is pretty close to the one in the picture.</li>
            <li> (this was my first wig.)</li>
            <li> It is well worth the money an looks exactly like real hair.</li>
            <li> First things first...</li>
            <li> I really want that wig!</li>
            <li> The wave in it is pretty but  not as wavy as the picture.</li>
            <li> It comes with a wig cap which works pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> VERY flattering!</li>
            <li> This is my first wig</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not expensive</li>
            <li> which is funny</li>
            <li> The wig still has a definite wave going on but its now longer and much more</li>
            <li> This wig feels very close to real hair and is able to be brushed and styled as such (I&#x27;ve read that a warm curling iron can be used too</li>
            <li> If you are considering to buy this wig, and dont know if you should or not, you totally should, you wont regret it! :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really soft and light.</li>
            <li> It looks exactly as it does in the picture.</li>
            <li> This wig is pretty.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it any time!!</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> is the first wig I bought in awhile.</li>
            <li> But I would recommend this wig to all my friends and family ;)</li>
            <li> It is the first one I have ever owned and</li>
            <li> The first time I wore it, I received so many complements saying I looked like a completely different person!</li>
            <li> , I absolutely recommend it to anyone out there!</li>
            <li> But that is ok because I will not wear this wig on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> The color was more of reddish and it was to big</li>
            <li> Not the color stated and would be ok for Halloween but not for going out or anything public.</li>
            <li> and the color was pretty.</li>
            <li> It is pretty shiny.  </li>
            <li> will definitely buy more from this company.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too hot for summer</li>
            <li> I ordered this on June 2nd and it just got here today :-)</li>
            <li> I love the wig , the only problem is</li>
            <li> First of all, I never wrote any review before.</li>
            <li> And this is my first time that I feel like I should share my experience about this wig.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So my hair is naturally a light brown, but I haven&#x27;t seen my natural color in ages.</li>
            <li> Wore it for Halloween and nobody recognized me, even the guys ask if it was real!</li>
            <li> I have worn it several times and love the way it looks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth the price though, just be gentle with it.</li>
            <li> I wear it everyday and it is still in good condition.</li>
            <li> not the synthetic, usually enredarce a little, but it&#x27;s amazing how long and beautiful it is to love....</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t really like it right now.</li>
            <li> This product was very cheaply made and not even worth the money I spent on it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how long it will last yet, but I love it. :-)</li>
            <li> But for an occasional dress up or party I would have to say have fun with it!!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know much about wigs, but this one is stunning compared to the costume wig I bought my daughter for Halloween last year</li>
            <li> I own several wigs and this one is one of my favorites as far as styles and color.</li>
            <li> This wig looks very real and is super soft.</li>
            <li> It came right on time, and is way better than what I expected of it.</li>
            <li> Might need to trim them but the back is very full.</li>
            <li> Came fast &amp; was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> first time getting a wig, feel like real hair.</li>
            <li> The waves are very bouncy and pretty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first wig I&#x27;ve ever purchased and it looks totally real.</li>
            <li> This wig is pretty, but to me it doesn&#x27;t look real when you wear it.  </li>
            <li> This wig is pretty much as shown.</li>
            <li> I flat ironed it since I know straight hair looks better on me</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s long so that u can cut it the way u want it to look :)</li>
            <li> It came in the right color and it&#x27;s very soft!</li>
            <li> I usually just wear a cute hat to cover it and it looks fine.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would complain about is that I wish the quality of the hair wasn&#x27;t as &amp;#34;shiny&amp;#34; making it appear more wig-like rather than realistic.</li>
            <li> I love long wigs!</li>
            <li> Overall, it is nice and super long!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t do many hair styles in the front of the hair and the bangs are very long.</li>
            <li> Hangs well, very long, and not terribly shiny.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gag gift to a coworker and for the price it has a very realistic look.</li>
            <li> It is definitely BROWN and just a pretty light shiny brown.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very very pleased especially considering I only paid 6.49</li>
            <li> was quite satisfied with it, except it was not as long as the picture, doesn&#x27;t have as much volume as the picture</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a weird shine to it many wigs can have, but looks like very healthy, brown hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the hair, texture, looks real but didn&#x27;t like the bang, too long, maybe a hairstylist can help</li>
            <li> and it certainly helped with the tangling.</li>
            <li> While the wig itself is very beautiful, the quality (at least in my personal opinion) is very very very cheap and not worth the $15.99 that I paid.  </li>
            <li> I am going to order same wig from different seller because when I first got it I really liked it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely easy to brush and as far as I think, looks perfectly natural.</li>
            <li> However, it is still very manageable and can be brushed or trimmed easily to style.</li>
            <li> It does not have as much hair as the picture suggests, but it is very pretty and natural looking.</li>
            <li> I saw that the reviews were pretty decent and for $20</li>
            <li> It is really pretty and realistic indoors tho</li>
            <li> It is straight except for one large and obnoxious curl up at the bottom.</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve given 3 stars, but then it came along with a free necklace and free wig cap, so i guess it makes it up a little bit?</li>
            <li> The top of the wig seems a little unnatural but with a cute hat, it blends it in to look natural and it FEELS natural.</li>
            <li> It was comfortable and people that didn&#x27;t know I had short hair thought it was my real hair.</li>
            <li> coz u know, it was a huge change from my really short hair</li>
            <li> I received the product 3 weeks after purchasing which is fast for coming from Hong Kong.</li>
            <li> Very wavy.</li>
            <li> This seller has not replied to any of the emails I have sent except the very fist one.</li>
            <li> The bangs are much longer than pictured, though, so you will have to cut them yourself, or just push them to the side.</li>
            <li> I wanted something that was reasonably priced, just in case</li>
            <li> I give this product 5* just because I can&#x27;t really be bothered to contact them about the quality.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t bother me quite that much.</li>
            <li> I really like this wig.</li>
            <li> I got my wig really fast, weeks before the estimated date, and put it on the day after it came.</li>
            <li> My fiancé asked if I had gone and gotten my hair cut into bangs, he thought it looked so real.</li>
            <li> I am VERY satistified with this wig.</li>
            <li> Trying to gently comb it with both my hands and wig comb has a lot of hairs coming out.</li>
            <li> The adjustable straps on the inside are very durable.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know how to described the smell.</li>
            <li> I bought this wig very nervous because I had never bought a wig before let alone one without looking at it in person.</li>
            <li> After that they thought it was a real hair wig and not synthetic</li>
            <li> My mom wants one now just to play around and change up her hair :</li>
            <li> everyone thinks its my real hair .</li>
            <li> It looks real,</li>
            <li> There is so much hair coming out of the wig that&#x27;s</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s so much hair coming out of the wig just from trying it on once</li>
            <li> My mother saw that it was a wig as soon as I showed it to her, and I lied saying that I had my hair done, but she knew it wasn&#x27;t real</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll try it out in the real world now.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this wig I was really apprehensive.</li>
            <li> So much gaudier in real life.</li>
            <li> so a real bargain.</li>
            <li> But, it really doesn&#x27;t matter..</li>
            <li> the delivery faster than I expected..this people really care for customers..</li>
            <li> I really do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a much darker brown and quite a bit shorter.</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> thanks for absolutely nothing LOLI.</li>
            <li> I will start by saying this: the hair on this wig both looks and feels real.</li>
            <li> The bangs are also much longer than the ones in the picture, so you&#x27;ll have to cut them to get them out of your eyes.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t expect it this fast.</li>
            <li> Really curly.</li>
            <li> I really want to buy like 10 and wear them forever...</li>
            <li> Those who didn&#x27;t thought it was real hair.</li>
            <li> There isnt a ton of waves in it, fairly straight hair.</li>
            <li> and I swear it looks real in person and in the photographs.</li>
            <li> it feels real too.</li>
            <li> Very silky and shiny.</li>
            <li> People who did not know me thought this was my real hair.  </li>
            <li> I sewed in wig clips to keep it on, as it didn&#x27;t feel secure with only the rubber.  </li>
            <li> It gives me so much confidence.</li>
            <li> It looked real and</li>
            <li> You would never guess it was such a cheap wig.  </li>
            <li> Ok so I bought this wig for drag (I&#x27;m a guy)</li>
            <li> The wig looks absolutely real.</li>
            <li> This wig looks much better than I expected for the price.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought this wig for a Halloween costume and liked it so much I&#x27;m thinking about buying a second for personal use!</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect.</li>
            <li> To much messing anymore.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> When I have worn this wig I&#x27;ve been asked if it was my real hair.</li>
            <li> but it is better than I expected.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s cheap only in price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And now I can play with styling the wig much easier.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and/or are very &amp;#34;costumey&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The wig is VERY shiny..</li>
            <li> I would recommend washing the wig, because it IS really shiny.</li>
            <li> but when I put it on the wig was very itchy and kept knotting up.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> Having said that, I don&#x27;t have much experience with caring for wigs.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how real this wig looks.  </li>
            <li> This wig could pass for her real hair.</li>
            <li> There is no doubt that it looks incredibly real.</li>
            <li> It looks like real hair.</li>
            <li> It shipped really fast</li>
            <li> really.</li>
            <li> This product i bought it after reading all the reviews..it doesn&#x27;t look real at all..</li>
            <li> However, I went ahead and did so since it was such a cheap price.</li>
            <li> I really wanted the one pictured here.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, and still worth the money.</li>
            <li> Looks real when worn.</li>
            <li> I tried to gently brush is and the hair started coming out immediatly.</li>
            <li> It came much faster than anticipated!&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I really don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> I bought this for some one who is going bald, you can not even tell it is not their real hair.</li>
            <li> It looks and moves like real hair.</li>
            <li> the color light brown is the same as show in the picture.</li>
            <li> Very pretty.&lt;br /&gt;makes</li>
            <li> A couple of people even thought it was my real hair.</li>
            <li> So overall I give this only a 2 stars for the nice color and softness.  </li>
            <li> I thought the color was more brown than red and had lots of natural looking tones to it.</li>
            <li> depending on the lighting, the hair color looks different, which I think is pretty cool, if u ask me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The color and the slight curls match the pictures, but it tangles very easily.</li>
            <li> I have been buying wigs left and right in order to wear out on the weekends for fun, you know, wigging out.</li>
            <li> The side-swept bangs are the right length, hair looks natural.</li>
            <li> Tangles easily, but, the long wigs always do.  </li>
            <li> use an old very large afro hair pick to style it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will most likely trim the wig along the sides for a more natural length and find some way to tone down the shine.</li>
            <li> The wig does look fake but good for a night out or for halloween!  </li>
            <li> I got this wig for a halloween costume and it was SO much better than I expected!</li>
            <li> Also, the length is shorter than what I see in the image, and I imagine it&#x27;s due to the curls being more defined.  </li>
            <li> and I would have been willing to put a little more towards it.</li>
            <li> I spent $10 max on this, and it is better than any wig that I could get around here (where I live.)</li>
            <li> Very natural, and much better quality than I expected for the money.</li>
            <li> i currently have this one and my pink and white one together and they look great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and silky and very well cut!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, does not smell funny or anything.</li>
            <li> It is more like dark strawberry blond.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It looked soft and pretty when I took it out of the package</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, it came after 8 days.(I live in Norway)&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> you pay more at the halloween shops for a lot less wig.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful, since it tangles easily.</li>
            <li> Also, it gets tangled easy which is to be expected because its so long.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> : This is THE MAIN CON I HAVE-the netting.</li>
            <li> But it was soft, really shiny and didn&#x27;t shed to much.</li>
            <li> Surely the wig has a tiny red hue</li>
            <li> so i bought this wig because the reviews were decent and i wanted to wear it on a weekend trip to the city.</li>
            <li> It came early and it really was a high quality wig for the price!</li>
            <li> It was a big hit at work and around family that is more used to my blue hair.</li>
            <li> it was very soft and silky!</li>
            <li> Wig looks pretty real but very shiny especially in pictures with a flash.</li>
            <li> it sheds a lot and doesnt last long at all, but then they are like 15 dollars so you can buy several for the price of one good quality synthetic.</li>
            <li> I have a tiny head though and the cap seems to be the right size for my head without much</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> is one I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a wig.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> definitely, HIGHLY recommend this wig.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a high quality product..</li>
            <li> This wig tangles very easily just from very little wear.</li>
            <li> I cant make this wig look remotely natural due to not being able to put it on all the way.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more orange though.</li>
            <li> I do own those plastic ones but they are SO hard to maintain.</li>
            <li> The natural color and cut makes it look like it&#x27;s my real hair -</li>
            <li> It looks completely and utterly real.</li>
            <li> It comes with a wig cap and a few interesting trinkets (cell phone chain).</li>
            <li> First, I do admit that people might get crappier ones if they are unlucky, since there are so many negative reviews.</li>
            <li> only thing that does give the wig away is the shine many synthetic wigs have, a shine you don&#x27;t see in natural human hair.</li>
            <li> can be used to normal or formal.</li>
            <li> Its okay too, but not light brown like i ordered.</li>
            <li> Overall, its worth the money, yes.</li>
            <li> It is VERY wavy and a little curly, easily gets frizzy however.</li>
            <li> and I was super surprised when it came it that it was of such high quality.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does shed a bit just being handled, but I learned that that&#x27;s normal for a new wig.</li>
            <li> The company had sent me an email right after the product shipped telling me personally who I could contact if I have any problems.</li>
            <li> and it came right above my hip.</li>
            <li> Also, the color is NOT monotone and dull, you can see light brown and dark brown individual hairs, sort of with a reddish tint (just like my own hair color)!  </li>
            <li> This is a super long wig with an almost &#x27;ombre effect from L. Brown to a auburn-ish tip.</li>
            <li> Light and fluffy with decent length and great bangs that hang down over half my face.</li>
            <li> I think I actually need a much darker color for it to look natural on me, but I think this is the only color available for this wig on Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It also tangles very easily and is pretty thin on the bottom.</li>
            <li> Used a regular round brush to sweep the bang to one side because they were a bit long for my face and it looked great.</li>
            <li> make it look a little more natural.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this wig especially if it&#x27;s going to be your first wig.</li>
            <li> When I got my new haircut</li>
            <li> I called to order a new one, they said they sent it</li>
            <li> , i dont think they ever sent a new one of my choice.</li>
            <li> I wore it out ,shopping with my husband,and,i really felt pretty ,having long hair, again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent over 50.00 for wigs that aren&#x27;t as nearly comfortable or look as natural as this one.</li>
            <li> When looking at it closely you&#x27;ll notice that there&#x27;s not enough hair sewn in to make it look truly real, but for the price point how can you really</li>
            <li> The color is a tiny bit more auburn than expected</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a wig that is long, straight kinda curly, and  has pretty bangs that are pre-trimmed for you, this is the wig for you.</li>
            <li> The first one held up for a long time and was very well made...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and quite realistic looking beyond maybe being too shiny if you want to nitpick.</li>
            <li> Anyway when I touched the wig, it was very soft.</li>
            <li> looks very natural.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m wearing it now very natural looking.</li>
            <li> Looks very natural, I am thinking of wearing it every day.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised, because you CAN straighten and curl this wig.</li>
            <li> and it looks so very natural</li>
            <li> Its very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> The first thing that I noticed was that the color was different from the pictures.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 of these lovely wigs, in case I wanted to cut one in a shorter style  and make additional wefts for the other for extra thickness.  </li>
            <li> item,,,she could not believed I paid under ten dollars for a high quality wig!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for a pirate costume (female) and wore it under a bandana (the bangs fell funny along my face) and a pirate hat.</li>
            <li> They were only willing to replace the item.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even explain how surprised I was at the quality of this wig!</li>
            <li> but I had several people said it looked real!</li>
            <li> Wow again!</li>
            <li> I will say you probably have to cut the bangs a little tiny bit more depending on your forehead, to frame the face a little more.  </li>
            <li> I am actually surprised with how well the quality of this turned out to be!</li>
            <li> Not lovely, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> I got it on an impulse as an accessory and thought it would be fun to wear my hair this long every once in a while, but I haven&#x27;t even worn it out of the bathroom yet.  </li>
            <li> (I was only gently finger-combing!</li>
            <li> so I was skeptical, but when I got it, the texture was very close to real hair, and the cut was nice.</li>
            <li> The bangs were a little longer than I expected, but overall I&#x27;m very pleased with the product, and the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> At least then it would look more realistic.</li>
            <li> Does not look like typical cheap wigs</li>
            <li> It has only shed slightly , so far, but this is my first day.  </li>
            <li> I loved this wig and its long and thick</li>
            <li> but I like more the one in person, not very bright, so betrays</li>
            <li> It has a little bit of a shine to it but that is fine.</li>
            <li> Speaking of which, please buy your own: the one provided is a weak mesh one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good quick fix for a bad hair day.  </li>
            <li> Wish it was less red and more brown tho.</li>
            <li> I read online that some either wet, wash or baby powder their wigs to make them look less shiny and more like real hair.  </li>
            <li> I actually chopped it a little bit and looked better now.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;ll tangle fairly quick and use a wide toothed brush!</li>
            <li> Without a wig cap I can make it work, but the wig pulls back and it&#x27;s hard to manage my own hair underneath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing I can really say about it is that it lingers all over your natural hair.</li>
            <li> natural looking, not too shiny.</li>
            <li> it like an hour ago and do far</li>
            <li> Falls naturally, and the cap fits me well-</li>
            <li> I bought this wig about 3 weeks ago (Near the beginning of March).</li>
            <li> I showed my sister and she thought it was professional</li>
            <li> fibers are soft and the wavy texture looks natural.</li>
            <li> I was so pleasantly surprised at the quality and fullness of this wig.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that really bothers me is the scent of the wig.</li>
            <li> I was delivered on time and it&#x27;s incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> and when I took it out of the box I was pleasantly surprised :</li>
            <li> and I was getting so self conscious and didn&#x27;t know what to do.</li>
            <li> but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Also, it didn&#x27;t tangle at all, so far..</li>
            <li> Looks quite natural, the hairline is well blended.</li>
            <li> It has all these highlights and lowlights that bring out the color, which for mine wasn&#x27;t too far off from the product photo.</li>
            <li> Wow, this is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> IT LOOKS QUITE NATURAL AFTER.</li>
            <li> so i would to buy at least three more.  </li>
            <li> So I got this one thinking it was natural</li>
            <li> and everyone thought it was my natural hair.</li>
            <li> And so far, it has worked.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really soft and natural looking wig.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The color and cut are so natural that I suspect almost anyone could wear it without feeling self-conscious.</li>
            <li> I cannot afford real hair wigs (Starting price $700!!).</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was the length, it wasn&#x27;t too long</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> It is soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I bought this wig and thought wow.</li>
            <li> One can&#x27;t complain too much, because the cost is so low.</li>
            <li> The waves are really natural looking as is the color.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I receive this.</li>
            <li> It does tangle fairly fast, but the quality and overall product cancels that out.</li>
            <li> The second, not so much.</li>
            <li> The hair itself is silky soft.</li>
            <li> As far as construction goes, you can&#x27;t see any of the wefts when you wear it.</li>
            <li> It is quite soft and not too shiny.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its soft and</li>
            <li> The fringe is straight across/ish, not blunt but blends back out longer and longer, into the rest of the hair.</li>
            <li> theres enough room for a full head of long hair inside.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about bangs, but not much I can do about that.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it sheds and tangles pretty easily.</li>
            <li> Other synthetic wigs cost 5 times as much and don&#x27;t have the feel of real hair</li>
            <li> A little to shiny to be real, but no one would know at first glance.</li>
            <li> length was OK, but not as long as expected from the picture (the model was obviously a very short person.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that straight out of the box, it&#x27;s a bit shiny, but that&#x27;s easily solved with some baby powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> I am interested in hatural human hair, is this wig made from 100% human hair?</li>
            <li> When rec&#x27;d this wig was amazed at the softness and length, only thing was displeased with is that get&#x27;s snarly when brushed and putting on, being first wig once get use to putting on</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent wig especially for the price.</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty short, now, and dyed blonde..</li>
            <li> The picture made me worry that it might be dark blonde light brown</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it has enough volume and length to be a decent wig.</li>
            <li> not too shiny, and very silky smooth softness to it, not a lot of shedding when i brushed it only a few fibers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely light compared to my other wig, yet has more than enough coverage and looks very thick.</li>
            <li> I like it because his very beautifull long</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty good, but the cap is too small and makes it sore and achey behind my ears after a day&#x27;s wear.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> the wig itself looks very dark strawberry blonde in the light.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not real hair, it very shiny but soft nonetheless, I suppose human-made means that it wasn&#x27;t done by a machine.</li>
            <li> Coo2day is they deliver fast and send you a wig cover (for you to put on before the wig) and socks (random, I know but who doesn&#x27;t love</li>
            <li> The only way I can wear it so that it looks real is if I hide the \\&quot;scalp\\&quot;, because of the way it parts and how it makes my head look bigger than it is.</li>
            <li> I am nearly 60 and have very very long mostly grey golden brown mixed hair</li>
            <li> I had gone through and read all the reviews and while the good reviews spoke highly of this wig, the bad ones made me hesitant.</li>
            <li> The wig looked very real, I had at least a dozen people ask if it was my real hair.</li>
            <li> a cosplayers (and all my cosplayers friends agree) - buy 100% Japanese Kanekalon (high quality one) made fiber ONLY.</li>
            <li> But for a wig at such a low price, it was surprisingly high quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if would fit someone with a larger size head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had multiple people come up to me and compliment my hair, asking what products I use to get it so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> My problem is that it&#x27;s much shorter than I expected, probably because the girl on the picture is so petite.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m only 26 years old)</li>
            <li> I barely touched it.  </li>
            <li> Plus, the sleek, shine to the hair makes me feel like I&#x27;m in a professional shampoo commercial!  </li>
            <li> What I received barely resembles the image.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, it does look real enough and it feels soft.</li>
            <li> I MODEL FOR A LIVING, AND OFTEN USE WIGS AS MY NATURAL HAIR IS VERY SHORT,</li>
            <li> wig net to hold one&#x27;s natural hair.  </li>
            <li> but I actually wanted a wig I could wear out that looks natural.</li>
            <li> I recently dyed my hair and had to have a natural color for the work place.</li>
            <li> , I was just curious and did not expect much -</li>
            <li> but my natural hair is red, so</li>
            <li> /&gt;requires trimming/styling (if you don&#x27;t know how)&lt;br /&gt;smaller than a regular wig&lt;br /&gt;shinier than natural hair</li>
            <li> wore this as an everyday wig adored it even got a few cosplays out of it not shiny realistic and easy to style a bit of shedding though</li>
            <li> I love this wig it is thin but covers all of the netting underneath.</li>
            <li> Bought to help cheer self up a wee bit more as a very rough year, lost my second leg above the knee, and hair is leaving due to all meds am on.....</li>
            <li> am using this daily, it gets tangled a little quick</li>
            <li> long however a few quick snips with the scissors fixed that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super soft or anything which doesn&#x27;t really bug me and isn&#x27;t unnaturally shiny or anything.</li>
            <li> This wig is gorgeous, it tangles easily, but not so horrible</li>
            <li> The make is a bit sloppy but the outcome is ok.</li>
            <li> Super long front bangs, it covers half of my face.</li>
            <li> The wig doesn&#x27;t have as much hair as the picture shows, and the bangs are really long and need extensive trimming because they don&#x27;t sweep to the side at all, they hang straight down.</li>
            <li> cause it was a little over the top for everyday wear and got tangled alot.</li>
            <li> Hair is a little thin, but it&#x27;s a good quality.</li>
            <li> It requires a gentle brushing at least once a day, but is durable and looks real.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been around artificial or real hair wigs at all, but when this came in I was extremely pleased with the quality.</li>
            <li> its a little darker and it looks soooooo real!</li>
            <li> The crown part where the hair changes direction lays a little funny.</li>
            <li> Just have a little bit of patience and be willing to work with it.</li>
            <li> It was pretty cool the first few times but now its just a hard to untangle mess</li>
            <li> It smells like new clothes of a new car, a little like plastic and factory.</li>
            <li> Has great length and color but was disappointed in quality</li>
            <li> it looked that high-quality (because of my general knowledge of wigs prior to buying this one).</li>
            <li> The wig arrived within three weeks, and I was happily surprised to find it&#x27;s not complete junk for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this exact wig off of ebay a few months ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , the only problem Im noticing is it&#x27;s a little itchy at first, but now I don&#x27;t feel it.</li>
            <li> The wig cap runs a little small, but I just pinned it in more, and it stayed in place all night.</li>
            <li> This wig is really soft, wavy, glamorous,and long!</li>
            <li> I wore this for less than an hour and the whole bottom layer was tangled in a rats nest.</li>
            <li> The length doesn&#x27;t feel as long as the picture in fact it&#x27;s only two inches longer than my natural hair.</li>
            <li> The only thing that was a little iffy on my wig was the color (dark brown instead of light brown), but I ended up liking the color I got instead of the one I ordered xp.</li>
            <li> The color is a dark toned dirty blonde color, great for almost any skin tone.</li>
            <li> I got a free pair of hot pink socks with it, kinda random</li>
            <li> The color looks to be blended with darker, lighter, and reddish fibers for a real-looking brown... not flat and one dimensional like a lot of the wigs I see around.</li>
            <li> Not much different than the dark long wig but pretty.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair and this wig was even darker than my own hair, really only reaches the shoulders, and has straight bangs (I really, really hate straight bangs.)</li>
            <li> It is very small and I cant even pull it down all the way, so it rides up on top of my scalp.  </li>
            <li> The bangs also came much longer than in the picture, but I don&#x27;t mind because I like them a little longer anyway</li>
            <li> (i got it really short to get rid of my old bleached hair) and also I havent had my hair this long (chest length now) since kindergarten!!!.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so weird to wear it because I have thin, blonde hair and this is thick and full, but it is simply beautiful for the price.</li>
            <li> wig is just ok color shown is correct but this wig is very thin and looks like some hair in the back was cut?</li>
            <li> Looked like natural hair..will definitely buy again in other colors.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that when I brushed the curls with a flat brush, one of them frizzed</li>
            <li> OVerall, though, the wig is plenty thick and well made, with a plastic circle meant to represent a \\&quot;scalp\\&quot; area; you can even see the hairs punched into this plastic piece, very realistic!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It looked very real,, was thick and came with a hair net to hold the hair and</li>
            <li> The only real downside for me is that the wig cap is somewhat small and it does not have clips in it.</li>
            <li> Beware if you wear a medium-large or large size wig cap, this may not fit!</li>
            <li> As with anything new, there is a period of awkward wearing and getting used to how to wear it, but still it&#x27;s comfortable and people who don&#x27;t know me can&#x27;t tell I&#x27;m wearing a wig.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to get in the male a little over a week later, on the 28th.</li>
            <li> I really like this product if it wasn&#x27;t for the small wig cap i would have given it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The band is also much too small, it&#x27;s like child size.</li>
            <li> I personally prefer dark brown, I&#x27;ve been dark haired my whole life so this was something I couldn&#x27;t overlook.</li>
            <li> The only problem is the bangs are a bit long.</li>
            <li> Long and curly , wash regularly to keep it longer.</li>
            <li> The bangs are a tiny bit long</li>
            <li> only nitpick is that the bangs were too long for my liking at about 4 in.</li>
            <li> I have almost no hair at all so the cap sags in the back and causes a strange shape</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel like it would last so long though,</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this wig is that, It&#x27;s abit WAY too long.</li>
            <li> It is so long, stringy, flat, AND after putting it on, I looked at the back in the mirror..</li>
            <li> All I did was ran my hand down over the hair just to see how it felt and the wig hair came out in near gobbs.  </li>
            <li> And I mean straight out!</li>
            <li> The bangs are VERY long, they have to be cut back.</li>
            <li> I experienced a bought of horrible folliculitis and thought I&#x27;d have to wear a scarf until my scalp completely healed.  </li>
            <li> Although this wig looks and feels cheap to the wearer, it only looks fake upon close inspection.</li>
            <li> THAT MAKES IT LOOK LESS NATURAL</li>
            <li> You could definitely fool people with this wig, it is my most realistic wig out of my stupid collection.</li>
            <li> fun wig - for late nights out!</li>
            <li> I still have a little trouble fitting everything under even with the wig cap, but you don&#x27;t notice it sticking out because the wig is thick enough to hide it.</li>
            <li> I have reallllllyyyyyy thick hair and a somewhat large head.</li>
            <li> they even sent me a little gift with it which was a pretty ring :) trust me you wont be disappointed if you get this wig.</li>
            <li> It is pretty much exactly what the picture looked like, except maybe a tad bit darker, but nothing unpleasant.</li>
            <li> The wig has a weird fit to it.</li>
            <li> But I regret cutting them, because the bangs did look better when they were long.</li>
            <li> Or you can leave long, which is what I did.</li>
            <li> Just too long for me.</li>
            <li> It arrived earlier than the expected time.</li>
            <li> are long, but matched my hair color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the bangs on both sides and, even though they are long (about6-7 inches, they brush out of the way.</li>
            <li> This wig is too way small for a normal size head.</li>
            <li> THE BANGS WERE A BIT LONG, AND</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s minimal shedding, and you can even put it in a low ponytail or braid if you are patient.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t worn it for a long period of time yet</li>
            <li> It came three weeks earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> I had to cut the bangs because they were too long.</li>
            <li> Though the color was correct, and the quality of the actual hair was at par, there was absolutely no body to the piece.</li>
            <li> there are thinner spots where inch long pieces of hair poke out</li>
            <li> bangs are way to long and cap does not sit on head.</li>
            <li> complete waste of 8.00</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ll end up shortening it to a long bob and get rid of some of the unruly hair.</li>
            <li> I did have to cut the bangs as they were to long for me.</li>
            <li> Had to adjust the bang, for it was too long, but with a bit of creativity you can pull it off.</li>
            <li> It is quite a long wig, maybe not as thick as the picture, but it doesn&#x27;t shed much and you&#x27;ll never have to worry about the wig cap showing.</li>
            <li> Not pleased with this wig, but at least it was cheap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little stiff and shiny, but not fake looking.</li>
            <li> I mean really?</li>
            <li> This wig is very long, and the bangs area  bit too long for my taste.</li>
            <li> I have had short hair all my life, and this wig is long enough to reach the small of my lower back.</li>
            <li> I only wore it once because it looks extremely unnatural.</li>
            <li> Very small.... Very shiny too.</li>
            <li> it didnt take as long as i thought with shipping either!</li>
            <li> THE BANGS ARE LONG!</li>
            <li> but they are very long.</li>
            <li> cure the shiny-ness make some dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> So I ordered a red wig a few months back</li>
            <li> Only bad thing about it is it can get a little big tangled but easy fix!  </li>
            <li> As far as the seller being rude like one of the other commenters stated, I am not sure because I didn&#x27;t really have to e-mail them for anything.</li>
            <li> Easily past my waist, soft waves.</li>
            <li> I received the wig after a long wait, which was expected because it is coming from China to USA.  </li>
            <li> Do not brush as hair will come loose.</li>
            <li> It is very long and flowing, It doesn&#x27;t shed as much as my other synthetic wigs, and I can pull a few strands on the sides back into a low ponytail or put them up in barrettes without it looking too \\&quot;wiggy\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The wig (not counting the tax) was less than ten dollars.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Another thing I didn&#x27;t like is that it has a real strong shine in it, which gives it away and makes it look like really dirty hair (at least to me anyway).  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t tangled when I received it, but after 45 minutes of trying to get it over my giant head, the chemical-smelling hair was a mess.</li>
            <li> Also the \\&quot;strange smell\\&quot; that other reviewers mentioned...</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned because everything on the web said to only use products designed for synthetic material wigs.</li>
            <li> The last one is a challenge for me as I have a petite head size and there are not very many options for us pea heads.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I have about this wig is that there are some hairs under the bang that are cut really short (like baby hairs)</li>
            <li> so if you&#x27;re not really planning to wear it</li>
            <li> Save yourself some money, and make a wig out of yarn.</li>
            <li> Just run a wide toothed comb through it...</li>
            <li> Again, use a wide toothed comb to get the tangles out of the hair.</li>
            <li> : SPRINKLE SOME UNSCENTED BABY POWDER ON A WIDE TOOTHE COMB, COMB IT THROUGH THE WIG FROM ROOT TO TIP, THEN SHAKE IT OUT.</li>
            <li> It is a bit thin, but you know what it looks real.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be caught dead wearing such.</li>
            <li> MINUS</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s genetic folks, so there is not much I can do.</li>
            <li> I bought it in a few different colors</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to keep it from being tangled all the time, but I like wearing it for fun.</li>
            <li> Not much like the picture.</li>
            <li> I really like the color, although it is falsely advertised.&lt;br /&gt;-Held</li>
            <li> The texture is not exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> but with a few tiny dark brown highlites.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to grow my hair out, and it&#x27;s at at stand still right now and very frustrating</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t made like other wigs.</li>
            <li> If u have an extra small head, go ahead.</li>
            <li> I hve worn it twice and its sooooo pretty but looks fake out in the sun.</li>
            <li> so she can recommend it to her other clients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> noticed no funny odors.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I had been looking at other places to get a wig, all of which selling for over $200.00.  </li>
            <li> but I knew that ahead of  time from other reviews.</li>
            <li> The other drawback is the ends tend to get frizzy.</li>
            <li> They even included a wig cap in the package and a money back guarantee if you are not pleased with the wig.</li>
            <li> It even came with a wig cap and a small present (socks)!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much due to the price of this wig.</li>
            <li> because it&#x27;s not exactly like the picture shown.</li>
            <li> In fact, it not only has scared me innumerable times when I turn the corner where it is, but my dogs went crazy wondering who the new woman is with the long hair.</li>
            <li> I would guess this is about a size 18&amp;#34;-19&amp;#34;, way too small for the average American head of 21-22&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> This wig is not very full but you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> It is very long, perhaps too long, and hard to manage.</li>
            <li> Its very soft and hardly tangles but the cap on the wig is small.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super thin, but it&#x27;s also not thick as some cosplay wigs.</li>
            <li> However, I received a dark brown colored wig, which is not much of a change for my naturally black colored hair.</li>
            <li> There is a little shedding but that is expected from a cheaper wig.</li>
            <li> I ended up cutting the bangs on it because I felt like the part in the wig was too high and would make the wig start sliding back.</li>
            <li> I never use it and its basically sitting in a drawer in my house because its so cheap and ugly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a dark reddish gold.  </li>
            <li> I got a dark brown wig with auburn in it.</li>
            <li> Dark Brown inside doors &amp; out side looks like</li>
            <li> /&gt;But its not at all like the photo model color wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tryed on for a whole day, I will this wkend and ill post a photo.</li>
            <li> Kinda wish I got dark brown</li>
            <li> Not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;all</li>
            <li> But the absolute worst thing I can say is that i wanted the light brown color, and what i got was not light brown at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not used to really long hair, makes me feel uncomfortable and also, to make it look natural.</li>
            <li> It has hairs of random lengths (one strand half down my back, another barely to my ears??)</li>
            <li> the bangs were down to my chin</li>
            <li> , I am going to try some of the tricks to soften the shine down some.</li>
            <li> It brought the \\&quot;too good\\&quot; texture down a notch</li>
            <li> I range from a black to a dark brown, usually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I read a few other reviews before deciding this</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the cap is a little tight for me and gives me headaches.</li>
            <li> It has been a month and a half sense</li>
            <li> Both wigs came with a black wig cap and gift pair of socks.  </li>
            <li> All the cornstarch and baby powder in the world couldn&#x27;t make it look any less like what is attached to a Barbie&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> I read previous reviews of this wig and thought for $10 dollars it could not hurt to try.</li>
            <li> if you look at the roots, you can see the stocking and wig caps, which are black.</li>
            <li> From the reviews I read, I expected very little out of this wig.</li>
            <li> so if you mess it up you just order another.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed , bc it wasn&#x27;t the light brown, i was expecting.</li>
            <li> And it is super shinny and thin, looks very fake on, had to cut and pin back bangs as well as stuff tissue paper in my wig cap to make it look fuller.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d buy it again if I wasn&#x27;t so obsessed with buying and trying new things.</li>
            <li> To bad it is very pretty.</li>
            <li> Oh, and it does get a little knotted after a while, but it brushes out with no problem.</li>
            <li> Maybe a little lighter.</li>
            <li> I would say it is a little bit darker than the photo, but that could be a matter of lighting.</li>
            <li> but it should still look a little like the picture.</li>
            <li> The color is a little (little) bit darker as waht is shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that in the front it does have some small short hairs hanging out that makes it look fake</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe they can sell this wig for so little.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a little shiny that is to be expected.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little shiny in the sun, but not dramatically so.  </li>
            <li> that show if I lift the bangs to style them a little.</li>
            <li> and yes it sheds a little now and then,</li>
            <li> I was a little bit worried</li>
            <li> A little cornstarch can fix that.  </li>
            <li> It does shed a little but what synthetic wig doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The cap that came with it is a little funky, I got another one at the costume shop.</li>
            <li> It was as expected but the hair is very very hard to maintain and adjust.&lt;br /&gt;Besides that it fulfilled its purpose as expected</li>
            <li> Another thing, I wouldn&#x27;t want anyone to touch the back of it when the model&#x27;s wearing it, you can feel every little knot made - perhaps it too thin?</li>
            <li> the only bad thing is that cool2day offers no wigs with parts or lace.</li>
            <li> &gt; When I put on the wig, the netting bunches up together on my head, and it makes it look as if the wig has thin hair in the back.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to waste my money on something I&#x27;ll never wear.</li>
            <li> When I opened it I noticed that the color of the wig was not light brown.</li>
            <li> This as well has fooled a few people.</li>
            <li> Sometimes a few strokes pulling fingers through the tangles will restore it.</li>
            <li> I was having trouble because I hadn&#x27;t received it and the person that was suppose to be helping me was of NO assistance.</li>
            <li> The package also included a wig cap and a \\&quot;gift\\&quot; - a pair of lime green socks.</li>
            <li> it just doesnt match my face and the color is not light brown</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way too thin and very OBVIOUSLY a wig.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The wig was not light brown as shown on the model photo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fitted my look and style and it looks so natural, doesn&#x27;t shiny like a fake hair.</li>
            <li> It shed really bad when I first took it out of the package, but that seems to be calming down.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also so thin in the back you can see the netting underneath, so it&#x27;s pretty much impossible to wear unless I have a hat covering it.</li>
            <li> ITS A MESS CAP TO SMALL AND ALREADY TORE AT THE BANG</li>
            <li> What a mess!</li>
            <li> It was a disappointment that something so highly rated turned out to be looking just how it should be for the price:</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I wasn&#x27;t expecting high quality for the price I paid, but this is just ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> There were a few small knots in it that seemed like burnt fibers.  </li>
            <li> Or maybe my head is just too small,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pointless.</li>
            <li> As did a few friends I hung out with that day, including a hairstylist friend I have!</li>
            <li> The cap is a bit small, but I still didn&#x27;t have any problems with it.</li>
            <li> So i usually wear it for nights out on the town.</li>
            <li> I was worried the wig cap would be small</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure I will try this).</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t need wig, but this time I chopped my hair off</li>
            <li> The wig is small though.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> I wear it almost everyday!</li>
            <li> A lot.&lt;br /&gt;-Very small cap.</li>
            <li> all my hair twisted flatly under the cap.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However, I was pleasantly surprised when I was wrong!</li>
            <li> ut was ugly and it fit weird un</li>
            <li> The color is a light orange , it is very thin all over a bad wig.</li>
            <li> but once you put it on you can hardly notice.</li>
            <li> Since it is styled, without looking to much.&lt;br /&gt;Can be hard to style by yourself</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair, so it was hard to put it up and wear it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to explain</li>
            <li> Also hard to style</li>
            <li> And it is hard to believe!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would like it to be a little fuller though since it&#x27;s sort of thin.</li>
            <li> The wig is shiny but feels really soft and because of its length doesn&#x27;t seem to tangle too bad, but this isn&#x27;t the wig I paid for and would not have bought it.</li>
            <li> When I complained and tried to return it for a refund, the seller would not refund my money.</li>
            <li> Literally EVERYONE I saw the night I wore it complimented me on this wig and thought it had cost me AT LEAST $50.</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s a common problem with these synthetic wigs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> wig is thick and luscious.</li>
            <li> It was as described, didn&#x27;t smell weird, didn&#x27;t fall apart or any of the other things the negative feedback said.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> Seriously, you can&#x27;t beat the price and it comes with a wig cap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That is not good at all.</li>
            <li> Not a good wig.</li>
            <li> I almost was sad, and strtd crying.</li>
            <li> Soooo disappointed, wig very thin, does not look natural, way toooo small to wear, and already hair falling out everywhere</li>
            <li> Well layered, it is curly and thick!</li>
            <li> I ended up cutting off about 4 inches and spraying it down with leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> Not very impressed with this wig.  </li>
            <li> This certain netting that they have is terrible.</li>
            <li> but then when I tired to put it on...IT WAS TOO SMALL!!</li>
            <li> The reviewer that said it&#x27;s terrible must have received the wrong wig, because this one is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> and the hair was really thin.</li>
            <li> The wig is a bit thin</li>
            <li> and I just put it on and styled and and he looked at me all confused and said, \\&quot;Did</li>
            <li> I hate being the same color as my hair.</li>
            <li> make it worse.</li>
            <li> The wig is a bit too thin thoughm</li>
            <li> this wig is incredibly thin.  </li>
            <li> it was very thin and not a good investment.</li>
            <li> I purchase alot of synthetic hair and this by far was the WORST.</li>
            <li> It is too small and it sheds so badly that buy the time I had it out of the packaging I was covered in hair.</li>
            <li> I am so sorry I ever bought this wig.</li>
            <li> I just felt I couldn&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> This wig was a life saver and I am so relieved that it looks soreal and doesn&#x27;t look fake at all.</li>
            <li> For $20 and the quality of it, you just can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> My husband was not impressed and said it looked fake, which the shine can give away....</li>
            <li> Does not look fake and curl stays well.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because it was so inexpensive</li>
            <li> It was wrong color and</li>
            <li> so sad.</li>
            <li> I havent worn it out and about during the day for the fact that it does look a bit fake.</li>
            <li> it looked so fake as well.</li>
            <li> At this point, I was so irritated that I ended up just selling the silly thing.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t afford any of the expensive wigs they sell in stores around here</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fake until I tell them.</li>
            <li> Hair replacement- ridiculously expensive.</li>
            <li> Both those elements can give it away as fake.  </li>
            <li> so now it&#x27;s a weird blend between the colour and my skin</li>
            <li> try it you won&#x27;t b sorry</li>
            <li> I look like I&#x27;m from the wrong time period.</li>
            <li> which makes it look a tad noticeably fake.</li>
            <li> You can go wrong.</li>
            <li> it is very thin.</li>
            <li> very thin and tangled .</li>
            <li> Very thin.  </li>
            <li> Although it is shiny, it isn&#x27;t so shiny that it looks bad or really fake.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just a random bad one, but regardless, I will not be buying this item again.</li>
            <li> Rogaine for Women- expensive, ugly side effects and not guaranteed.</li>
            <li> For the price...and speed of delivery....you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was afraid that the wig was going to look fake and too \\&quot;wiggy\\&quot;, but boy was I wrong!!</li>
            <li> they are very difficult.</li>
            <li> but it knotts up really bad.</li>
            <li> The wig its self wasn&#x27;t all that bad</li>
            <li> I am writing review 2 nd time for this product and it seems the seller deletes bad</li>
            <li> looked bad</li>
            <li> I dont know if i just got a bad one or</li>
            <li> I bought this wig on a whim, figuring that, for the money, how bad could it be?  </li>
            <li> He was so shocked</li>
            <li> and she was so shocked by it&#x27;s quality I had to send her the link on Amazon</li>
            <li> it was matted and uncut and terrible.</li>
            <li> so I was extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> It was about two shades lighter than the picture, which was slightly disappointing, but it got the job done nonetheless!</li>
            <li> So this is why the 4 stars :(</li>
            <li> (I bought 2 wigs before from difference seller and it was disappointed me).</li>
            <li> I HATE my hair...</li>
            <li> I hated wearing it</li>
            <li> it is a very bad wig.</li>
            <li> THIS WIG SHEDS LIKE CRAZY!!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> the worst thing is I cant even return it</li>
            <li> The worst part of this shopping experience was the customer service.</li>
            <li> This wig is terrible.</li>
            <li> Worst case-</li>
            <li> and is simply terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Okay, let me be clear by saying that this wig is indeed beautiful. However, I have standards for wigs, seeing as how my life is revolved around them, and I wear them constantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My standards were not met because of:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1: The wig, even though it is a beautiful color, is kind of thin. But it brushes through beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2: This is THE MAIN CON I HAVE-the netting. It isn&#x27;t made like other wigs. This certain netting that they have is terrible. It&#x27;s just tiny holes, and not lines that keep the hair in place.&lt;br /&gt; When I put on the wig, the netting bunches up together on my head, and it makes it look as if the wig has thin hair in the back. A wig is supposed to lie nice and flat on your head, not all scrunched up. The netting has GOT to be changed. Seriously. Or maybe my head is just too small, I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I am very very dissatisfied. It wasn&#x27;t even worth returning. It&#x27;s pointless. I&#x27;ll just probably end up selling it or giving it away. If the seller could take PICTURES OF THE INSIDE, That would be a lot better. I don&#x27;t want to waste my money on something I&#x27;ll never wear. I am so sorry I ever bought this wig. Kudos to those who love it and can wear it.</li>
            <li> This product was very cheaply made and not even worth the money I spent on it. I never use it and its basically sitting in a drawer in my house because its so cheap and ugly.</li>
            <li> I ordered this wig and another darker brown one. I like the darker colored one better because it matched better with my eyebrows and had a little more curl to it. But this one is really nice as well! natural looking, not too shiny. A coworker said that he never would have known it was a wig.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gag gift to a coworker and for the price it has a very realistic look. Does not look like typical cheap wigs but it does feel like one if that is anyone&#x27;s concern.</li>
            <li> soooo beautiful. Currently my favorite wig ever. It worked perfectly for the cosplay i needed it for and i still wear it!</li>
            <li> I received the product 3 weeks after purchasing which is fast for coming from Hong Kong. The product is as described and there were no problems with the product</li>
            <li> Obvious.  Even after washing and styling.  But, fun.  Smells fishy.  Arrived before ETA and in bubble mailer or plastic type wrap (I&#x27;ve forgotten now).  Great color.  Sheds a lot.  Tangles easily, but, the long wigs always do.  It&#x27;s fun and flirty.</li>
            <li> I am interested in hatural human hair, is this wig made from 100% human hair? and if yes do you have lighter color?</li>
            <li> This wig is one of the best I&#x27;ve bought. Very pretty color and feels super soft. I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> When rec&#x27;d this wig was amazed at the softness and length, only thing was displeased with is that get&#x27;s snarly when brushed and putting on, being first wig once get use to putting on I&#x27;m sure will enjoy it more. Bought to help cheer self up a wee bit more as a very rough year, lost my second leg above the knee, and hair is leaving due to all meds am on.....Hoping that this is just what the nurse (me) ordered!!!! LOL LOL LOL</li>
            <li> Okay, so, I am in love with this wig. It is the best first wig, I gir it like an hour ago and do far, the only problem Im noticing is it&#x27;s a little itchy at first, but now I don&#x27;t feel it. Oh, and it does get a little knotted after a while, but it brushes out with no problem. I HIGHLY recommend this wig especially if it&#x27;s going to be your first wig.</li>
            <li> This wig is beautiful. I actually read through all reviews before purchasing. Some nice.....some not so nice. I am very pleased with this product! It is just like description says.....stunning!!!! The color is very pretty....almost like in the picture. Maybe a little lighter. Very wavy. Yes you have to cut the bangs to get the effect of the model. Or you can leave long, which is what I did. For the price...and speed of delivery....you can&#x27;t go wrong! I love it!</li>
            <li> I recently bought this wig. It is so beautiful but it knotts up really bad. It is to the point where it is unwearable now. The bottom of the wig is like horse hair now. It lasted me like 3 wears and it was worn out. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Looks beautiful and like real hair, however, it does tangle pretty easily. For the most part though, it looks amazing and I even wear it outside the house quite often. Falls naturally, and the cap fits me well- I have reallllllyyyyyy thick hair and a somewhat large head. It will more than likely fit you regardless of head size, though.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t look great on me, but that wasn&#x27;t the fault of the wig.  I would definitely wear it if I were younger.  Just too long for me.</li>
            <li> The first thing that I noticed was that the color was different from the pictures. Also when I bought it there were more pictures showing the wig from side and back, I don&#x27;t know why they removed them. Anyway when I touched the wig, it was very soft. I liked and it looks good while wearing it. Even though it doesn&#x27;t looks that natural, its still fantastic and beautiful.</li>
            <li> The wig does look fake but good for a night out or for halloween!  I don&#x27;t reccomend during the day or special occastions</li>
            <li> I like it because his very beautifull long and I like&lt;br /&gt;I order for me because I like it&lt;br /&gt;his very nice wig&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
            <li> This wig looks very real and is super soft. The only problem is the bangs are a bit long. and could use some styling. and when you put the wig on it doesnt really fit to your head shape well. but besides that its really good!!</li>
            <li> I bought this wig about 3 weeks ago (Near the beginning of March). It wasn&#x27;t suppose to come in for about another week (The beginning of April). It arrived earlier than the expected time. It was shipped within a week and arrived at my house 3 days afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very pretty and flows nicely. I wear it everyday and it is still in good condition. It just needs regular brushing. The waves are nice and it&#x27;s a good shade of brown. It has a little bit of a shine to it but that is fine. It also falls to about mid-back. Which is a nice length for in case someone would like to cut it shorter for one reason or another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is of very nice quality for the price! I would recommend this wig for anyone. :)</li>
            <li> packaging wasa very protective of wig and my wife loves to have a large selection and this was a perfect addition with a nice wave and layercut look. Nice for a night on the town and many complements on hair.</li>
            <li> item as described- it darker in color and bangs are long, but matched my hair color. and the bangs can be cut. not too shiny, and very silky smooth softness to it, not a lot of shedding when i brushed it only a few fibers. ordered last night and came in the mail only 22 hours later.</li>
            <li> Not as described on the picture looks like clown hair March 27,2015</li>
            <li> This wig looks really nice considering the low price. It is not a high quality wig, but it looks like a nice wig.</li>
            <li> This wig is really soft, wavy, glamorous,and long! It is really cute! The only thing that was a little iffy on my wig was the color (dark brown instead of light brown), but I ended up liking the color I got instead of the one I ordered xp. I will be ordering from them again!</li>
            <li> Beautiful color, many long layers and very soft. Can&#x27;t do many hair styles in the front of the hair and the bangs are very long. Might need to trim them but the back is very full. Can do pony tails, braids..</li>
            <li> totally looks different what its shown and it doesn&#x27;t even fit on the manikin and the worst thing is I cant even return it basically I lost my money</li>
            <li> The wig its self wasn&#x27;t all that bad but it wasn&#x27;t good ether it was the customer service that I have a problem with. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying form this seller. This seller has not replied to any of the emails I have sent except the very fist one.It has been a month and a half sense I have heard anything from them. I have sent 5 or 6 emails trying to get information on how to return it because the wig I received is not what is described. It is too small and it sheds so badly that buy the time I had it out of the packaging I was covered in hair. It feels very coarse and is not something you could wear any where but a costume party.</li>
            <li> This wig is great for the price- it is the same color as my natural hair (light chestnut brown), it&#x27;s got a great wave, and after a quick soak in some cool water and a little bit of hairspray, it looks almost as good as the real thing (human hair). G The bangs are much longer than pictured, though, so you will have to cut them yourself, or just push them to the side. Don&#x27;t know how long it will last yet, but I love it. :-)</li>
            <li> The wig arrived within three weeks, and I was happily surprised to find it&#x27;s not complete junk for the price. It requires a gentle brushing at least once a day, but is durable and looks real. I&#x27;ve had multiple people come up to me and compliment my hair, asking what products I use to get it so soft and shiny. The only downside is that when I brushed the curls with a flat brush, one of them frizzed so I keep it in a miniature braid. The product tangles very easily so keep that in mind as well. I&#x27;ve had it for a week now and have worn it every day~ I absolutely love it and will order from this company more often.</li>
            <li> This is the first wig I&#x27;ve ever purchased for myself. I wanted something that was reasonably priced, just in case I hated wearing it or I looked funny in it.&lt;br /&gt;I was pretty excited to find it on my door step within a couple days with Prime shipping, but I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect after reading so many reviews stating that the wig was a different color than the one pictured. I do agree that the wig photographs lighter than it is. I would say that it&#x27;s more of a deep honey-toned chestnut brown. It&#x27;s definitely a gorgeous wig though! It&#x27;s soft and silky and very well cut! I love the longer bangs and the soft layers are SO beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;It does shed a bit just being handled, but I learned that that&#x27;s normal for a new wig. I&#x27;m not quite sure about the hooks for tightening the wig. They don&#x27;t seem like they would stay in place easily. I have a tiny head though and the cap seems to be the right size for my head without much adjustment.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know much about wigs, but this one is stunning compared to the costume wig I bought my daughter for Halloween last year and it was the same price! This wig seems to be very high quality and looks very authentic!&lt;br /&gt;After holding it up to my face, I don&#x27;t believe that it&#x27;s the best color for my particular skin tone. I think I actually need a much darker color for it to look natural on me, but I think this is the only color available for this wig on Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;The wig did come with a couple extras, one of those things being a free wig cap! Cool2day&#x27;s customer service has been great too! They wrote just to make sure I didn&#x27;t have any questions or concerns!&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great wig! I just wish that it came in more color choices so that I could buy one better suited for me!</li>
            <li> wore this as an everyday wig adored it even got a few cosplays out of it not shiny realistic and easy to style a bit of shedding though</li>
            <li> I experienced a bought of horrible folliculitis and thought I&#x27;d have to wear a scarf until my scalp completely healed.  I never thought of wearing a wig because I thought I&#x27;d look for lack of a better word, \\&quot;crazy.\\&quot;  My husband bought this wig for me thinking it would be worth a try and boy will I be forever grateful.  Who knows if everyone is convinced that it&#x27;s my real hair, I feel like it looks great and my husband sure loves it, probably more so than my own hair pre-folliculitis.  I just bought three more so that I&#x27;d have backup.  I read online that some either wet, wash or baby powder their wigs to make them look less shiny and more like real hair.  I just washed mine using non-sulfate shampoo and it came out looking even better than before.  Wen products or something without detergent is probably the safe way to go if you don&#x27;t have wig shampoo.  Good luck whether you&#x27;re looking to buy this wig for an event, just because or for health reasons.  I strongly recommend giving it a try!</li>
            <li> I received the wig after a long wait, which was expected because it is coming from China to USA.  Opened up the package.  The color of the wig is very nice medium brown and shiny.  Immediately wanted to try it on... and cant even fit it on my head!  It is very small and I cant even pull it down all the way, so it rides up on top of my scalp.  I cant make this wig look remotely natural due to not being able to put it on all the way.  I would guess this is about a size 18&amp;#34;-19&amp;#34;, way too small for the average American head of 21-22&amp;#34;.  So I try to rig it to sit on top of my head and wear a headband, doesn&#x27;t look good... and when I just go to arrange the hairs, many hairs fall out/not tied in correctly.  So overall I give this only a 2 stars for the nice color and softness.  Beware if you wear a medium-large or large size wig cap, this may not fit!</li>
            <li> This wig is really nice!  It&#x27;s not made for bigger heads, though.  It comes with a nice wig cap, but I prefer using the wig without it, as it stays on my head better.  The hair looks almost real!  A little to shiny to be real, but no one would know at first glance.</li>
            <li> I liked this wig. I got it for a costume, and it seems okay. The bangs seem a bit long, and it tangles very easily. But it will serve my purpose.</li>
            <li> I give this product 5* just because I can&#x27;t really be bothered to contact them about the quality. Perhaps mine was off. It&#x27;s not real hair, it very shiny but soft nonetheless, I suppose human-made means that it wasn&#x27;t done by a machine. The color is two, three shades darker than on the picture making it more dark honey blond than light but it doesn&#x27;t bother me quite that much. My problem is that it&#x27;s much shorter than I expected, probably because the girl on the picture is so petite. Also when I tried to adjust the size, the hooks just gave way so I use tape now. Another thing, I wouldn&#x27;t want anyone to touch the back of it when the model&#x27;s wearing it, you can feel every little knot made - perhaps it too thin? Overall for twenty bucks I didn&#x27;t expect miracles and I didn&#x27;t get one either but it works for the photoshoot so if you&#x27;re not really planning to wear it it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I got this wig for a halloween costume and it was SO much better than I expected! It looks super realistic, adjusts to fit, and will make my Lara Croft costume absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> I really like this wig. I&#x27;ve purchased a lot of cheap costume wigs, some nice cosplay wigs, and worn even more expensive ones. I took it out of the bag and plopped it on my head: no styling, no comb out, not letting it relax on a head form, nothing. Used a regular round brush to sweep the bang to one side because they were a bit long for my face and it looked great. I showed my sister and she thought it was professional extensions.&lt;br /&gt;The fibers are soft and the wavy texture looks natural. The color looks to be blended with darker, lighter, and reddish fibers for a real-looking brown... not flat and one dimensional like a lot of the wigs I see around. I would say it is a little bit darker than the photo, but that could be a matter of lighting.</li>
            <li> Soooo disappointed, wig very thin, does not look natural, way toooo small to wear, and already hair falling out everywhere once I took it out of the packing. Have it sent back to Amazon immediately.</li>
            <li> I got my wig really fast, weeks before the estimated date, and put it on the day after it came. My fiancé asked if I had gone and gotten my hair cut into bangs, he thought it looked so real. As did a few friends I hung out with that day, including a hairstylist friend I have! So if it fools people sitting next to you and stylists, it&#x27;s a good purchase in my mind! I definitely recommend this wig!</li>
            <li> It all started with just simply going to amazon. I was originally looking to buy extensions when I had seen some wigs as well. I must have looked back and forth for hours deciding which one to choose. I just got mine and I had ordered it friday its Monday. I still paid the 3-5 buisness day fee. I am VERY satistified with this wig. Recently I had to cut my hair really short because of damage from going blonde again. This wig is already helping me feel more confident. When I got my new haircut I didn&#x27;t even want to be around people. I&#x27;m so thankful that it turned out to be the right color, size and fit for me (: I will be using amazon in the future (:</li>
            <li> When it came it really pretty I liked it a lot but then when I tired to put it on...IT WAS TOO SMALL!! and the hair was really thin. But it was soft, really shiny and didn&#x27;t shed to much. But I would wear it more....if it fit.</li>
            <li> The color and the slight curls match the pictures, but it tangles very easily. Trying to gently comb it with both my hands and wig comb has a lot of hairs coming out. It&#x27;s also so thin in the back you can see the netting underneath, so it&#x27;s pretty much impossible to wear unless I have a hat covering it. I might get a use out of it, but we&#x27;ll have to see.</li>
            <li> This wig is awesome, it looks beautiful,  that&#x27;s why I give it five stars  It may also have healing properties but that is as of yet unconfirmed.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome wig. Especially for the price. The color and length are perfect and the waves in the hair are top notch. The adjustable straps on the inside are very durable. The wig is a bit thin but once you put it on you can hardly notice. I ended up cutting the bangs on it because I felt like the part in the wig was too high and would make the wig start sliding back. It&#x27;s always best to wear a wig cap for me, especially with thinner wigs. It looks great with a hat. It was definitely worth the price. I own several wigs and this one is one of my favorites as far as styles and color.</li>
            <li> I am writing review 2 nd time for this product and it seems the seller deletes bad comments.&lt;br /&gt;That is not good at all. it is a very bad wig. do not wast ur $.</li>
            <li> color is inaccurate. was neon orange. looked bad</li>
            <li> you pay more at the halloween shops for a lot less wig.  I was so pleasantly surprised at the quality and fullness of this wig.  Don&#x27;t expect it to look like human hair, it&#x27;s still a synthetic wig.  Although it is shiny, it isn&#x27;t so shiny that it looks bad or really fake.  I will be ordering more just to wear for fun.</li>
            <li> Very nice for the price. I&#x27;ve gotten great use out of this despite the price and the fact that it isn&#x27;t human hair. The cap is a bit small, but I still didn&#x27;t have any problems with it. It&#x27;s honestly a very pretty wig and I&#x27;d buy it again if I wasn&#x27;t so obsessed with buying and trying new things. Tangling and matting can be a problem but if you know how to take care of synthetic wigs you know with an hour of work it&#x27;s totally fixable.</li>
            <li> My wig arrived yesterday. When I opened it I noticed that the color of the wig was not light brown. Mine is more of a chestnut color. I don&#x27;t even care about the color. The only thing that really bothers me is the scent of the wig. I really don&#x27;t know how to described the smell. The only thing I can really say about it is that it lingers all over your natural hair. I am currently airing it out on my clothes line. Hopefully it will be odor free soon. Despite the \\&quot;scent\\&quot; problem I don&#x27;t have any additional problems with this product. I was delivered on time and it&#x27;s incredibly soft. It&#x27;s a decent wig especially for the price. I would definitely recommended it.</li>
            <li> The wig came within the indicated date. It was a nice color and very pretty! It is also very easy to put on. It comes with a wig cap and a few interesting trinkets (cell phone chain). A good buy for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this wig very nervous because I had never bought a wig before let alone one without looking at it in person. I saw that the reviews were pretty decent and for $20 I just felt I couldn&#x27;t go wrong. I received my wig in about 3 business days which was so great and when I took it out of the box I was pleasantly surprised :-).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was afraid that the wig was going to look fake and too \\&quot;wiggy\\&quot;, but boy was I wrong!! It is just amazing and it looks like real hair. I didn&#x27;t tell my husband that I bought one and I just put it on and styled and and he looked at me all confused and said, \\&quot;Did you go to the hair dressers today and get extensions?\\&quot;. I smiled and said \\&quot;No babe, it&#x27;s a wig\\&quot;. He was so shocked and he said it looked like real hair so that made me even more confident to go out in public with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We went out to a restaurant and I got several compliments on my hair from my family and they all asked me what I did to my hair to make it look so healthy and shiny :-). I ended up telling them it was a wig and they didn&#x27;t believe me until I took it off and showed them. After that they thought it was a real hair wig and not synthetic and when I told them it was synthetic and it costed my $20 on Amazon they just couldn&#x27;t believe it. My mom wants one now just to play around and change up her hair :-).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only gripe I have about it is that it does tangle easy, but just comb it through with your fingers and you are good to go. The bangs also came much longer than in the picture, but I don&#x27;t mind because I like them a little longer anyway and you can just cut them. The color is also a little off as it is more of an auburn color, but honestly the color looks better in person than in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am getting emotional because I have Psoriasis on my scalp and was losing all my hair (I&#x27;m only 26 years old) and I was getting so self conscious and didn&#x27;t know what to do. This wig was a life saver and I am so relieved that it looks soreal and doesn&#x27;t look fake at all. For $20 and the quality of it, you just can&#x27;t go wrong. I am actually going to buy another one when I get done writing this review I liked it so much. As far as the seller being rude like one of the other commenters stated, I am not sure because I didn&#x27;t really have to e-mail them for anything. All I know is that I payed for my wig and it got here very quickly and packaged really well :-). If you are on the market for a wig or you just want an inexpensive wig to try out, definitely get this one, you won&#x27;t regret it :-).</li>
            <li> At first i didnt know if i made a good decision then i received it in the mail ,I love it everyone thinks its my real hair .</li>
            <li> Fit quite nice, some styling required, but overall not a bad hairpeace for the money. looks very natural. Would but it again.</li>
            <li> For a while now I&#x27;ve wanted to experiment with wigs, My hair is naturally red so my parents would NEVER let me dye it. I bought this wig for both fun purposes and for Halloween. It is so amazing! It looks real, The shine isn&#x27;t too much, and it doesn&#x27;t frizz, and you can easily unknot it with your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;I wore it to school one day and everybody thought I had dyed my hair and gotten extensions.&lt;br /&gt;The wig shipped and arrived on the same day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first wig ever and I plan on buying again from Taobao.</li>
            <li> Super long front bangs, it covers half of my face. The rest of the hair just stuck together. I only wore it once because it looks extremely unnatural.</li>
            <li> sdfsds dsdfg sdgsg dkiegfki oie reiujik ie jsdkfweioj ji efj ;j eeefjif wepefji&#x27;sjif iefjeifjf fjsoisgoaer8wehjie ifgwierji irgeroghiaehr it tangles to easily but I actually like the color and the style. I look like an 80&#x27;s hair metal band member</li>
            <li> The wig has a weird fit to it. The bangs are VERY long, they have to be cut back. The hair is nice but I would not order this wig again.</li>
            <li> The wig took longer than I thought it would take to get, but did come within the estimated time of delvery.  I wig is of great quality and looks great.</li>
            <li> This is actually my fist time buying a wig from this person. And i am very satisfied with the wig. Its very soft and hardly tangles but the cap on the wig is small. I really like this product if it wasn&#x27;t for the small wig cap i would have given it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I read most of the customer reviews and read all of the product info about this wig and was really excited about buying this, but it turned out to be one of my biggest disappointments.  While the wig itself is very beautiful, the quality (at least in my personal opinion) is very very very cheap and not worth the $15.99 that I paid.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I wasn&#x27;t expecting high quality for the price I paid, but this is just ridiculous.  There is so much hair coming out of the wig that&#x27;s it&#x27;s not going to last a month, and that was just from trying it on one time.  As soon as I got the wig in the mail, I immediately tried it on because I was that excited about it, and it looked good until I started noticing hair falling all over the place.  At first I though it was my hair; then I realized it was the wig.  I barely touched it.  All I did was ran my hand down over the hair just to see how it felt and the wig hair came out in near gobbs.  I know this is a just a $15 wig, but shouldn&#x27;t it hold just a bit better than that?  There&#x27;s so much hair coming out of the wig just from trying it on once that by the looks of it the wig probably wouldn&#x27;t last two weeks since I planned on wearing it daily.  Another thing I didn&#x27;t like is that it has a real strong shine in it, which gives it away and makes it look like really dirty hair (at least to me anyway).  My mother saw that it was a wig as soon as I showed it to her, and I lied saying that I had my hair done, but she knew it wasn&#x27;t real the moment she saw it.  That alone should speak volumes.  In conclusion, the wig is beautiful, but it&#x27;s just too low a quality for me and also way too shiny and wiggy.</li>
            <li> I really like this wig and for the price it is excellent. Just know you will only get six uses out of it.</li>
            <li> Perfect item. Surely the wig has a tiny red hue but I&#x27;d consider it 100% light brown. It&#x27;s extremely easy to brush and as far as I think, looks perfectly natural. We&#x27;ll try it out in the real world now. I&#x27;ve always had really short hair so it&#x27;s probably more of a user error thing with me not knowing what the **** to do with the hair!</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 of these lovely wigs, in case I wanted to cut one in a shorter style  and make additional wefts for the other for extra thickness.  OVerall, though, the wig is plenty thick and well made, with a plastic circle meant to represent a \\&quot;scalp\\&quot; area; you can even see the hairs punched into this plastic piece, very realistic!  I&#x27;ve tried the bangs on both sides and, even though they are long (about6-7 inches, they brush out of the way. I wear the wig kind of high up on my forehead and you still can&#x27;t see my hairline because of the way the bangs fall.  Both wigs came with a black wig cap and gift pair of socks.  My husband was not impressed and said it looked fake, which the shine can give away.... but my hair is pixie and I think the length was a drastic change for him.  Plus, the sleek, shine to the hair makes me feel like I&#x27;m in a professional shampoo commercial!  Under certain lights, the shine is more apparent, but I took some photos in diffuse light and they came out wonderful!  I intend to upload some under customer photos.  I say BUY this product for this seller!  They emailed me 1 day after I placed my order to say if I had ANY problems or needed to contact them, please do.  The wigs arrived quickly (actually 1 day ahead of schedule) and they are identical.  At first I thought they looked rather shorter than the product images, but after putting it on, it relaxes to a length of about mid-back.  It is VERY true to the images provided by the seller.  Also, the color is NOT monotone and dull, you can see light brown and dark brown individual hairs, sort of with a reddish tint (just like my own hair color)!  IF you can&#x27;t tell, I am VERY pleased with this purchase!</li>
            <li> When I ordered this wig I was really apprehensive. I had gone through and read all the reviews and while the good reviews spoke highly of this wig, the bad ones made me hesitant. However, I love this wig, it is so fun! The color is gorgeous and my sister, who is a hairstylist, thought it was a real hair wig, not a synthetic one. The bangs were a lot longer than in the picture, but that works great for my costume! It&#x27;s so weird to wear it because I have thin, blonde hair and this is thick and full, but it is simply beautiful for the price. Would totally recommend this wig to others!</li>
            <li> Not a good wig. I know it is cheap but it should still look a little like the picture. So much gaudier in real life. Would never purchase from this company again.</li>
            <li> i was really excited when i got this wig. instead of being too \\&quot;wiggy\\&quot; or unnatural looking it was very soft and silky! doesn&#x27;t even look synthetic. over-all great buy!!</li>
            <li> Not much different than the dark long wig but pretty. Does not look fake and curl stays well. Had to trim the bangs some but otherwise very nice</li>
            <li> Absolutley love this wig. I was skeptical because it was so inexpensive but I was pleasantly surprised. Looks great, takes awhile to ship because its coming from china but worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Love this wig. When I bought it, it was around 6$ so a real bargain. It&#x27;s pretty. Had my guy friend wear it and he walked around school in full makeup and a girly outfit and no one recognized him and thought he was a hottie XD</li>
            <li> Its not bad really. You get what u pay for in a wig. I had to cut on the front to make it look right. And it doesnt comb well but will work for what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Looks cheep. It. Is now in my granddaughter&#x27;s dress up box I don&#x27;t think I will buy another wig. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> This wig is the first one I have ever purchased.  It is the color advertised and arrived in good condition.  The texture is not exactly what I expected.  But it is very pretty.</li>
            <li> This was the most ill-fitting wig I have ever purchased. What I received barely resembles the image. All the cornstarch and baby powder in the world couldn&#x27;t make it look any less like what is attached to a Barbie&#x27;s head. Even if I could remove some of the shine, it wouldn&#x27;t fit my dog&#x27;s head, let alone mine. Save yourself some money, and make a wig out of yarn. At least then it would look more realistic.</li>
            <li> It was wrong color and ut was ugly and it fit weird un even so nooo am nit satisfied will not buy ever never again</li>
            <li> Great quality product for a crazy good price. I&#x27;ve purchased several wigs from them, and have always been really impressed.</li>
            <li> This makes me look really good and I got a lot of comments saying nice hair amazing. Get it if u whant to look good</li>
            <li> Looked beautiful when it came, but it tangled up very very easily. so sad. plus it is itchy and well...I don&#x27;t know, just good for a costume and that&#x27;s it</li>
            <li> It was as expected but the hair is very very hard to maintain and adjust.&lt;br /&gt;Besides that it fulfilled its purpose as expected</li>
            <li> I bought this for a cosplay I used this wigs about once or twice, it&#x27;s very pretty that I didn&#x27;t want to cut it up to match the character. It tangles easily and now I have it in a bag in the deep reaches on a room in my house because to untangle it would just be a frizzy nightmare.</li>
            <li> The wig looked very real, I had at least a dozen people ask if it was my real hair. The wig cap runs a little small, but I just pinned it in more, and it stayed in place all night.</li>
            <li> What a beautiful wig! I waited 20 days ,for it to come...But ,it was SO worth it! I took it out of the wrapper, and was SO happy, to see it was so long, and silky soft! And, i love the color, a medium brown, with some reddish highlights.. I was a little disappointed , bc it wasn&#x27;t the light brown, i was expecting. But, it really doesn&#x27;t matter.. I wore it out ,shopping with my husband,and,i really felt pretty ,having long hair, again. My hair is pretty short, now, and dyed blonde.. I would recommend anyone I know, to get this wig! It has only shed slightly , so far, but this is my first day.  Also, it didn&#x27;t tangle at all, so far..It feels so comfortable ,on my head..At first, i thought it was too small.. but no, it is perfect.I forgot I was even wearing a wig!! Love love love  it!!</li>
            <li> It was exactly as mentioned and shown in the description. It arrived in almost 21 days. The color is a little (little) bit darker as waht is shown in the picture. The only problem is that in the front it does have some small short hairs hanging out that makes it look fake but you can cut them.</li>
            <li> My aunt asked me if I paid over a hundred dollars for this item,,,she could not believed I paid under ten dollars for a high quality wig!! the delivery faster than I expected..this people really care for customers..we got exactly as described...10 stars!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for a playboy bunny halloween costume (full disclosure, I am a man). It looked great. Very natural, and much better quality than I expected for the money. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Looks very realy and is very easy to manage. The bangs look fantastic and the color is very realistic. Great product.</li>
            <li> The wig is a good replica of natural looking hair.  A lot of girl my kids age are wearing wigs and really, this one compares good with all the other wigs the girls wear. The synthetic hair looks very real, even up close.</li>
            <li> Very fun wig, very worth 10 dollars. It tangles easily, but my real hair extensions do that too and they were 60 dollars. So I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good wig for the cash.</li>
            <li> It was pretty cool the first few times but now its just a hard to untangle mess T^T bangs are the softest thing on earth and i love them but theyre too long, despite being shorter than my own (which r side bangs so its okay lol)&lt;br /&gt;Even still i love it!</li>
            <li> its beautiful, better than as seen in the photos. You do not have bald spots, it can be easily combed and looks very natural</li>
            <li> This wig is not very full but you can&#x27;t beat the price. I doubt I&#x27;ll ever wear it outside the house but it&#x27;s still fun!</li>
            <li> I really love these Cool2day wigs. I really do. They are very well made, fit my head well, and have places to sew clips/combs in if you need them. Also, has adjustable bra-type strap. Hangs well, very long, and not terribly shiny. I&#x27;m a fan of the Cool2day wigs because for the price -- and if you choose wigs that are fulfilled by Amazon and add-ons -- you won&#x27;t be waiting forever. So watch for these wigs! I have three already!</li>
            <li> It seemed to be a good quality and lasted a long time.&lt;br /&gt;The color was attractive and was as described.&lt;br /&gt;The length was OK, but not as long as expected from the picture (the model was obviously a very short person.</li>
            <li> first wig I ever bought, and I&#x27;ve had PLENTY. it was a good beginner one, it was beautiful and awesome, but don&#x27;t brush it too much otherwise it&#x27;ll tangle fairly quick and use a wide toothed brush!</li>
            <li> Wonderful, everyone who saw me thought it was my real hair and I didn&#x27;t have to get a separate hair net because it came with one. Also order was delivered promptly.</li>
            <li> Cheap quality product.wear it make be urgly girl.</li>
            <li> This would have a 4 star review if it got my head. Very small.... Very shiny too. Like too shiny</li>
            <li> This is seriously a great buy and investment. I&#x27;ve spent over 50.00 for wigs that aren&#x27;t as nearly comfortable or look as natural as this one. Defiantly worth buying.</li>
            <li> I have had short (shaven neck) hair for about 20 years and have been contemplating getting extensions. This felt great to wear...and real! I bought this for a pirate costume (female) and wore it under a bandana (the bangs fell funny along my face) and a pirate hat. It was comfortable and people that didn&#x27;t know I had short hair thought it was my real hair. It felt great but after a night of sweating at Halloween parties, it was so tangled, I had to throw it away. But I&#x27;m going to order another one!</li>
            <li> The wig I received looks nothing like this. It&#x27;s a much darker brown and quite a bit shorter. It&#x27;s pretty, but not what I was expecting. The band is also much too small, it&#x27;s like child size.</li>
            <li> Love the hair, texture, looks real but didn&#x27;t like the bang, too long, maybe a hairstylist can help</li>
            <li> Well ..... Looks cheap</li>
            <li> fun wig - for late nights out!</li>
            <li> This wig is too way small for a normal size head. If u have an extra small head, go ahead.</li>
            <li> wig is just ok color shown is correct but this wig is very thin and looks like some hair in the back was cut?</li>
            <li> This is a great wig. Looks quite natural, the hairline is well blended. I was super surprised by the great quality of this wig. Great price too!</li>
            <li> The wig (not counting the tax) was less than ten dollars.&lt;br /&gt;I wore it to work twice and out to a friend&#x27;s to hang out.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty good, but the cap is too small and makes it sore and achey behind my ears after a day&#x27;s wear.&lt;br /&gt;The color is beautiful and it doesn&#x27;t look too synthetic, but ouch.&lt;br /&gt;3/5.</li>
            <li> Although this wig looks and feels cheap to the wearer, it only looks fake upon close inspection. From a distance no one is going to notice. When looking at it closely you&#x27;ll notice that there&#x27;s not enough hair sewn in to make it look truly real, but for the price point how can you really complain.&lt;br /&gt;This is a fun and flirty wig and if you only have a couple dollars to spend, then this is a good option.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful wig that looks good on.  Easy to care for, good looking, good cut, very natural looking.  I really like it</li>
            <li> This was perfect for my Playboy costume, and I&#x27;ve even worn to it a couple of other things!!! Just be careful, since it tangles easily.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful, light brown very long wig. Easily past my waist, soft waves. The side-swept bangs are the right length, hair looks natural. Great deal for the price</li>
            <li> This feels and looks like real human hair, no joke. I don&#x27;t take care of it at all and it&#x27;s still just as pretty as when I bought it. Just run a wide toothed comb through it... so gorgeous.</li>
            <li> I love this wig its perfect for nights out! super fun! I havent worn it out and about during the day for the fact that it does look a bit fake. So i usually wear it for nights out on the town.</li>
            <li> Shades a lot but hey I&#x27;m fine with that! looks real! It came fast, hope everyone else is happy with it to.</li>
            <li> Amazing , still using it after months. Came fast &amp; was exactly what I needed. Long and curly , wash regularly to keep it longer.</li>
            <li> It is going to go great with The Halloween Custom, the wig looks very natural and we got it at a fantastic low price.</li>
            <li> THIS WIG SHEDS LIKE CRAZY!! It looks nice and feels nice but is sheds so much that it&#x27;s more of a costume wig than anything else. NOT RECOMENDED IF LOOKING FOR LASTING WIG!!&lt;br /&gt;Edit: It still sheds but after a week it&#x27;s still holding strong! I might even get another wig!!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this wig the quality is real good I can&#x27;t wait to wear it out for party . I would recommend this to anyone...</li>
            <li> so i bought this wig because the reviews were decent and i wanted to wear it on a weekend trip to the city. unfortunatly, it came weeks after the trip and when i got it, it wasn&#x27;t even wavy. it was matted and uncut and terrible. the bangs were down to my chin and i couldn&#x27;t wear it in the privacy of my home, let alone in public. it looked so fake as well. it was very thin and not a good investment. i have a pixie cut, and so i guess i have to wait another 5 months to get the hair i want wiht extentions. thanks for absolutely nothing LOLI.</li>
            <li> I hve worn it twice and its sooooo pretty but looks fake out in the sun. It is really pretty and realistic indoors tho</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than expected, is good quality for an inexpensive price! I did cut the bangs, because of personal preference, but it could have been worn with the bangs to the side. Very satisfied, and I will be buying again from this seller!</li>
            <li> I will start by saying this: the hair on this wig both looks and feels real. It has all these highlights and lowlights that bring out the color, which for mine wasn&#x27;t too far off from the product photo. It is quite a long wig, maybe not as thick as the picture, but it doesn&#x27;t shed much and you&#x27;ll never have to worry about the wig cap showing. Speaking of which, please buy your own: the one provided is a weak mesh one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to take off one star for the headache this wig gave me. It wasn&#x27;t tangled when I received it, but after 45 minutes of trying to get it over my giant head, the chemical-smelling hair was a mess. It barely fit on my head without some struggling and you have to be gentle so as not to tangle it. The bangs are also much longer than the ones in the picture, so you&#x27;ll have to cut them to get them out of your eyes. Overall, I give it 4/5 stars.</li>
            <li> Well I just ordered this wig about 2 days ago and I shipped almost instantly and I just got it today. It&#x27;s not super soft or anything which doesn&#x27;t really bug me and isn&#x27;t unnaturally shiny or anything. It is pretty much exactly what the picture looked like, except maybe a tad bit darker, but nothing unpleasant. The bangs are a tiny bit long but that&#x27;s fine because pushing them to the side looks cuter and you could always just trim them a bit which is no big deal. The curls are cute and not over-exaggerated or under done and I just really love it. I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
            <li> So I just got my wig. Didn&#x27;t expect it this fast. Love this wig. I actually chopped it a little bit and looked better now.Really curly.</li>
            <li> Not at all like the picture. Though it did not say it on the order, the size is tiny - almost childsize. The color and fullness do not match the picture so I was extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Wow, this is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; First, I do admit that people might get crappier ones if they are unlucky, since there are so many negative reviews. However, mine is great. This is very soft, beautiful, and it fits beautifully to me. One drawback is that the color is a bit different from the picture, but I like this color better. (its reddish-brown indoor and strawberry blond in the sun)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I really want to buy like 10 and wear them forever... I even hesitated to write this review because if I post this more people are going to buy it and the seller might run out of this awesome wig...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But, this is great, and I will continue buying from this seller.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this because of the high reviews. I dont know if i just got a bad one or what but the hair was sewn into the cap and the hair was way shorter than it looks in the picture. It reached the top ot my breasts. The color is more like a light blonde also. Will never buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> The wig does not look like it does as pictured online. When I complained and tried to return it for a refund, the seller would not refund my money. They were only willing to replace the item. At this point, I was so irritated that I ended up just selling the silly thing.</li>
            <li> I was surprized at how wonderful this wig was for the amount it cost. I wore it and no one knew who I was. Those who didn&#x27;t thought it was real hair. Easy to take care of.</li>
            <li> Are you kidding me?  For the price you would think this is just another cheap costume wig but it&#x27;s NOT.  This wig is really pretty and does the job.  You won&#x27;t believe what you get for the price!!</li>
            <li> I bought this wig as well as another one sold by these people. This as well has fooled a few people. Havent trimmed the bangs on it but they are very long. There isnt a ton of waves in it, fairly straight hair. The color is pretty close to the one in the picture. Wig looks pretty real but very shiny especially in pictures with a flash. Again, use a wide toothed comb to get the tangles out of the hair. Comes with a wig cap too!</li>
            <li> I had it one day before it came unsewn. I&#x27;m always having to hide that part since I don&#x27;t know how to fix it (this was my first wig.) It also tangles very easily and is pretty thin on the bottom. It&#x27;s also not as layered as it looks. It&#x27;s all one length.&lt;br /&gt;That said, it does look real enough and it feels soft.</li>
            <li> Looks amazing!! Has really cute flowing curls and looks like real hair. Was really comfortable to wear too make it my wig of choice!</li>
            <li> to me, its gorgeous! I can easily brush it but it does shed. I need to find a more sturdy one but I can&#x27;t help but love the price for it!</li>
            <li> Great size, Great quality so pleased with my purchase arrived fast and well packaged / a great value  and a must for any adult mannequin</li>
            <li> I MODEL FOR A LIVING, AND OFTEN USE WIGS AS MY NATURAL HAIR IS VERY SHORT, SO MY COLLECTION OF WIGS IS QUITE EXTENSIVE. I&#x27;VE PAID UP TO $275 FOR SYNTHETIC WIGS. I STUMBLED ON THIS WIG WHILE SHOPPING WIG CARE PRODUCTS, AND THOUGHT FOR $10, WHY NOT? WELL, I&#x27;M ABSOLUTELY THRILLED!!! THE BANGS WERE A BIT LONG, AND THOUGH THEY CAN BE SWEPT TO EITHER SIDE, I CUT MINE BECAUSE IT&#x27;S A BETTER LOOK FOR ME. UNLIKE MANY SYNTHETIC WIGS, IT DIDN&#x27;T SPLINTER WHEN I TRIMMED IT AND IT RETAINED IT&#x27;S ORIGINAL SHAPE INSTEAD OF TRYING TO WARP ON MY LIKE SOME DO WHEN TRIMMED. IT EVEN CAME WITH A FREE GIFT OF CUTE PINK ANKE SOCKS, WHICH IS PRETTY COOL. I&#x27;VE ALREAY PLACED ANOTHER ORDER FROM THIS SELLER AND WILL BE MAKING MANY MORE! AND A TIP TO GET RID OF THAT \\&quot;WIGGY\\&quot; SHINE THAT MAKES IT LOOK LESS NATURAL: SPRINKLE SOME UNSCENTED BABY POWDER ON A WIDE TOOTHE COMB, COMB IT THROUGH THE WIG FROM ROOT TO TIP, THEN SHAKE IT OUT. IT LOOKS QUITE NATURAL AFTER. I&#x27;M 100% SATISFIED, AND HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> pretty nice. it sheds a lot and doesnt last long at all, but then they are like 15 dollars so you can buy several for the price of one good quality synthetic. the only bad thing is that cool2day offers no wigs with parts or lace.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been around artificial or real hair wigs at all, but when this came in I was extremely pleased with the quality. I didn&#x27;t buy it to wear but to put on a mannequin to practice photography. I already tried that and I swear it looks real in person and in the photographs. In fact, it not only has scared me innumerable times when I turn the corner where it is, but my dogs went crazy wondering who the new woman is with the long hair. I finally had to throw a quilt over the mannequin because I kept forgetting it was in the house! Now, she just looks like a tall ghost.</li>
            <li> this wig is BETTER  than the picture. its a little darker and it looks soooooo real! it feels real too. i love it so much. i was not expecting it to look so good! i would recommend this to anyone! it doesn&#x27;t tangle easy and i wore it right out of the package! they even sent me a little gift with it which was a pretty ring :) trust me you wont be disappointed if you get this wig. it didnt take as long as i thought with shipping either!</li>
            <li> I opened the package and noticed, the color was a lot darker than advertised.&lt;br /&gt;It was very soft, but it tangled very easily. And it is super shinny and thin, looks very fake on, had to cut and pin back bangs as well as stuff tissue paper in my wig cap to make it look fuller.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recomend wearing it out side or in well lit areas.&lt;br /&gt;But for the price I guess you&#x27;re getting what you pay for</li>
            <li> I bought this wig yesterday and received it today. :) quickest i&#x27;ve ever got an item.&lt;br /&gt;pretty wig, color is just like it&#x27;s stated, a light brown. the seller contacted me directly and was very nice and told me if i had any questions to email him.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this purchase and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This wig is beautiful!!!!!!!! It is well worth the money an looks exactly like real hair. Very silky and shiny. Beautiful realistic color.</li>
            <li> I bought this wig origionally to go along with my halloween costume, however i would wear this out and about anytime.  I got so many compliments on this wig.  People who did not know me thought this was my real hair.  It feels great and looks amazing.  Way better than any Halloween store.  Took awhile to get here since it&#x27;s coming from overseas, but definately worth it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even explain how surprised I was at the quality of this wig! It was so well priced and looks great. I purchased it for a play I was in but I had several people said it looked real! I love it and I take every opportunity to wear it :)</li>
            <li> I love this wig it is thin but covers all of the netting underneath. i currently have this one and my pink and white one together and they look great I will post pictures..</li>
            <li> This is a cheaply made wig and it takes some time to make it look right on your head. The clips also come undone and you have to take it off to fix it a lot</li>
            <li> I purchased this wig to wear once.  I had to cut the bangs down to the right length for it to look good on me.  The color of the wig in real life is very different than in the pictures- in a good way.  It&#x27;s like a dark reddish gold.  I sewed in wig clips to keep it on, as it didn&#x27;t feel secure with only the rubber.  I received a lot of compliments on it.</li>
            <li> The color is awesome, its a little shorter than pictured which I actually prefer, and its just so realistic,so amazing value for this price, Definitely worth the wait (shipping from China) as welLas the money!</li>
            <li> I just got this in the mail today and I have it on right now and I absolutely LOVE it!!! I have been trying to grow my hair out, and it&#x27;s at at stand still right now and very frustrating and I was actually considering last week going and getting it cut (It&#x27;s just now a couple inches below my chin, I had an angled bob hair cut.) but I didn&#x27;t go and have anything done and when I got this wig in the mail and put it on, it is almost the exact color of my natural hair, so my hair and the wig blend together beautifully and I LOVE it!! It gives me so much confidence. I may never take it off! lol. I would so reccomend this to anyone and everyone. I love the feel of it, it&#x27;s so soft, but it is a bit shiny in pictures, I am going to try some of the tricks to soften the shine down some. I am so happy with this!</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these wigs and they arrived in three days.&lt;br /&gt;They were well- packaged and I was stunned at the quality of this wig.&lt;br /&gt;It looked very real,, was thick and came with a hair net to hold the hair and&lt;br /&gt;a wig net to hold one&#x27;s natural hair.  it fit well.  It looked real and a friend&#x27;s customer&lt;br /&gt;took me for her daughter!  I will order more of these if I can.  Quality 10.&lt;br /&gt;Color 10.  Fit 10.  Love it- 5 stars!!</li>
            <li> It was about two shades lighter than the picture, which was slightly disappointing, but it got the job done nonetheless!</li>
            <li> that wig is beautfill do have the same wig in different colers.if so i would to buy at least three more.  red  blond blondishbround. thank you.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing wig!  You would never guess it was such a cheap wig.  I will be recommending this to everyone I know.  It looks so much better than the picture.  I will be buying one or two more just in case I wear this one out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going through chemotherapy and am losing my hair.  I can&#x27;t afford any of the expensive wigs they sell in stores around here but this wig looks better than any of them!  I had to take it in to have my hairdresser trim the bangs for me and she was so shocked by it&#x27;s quality I had to send her the link on Amazon so she can recommend it to her other clients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, buy this wig!</li>
            <li> First things first...I&#x27;m a guy.&lt;br /&gt;I used this wig for a costume where I dressed up as a woman. I had makeup done and everything and initially many people didn&#x27;t recognize me so I believe that stands for itself. The seller was very nice and included a hair net along with a pair of socks that I couldn&#x27;t use because I am a size 12 1/2 mens but gave to my sister who was helping me.&lt;br /&gt;My only nitpick is that the bangs were too long for my liking at about 4 in. long however a few quick snips with the scissors fixed that.</li>
            <li> I own a LOT of wigs. I like to cosplay characters and so I purchase a lot of wigs but I actually wanted a wig I could wear out that looks natural. So I got this one thinking it was natural enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a lot lighter than what the images shows and shinier. There are ways to reduce shine on a hair piece (dry shampoo - you&#x27;re welcome), but it was still lighter than what was shown. It was leaning towards blondish. It still looked good and the material is better than the ones you see at costume stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a cosplayers (and all my cosplayers friends agree) - buy 100% Japanese Kanekalon (high quality one) made fiber ONLY. I do own those plastic ones but they are SO hard to maintain. These ones are a lot easier to care for. I now only buy Kanekalon. I do own plastic ones cuz they were on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great thing about Coo2day is they deliver fast and send you a wig cover (for you to put on before the wig) and socks (random, I know but who doesn&#x27;t love socks!?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a great buy for $10. Worth it.</li>
            <li> I HAVE THIS WIG JUST GOT IT MONDAY ITS A MESS CAP TO SMALL AND ALREADY TORE AT THE BANG I HAVE A REVIEW ON YOUTUBE TYPE IN COOL2DAY WIG OR YOU CAN GO TO ROKINDATTHANG AND ITS ONE OF TWO VIDS IM UPSET BUT IT WAS ONLY 9$ NO PAIN THANK GOD</li>
            <li> Ok so I bought this wig for drag (I&#x27;m a guy) and it was my very first wig ever. Literally EVERYONE I saw the night I wore it complimented me on this wig and thought it had cost me AT LEAST $50. I had no idea it looked that high-quality (because of my general knowledge of wigs prior to buying this one). The wig looks absolutely real. It&#x27;s tricky to upkeep if you don&#x27;t know how to take care of a wig (like myself lol...) but if you do I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be fine for a long time. This wig is a keeper and for the price...it&#x27;s unbeatable. The package also came with a complimentary wig cap and some cute girl socks (which my man feet can&#x27;t fit into haha). Buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> It is a bit thin, but you know what it looks real. It&#x27;s soft, does not smell funny or anything. I read a few other reviews before deciding this is one I highly recommend. Do not use it every day though, or it will shed easily...it is very thin. But for an occasional dress up or party I would have to say have fun with it!! It looks just like a princess style. &amp;#60;3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to wear it tonight with my friends!! : D</li>
            <li> This wig is gorgeous, it tangles easily, but not so horrible you can&#x27;t finger brush it out. There&#x27;s minimal shedding, and you can even put it in a low ponytail or braid if you are patient.</li>
            <li> This wig is Stuningly beautiful as it is called. However, it does easily tangle. Sometimes a few strokes pulling fingers through the tangles will restore it. Some times it may require a bit more attention to restore it. It is gorgeous!</li>
            <li> I recently dyed my hair and had to have a natural color for the work place. this wig covers all of my hair perfectly, and most people don&#x27;t even realize that&#x27;s it&#x27;s fake until I tell them. Even my co-workers thought I had just gotten hair extensions and my hair dyes brown. It&#x27;s beautiful</li>
            <li> never got a wig, so I asked for another one or a refund. I am still waiting for a reply.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is so short and I don&#x27;t really like it right now. I really want that wig!</li>
            <li> I bought this exact wig off of ebay a few months ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While described as a light brown... the wig itself looks very dark strawberry blonde in the light. It definitely has a red hue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this is a fun wig. I wear it quite a bit. It is very long and flowing, It doesn&#x27;t shed as much as my other synthetic wigs, and I can pull a few strands on the sides back into a low ponytail or put them up in barrettes without it looking too \\&quot;wiggy\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that does give the wig away is the shine many synthetic wigs have, a shine you don&#x27;t see in natural human hair. so you can tell it is synthetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;other than that, this is one of my favorite wigs. I have wore it for Halloween, I wore it to an Anime convention (makes a nice Orihime from \\&quot;Bleach\\&quot; wig), I wore it to a Christmas party, I&#x27;ve even worn it out shopping. Its a really nice wig for the price.</li>
            <li> This wig was more auburn red than light brown. It got super tangled as I tried wearing it the first time. The hair falls out super easy. The shine definitely gives it away. I don&#x27;t think I could wear it in public. The worst part of this shopping experience was the customer service. I was having trouble because I hadn&#x27;t received it and the person that was suppose to be helping me was of NO assistance. I ended up arguing with them trying to get a refund for about an hour. Even then they did not solve the problem. Let&#x27;s just say I had to get Amazon involved. I do not recommend this product or seller.</li>
            <li> The color isn&#x27;t like it was described, but it is beautiful. It is more like dark strawberry blond.&lt;br /&gt;I am using this daily, it gets tangled a little quick but then it is just to brush it. When I first looked at the package I didn&#x27;t think it looked so great, but when I took the wig out and tried it on, it was beautiful. It looks very real and many people commented how beautiful it is. Fast delivery, it came after 8 days.(I live in Norway)&lt;br /&gt;This can be used to normal or formal. Since it is styled, without looking to much.&lt;br /&gt;Can be hard to style by yourself but it is looking good as it is.</li>
            <li> This wig looks much better than I expected for the price. It doesn&#x27;t look costume-y and works well for daily wear.</li>
            <li> This wig is terrible. The only way I can wear it so that it looks real is if I hide the \\&quot;scalp\\&quot;, because of the way it parts and how it makes my head look bigger than it is. It was a disappointment that something so highly rated turned out to be looking just how it should be for the price: cheap. I even had to cut off a good inch because of the way it tangled within the first day! Save your money! Just don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this wig and didn&#x27;t know what to expect. I have never used a wig before and just wanted a cheaper one to play around with and go out once in a while.&lt;br /&gt;First impression: The color is BEAUTIFUL. The picture made me worry that it might be dark blonde light brown but it is NOT. It is definitely BROWN and just a pretty light shiny brown.&lt;br /&gt;Second impression: The wave in it is pretty but  not as wavy as the picture. Also, it gets tangled easy which is to be expected because its so long.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t worn it for a long period of time yet but initially it feels like it will stay on no problem. It comes with a wig cap which works pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;Great price, good product. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe they can sell this wig for so little.  I purchased it as part of a Halloween costume, but is nice enough to wear every day. The reviewer that said it&#x27;s terrible must have received the wrong wig, because this one is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this wig for a Halloween costume and liked it so much I&#x27;m thinking about buying a second for personal use! I was worried the wig cap would be small but it fit perfectly (and I have a big head). Love the wig, didn&#x27;t have to trim the bangs or anything</li>
            <li> This is a super long wig with an almost &#x27;ombre effect from L. Brown to a auburn-ish tip. VERY flattering! Fort the price I will purchase more products!!!</li>
            <li> I threw mine out as soon as i opened the pack. What a mess! I mean really? This is even lower grade than costume wigs. I wouldn&#x27;t be caught dead wearing such.</li>
            <li> I love this wig! It&#x27;s beautiful, and great quality synthetic fiber. It&#x27;s a little stiff and shiny, but not fake looking. It came out of the bag with great shape! all I had to do was go over it with a soft-bristle brush and I was good to go! The only thing about this wig that I wasn&#x27;t expecting was that the length of the bangs was a good bit linger than the picture depicted. However, it is still very manageable and can be brushed or trimmed easily to style. I would definitely purchase from this merchant again! Thank you!</li>
            <li> VERY soft, good quality. Came in good packaging and includes its own hair net, which is greatly appreciated. The color is a tiny bit more auburn than expected but it&#x27;s still beautiful, and the curls at the end are magnificent.</li>
            <li> So I ordered a red wig a few months back and everyone thought it was my natural hair. I have been itching to get another one so I ordered this one. It is a great deal for the price. It even came with a wig cap which was wonderful. The hair was more wavy than curly though. The length doesn&#x27;t feel as long as the picture in fact it&#x27;s only two inches longer than my natural hair. The color is gorgeous and it looks very real!</li>
            <li> very good quality for the price, i was pleasently surprised and liked it very much. i think i would recomend to friends</li>
            <li> This is my first wig so I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect. For the price I was wowed and most people dont realize its a wig. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5th star is because the inside cap is SO big theres enough room for a full head of long hair inside. I have almost no hair at all so the cap sags in the back and causes a strange shape but I cover that and no one notices. I did have to trim it cause it was a little over the top for everyday wear and got tangled alot. All in all a good wig as far as I know and I&#x27;m glad I made all my first timer mistakes on a \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; wig. I may order another and experiment with length and adjustments with this one, thats the nice thing about this wig. It&#x27;s not expensive so if you mess it up you just order another. Also the \\&quot;strange smell\\&quot; that other reviewers mentioned...It smells like new clothes of a new car, a little like plastic and factory. But it QUICKLY looses that smell and is replace with your smell(your perfume/soap/lotion and whatever).</li>
            <li> As with all rewiews the bangs required trimming. I had no hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;I use an old very large afro hair pick to style it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Product was correct color as pictured it is a golden brown no ash tone.&lt;br /&gt;Husband said I looked like I was 20 years younger. I am nearly 60 and have very very long mostly grey golden brown mixed hair color.&lt;br /&gt;So that was a big win for me.&lt;br /&gt;The inclusion of a strechy wig cap was great.&lt;br /&gt;The cap fit well with all my hair twisted flatly under the cap.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to cut my hair short. To much messing anymore.&lt;br /&gt;This wig is a great substitute for my long hair  MINUS the grey.&lt;br /&gt;It is a little shiny that is to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;The wig is very light weight the cap is well constructed and the fibers are sewn in securely (on this one they are)&lt;br /&gt;I noticed no funny odors.&lt;br /&gt;For the price  it is a Great deal.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived quickly. But we have an Amazon facility in the Phoenix area.&lt;br /&gt;DEFINETLY NOT A HOLLOWEEN WIG.</li>
            <li> first time getting a wig, feel like real hair. there was a free wig cap and a pair of sock along with it. I have shoulder length hair, so it was hard to put it up and wear it</li>
            <li> This is a lovely wig and looks natural. When I have worn this wig I&#x27;ve been asked if it was my real hair.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this wig and am so far pretty happy with it.  It is pretty amazing for the price.  I had been looking at other places to get a wig, all of which selling for over $200.00.  While I&#x27;m sure this wig is not up to that quality, it sure beats spending those bucks if it works.  And so far, it has worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is a little darker than what I imagined from the picture and description, however it matches my color perfectly.  It&#x27;s a little shiny in the sun, but not dramatically so.  Also, the length is shorter than what I see in the image, and I imagine it&#x27;s due to the curls being more defined.  That may change when I wash it.  It shed really bad when I first took it out of the package, but that seems to be calming down.  It withstands brushing just fine.  There were a few small knots in it that seemed like burnt fibers.  I was able to cut them out without compromising the wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with this wig.  As with anything new, there is a period of awkward wearing and getting used to how to wear it, but still it&#x27;s comfortable and people who don&#x27;t know me can&#x27;t tell I&#x27;m wearing a wig.  I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a wig.</li>
            <li> I love this item and I&#x27;m wearing it now very natural looking. You will have to trim the bangs however they come to the nose almost. I like that though because you can choose your bangs style from this. I thought the color was more brown than red and had lots of natural looking tones to it. Very very pleased especially considering I only paid 6.49</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really soft and natural looking wig.&lt;br /&gt;I was quite satisfied with it, except it was not as long as the picture, doesn&#x27;t have as much volume as the picture and I would say the brown lies closer to the yellow spectrum than red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it has enough volume and length to be a decent wig.</li>
            <li> If I can rate this 10, instead of 5 - I would! It is absolutely beautiful! I never wore wig before, I was just curious and did not expect much - but when I opened it last night I was amazed! It is great! Looks very natural, I am thinking of wearing it every day. Great product! Thank you very much ;))&lt;br /&gt;Dijana</li>
            <li> is amazing, nobody believes that is a wig, is perfect, the color changes a bit of the picture but I like more the one in person, not very bright, so betrays not the synthetic, usually enredarce a little, but it&#x27;s amazing how long and beautiful it is to love....</li>
            <li> I was SO excited to get this wig in the mail today! It came early and it really was a high quality wig for the price! I was so suprised that a wig this great could be so cheap. The color was light but I knew that ahead of  time from other reviews. I am very happy with this wig and look forward to taking photos with it! I ordered another wig from this seller and I am now extremely excited to get it! I also got a wig cap and a cute  pair of purple socks! I will be buying from this seller again!</li>
            <li> Ordered this item for fun. What was surprising is the the company sent me a email letting me know it was coming and to let them know if their was a problem they were there to make sure I was satisfied. Mr Feng made me feel like a VIP for this inexpensive purchase. The wig is for fun so I did not expect great but it is better than I expected. Oh yes this vender COOL2DAY also included a bonus gift. Believe it. I was impressed. Great job cool2day. Also cute name. :-)</li>
            <li> I ordered this wig for a costume so I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot. In fact, this one of the cheapest wigs on Amazon. But it&#x27;s cheap only in price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the package, it looked great! In fact, it almost looked too good. Light and fluffy with decent length and great bangs that hang down over half my face. The natural color and cut makes it look like it&#x27;s my real hair - which is funny considering I&#x27;m a guy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took the advice of another reviewer and tried some [[ASIN:B000143JSK Mane &#x27;n Tail Detangler]] in it. Wow again! I was a little concerned because everything on the web said to only use products designed for synthetic material wigs. But at this price, why not? The Mane &#x27;n Tail had three great effects:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It brought the \\&quot;too good\\&quot; texture down a notch that&#x27;s much more natural. And now I can play with styling the wig much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It smoothed out some of the waves and seemed to add almost six inches to the length. The wig still has a definite wave going on but its now longer and much more natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. It gave the wig a nice scent. I guess some people don&#x27;t like the smell of Mane &#x27;n Tail, but I do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this wig is an amazing deal. The color and cut are so natural that I suspect almost anyone could wear it without feeling self-conscious. The length is great, especially if you put detangler in it and brush it out well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawbacks: Being a fairly thick-haired wig, it&#x27;s pretty warm. I may have to break it out this winter when the temps drop below freezing. Paired with a hat, I&#x27;d stay super warm. The other drawback is the ends tend to get frizzy. The detangler helps some but I think it&#x27;s a common problem with these synthetic wigs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last thing: the wig was packaged quite nicely. The vendor, Cool2Day, contacted me before the product shipped (from Amazon) to thank me for the order. The package also included a wig cap and a \\&quot;gift\\&quot; - a pair of lime green socks.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B005KO7NK6 Stunning beautiful long LIGHT BROWN curly wave wig full wigs jf010023]] very happy with the product arrived on time good quolity and no problem with anything</li>
            <li> Hair piece is very large. Mesh cap only. No combs to keep it attached to your head. Didn&#x27;t like at all.</li>
            <li> The wig showed up in great condition, and it&#x27;s very nice quality. The bangs were a little longer than I expected, but overall I&#x27;m very pleased with the product, and the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Darker than it looks but a perfect buy. It tangles extremely easily but handle it with care.&lt;br /&gt;It fit comfortably and is good for every day use, actually! I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m losing my hair. Ugh. It&#x27;s genetic folks, so there is not much I can do. Rogaine for Women- expensive, ugly side effects and not guaranteed. If it works, you can never stop or hair will fall out again. Hair replacement- ridiculously expensive. So I went on the hunt for a nice wig. I cannot afford real hair wigs (Starting price $700!!). I read previous reviews of this wig and thought for $10 dollars it could not hurt to try. Worst case- I use it for a costume, gift it, and/or sell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars is for the bargain of the product. Other synthetic wigs cost 5 times as much and don&#x27;t have the feel of real hair and/or are very &amp;#34;costumey&amp;#34;. This wig feels very close to real hair and is able to be brushed and styled as such (I&#x27;ve read that a warm curling iron can be used too but I&#x27;m not sure I will try this). I would consider the color light red rather than light brown but my natural hair is red, so it isn&#x27;t a problem for me. I can only give the wig itself a 3.5 to 4 stars because 1.) if you look at the roots, you can see the stocking and wig caps, which are black. It would have been perfect to have the caps match the wig color and/or be nude. 2.) The wig is VERY shiny.. Like, unnaturally shiny. Both those elements can give it away as fake.  I will most likely trim the wig along the sides for a more natural length and find some way to tone down the shine. I&#x27;m not crazy about bangs, but not much I can do about that. Overall, I am pretty happy with the product.</li>
            <li> This is my first wig and I&#x27;m so very pleased. It just arrived today. It came three weeks earlier than expected. It&#x27;s very nicely packed. It came with a wig cap AND an extra gift. The company had sent me an email right after the product shipped telling me personally who I could contact if I have any problems. If all goes well with this wig, which I believe it will, I&#x27;ll be sure to buy from this company again!</li>
            <li> This wig was absolutely stunning, realistic, gorgeous! I received many compliments on how healthy \\&quot;my hair\\&quot; was, and frequently asked what products I was using to get such a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> I ordered this wig 3 days ago and it arrived today, earlier than the estimated delivery date. I was very pleased with the product it also came with 2 gifts, a pair of ankle socks and a wig cap so i got to try it on right away . The hair on the wig doesn&#x27;t come off easily like many wig does , it is actually very stable. You can also adjust the size of the wig with the wig clips inside. The color of the wig is a bit darker than depicted on the picture but it still looks very natural and it&#x27;s very smooth. If you are considering to buy this wig, and dont know if you should or not, you totally should, you wont regret it! :)</li>
            <li> I have been buying wigs left and right in order to wear out on the weekends for fun, you know, wigging out. I ordered this guy because it was so cheap and I was super surprised when it came it that it was of such high quality. You could definitely fool people with this wig, it is my most realistic wig out of my stupid collection. It feels great and looks great I highly recommend it to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the company cool 2 day was a pleasure to order from. They even included a wig cap in the package and a money back guarantee if you are not pleased with the wig.</li>
            <li> I got this wig about 5 days after I ordered it. Its a really great wig, extremely soft &amp; its about 19\\&quot; long. I had to cut the bangs because they were too long. But I regret cutting them, because the bangs did look better when they were long. So my best advice would just be to push them to the side. I would recommend washing the wig, because it IS really shiny. Or you could just blowdry it to get some of the shinyness out. I&#x27;ve worn this wig for almost a week now, &amp; the shinyness has worn away some. I was very surprised, because you CAN straighten and curl this wig. I wear this wig every day, wherever I go, &amp; I plan on buying another wig from this company.</li>
            <li> Well layered, it is curly and thick! The bangs are sided and the color is a beautiful light brown! It is VERY wavy and a little curly, easily gets frizzy however. The only complaint I have is that the cap is a little tight for me and gives me headaches. Overall, it is nice and super long!</li>
            <li> This wig is very nice! It came in the right color and it&#x27;s very soft! It even came with a wig cap and a small present (socks)! It&#x27;s very easy to adjust and it fits perfectly. It&#x27;s not too shiny in the sunlight so it doesn&#x27;t look too wiggy. It looks just like the customer images. Some other people said that the bangs are too long but mine were cut perfectly. The only complaint I have about this wig is that there are some hairs under the bang that are cut really short (like baby hairs) that show if I lift the bangs to style them a little. It&#x27;s hardly noticeable though and the wig is perfect in every other way! :D</li>
            <li> It looked soft and pretty when I took it out of the package but when I put it on the wig was very itchy and kept knotting up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really soft and light. It looks exactly as it does in the picture. Doesn&#x27;t feel like it would last so long though, but for that price it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> the wig is cool it just doesnt match my face and the color is not light brown it is darker than in the picture but its great for dressing up with!</li>
            <li> I have never been more complimented on a wig in my whole life. I am transgender and wear wigs a lot, and this wig is it. beautiful</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a wig that is long, straight kinda curly, and  has pretty bangs that are pre-trimmed for you, this is the wig for you. This wig is pretty. The color is a dark toned dirty blonde color, great for almost any skin tone. It fits snug on my head, i wont have to worry about it falling off. There is a little shedding but that is expected from a cheaper wig. It is easy to brush through without tangling.  I will say you probably have to cut the bangs a little tiny bit more depending on your forehead, to frame the face a little more.  In my opinion, this wig looks better in person than on the picture shown.</li>
            <li> This was exactly &amp;#34;worth the price&amp;#34; as its very cheap. It reeeaaally looks like a wig. Won&#x27;t wear it. I dont recommand it.</li>
            <li> Now that the pictures are updated, the wig is closer to the color pictured. The wig is absolutely gorgeous as well. It doesn&#x27;t have a weird shine to it many wigs can have, but looks like very healthy, brown hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the wig on June 14, leaving me with an estimated delivery date between July 11-29. I was pleasantly surprised to get in the male a little over a week later, on the 28th. It&#x27;s in excellent condition and is exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> Love it love it love it!!!! I look so sexy wearing this hair! I highly recommend it any time!! Love it</li>
            <li> the light brown really was LIGHT haha. I went tanning recently so now it&#x27;s a weird blend between the colour and my skin but it&#x27;s fine. I could cut it and style it etc. It&#x27;s lovely. I would like it to be a little fuller though since it&#x27;s sort of thin. But for a wig at such a low price, it was surprisingly high quality.</li>
            <li> I loved the color and the length. It was exactly what I thought it would be. It isn&#x27;t to shiny or &amp;#34;wiggy&amp;#34;. It stays in place for quite a while. It does get tangled really easily. Great style at a very wonderful price.</li>
            <li> My wig came a couple days ago. It is absolutely amazing, for being a $10 wig.&lt;br /&gt;This is the first wig I bought in awhile. I usually don&#x27;t need wig, but this time I chopped my hair off and I&#x27;m kind of hating it.. :P The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this wig is that, It&#x27;s abit WAY too long. It&#x27;s longer than what it show on the picture, but either than that I love it.</li>
            <li> This is beautiful.. it looks just like natual human hair, beautiful color i cannot wait to wear this and have long beautiful curly hair :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this wig! I&#x27;m using it for a cosplay right now and it looks so very natural some of my close friends didn&#x27;t even recognize me with it on!</li>
            <li> This hairpiece looked beautiful.  The only reason for 3 stars is because there is no information about head size, and even with the adjusting straps set to their smallest setting, this wig would not stay on my head.  I have a smaller head than most adults, and as a petite person, it would be nice to have been told that the wig would only fit the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; head, not a petite adult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned it with no problem, however.  The return was a good experience (although I paid for return shipping).</li>
            <li> This would be a great cosplay/costume wig, but I don&#x27;t think it would really fool anyone if you wanted it to look like your own hair in person. In pictures it look pretty convincing. Having said that, I don&#x27;t have much experience with caring for wigs. So I&#x27;m sure there are some things that could be done make it look a little more natural. It&#x27;s a good quality wig for the price. Seriously, you can&#x27;t beat the price and it comes with a wig cap. The wig is small though. I&#x27;m not sure if would fit someone with a larger size head.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter.  She loves to dress up.  I didn&#x27;t realize how real this wig looks.  Beautiful.  This wig could pass for her real hair.</li>
            <li> Due to health problems and medications I take, my hair has been thinning incredibly. It&#x27;s not the same as it use to be so I decided to try a wig. Being a newbie I&#x27;ve never tried a wig before so I knew nothing about them, so I looked on amazon and saw this beauty. It had a lot of good reviews so for $12 I decided to try it. I couldn&#x27;t really say or comment about the delivery, to be honest I wasn&#x27;t in a rush for it. So I just got it yesterday, and started playing with it and trying it last night. The first thing I noticed was the length, it wasn&#x27;t too long but I&#x27;m 5\\&quot; 7 and it came right above my hip. So for me tht was a perfect length, it was incredibly soft for synthetic hair. And the curls are kinda like soft curls, maybe 1.5\\&quot; curls but very beautiful. Everything about this wig was perfect except for the color. It&#x27;s hard to explain but it&#x27;s kinda like a Carmel, honey color but with a few tiny dark brown highlites. I personally prefer dark brown, I&#x27;ve been dark haired my whole life so this was something I couldn&#x27;t overlook. I&#x27;ve been told my skin color is like Carmel, so for me I hate being the same color as my hair. So this is why the 4 stars :( but if your lighter skinned than me than I would definitely give this wig a try, like I said I loved everything abt it except for the color. I swear I stood in front of my mirror for hours trying to c if I could overlook the color. But i couldn&#x27;t , and after I finally took it off and saw my hair I almost was sad, and strtd crying. :/ but for the most part very beautiful, soft wig and of course as all wigs it was a little on the shiny side so u will have to de-shine it some to your liking. But I would recommend this wig to all my friends and family ;) try it you won&#x27;t b sorry</li>
            <li> This wig is amazing! A good styling and brushing and it is absolutely beautiful. There is no doubt that it looks incredibly real. The customer-contributed photos are the most accurate to its appearance as far as color and ways that it can be styled. This wig is such a wonderful quality that I want to wear it around every day and even though I will not it will be perfect for Halloween and cheaper than Halloween wigs!</li>
            <li> I absolutely fell in love with this wig! It is the first one I have ever owned and I wasn&#x27;t quite sure I could pull it off. Though, with the right outfit, it looked amazing! Yes, it is itchy (yet again, it is the first time I have ever worn a wig) and yes it tangles up easily (but its really easy to brush out the knots) and yes it sheds a little now and then, but what do you expect! and so what?? The top of the wig seems a little unnatural but with a cute hat, it blends it in to look natural and it FEELS natural. I have had short hair all my life, and this wig is long enough to reach the small of my lower back. I wear it almost everyday! The first time I wore it, I received so many complements saying I looked like a completely different person! Even my mom asks to borrow it every now and then! My point it, I absolutely recommend it to anyone out there!</li>
            <li> I just got this wig today and it is absolutely amazing! Love the color, length and just everything about this wig! I will be posting pics of me wearing it soon! It combs easily and they bangs can easily be combed to the side. I love the waves too!</li>
            <li> This wig is gorgeous. It looks like real hair. It has beautiful hi lights and low lights, light copper brown with medium brown low lights, it looks very natural. The waves are very bouncy and pretty. I can&#x27;t believe this wig was so cheap. I LOVE it. Im considering ordering another just to store away incase the one I have gets damaged. Im so excited to get all dolled up today with my new hair. I definately recommend this wig.</li>
            <li> Wow. For the price I paid, I am so happy about this wig. It is soft and shiny. It shipped really fast and it was packaged with care. It came in great condition. The only real downside for me is that the wig cap is somewhat small and it does not have clips in it. But that is ok because I will not wear this wig on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> It was easily tangled..as soon as i put it on it was knotted, I have a wig brush and that didnt do anything to this besides make it worse. I called to order a new one, they said they sent it and i never got it, i dont think they ever sent a new one of my choice. they did give me the choice however to pick any wig.&lt;br /&gt;that was the only good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERY UNSATISFIED.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this wig. It&#x27;s the first wig I&#x27;ve ever purchased and it looks totally real. Everyone that&#x27;s seen it says they ever would&#x27;ve guessed. Easy to brush threw specially when you start from the tips and move up. I have to brush the bangs to the side but it looks really cute like that anyways. Definitely recommend this wig and it&#x27;s such a great price.</li>
            <li> Serves its purpose to hide hair for a quick performance.</li>
            <li> I bought this wig and thought wow. It does not have as much hair as the picture suggests, but it is very pretty and natural looking. I wear all my wigs with a cute hat so that you cannot tell it is fake, plus a hat keeps the wig from sliding off. I would recommend this product. It arrived super fast. Thank you</li>
            <li> I wore this with a costume and it was perfect! Looks very real for synthetic hair. Pretty color and nice texture. It does get tangled easily though.</li>
            <li> Good product for your playmate and its  a product for playtime and thats all would rcommend this  product&lt;br /&gt;wears well also.</li>
            <li> Just received this wig in the mail and it is just as advertised. Looked like natural hair..will definitely buy again in other colors. Great value, and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Though the color was correct, and the quality of the actual hair was at par, there was absolutely no body to the piece. It seemed as if there was not enough used to even cover the cap.&lt;br /&gt;I am returning.&lt;br /&gt;There are much better products available for the same price</li>
            <li> fight ya with whatever you are trying to do with them. they are very difficult. But the absolute worst thing I can say is that i wanted the light brown color, and what i got was not light brown at all. I got a dark brown wig with auburn in it. Its okay too, but not light brown like i ordered. The hair quality is good though, it is very long in length. Overall, its worth the money, yes. One can&#x27;t complain too much, because the cost is so low. really.</li>
            <li> Mine looked more strawberry-blonde than light brown.This also tangles very easily.You can easily tell this is a wig from the back!&lt;br /&gt;Other than that i like the wig.</li>
            <li> The color was more of reddish and it was to big so I trashed it.</li>
            <li> This product i bought it after reading all the reviews..it doesn&#x27;t look real at all..&lt;br /&gt;Dont buy it !! Warning</li>
            <li> Not very impressed with this wig.  Not the color stated and would be ok for Halloween but not for going out or anything public.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews on this item I as kind of sceptical of buying this. However, I went ahead and did so since it was such a cheap price. I am actually surprised with how well the quality of this turned out to be! I have a slightly big head, but the wig still fit almost perfectly. It did not arrive in tangles, which was something else I was a little bit worried about.&lt;br /&gt;A really good product and at a good price. The only thing I would complain about is that I wish the quality of the hair wasn&#x27;t as &amp;#34;shiny&amp;#34; making it appear more wig-like rather than realistic.</li>
            <li> I bought this wig bc of the reviews, and I am pleased! It arrived on time w a cute pair of socks and wig cap. The wig is soft and really not too shiny. I shook it out a bit and put it on, perfect! The waves are really natural looking as is the color. I love it!!!</li>
            <li> This wig is great! Especially for the price! I too am one who had to cut my hair really short because of all the damage from bleaching it. I HATE my hair... And cried a couple of times. So I decided to just \\&quot;look\\&quot; at wigs to see all of what I couldn&#x27;t afford. I didn&#x27;t believe it when I read such great reviews on a $10 wig.... So I ordered it. And I fell in LOVE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Price&lt;br /&gt;Length&lt;br /&gt;Quality&lt;br /&gt;Size&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Sheds a LITTLE&lt;br /&gt;Tangles slightly&lt;br /&gt;Too shiny&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendations: BUY IT&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the thing... This wig will take some TLC initially. But I can&#x27;t imagine what wig wouldn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;To cure the tangles buy some Mane &#x27;n Tail detangler. It works wonders!&lt;br /&gt;To cure the shiny-ness make some dry shampoo. TBL Spoon rubbing alcohol, tbl spoon corn starch, 4 tbl spoons water. Soak with spray bottle brush out, wallah!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is very similar to the picture. It&#x27;s a little more orange though. You do have to play with it to frame your face... But all around this is a great wig! I will definitely buy another in a darker color!</li>
            <li> It came right on time and is simply beautiful! It doesn&#x27;t have the bangs pictures, but I like it better without. It looks completely and utterly real. It came right on time, and is way better than what I expected of it.</li>
            <li> like a barbie dolls hair. very low quality synthetic hair . I purchase alot of synthetic hair and this by far was the WORST. very thin and tangled . i wore it for one day before I junked it .</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t the style that was as pictured. I really wanted the one pictured here. It&#x27;s soft, and still worth the money. I would order from them again.</li>
            <li> I got this item on time, so I was very happy with that.. However, when I opened the box and took the wig out it was NOTHING like the photo. It is so long, stringy, flat, AND after putting it on, I looked at the back in the mirror.. there are thinner spots where inch long pieces of hair poke out and you can see the cap underneath! And I mean straight out! There&#x27;s no way I can wear this thing without a hat over the top.. Maybe it&#x27;s just a random bad one, but regardless, I will not be buying this item again.</li>
            <li> The wig is like a cheap doll&#x27;s hair.  Arrived tangled.  Very thin.  It is  worth $2.99 maybe.  Will make a great wig for Halloween.</li>
            <li> The wig doesn&#x27;t have as much hair as the picture shows, and the bangs are really long and need extensive trimming because they don&#x27;t sweep to the side at all, they hang straight down. Not pleased with this wig, but at least it was cheap.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Halloween wig.Very impressed with the quality and how soft the hair is.Looks real when worn.Well packaged and arrived in 2 days.Will buy from this seller again!!</li>
            <li> I loved this wig and its long and thick and i wore it it look great my friends love it as well good item buy this item!</li>
            <li> trashed within min of receiving. bangs are way to long and cap does not sit on head. bangs do not sweep to the side and resembles a mullet, and even if you wear it with a hat it still will not sit well on the head. complete waste of 8.00</li>
            <li> Not lovely, that&#x27;s for sure. Nice for costume or kids play but can&#x27;t really use for yourself out in public. Also hard to style</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this wig because it was so popular and everyone was saying it was strawberry-blonde like in the light. It went on sale and I got it. I have dark brown hair and this wig was even darker than my own hair, really only reaches the shoulders, and has straight bangs (I really, really hate straight bangs.) These photos are not this wig. The wig is shiny but feels really soft and because of its length doesn&#x27;t seem to tangle too bad, but this isn&#x27;t the wig I paid for and would not have bought it. I really didn&#x27;t want another dark brown wig, and I already have hair this length, and my own haircut is better. It is straight except for one large and obnoxious curl up at the bottom. I look like I&#x27;m from the wrong time period. I am in love with the last wig I bought from this seller and and pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> This wig tangles very easily just from very little wear. I wore this for less than an hour and the whole bottom layer was tangled in a rats nest. I tried to gently brush is and the hair started coming out immediatly. I ended up cutting off about 4 inches and spraying it down with leave in conditioner. Now it is finally wearable again. The wig is a bit too thin thoughm you can see the net that holds the hair if you look closely.</li>
            <li> This wig is pretty, but to me it doesn&#x27;t look real when you wear it.  I would never wear this out in public, just something to play with at home and wear for my honey.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much due to the price of this wig. I was pleasantly surprised when I receive this. The hair quality was actually really good, it fit well and the color was pretty. The only downfall to this one is the top part looks a bit weird. The crown part where the hair changes direction lays a little funny. I usually just wear a cute hat to cover it and it looks fine.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this wig. It was as described, didn&#x27;t smell weird, didn&#x27;t fall apart or any of the other things the negative feedback said. You may have to fiddle with the bangs a bit but you have to do that with most wigs, even high priced ones. For what I payed it was worth it and I would have been willing to put a little more towards it. Give it a try. For the price its worth a shot.</li>
            <li> great wig for the price. Hair is a little thin, but it&#x27;s a good quality. I liked this one so much I bought it in a few different colors</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful wig but the hair strands come out sooo easily.  Has great length and color but was disappointed in quality</li>
            <li> The wig was nice, but mine came a bit red. This wasn&#x27;t a huge problem, seeing that it&#x27;s still a nice wig. It was a big hit at work and around family that is more used to my blue hair. Why four stars? It&#x27;s too shiny..which makes it look a tad noticeably fake. But, for every once in a while, this wig is a pretty good one. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> this wig is incredibly thin.  I got it on an impulse as an accessory and thought it would be fun to wear my hair this long every once in a while, but I haven&#x27;t even worn it out of the bathroom yet.  It&#x27;s way too thin and very OBVIOUSLY a wig.  I guess it would be better than nothing for someone who needs a wig, but my advice would be to spend the money and get one that looks better than this one does.</li>
            <li> This wig exceeded my expectations. It is very natural looking and even the top remembles a real scalp with beautiful hair. Very, very happy customer!</li>
            <li> Well I started wearing it today, just got it yesterday , and it is literally falling apart.Will never order from this seller again. I am going to order same wig from different seller because when I first got it I really liked it. But then it started falling apart.&lt;br /&gt;Update: I ordered the same wig from different seller, 3 months and still waiting. I give up on this wig. To bad it is very pretty.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this wig for the price.  It&#x27;s a good quick fix for a bad hair day.  I feel like I need a headband or a hat or something.  It&#x27;s not put together in the best way.  For example, f the strands shift the wrong way you can see the cap on top.  I like the length.  I love the color and I love the cap size.  The last one is a challenge for me as I have a petite head size and there are not very many options for us pea heads.  I would feel confident going out with it on.  I would not go to work where people know me.  It is pretty shiny.  A little cornstarch can fix that.  Go for it.  You can go wrong.</li>
            <li> From the reviews I read, I expected very little out of this wig. However, I was pleasantly surprised when I was wrong! It does tangle fairly fast, but the quality and overall product cancels that out. I spent $10 max on this, and it is better than any wig that I could get around here (where I live.) You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> It came much faster than anticipated!&lt;br /&gt;It is a beautiful wig and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy more from this company.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this wig twice now. The first one held up for a long time and was very well made... The second, not so much. It has hairs of random lengths (one strand half down my back, another barely to my ears??) and is simply terrible.</li>
            <li> This wig is pretty much as shown. It is very long, perhaps too long, and hard to manage. The color is a rich medium brownish red, very attractive. The hair is smooth and shiny. It&#x27;s too hot for summer so I&#x27;ll stick to my short wigs for awhile. I&#x27;ll see how this works in cooler temperatures. For the price, what&#x27;s to complain about. Maybe I&#x27;ll end up shortening it to a long bob and get rid of some of the unruly hair.</li>
            <li> Very good quality for the price worth the wait for coming from China. I did have to cut the bangs as they were to long for me.</li>
            <li> I ordered this on June 2nd and it just got here today :-) The ONLY issue I had is the wig cap is HUGE! The hair itself is silky soft. it is a lot longer then I had anticipated. However, I really don&#x27;t mind. I love long wigs! It does shed a little but what synthetic wig doesn&#x27;t. All in all I love it and will be buying from the seller more often! And the color! AMAZING!</li>
            <li> You really cannot beat this nice of a wig for the price! It&#x27;s soft and quite realistic looking beyond maybe being too shiny if you want to nitpick. THE BANGS ARE LONG! So be prepared to trim them to your preference once you receive it. If you have a lot of hair (long/thick) DEFINITELY buy a wig cap. It makes a huge difference in how well the wig fits. I still have a little trouble fitting everything under even with the wig cap, but you don&#x27;t notice it sticking out because the wig is thick enough to hide it. Without a wig cap I can make it work, but the wig pulls back and it&#x27;s hard to manage my own hair underneath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;soft&lt;br /&gt;medium thickness/hair density&lt;br /&gt;easily manageable&lt;br /&gt;quick shipping (for coming from China)&lt;br /&gt;can&#x27;t see the netting underneath without physically pulling the hair out of the way&lt;br /&gt;dat price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;requires trimming/styling (if you don&#x27;t know how)&lt;br /&gt;smaller than a regular wig&lt;br /&gt;shinier than natural hair&lt;br /&gt;shipping takes a while (in case you need it soon; took ~3 weeks for me)</li>
            <li> if you want to go to the gym in it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for some one who is going bald, you can not even tell it is not their real hair. Made their day for sure!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just going to list the pros and cons.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Price&lt;br /&gt;-Color. This is both a pro and con for me. Con because it&#x27;s not exactly like the picture shown. It is darker (medium brown?)  and also has a reddish auburn tone to it. I really like the color, although it is falsely advertised.&lt;br /&gt;-Held a beautiful curl when it came out of the package.&lt;br /&gt;-Low heat can be applied.&lt;br /&gt;-Length. Nice and long, just like photo&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-SHEDDING. (I was only gently finger-combing! lots of hair came out :/)&lt;br /&gt;-Tangles.. A lot.&lt;br /&gt;-Very small cap. (Or maybe I just have a big head?) It&#x27;s a bit snug for me.&lt;br /&gt;-No combs or tabs to make sure it lines up correctly with your hairline.&lt;br /&gt;-SHIPPING: took then 2 days to process and ship. Got here in 20 days. Ordered on 1st. Shipped on 3rd. Arrived on 23rd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an okay wig. I tried to make it work since I paid money for it and the color is just beautiful. I flat ironed it since I know straight hair looks better on me and it certainly helped with the tangling. It looks and moves like real hair. The only thing I&#x27;d say that gives it away is the nonexistant part, so I wear it with a slouchy knit beanie and it looks nice. I had to trim the bangs, but that&#x27;s alright. As far as construction goes, you can&#x27;t see any of the wefts when you wear it. The make is a bit sloppy but the outcome is ok. It&#x27;s not super thin, but it&#x27;s also not thick as some cosplay wigs. Also, I&#x27;d rate the softness at about a 7/10. It is quite soft and not too shiny.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I was expecting a whole lot more from the 5 star reviews on here.. Honestly I was a bit let down, but it&#x27;s still a nice wig worth the 7 dollars I paid for it. Just have a little bit of patience and be willing to work with it. Hope this review helped ^_^</li>
            <li> I orderd this wig on May 24 &amp; recieved May 29. Its soft and it has a natural&lt;br /&gt;Shine to it. Not supper glossy looking. I love the wig , the only problem is&lt;br /&gt;The wig was not light brown as shown on the model photo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Color looks like Dark Brown inside doors &amp; out side looks like&lt;br /&gt;Brownish redish. I&#x27;m keeping it Im ok with it the color is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But its not at all like the photo model color wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tryed on for a whole day, I will this wkend and ill post a photo.</li>
            <li> First of all, I never wrote any review before. And this is my first time that I feel like I should share my experience about this wig.&lt;br /&gt;I got the wig yesterday and I fall in love with it right after I tried it on! (I bought 2 wigs before from difference seller and it was disappointed me). So I gave this seller a try, And it was impressed me :). Love Love Love it!!. It&#x27;s fitted my look and style and it looks so natural, doesn&#x27;t shiny like a fake hair. The bang is perfect length(for me)and the color light brown is the same as show in the picture. Such a great wig, Thank you!</li>
            <li> And it is hard to believe!&lt;br /&gt;So depending on the lighting, the hair color looks different, which I think is pretty cool, if u ask me.&lt;br /&gt;The hair color u see of the model is pretty darn accurate, depending on the lighting. Wish it was less red and more brown tho. Kinda wish I got dark brown instead.&lt;br /&gt;Took some pix, cut bangs of course (I don&#x27;t have a big forehead) and cut the back as well, coz I&#x27;m not used to really long hair, makes me feel uncomfortable and also, to make it look natural. :)&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good tht it&#x27;s long so that u can cut it the way u want it to look :)&lt;br /&gt;Just so u know I got this for a second hairstyle option for a wedding. And I&#x27;m VERY GLAD I got it!&lt;br /&gt;At first I wasn&#x27;t sure...coz u know, it was a huge change from my really short hair (i got it really short to get rid of my old bleached hair) and also I havent had my hair this long (chest length now) since kindergarten!!!. now I feel so PRETTY lol. Which I don&#x27;t usually go for, but perfect for the wedding! since I&#x27;m going for a princess look lol with a tiara and all that.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely, HIGHLY recommend this wig. Very pretty.&lt;br /&gt;makes me wanna get more wigs from them lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;oh btw the wig is a bit big on me, but np. Used the tightening straps and it is PERFECT now!  I figured out looking at some other wigs today and looking inside lol. l&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ps cool2day is awesome btw, very helpful, very kind and always available to answer any questions! :)&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely use this company for any wig situation!! :D</li>
            <li> I was super excited to get this because I read all the wonderful reviews and they were not wrong! It looks real and feels great. I think the color looks true to the picture, idk what everyone else was talking about. I got a free pair of hot pink socks with it, kinda random but they are cute. The wig fit perfectly, There are little hook like things that allow you to adjust the size of the inner band. The cap that came with it is a little funky, I got another one at the costume shop. Overall this is a truly wonderful product. Will be wearing it not just for halloween now!</li>
            <li> I loved the length, texture, and color. Only bad thing about it is it can get a little big tangled but easy fix!  Love it!!</li>
            <li> I bought this wig on a whim, figuring that, for the money, how bad could it be?  It&#x27;s a high quality product..Amazing  Thanks  Jackie</li>
            <li> I ordered it hoping for a light/medium brown wig like how the pictures were. However, I received a dark brown colored wig, which is not much of a change for my naturally black colored hair. I would&#x27;ve given 3 stars, but then it came along with a free necklace and free wig cap, so i guess it makes it up a little bit? Besides the color issue, its not bad.</li>
            <li> So my hair is naturally a light brown, but I haven&#x27;t seen my natural color in ages. I range from a black to a dark brown, usually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wig is thick and luscious. My only complaint is that straight out of the box, it&#x27;s a bit shiny, but that&#x27;s easily solved with some baby powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this wig. I just need to get used to the color! :D</li>
            <li> The price was cheap when I bought the wig, so it was a really good deal. I have never bought a wig before so I was skeptical, but when I got it, the texture was very close to real hair, and the cut was nice. Had to adjust the bang, for it was too long, but with a bit of creativity you can pull it off. Wore it for Halloween and nobody recognized me, even the guys ask if it was real!</li>
            <li> The color is a light orange , it is very thin all over a bad wig. Not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;all the hair was gatherd up in the crown and look like you glued the hair on the wig.</li>
            <li> I have worn it several times and love the way it looks. It has held up fairly well and i consider it to be a bargain.</li>
            <li> For the price, it was an okay wig. It&#x27;s difficult to keep it from being tangled all the time, but I like wearing it for fun.</li>
            <li> i just finished raving on another hair piece from these guys! these pieces are amazing for the price and amazing for my confidence! i feel human again and beautiful these are amazing quality amazing price look real what can i say more I AM SOOOOO HAPPY! i look forward to ordering more wigs from these guys!!! i love love love this company!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely light compared to my other wig, yet has more than enough coverage and looks very thick. My only complaint is that it sheds and tangles pretty easily. It&#x27;s definitely worth the price though, just be gentle with it.</li>
            <li> This wig is very long, and the bangs area  bit too long for my taste. It also, despite styling, remains a bit lifeless. Not much like the picture.</li>
            <li> Its hard to manage but looks great as a costume accessory. Color and cap holds well. Do not brush as hair will come loose.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was cheap and I didn&#x27;t need it to look good (was for a costume) but it was actually really great! A couple of people even thought it was my real hair.</li>
            <li> It was good for the price. It was shiny/plastic-looking but did the job for my Halloween costume.</li>
            <li> The wig is much shorter, but it&#x27;s great regardless. Its very soft and shiny. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;3 and it comes just under my chest. The fringe is straight across/ish, not blunt but blends back out longer and longer, into the rest of the hair. Doesn&#x27;t tangle easily, brushes out like a dream. A bit too shiny to look real, but worth more than what you pay, a great buy for a mid-length wig.</li>
