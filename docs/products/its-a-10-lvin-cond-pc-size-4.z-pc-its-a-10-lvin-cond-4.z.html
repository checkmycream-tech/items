            <li> I have long hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair, and there&#x27;s a lot of it, and would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Just a few sprays leaves it soft and knot-free.  </li>
            <li> It lasts a long time, too.  </li>
            <li> This is not oily and works like a gem on my long hair.</li>
            <li> THIS LEAVE-IN CONDITIONER FOR SOMEONE WITH DRY OVER PROCESSED HAIR..</li>
            <li> Immediately after starting to use this product, I have noticed it stronger and when I brush it when wet, there are way less knots in my hair.  </li>
            <li> AND IT ONLY TAKES A FEW SQUIRTS.</li>
            <li> Tames the frizzies without build-up or weighing hair down.</li>
            <li> My hair is a lot less tangled after using this product.</li>
            <li> I use very little, so it wont get too greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Because it sprays out like a thick lotion or conditioner, I just spray some on my hand and rub it in my hair</li>
            <li> She uses this product and pays a ridiculous price for it.</li>

            <li> Great on my naturally curly hair. Seriously love this product!</li>
            <li> Use after shampooing &amp; conditioning to detangle!!  This works great and has a nice scent.  I don&#x27;&#x27;t like the pump on this because it leaves the product on the pump unit. I&#x27;ve noticed this no matter where I buy the product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great its basically all you need, it&#x27;s so many things in one! Great deal very happy will order again.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! Leaves your hair shinny and smelling great!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!  It makes my hair soft and shiny and it helps detangle it.  And this is a good price on it compared to buying it in a salon or beauty store.  You don&#x27;t need that much.  Because it sprays out like a thick lotion or conditioner, I just spray some on my hand and rub it in my hair so it goes on evenly.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, keeps my ends from getting razzled, and my frizz at bay when it&#x27;s raining. Love It!</li>
            <li> Love it!  Works exactly as promised.</li>
            <li> Was a gift and they loved it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is truly a miracle. It has revived my hair; moisturizing it and making it manageable. My hair is a lot less tangled after using this product. I would highly recommend this to anyone struggling with tangled, dry, and brittle hair. It will really help you out!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It makes my hair feel silky and tangle free. I use very little, so it wont get too greasy feeling. My 4oz last for months, and buying it with keratin or without doesnt matter, the results are the same. So for the the 2 bottle purchase is a very good price. I cannot be with out it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product every day for a week now and I am in love with it.  My mom loved it too when she tried it, and she took one of the bottles home with her haha.  Immediately after starting to use this product, I have noticed it stronger and when I brush it when wet, there are way less knots in my hair.  Also, when I brush my hair throughout the day, it is so much easier to brush.  I have long hair, and there&#x27;s a lot of it, and would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> My hair tends to get very knotty and tangled at night, and this stuff is amazing.  Just a few sprays leaves it soft and knot-free.  It lasts a long time, too.  Amazon has the best price I&#x27;ve seen so far, especially with this 2-pack.</li>
            <li> This is not oily and works like a gem on my long hair. Without it, my after shower hair brushing sessions would have doubled in the length of time.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to&lt;br /&gt;A little pricey but worth it if you care about your hair and take care of it</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom. She uses this product and pays a ridiculous price for it. Happy that it cam with 2. Looking forward to buying it again. Overall happy with this product and the shipment was fast too!</li>
            <li> The best leave in treatment I have ever used.</li>
