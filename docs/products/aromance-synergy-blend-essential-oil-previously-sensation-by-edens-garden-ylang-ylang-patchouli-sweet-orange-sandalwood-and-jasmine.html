            <li>Smells great and last most the day.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s also too strong.</li>
            <li>We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM.</li>
            <li>It is also a great way to have use of/ receive benefits of more expensive oils, as many are part of this blend!</li>

            <li>That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden.</li>
            <li>Very quick transaction &amp; packaged very well.</li>
            <li>will buy more in future as well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, JB</li>
            <li>It is a very versatile product.</li>
            <li>Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers.</li>
            <li>It smells so lovely, I added a few drops to cotton balls and placed them in a chest of drawers and closet.  </li>
            <li>This is a new scent for me</li>
            <li>There is a certain amount of peace and comfort that comes with essential oils and this was spot on.</li>
            <li>this smells like an old person.  </li>
            <li>I use it for natural organic cosmetics that I make.</li>
            <li>I would consider this a slightly masculine scent, which makes it intriquing when used for a women&#x27;s fragrance.  </li>

            <li> Not much to say here.</li>
            <li> so a few drops go a long way.</li>

            <li> I like this company, Eden Gardens. This scent I like too but it does seem to bother people with sensitivites. My husband said it smells like dirt, but that it was OK. It does have earthy scent to it.</li>
            <li> Not much to say here.</li>
            <li> Loved it! Made body butter for my MIL for Christmas!</li>

            <li> Mood altering aromatherapy mix. Love it!!</li>
            <li> These oils by Eden&#x27;s Garden are not the least bit inferior to doTerra, Melaleuca, or Young Living. I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM. Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers. We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price. The reason it is a fraction of the price is because it does not have about 3 to 5 levels of compensations for its representatives built into the margins, which drastically reduces the overhead. That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden. From my experience, and countless other essential oil enthusiasts who have also used doTerra, YL, and Melaleuca, there is no difference in quality, purity or smell with Eden’s Garden. If you are one of the 1 - 5% making great money with an MLM, more power to you! But for everyone else, this oil matches up well with the best of them.</li>

            <li> This product was purchased to be added to grapeseed oil for massage.  It smells so lovely, I added a few drops to cotton balls and placed them in a chest of drawers and closet.  I would consider this a slightly masculine scent, which makes it intriquing when used for a women&#x27;s fragrance.  It is a very versatile product.</li>
