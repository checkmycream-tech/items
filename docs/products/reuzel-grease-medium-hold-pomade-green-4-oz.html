            <li>Smells nice</li>
            <li>The smell is really nice as well.</li>
            <li>The scent is great and clean.  </li>
            <li>Love it, smells great with a strong hold.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells so good that when I get to work in the morning, I just want to sit in the car with the heat on so that I can enjoy the scent.</li>
            <li>Awesome pomade, quickly becoming my new go-to.  </li>
            <li>Nice shine and has a nice clean smell as well.  </li>
            <li>Great hold, feels pliable and not sticky in my hair, and even washes out reasonably well for an oil based product.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t explain how much I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love the hold and the feel of my hair and the tin</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t fault the product too much, it is mostly as advertised, but I&#x27;d recommend a wax or else just buy a tub of vaseline and save $12</li>
            <li>and I can smell this stuff for most of the day.</li>
            <li>It is not too greasy and has a nice light shine.</li>
            <li>I find a product I love</li>
            <li>I happen to enjoy the scent of my hair treatment!</li>
            <li>Wish it made hair much more shiny, but that can be remedied by just applying a topcoat of a lighter pomade.</li>
            <li>I love the tin</li>
            <li>and I love my hair for it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely made my hair look the best it&#x27;s ever looked.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite oil based pomade.</li>
            <li>Holds better and is really easy to work into the hair.</li>
            <li>it comes int too - the top screws on to keep your grease secure.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s good as new.</li>
            <li>It is probably too firm/strong for me because I have light brown, fine, &amp;#34;white-boy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Great product for the price and will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li>I felt like I had the most control over my style and throughout the day it would re-comb fresh as when I put it in.  </li>
            <li>However..., they specifically say in description that you get a free comb</li>
            <li>Good hold and goes in hair nice and smooth, but the smell is a little too strong and sweet for me</li>
            <li>The best example of that is that a petroleum pomade will make the floor of the shower slick and this beeswax pomade will not.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m trying many (about 12) different pomades while I try to find my go-to and the Reuzel is at the top of my list so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is probably my new favorite pomade.&lt;br /&gt;-holds strong&lt;br /&gt;-easy to wash out&lt;br /&gt;-holds all day</li>
            <li>/&gt;Spendy, at $15, but worth it.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is worth the hype.</li>
            <li>This product is worth every penny</li>
            <li>and I think that the high beeswax content of Reuzel keeps it holding in the heat much better than a purely petroleum based pomade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Large size container too!</li>
            <li>but that is good because I will just use less and</li>
            <li>Great pomade, and it isn&#x27;t to hard to wash out</li>
            <li>Already bought two cans and just finished the first can</li>
            <li>As a first time user of the product I am blown away with the results.</li>
            <li>And another thing, I&#x27;ve never been able to comb my hair with a pocket comb because no other product was easy enough to manage until I tried this stuff out.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells really good and is smooth and soft - not even the least bit &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and comb into your hair with a hold that will last all day.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Floyd&#x27;s Barber Shop in Colorado Springs for talking me into trying this.</li>
            <li>Really fellas???</li>
            <li>/&gt;Worth every penny, and I&#x27;m a fan of the tin itself, very &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; beat up look and feel.</li>
            <li>I am really liking the scent.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a real pomade.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait until my reuzel pink comes in :)</li>
            <li>This stuff is a different feel more natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used probably a dozen different pomade,water based and wax based and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it for anybody</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly reconmend.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone looking for a new premium pomade.  </li>
            <li>Hold is very natural and not sticky.</li>
            <li>I smell like a 13  year old girl after putting these on!</li>
            <li>It may be a little more pricey that other pomades, but this one is well worth it.</li>
            <li>: smell could be stronger, very little scent or wears off pretty quickly</li>
            <li>Hair stays put but is not stiff.  </li>
            <li>I plan to be a frequent customer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used different pomades that are really sticky and tacky and feel like you have to wash 17 times before it comes out of your hair.  </li>
            <li>love this pomade the red and green are all i use anymore</li>
            <li>I like to use a wod of of it as a base in combo with another pomade, but it should be sufficient for most guys to use on its own.</li>
            <li>, i like a more subtle scent</li>
            <li>I have recently purchased this medium hold Reuzel along with the high sheen pomade........</li>
            <li>The pomades moisturize your scalp and prevents you from throwing actual dandruff (from the cheap gels that dry your skin) and flakes of dried gel that looks just like</li>
            <li>I only gave it 4 stars and not 5 due to the comb not being delivered with it as promised.</li>

            <li> on long hair</li>
            <li> It also isn&#x27;t ever stiff, my hair maintains a soft feel, but def looks &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have used other products which has not given me the same result as Reuzel.</li>
            <li> do yourself a favor and get away from gels that dry and leave flakes.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what you&#x27;d expect from product called Green Grease, I suppose, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again since it&#x27;s just a more expensive version of petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li> Car hair, dog hairs, pollen, lint, mistress hairs,  confetti, loose sequins, glitter, sand,</li>
            <li> recommend it, and you only need little bit ot this stuff to get it in control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I also have tried the red one, the green is stronger in hold, if your wondering.</li>
            <li> Real oil based pomade is not as messy as people seem to think nor is it near as difficult to manage and apply.</li>
            <li> Naturally I have thick hair</li>
            <li> It is somewhat thicker, but it didn&#x27;t fully hold down my hair despite applying to completely dry hair as per instructions.</li>
            <li> You can get a kick-a$$ pomp, executive contour, side-part, or sleek slick back with this grease.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve gotten stickers when purchased from other sources and neither of the two came with order, just FYI.</li>
            <li> Hahahahaa.......for real.......instead of smelling like a tough guy, I now smell like a Big Jolly Rancher with a sheeny head!!</li>
            <li> Bought this after seeing it promoted on youtube videos and a few pomade sites.  </li>
            <li> You do need to get used to not washing it out but rather just rinse your hair and reapply small amount.</li>
            <li> The only other way I review is when it sucks so bad</li>
            <li> Just need a very small amount.  </li>
            <li> For a bunch of hardcore, tough guy,  barber shoppers , one would think that a bunch of Rotterdam Toughies would come up with a tougher smelling pomade!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since it is in a beeswax base, it isn&#x27;t greasy like a petroleum based pomade.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Best... Hair.. Product... EVER!!!!!!! I will never go back to gel again. Thanks to Floyd&#x27;s Barber Shop in Colorado Springs for talking me into trying this. I plan to be a frequent customer. Already bought two cans and just finished the first can and that took almost 4 months! I cannot praise this product enough!</li>
            <li> As a first time user of the product I am blown away with the results. Naturally I have thick hair and I have used other products which has not given me the same result as Reuzel. I would highly recommend it for anybody</li>
            <li> Nice smell great hold</li>
            <li> Awesome pomade, quickly becoming my new go-to.  Great hold, feels pliable and not sticky in my hair, and even washes out reasonably well for an oil based product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the bomb.com. I was using the Paul Mitchell water based before I got this which did nicely.  This stuff is a different feel more natural. Holds better and is really easy to work into the hair. I only gave it 4 stars and not 5 due to the comb not being delivered with it as promised.</li>
            <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve used probably a dozen different pomade,water based and wax based and this is by far my favorite. Great smell and holds great. I work in a factory that at times is 100+ degrees and it holds up awesome. Even when it does fall out of place all I have to do is run my fingers or comb back through my hair and it&#x27;s good as new. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t explain how much I love this stuff. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products, this is the best. Made by the best in the business.</li>
            <li> I have recently purchased this medium hold Reuzel along with the high sheen pomade........and here is the thought. For a bunch of hardcore, tough guy,  barber shoppers , one would think that a bunch of Rotterdam Toughies would come up with a tougher smelling pomade!!! Really fellas????  I smell like a 13  year old girl after putting these on! Hahahahaa.......for real.......instead of smelling like a tough guy, I now smell like a Big Jolly Rancher with a sheeny head!! I love the hold and the feel of my hair and the tin is nice as well. That being said I may just keep trying things out before wanting to try thugging with this goop in!</li>
            <li> Basically just scented vaseline in an attractive container. That&#x27;s what you&#x27;d expect from product called Green Grease, I suppose, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again since it&#x27;s just a more expensive version of petroleum jelly. It is somewhat thicker, but it didn&#x27;t fully hold down my hair despite applying to completely dry hair as per instructions. I can&#x27;t fault the product too much, it is mostly as advertised, but I&#x27;d recommend a wax or else just buy a tub of vaseline and save $12</li>
            <li> update: Works well in the heat- it was 98 degrees this week and I think that the high beeswax content of Reuzel keeps it holding in the heat much better than a purely petroleum based pomade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spendy, at $15, but worth it.  Bought this after seeing it promoted on youtube videos and a few pomade sites.  Seems like there is always a flavor-of-the-month with pomades.  This stuff is worth the hype. Smells mellon-y to me, maybe like an apple/mellon bubble gum. It is probably too firm/strong for me because I have light brown, fine, &amp;#34;white-boy&amp;#34; hair- but that is good because I will just use less and it will last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it is in a beeswax base, it isn&#x27;t greasy like a petroleum based pomade. The best example of that is that a petroleum pomade will make the floor of the shower slick and this beeswax pomade will not. Also, with petroleum pomades, anything airborne will tend to be collected in my hair.  Car hair, dog hairs, pollen, lint, mistress hairs,  confetti, loose sequins, glitter, sand, [that was a helluva party] will somehow find your hair and go for a ride.  The beeswax stuff is ~there~ and it will be obvious that you have pomade in your hair; but if your head touches something it will not leave a greasy mark on a pillow/car headrest/couch in the lapdance room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Even if you don&#x27;t pick this Reuzel- do yourself a favor and get away from gels that dry and leave flakes. The pomades moisturize your scalp and prevents you from throwing actual dandruff (from the cheap gels that dry your skin) and flakes of dried gel that looks just like dandruff.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m trying many (about 12) different pomades while I try to find my go-to and the Reuzel is at the top of my list so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells so good that when I get to work in the morning, I just want to sit in the car with the heat on so that I can enjoy the scent.</li>
            <li> I been using Suavecito and Layrite pomade. This is probably my new favorite pomade.&lt;br /&gt;-holds strong&lt;br /&gt;-easy to wash out&lt;br /&gt;-holds all day&lt;br /&gt;-good on long hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons: smell could be stronger, very little scent or wears off pretty quickly&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it, and you only need little bit ot this stuff to get it in control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have tried the red one, the green is stronger in hold, if your wondering.</li>
            <li> All perfect , but the pomade is dented . Please take care the pomade case</li>
            <li> Good hold and goes in hair nice and smooth, but the smell is a little too strong and sweet for me, i like a more subtle scent and I can smell this stuff for most of the day.</li>
            <li> This is one if the best medium hold petroleum based pomades I have used.  It is now my current go to pomade.  The scent is great and clean.  It is easy to apply and comb into your hair with a hold that will last all day. It is not too greasy and has a nice light shine. I recommend this to anyone looking for a new premium pomade.  Great product for the price and will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. I will buy a heavier hold next time will be the only difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used different pomades that are really sticky and tacky and feel like you have to wash 17 times before it comes out of your hair.  This stuff smells really good and is smooth and soft - not even the least bit &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34;.  I felt like I had the most control over my style and throughout the day it would re-comb fresh as when I put it in.  It also isn&#x27;t ever stiff, my hair maintains a soft feel, but def looks &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I find a product I love I have no problem giving it a rave review.  The only other way I review is when it sucks so bad I feel I have to warn people.  This product is worth every penny and I believe it is the &amp;#34;best pomade in Holland&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny, and I&#x27;m a fan of the tin itself, very &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; beat up look and feel.</li>
            <li> Great product for a pixie cut. Hold is very natural and not sticky. Highly reconmend.</li>
            <li> Best hair product on the market</li>
            <li> I happen to enjoy the scent of my hair treatment! Best pomade ever!!!</li>
            <li> I am really liking the scent. The hold awesome. Wish it made hair much more shiny, but that can be remedied by just applying a topcoat of a lighter pomade. I like to use a wod of of it as a base in combo with another pomade, but it should be sufficient for most guys to use on its own. Good stuff. It may be a little more pricey that other pomades, but this one is well worth it. I love the tin it comes int too - the top screws on to keep your grease secure. This is now my go-to grease for my daily routine. You can get a kick-a$$ pomp, executive contour, side-part, or sleek slick back with this grease. Get some!</li>
            <li> This stuff is really good. Smells nice and it&#x27;s a real pomade. Real oil based pomade is not as messy as people seem to think nor is it near as difficult to manage and apply. You do need to get used to not washing it out but rather just rinse your hair and reapply small amount. I have to say I&#x27;ve used this stuff for a while and I love my hair for it. However..., they specifically say in description that you get a free comb and I&#x27;ve gotten stickers when purchased from other sources and neither of the two came with order, just FYI.</li>
            <li> love this pomade the red and green are all i use anymore</li>
            <li> Great pomade.  Just need a very small amount.  Hair stays put but is not stiff.  Nice shine and has a nice clean smell as well.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Best pomade I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s definitely made my hair look the best it&#x27;s ever looked. The smell is really nice as well. It&#x27;s like a chocolate mint smell. Once you work the pomade in thoroughly and comb it in, the comb just starts gliding through your hair. And another thing, I&#x27;ve never been able to comb my hair with a pocket comb because no other product was easy enough to manage until I tried this stuff out. I can give my self a good looking pomp with just a pocket comb. Can&#x27;t wait until my reuzel pink comes in :)</li>
            <li> Best Pomade money can buy</li>
            <li> Love it, smells great with a strong hold. One of my favorite oil based pomade. Large size container too!</li>
            <li> Great pomade, and it isn&#x27;t to hard to wash out</li>
