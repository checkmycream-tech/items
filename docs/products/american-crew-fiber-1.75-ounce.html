    <ol>
            <li>Perfect for traveling or keeping at another place</li>
            <li>Still looking for the perfect hair product.</li>
            <li>makes it perfect.</li>
            <li>This is a good product, has a good finish to the hair, I hope to continue buying this product.</li>
            <li>Still works great. :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fiber provides the perfect look and feel in my opinion because you really can&#x27;t tell there is any product in your hair if applied sparingly.</li>
            <li>I love love LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I love my hair on this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I needed a smaller container for my gym bag and this is the perfect size.&lt;br /&gt;Holds</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sent is okay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 10 years now, and I love that it holds well (until you sweat ), doesn&#x27;t have a shine and appears to thicken your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its definitely best to rub it between your fingers a little bit to warm it up before applying.</li>
            <li>Love the fiber, but 1.75 ounces goes quick!</li>
            <li>Most importantly the wife likes it.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t have the shiny look of the forming cream.  </li>
            <li>on light (look and smell) but holds all day.</li>
            <li>I have used many products in my hair over the years and have never been completely satisfied until I tried American Crew fiber.</li>
            <li>Great product that works well without looking like you are trying too hard.</li>
            <li>Hubby &#x27;s hair is short on sides, longer on top.</li>
            <li>but I find slightly damp hair and working it between my palms to warm it up</li>
            <li>Thanks for the sale.</li>
            <li>This product worked very well for that.</li>
            <li>Also holds up quite well compared to many other products and does not make your hair like a helmet.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t feel as though it offers much when used in moderation.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I used it right after i get out of the shower and towel dry my hair.</li>
            <li>While it was clearly indicated that it was 1.75 Ounce, at the time of purchase</li>
            <li>Some products make your hair look too greasy or shiny, others make your hair far too unnatural looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would suggest getting a pack containing multiple containers, or go with a higher volume overall</li>
            <li>Also the top layer felt different than the usual stuff, as if it had been frozen during shipping.</li>
            <li>In fact, you do not have to use a lot of this product depending on how much hair you have making it last a long time.</li>
            <li>The tiny size is probablly new and Amazon should have called it out as such to avoid inadvertently tricking buyers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>product was old and dry when received</li>

            <li> product was old and dry when received</li>
            <li> I find that the stuff doesn&#x27;t want to wash out all the way sometimes, so if my hair still feels a little waxy after washing my hair, I just wash it again and use half as much shampoo the second time.</li>
            <li> Be careful this size is half that of the normal ones (3oz hockey puck sized)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think i would ever apply it to dry hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t give you a stiff, dried look and if you don&#x27;t use too much, it won&#x27;t look greasy either.</li>
            <li> I have coarse straight hair (very thick) and this product does not thing but make a mess.</li>
            <li> a little dab of this lasts a long time and goes a long way, he uses this every day and likes it a lot</li>
            <li> Otherwise you can get the thick white clumps in your hair.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves the smell, that it doesn&#x27;t look all clumpy or stiff.</li>
            <li> First, I was disappointed by the size of the container.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells horrible and leaves my hiar clumpy.  </li>

            <li> Great product that works well without looking like you are trying too hard. Also holds up quite well compared to many other products and does not make your hair like a helmet.</li>
            <li> I love love LOVE this stuff. Couldn&#x27;t live without it. Its definitely best to rub it between your fingers a little bit to warm it up before applying. Otherwise you can get the thick white clumps in your hair. I find that the stuff doesn&#x27;t want to wash out all the way sometimes, so if my hair still feels a little waxy after washing my hair, I just wash it again and use half as much shampoo the second time. I actually stopped using conditioner since using this product and have found that my dandruff has lessened as well. Anyway you want to slice it, my hair loves this stuff and I love my hair on this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t give you a stiff, dried look and if you don&#x27;t use too much, it won&#x27;t look greasy either.</li>
            <li> Love the fiber, but 1.75 ounces goes quick! I would suggest getting a pack containing multiple containers, or go with a higher volume overall</li>
            <li> I needed a smaller container for my gym bag and this is the perfect size.&lt;br /&gt;Holds my hair in place while keeping me from looking like I greased my hair down.&lt;br /&gt;Goes on light (look and smell) but holds all day.</li>
            <li> I have used many products in my hair over the years and have never been completely satisfied until I tried American Crew fiber. Some products make your hair look too greasy or shiny, others make your hair far too unnatural looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fiber provides the perfect look and feel in my opinion because you really can&#x27;t tell there is any product in your hair if applied sparingly. In fact, you do not have to use a lot of this product depending on how much hair you have making it last a long time. Overall, I&#x27;ve been hooked on this product for years now and have used nothing else.</li>
            <li> Be careful this size is half that of the normal ones (3oz hockey puck sized) you see in the stores and almost the same price!</li>
            <li> Hubby &#x27;s hair is short on sides, longer on top. a little dab of this lasts a long time and goes a long way, he uses this every day and likes it a lot</li>
            <li> Perfect for traveling or keeping at another place you don&#x27;t go to often.  My boyfriend loves the smell, that it doesn&#x27;t look all clumpy or stiff.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a trail run and didn&#x27;t care for it.  I don&#x27;t like the hold of Fiber, I don&#x27;t feel as though it offers much when used in moderation.  I also didn&#x27;t care for the smell of this product, it had a peculiar odor to it.  Still looking for the perfect hair product.</li>
            <li> product was old and dry when received&lt;br /&gt;did not work for me at all!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t flake, not oily, no shine, holds well (short hair here).  I used it right after i get out of the shower and towel dry my hair. It can be a bit stiff/think to apply but I find slightly damp hair and working it between my palms to warm it up makes it perfect. I don&#x27;t think i would ever apply it to dry hair.</li>
            <li> First, I was disappointed by the size of the container. While it was clearly indicated that it was 1.75 Ounce, at the time of purchase I didn&#x27;t realize this would be smaller than the one you buy in the store. Also the top layer felt different than the usual stuff, as if it had been frozen during shipping. For these two reasons, I will no longer order this product on-line.</li>
            <li> I did not even realize that they made a tiny version of this product. Even looking at the size alone would not help because I just assumed there was only one size avaliable. The tiny size is probablly new and Amazon should have called it out as such to avoid inadvertently tricking buyers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe my situation is ultimatly my fault and I take responsbility for my actions but I am writting this review to help others avoid making the mistake I made.</li>
            <li> I have used American Crew products for a while now, but just switched to using the Fiber.  It is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t have the shiny look of the forming cream.  Most importantly the wife likes it.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, has a good finish to the hair, I hope to continue buying this product. Thanks for the sale.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a smaller version then what you would find in the store, but that is why it&#x27;s a cheaper price. Still works great. :)</li>
            <li> I wanted a hair product that would hold my hair in place but not make it shine like greasy kid stuff. This product worked very well for that. It&#x27;s sent is okay.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells horrible and leaves my hiar clumpy.  I have coarse straight hair (very thick) and this product does not thing but make a mess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 10 years now, and I love that it holds well (until you sweat ), doesn&#x27;t have a shine and appears to thicken your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A must have for short hair, as you can create a style that will hold without getting goopy, sticky, or separated.</li>
