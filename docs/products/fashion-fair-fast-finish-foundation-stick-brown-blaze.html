            <li>The color ordered is the right one but although it gives a natural look it somehow does not do much for &#x27;effect&#x27; and smoother look.</li>
            <li>It is a high quality product.</li>
            <li>Too dry and has much much more red in it.</li>
            <li>I have been using the product over the last two weeks and have discovered this same product is a different color from my last purchase directly from Fashion Fair.</li>

            <li> I have been using this for years and this time, the color is definitely too red and is very dry.  </li>
            <li> For those who are searching for Brown Blaze because FF discontinued it, this is not a replacement, it&#x27;s a knock-off version that is dry and leaves a reddish hue.</li>
            <li> ; dry</li>
            <li> It was all I. expected it to be.  </li>
            <li> Not much at all to worry about.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be a little dry in coverage compared to when I purchased it in stores.</li>

            <li> Happy with product and price..will be ordering from Amazon from now on</li>
            <li> This product is okay, It seems to be a little dry in coverage compared to when I purchased it in stores.</li>
            <li> Very good makeup.  You don&#x27;t have to use much.  Can last you up to 8 months.</li>
            <li> I love Fashion Fair Brown Blaze Finish Stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the Amazon prices.  I will continue to glean from both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bernice E. Carson, Pittsburgh, PA</li>
            <li> Always use fashion fair</li>
            <li> I love the rich color! It is a high quality product.</li>
            <li> I just wish it  came in the souffle.</li>
            <li> This is not the real thing. For those who are searching for Brown Blaze because FF discontinued it, this is not a replacement, it&#x27;s a knock-off version that is dry and leaves a reddish hue. Keep searching because this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> Very convenient, very neat.</li>
            <li> It was all I. expected it to be.  I&#x27;m very please.</li>
            <li> I received the foundation in a timely manner.&lt;br /&gt;The color fit my complexion nicely and it is smooth and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;It has rich reddish-orange undertones that enhance my skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered Brown Blaze and got Bronze instead!</li>
            <li> Have been using Fashion Fair for a number of years and very pleased with it. The color ordered is the right one but although it gives a natural look it somehow does not do much for &#x27;effect&#x27; and smoother look. It is lighter on application. I did note that the label indicates &#x27;fast finish&#x27; and that might be the reason for this. Thanks</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted.  Lovin&#x27; it !  Thanks</li>
            <li> excellent, very happy, cheaper than macys</li>
            <li> Hello fashion fair brown blaze makeup üíÑ is my way of my life üòä it&#x27;s is how I start my morning üïó for my day, I just love ‚ù§ it and there all ways a good sales and good prices at Amazon this is why I shop there your the best üòä Amazon. Thanks</li>
            <li> This item was  very much to my satisfaction. I had purchased my Fashion Fsir makeup from department stores for a very long time  until I found it on the amazon site for a great price . I am so happy !!</li>
            <li> I love this product and the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I love the product.  I ordered it before, I don&#x27;t know what was different but the product&lt;br /&gt;was different.  It was so much better.  I will be ordering again when I get paid again.&lt;br /&gt;Your serve was also great. Thanks for asking me.  Keep up the good work both of you.</li>
            <li> Fashion fair foundation was exactly as described.  Fast shipping.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> I love this concealer</li>
            <li> Received product in at timely fashion and it was a great price.  It was &amp;#34;a little&amp;#34; dry but I didn&#x27;t even notice until I read one reviewers post.  Not much at all to worry about.  I am very happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE** I have been using the product over the last two weeks and have discovered this same product is a different color from my last purchase directly from Fashion Fair. I have been using this for years and this time, the color is definitely too red and is very dry.  This time I purchased it from this company because Fashion Fair no longer has it on their website.  Great cost, but  just doesn&#x27;t feel like the actual fashion fair product (could be old?)  I will not purchase again tho.  Good cost, but it&#x27;s just not the same (or even close to it).  Too dry and has much much more red in it.</li>
