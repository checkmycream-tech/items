    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>and it was wonderful</li>
            <li>BEST EQUIPMENT</li>
            <li>My Dentist recommended this toothbrush series and it is the best.</li>
            <li>the best I&#x27;ve ever used......</li>
            <li>If you have braces or are getting &amp;#34;long in the tooth&amp;#34; the tip brush is perfect.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The best electric brush for myself.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Rotodent is still an excellent product for my teeth.</li>
            <li>VERY UPSET!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>The design itself is very good.</li>
            <li>Brilliant machine  </li>
            <li>GREAT about honoring warranty and replacing malfunctioned items in my experience.</li>
            <li>I purchased a Braun Oral-B toothbrush which is great.</li>
            <li>although it looks like they die quicker than they should, the customer service was great in my book.</li>
            <li>Rotadent stole the great design of the Sonicare but didn&#x27;t bother to use a lithium ion battery like the Sonicare that has no memory effect.  </li>
            <li>For the money though, it should have lithium batteries or an intelligent charger</li>
            <li>who&#x27;s effectiveness seemed greatly reduced after just a couple months use.  </li>
            <li>Did a great job, while it lasted.  </li>
            <li>Great customer service and well made.</li>
            <li>I think that it does a great job cleaning your teeth.</li>
            <li>I am sticking with Rotadent for now because it is great for people with braces.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is used by both my husband and myself, and does a great cleaning job.</li>
            <li>and they were great.  </li>
            <li>Great tooth brush.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of cleaning your teeth without damaging your gums but it&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product, with one exception.  </li>
            <li>I think the produce design is great</li>
            <li>I think it does a better job than Sonicare or Oral-B, even their best</li>
            <li>PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT AT YOUR OWN PERIL!</li>
            <li>Than dental Inc with a good rating was in words helpful, and that was it after returning it they promised to replace it.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s start with the good.</li>
            <li>and yes, I have had good oral health since using it.</li>
            <li>The concept and design are good.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s where the good part stops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will admit that this is a good product in terms of how well it works... when it does work.</li>
            <li>I loved the toothbrush however, it does not hold the charge up to 2 weeks as the package says...</li>
            <li>However good Rotadent was - they are no longer.  </li>
            <li>However, inspection of the warranty conditions reveals a surprisingly hefty \\&quot;exchange fee\\&quot; for a defective toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Loved the toothbrush when it worked, but quit after 5 months.  </li>
            <li>but this is a good thing.</li>
            <li>If you purchase a Rotadent there is a good chance</li>
            <li>But as it is, I am looking for a good durable toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The original Rodadent had a lifetime warranty and excellent customer service.</li>
            <li>/&gt;TL;DR -- Great toothbrush, but messes up very easily.  </li>
            <li>I said, I would never pay $160 for this toothbrush again, but I have been very pleased that they have honored the lifetime warranty they advertise on the box.  </li>
            <li>did not like the plus brush,, but most certainly am happy with the service received from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Better materials and/or design in this one area would make it a great product.  </li>
            <li>I took very good care of the unit because the cost factor is significant .</li>
            <li>I love the way it brushes!</li>
            <li>it is even better than this one!</li>
            <li>Love the charger!</li>
            <li>The brush itself was amazing - my teeth got whiter by the day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve liked dealing with Amazon and this item came from another supplier who sold thru Amazon.  </li>
            <li>After charging this product it began to turn on and off on its own.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is extremely effective for plaque removal and gum disease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Who stays in business with that kind of response?</li>
            <li>I tried it and really liked it</li>
            <li>I had an original Rotadent and it was a great toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Leaves your mouth with a great clean feeling&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>This is the best toothbrush for my teeth and sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>I DON&#x27;T THINK THAT THIS ROTODENT IS AS GOOD AS MY ORIGINAL ,</li>
            <li>It came with a special brush for orthodontics, so I thought we were good to go.  </li>
            <li>Also, I want to mention that I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Inspired by this, I bought Rotadent Plus for my daughter and a 3 more as gifts for my friends.</li>
            <li>And I paid my dentist for his lovely handiwork.  </li>
            <li>Then to top that, the toothbrush stopped charging for some reason.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE that the Rotadent system helps me improve my gingivitis</li>
            <li>I have been using Rotadent products for more than 10 years.  </li>
            <li>LOVE THIS UPDATED MODEL.</li>
            <li>the Zila company that makes this product: Please, build a better product.</li>
            <li>and I cannot find any tool that cleans my teeth and mouth while leaving my gums healthy like this does.</li>
            <li>Zila has been incredibley helpful and has replaced the unit more than six times.</li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>As many others mentioned, this toothbrush should come with a &#x27;buyer beware&#x27;</li>
            <li>understand that many dental offices are no longer selling the product because it is so unreliable.</li>
            <li>When the toothbrush is operating properly, it works great, but if you have any issues at all, good luck trying to get a competent person from Zila to handle a repair, because it just does not happen.  </li>
            <li>Now it seems that the Rotadent does a better job of cleaning, but takes longer.  </li>
            <li>Rotadent showed noticeably better cleaning at my dental check-ups than sonicare.</li>
            <li>it felt better for me.</li>
            <li>This is the most Customer UNFRIENDLY company I have ever seen.</li>
            <li>Now granted, my Sonicare gave out after more than a year and now is refusing to charge, but this thing is refusing to turn on regardless of being able to charge, after just ONE MONTH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And, I&#x27;ve never had the Nimbus stop working for any reason. :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>SO SURE THAT I WOULD RECOMMEND IT .</li>
            <li>The 3000 is a much better product.</li>
            <li>They said that they did not send receipts but assured me that they keep excellent records and that it was not necessary.  </li>
            <li>It takes more space on the countertop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had a braun before and it is 100 tmes better.  </li>
            <li>I brought the issue to my dentist, who mentioned, after the fact, that many of his clients had complaints with the brush not charging at all.</li>
            <li>have had this for 1 year to the day; I have used it every day with no problems, but now it keeps turning on by itself and will not turn off most of the time.</li>
            <li>My gums seem to be getting better.</li>
            <li>but after just 2 weeks it wouldn&#x27;t work any more.  </li>
            <li>It would have a more pleasing appearance on the counter top.</li>
            <li>It appears Amazon will let any vendor use their site for sales even if they do not offer appropriate customer service.</li>
            <li>Many dentists push this brush on their patients because they get a sizable kickback, and not because this is a better brush.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ll try to hit you up you for more money as if the defective design is your fault.</li>
            <li>Much better than oral B&#x27;s sonic or sonicare.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it cleans</li>
            <li>I am sure there are better choices.</li>
            <li>Your teeth feel very clean when you are done and even better if you use the pro dentec toothpaste gel with the rotadent.</li>
            <li>I believed since it was so highly recommended by Dentists that it would be a great product.</li>
            <li>Luckily, my dentist is awesome and took care of the replacement for me through the salesman he deals with directly.  </li>
            <li>I will admit I loved my Rotadent for the first month.  </li>
            <li>Just doesn&#x27;t live up to being a great product.</li>
            <li>It has been great, but I upgraded to the new plus</li>
            <li>It does a good job,  my present dentist said that if everyone did as good a job as I did on my teeth he would be out of business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve made a huge profit on this electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>The brush heads were really soft, which is great, but they&#x27;re 15 bucks and crack until they fall off while you&#x27;re brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I suggest you strongly consider one of the many alternatives available.</li>
            <li>At first I loved this toothbrush and how clean my mouth and teeth felt after using it.  </li>
            <li>Due to gum problems after treatment for oral cancer, the Rotadent brush is the best solution for my oral care.  </li>
            <li>it actually works, it&#x27;s pretty good, great even.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush regarding its capability to clean.</li>
            <li>I had a Braun before this and the Rota Dent doesn&#x27;t clean any better despite the platinum price.  </li>
            <li>The Oral B is still going strong at 8 years.  </li>
            <li>It does not hold a full charge for more than a couple of days.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d send this in for warranty repair, but I&#x27;m guessing I will get the runaround because I did not purchase this from the dentist, and there&#x27;s probably some fine print saying the brush heads aren&#x27;t covered.  </li>
            <li>There is a huge defect and the handle needs re-engineered in order to make the switch waterproof.</li>
            <li>and she is sending a replacement handle free</li>
            <li>and now it no longer spins smoothly -</li>
            <li>If I am in a hurry, I still enjoy using my Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>and they wouldn&#x27;t replace the motor, but gave me two free brush heads.</li>
            <li>I do enjoy the way my teeth feel after using this product but considering the design flaws, I would not advise buying it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, it is cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Each Rotadent® Plus power handle and charger unit is warranted to be free from defects in material and workmanship.</li>
            <li>This Rota Dent Plus is a great step up from the regular Rota Dent toothbrush model.  </li>
            <li>It shows that it&#x27;s charging (the light comes on)</li>
            <li>Long term results are yet to be determined, but hopefully it will be successful in keeping my gums healthy.</li>
            <li>but it really does leave my mouth feeling significantly more healthy</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the new rotadent toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I had purchased the original rotadent many years ago, and it finally was no longer working, so I purcased a rotadent Plus toothbrush, and am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>The battery is great and the motor is very powerful yet not loud.</li>
            <li>I had the original Rota-dent for 10+ yrs</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>I am also told that the original lasts longer than the Zila version.</li>
            <li>I registered it online when I purchased it from my dentist, who no longer sells Rotadent and I now understand why, and even have my original receipt and the printout when when I did register it.  </li>
            <li>WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT , MORE THAN 10 YEARS AGO .</li>
            <li>The first series was Nicad which were ok but not so convenient since you couldn&#x27;t leave it on the charger like the competition.</li>
            <li>As so many others have stated, I bought my first Rotodent from my dentist in the &#x27;90&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>At first, I love this brush.</li>
            <li>Unlike the original Rotadent, you can&#x27;t clean the electrical contact yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t work right, the top part comes off of the stem because it doesn&#x27;t fit right.</li>
            <li>My orthodontist commented on how clean my teeth were.</li>
            <li>Afterwards, my teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li>the item arrived quickly and in apparent good condition.  </li>
            <li>I first received the Rotadent Rota Dent PLUS model from my dentist and it worked perfectly for about two and half months, but then the plastic on toothbrush heads broke which prevented me from using the brush heads.  </li>
            <li>spinning microfiber brush head really does seem to do an exceptional job on my teeth and gums, but you have to use it gently.</li>
            <li>Nimbus makes the finest manual brush money can buy, and with proper technique should do as good a job as the Rotodent.</li>
            <li>actually its just good for one use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true, if you don&#x27;t buy from a dentist</li>
            <li>Just hold the brush at an angle to your gums, then flat to get a good clean.</li>
            <li>The first was fine for about 2 years - then it stopped working.</li>
            <li>The first time it was fine for a year, then as soon as the warranty was up, so was its life span.  </li>
            <li>I like it better than the Classic because the brushes are softer and it has 3 speeds</li>
            <li>and the company quickly replaced them.  </li>
            <li>Overall, though, this is a great toothbrush -- sturdy, gentle on teeth and gums, holds charge well.</li>
            <li>Lucky if it lasts 6 months.</li>
            <li>Their product if it would work would be excellent but it seems that after a short period of time using the motor stops working and it would start again until finally would stop.</li>
            <li>and I guess the older model is ok</li>
            <li>Okay, but would have preferred to charge it with a detachable charging cord (as the older models).</li>
            <li>It seems to be doing a super job on my teeth.</li>
            <li>I would say the new design is more desirable because you do not need to pull the power plug from the toothbrush to get it to start it.</li>
            <li>REALLY WORKS!!  </li>
            <li>It just vibrates a little bit to sound good</li>
            <li>This is probally the most convienient and soft way to remove plaque.</li>
            <li>Let the battery charge a full 24 hours before using the first time.</li>
            <li>After a considerable period of waiting, I was able to leave a message.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;He said it is the only kind he will use.</li>
            <li>The old Rotodent&#x27;s worked better</li>
            <li>and his response was \\&quot;Have fun with that.\\</li>
            <li>Yes, I have two power toothbrushes by my sink, and I use them several times a day, and love the clean feeling after brushing.</li>
            <li>went back to using the manual toothbrush and at my next dental appointment received a brand new Rotadent Rota Dent PLUS toothbrush and again it worked perfectly</li>
            <li>The power handle is warranted for so long as you own it and operate it according to instructions.</li>
            <li>The rotadent classic or plus is great for helping to keep the staining down from coffee and tea.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t fit the new model.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really use the multiple speeds, but the rest of the features are nice.  </li>
            <li>These are very gentle toothbrushes - which is what you want.</li>
            <li>After the first one malfunctioned, I called the customer service line and got ZERO satisfaction.  </li>
            <li>I got my first Rotadent through my dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>The brushes are junk,they broke the first time I used  them,again giving to the needy people,I called the factory and they  (customer service)informed me that I bought the item on line and not from a dentist so there for</li>
            <li>But it is actually cleaning your teeth much better than anything else on the market.  </li>
            <li>The most recent model I bought (this Plus model) lasted about 6 months</li>
            <li>I bought my first rota-dent plus from my dentist.</li>
            <li>Be aware of this scam..</li>
            <li>I was cautiously optimistic that this one would be of a higher quality but guess what?</li>
            <li>The first two I purchases didn&#x27;t work at all and had to be returned before this one broke after 6 months.</li>
            <li>The first three times (before the Plus) was a power issue.</li>
            <li>recommended by my dentist (At considerably higher cost in his surgery).  </li>
            <li>It is a bit noisy and vibrates a bit, but still, small &amp;#34;issues&amp;#34; on an overall excellent products</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than the last one I had.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>Being in sales and customer service for many years myself this company is will be what I use as an example of how NOT to do business to my future employees.</li>
            <li>if I will purchase a replacement and hope it doesnt have the same battery issue... if I do... Will be sure to purchase from website where its under warranty</li>
            <li>Just like my first one, after 3 months, it doesn&#x27;t rotate anymore.</li>
            <li>The first one died of tropical humidity, so I don&#x27;t blame the company.</li>
            <li>most recent two</li>
            <li>I contacted Zila and they are supporting this.</li>
            <li>So in the end they are likely MAKING more money off me each time I&#x27;ll get a replacement.  </li>
            <li>When I first got it it lasted for over a week</li>
            <li>First it would not turn off.  </li>
            <li>After two weeks&#x27; use, the battery can not last more than a day.</li>
            <li>It comes with a lifetime warranty, so when the first one died in 6 months I called the company</li>
            <li>Looking for a good one to replace the one I have that has gone dead after just a couple of months.</li>
            <li>Great product but binds up easily when brushing back teeth have to take it out cycle thru next two speeds to turn off then back on and during one brushing have had it bind up (stop)</li>
            <li>I honestly could care less about how amazing the Rotadent is when the Rotadent lasts about 1/10th as long as either of their competitors, for 1.5x the price.</li>
            <li>But thanks to amazon they made it right in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li>First, the positive aspects.</li>
            <li>The nickel metal hydride battery in the new Rotadent is better than the old Nickel Cadmium battery, but not by much.  </li>
            <li>It is a great product OTHER THAN the fact that it seems to mess up easily.  </li>
            <li>I love the product and it works very well as a toothbrush, but I have yet to have one last longer than six months without malfunctioning.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised when my older model was no longer available.  </li>
            <li>I would strongly advise that you purchase a different product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had an OralB Triumph for several years and it is still going strong.  </li>
            <li>The $35 dollar shipping charge was pure stealing</li>
            <li>And then.... Expect to pay $18 shipping for each new unit that will arrive in 5 days!!</li>
            <li>(I keep one at work and one at home) are still working, but one developed the same kind of switch problem after normal use (I never used it in the shower).</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to replace the entire thing for a new one with my dentist, bc</li>
            <li>This new model is nice but is completely unadaptable to prior models so you can not interuse at all.</li>
            <li>On the Oral B, the brush head is soft (just like the original Rotadent) and there is not hard core.  </li>
            <li>I love the way my teeth feels after using this toothbrush, but it no longer seems worth the frustration of having to replace the toothbrush every few months.</li>
            <li>In fact, professional testing and reviews show that the brush does not perform well and has battery problems--they use old battery technology, really cheap stuff from China.  </li>
            <li>As my dentist explained it, you would not use an electric sander when polishing your car; you would use a gentle buffer.  </li>
            <li>If that is what you are used to, then the Rotadent will seem like it is not doing much.</li>
            <li>I suggest registering because some times the replacement heads are defective and that is the only way to get a free replacement.</li>
            <li>I will also point out that there is no real discount or better price for these online.</li>
            <li>but now I&#x27;m having the same problem with the cheap plastic brush heads....</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m having so much problem with a freakin toothbrush!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>KEEPS THE TEETH AND GUM LINE HEALTHY AND PINK.  </li>
            <li>Automatic charging when it&#x27;s docked is a real plus.  </li>
            <li>It really takes off the plaque.  </li>
            <li>YOU are the one responsible for footing the bill for shipping and handling fees.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately for me, this has not been a constant issue, but it is annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t care, because I just wanted my brush to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really like it when it was working</li>
            <li>It is gentle, yet cleans thoroughly</li>
            <li>Running your tongue along the back teeth after a thorough brushing feels almost as smooth as just coming from a dental cleaning.</li>
            <li>Amazon was very diligent in refunding me after I returned the article</li>
            <li>So, this is very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t even really given the choice - the dentist handed me this system and said I needed to use this to repair my gums and I was too...</li>
            <li>The only good thing about this toothbrush is the brush heads are much softer than other brands.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I loved the Rotadent classic but for a product which is supposed to perform better than the old model it fails.</li>
            <li>I bought the original Rotodent from my former dentist and it lasted 10 years.  </li>
            <li>The first 3 were the standard rotadent models but the most recent was the Rotadent</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B003UKKHB4 Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + Gum Care Precision 3000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush 1 Count]], for half the price of a new Rotadent, and</li>
            <li>fear that a real reliable decent  </li>
            <li>I simply don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews as I&#x27;ve had such a wonderful experience with my Rotadent Plus toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The Rotadent did do a much better job at cleaning below the gum line with the sweep bristle head (which is why I bought it), but not worth buying again if most only last 6 - 9 months.  </li>
            <li>I really like the settings on the new model (which can be adjusted for gum sensitivity).  </li>
            <li>This new rotodent does not rotate nearly as fast as the one I bought 7 years ago.</li>
            <li>assuming the outlet is ok, the battery may recover if you leave it charging for about 24hrs or slightly longer.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing the older model, which my mother has and has NEVER HAD A</li>
            <li>SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY THE OLDER MODEL....</li>
            <li>I bought this as a replacement for an older model.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased three Rota Dent brushes - two of the older model and one of these Plus models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first 3 were the first model, this last was the Plus.  </li>
            <li>The most difficult thing is that I love the toothbrush</li>
            <li>I used the original product for many years and always felt the battery was weak.  </li>
            <li>I would have discarded it earlier, but I paid $150 for it and it was doing an adequate job, barely.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used the rotadent classic for over 8 years.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will be ordering the Rota Dent brush older model (which I have used for years) from you, after the holiday season is over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I must say there is a decent defect rate.</li>
            <li>I searching for an older model but never this one....</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend toothbrush, this but buy from a dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>This product was highly recommended by my dentist.  </li>
            <li>The Rotadent unit was highly recommended by my dentist, so I paid her $130 for the unit.  </li>
            <li>a new rotadent will let me see less of him:)  </li>
            <li>so I bought a new (Classic) one.</li>
            <li>Also, I cannot use my older model toothbrush heads on the new model.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect storm--a badly designed product sold by a a non-supportive</li>
            <li>so I can use the ultra gentle speed when my teeth feel sensitive.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve occasionally experienced weird behavior where it stops running and won&#x27;t restart without returning it to the charger.</li>
            <li>It has come to it not being worth it financially.</li>
            <li>, I just brush normally, three times a day, in front of a mirror.  </li>
            <li>and they took my address and said they would send another in 7-10 days, one month later I still did not have it, called again and they were really nice and said they would send it overnight, got it the next day, only problem it died in two months.</li>
            <li>so save money and buy online because you pay a lot more for the &#x27;lifetime&#x27; guarantee, and you don&#x27;t know how long it will last anyway....</li>
            <li>This low-quality product is costing me more and more money, and I&#x27;m curious to see how long would the third one keep functioning properly.</li>
            <li>At the end of a five minute conversation, she got some information from me and said I would have a new Rotadent Plus in the mail in 4-5 business days.  </li>
            <li>However, I registered my new one with the name of my dentist (who sells them) and had no problem getting the warranty.</li>
            <li>I attempted to return the product to the seller, Snafuaru2, who informed me \\&quot;you purchased a new toothbrush and that is what you received\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Then I got a new one(free of charge) via the warrantee.</li>
            <li>Like the new design otherwise.  </li>
            <li>The box was in new condition.  </li>
            <li>Within 3 months it broke and I was sent a new toothbrush through the Dentist office.</li>
            <li>Within 4 months the new Rotadent stopped working.</li>
            <li>Like the new stand that keeps it always charged.</li>
            <li>and I like the new features it has.</li>
            <li>I did not like he new rota dent Plus,  as it did not work well with a converter as stated in the instruction</li>
            <li>New Info:</li>
            <li>You can keep buying new brush heads at $30 a pop, but they will keep breaking.  </li>
            <li>For all I know, the new battery lasts a decade.  </li>
            <li>I had to get a new one</li>
            <li>A new product is a new product, regardless where it is purchased.  </li>
            <li>Initally, I thought the battery died or some sort, but after switching to a new head, it worked again.</li>
            <li>and I should return it to manufacturer to receive a new rotadent.</li>
            <li>and they sent me a new one.</li>
            <li>I bought the Classic version and it never died, it just got old looking</li>
            <li>The moral of the story is not to trust a product that does not compete in an open market and is sold primarily by dentists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>had the classic model 3 years-trouble with brushes coming off no lock-slow operation-lousy charger system-new brush heads frequently faulty-on/off</li>
            <li>This is how my dentist told me to use it and it does work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not yet comfortable using this as my only toothbrush - so it is adding extra time to routine -</li>
            <li>I bought it there, but the new one did the exact same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one comes with a power supply that will only work in countries with 110 volt systems, making this product much less useful and friendly to me.  </li>
            <li>This is pretty much standard procedures for all rechargeable batteries (including laptop computers).  </li>
            <li>The first one lasted close to ten years.</li>
            <li>I bought this toothbrush through my periodontist about 2 months ago, who said the bristles were softer than the Sonicare I usually use and would be better for my gums.  </li>
            <li>The brush heads only lasted about 1.5weeks of consistent use.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s various phases first.</li>
            <li>But after few days you love it, it cleans really well, has briefs stops every 30 seconds to help as a reminder to go to the next section of teeth, and was quite powerful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My teeth do not feel even half as clean with this model vs. the classic.  </li>
            <li>, they STRONGLY recommend you drain the battery to dead about 3 or 4 times a year and then recharge for 24 hours.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I had one brush head left before my next appointment.  </li>
            <li>I carefully dried it out and now it seems to work fine.</li>
            <li>This new brush is sluggish and since I still have an older brush, the difference is very obvious between the two.  </li>
            <li>but there are clearly problems with the manufacture.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even have to send the old one in.  </li>
            <li>This is the closest thing you can get to a professional cleaning at your dentist.</li>
            <li>The green light indicated that it was charging but when I tried to using it, it didn&#x27;t turn on.  </li>
            <li>IT WAS COMPLETELY DEAD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money here.</li>
            <li>I have an old Rotadent-</li>
            <li>You might as well use the old Rotadent</li>
            <li>, they refused stating they were to busy to call</li>
            <li>I have an old model Rotodent that has worked well.  </li>
            <li>I sent direct to Rotadent and they have not replaced</li>
            <li>the brush heads were soft.</li>
            <li>It will completely just stop working</li>
            <li>I have used the Rotadent for 10 years because of the soft brush heads.  </li>
            <li>My old one lasted 10+ years</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B003UKKHB4 Oral-B Professional Care 3000 Electric Toothbrush, 1 Count]] and also bought the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>B00006ANDK Oral-B Sensitive (3 Extra-Soft Brush heads)]] brushes.</li>
            <li>They told me to keep plugged in at all times except when doing this complete discharge.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>This is not a company that supports its customers as far as I can see.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame, because the cleaning action of the Rotadent is unsurpassed.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know if the battery issues were fixed or not, because I burned through a half-dozen brush heads before I gave up.  </li>
            <li>I really have only used this for about a week.</li>
            <li>routine so far</li>
            <li>brush teeth with either soft brush and tooth paste or my oral b and toothpaste... use rotadent with the fluoride rinse... rinse mouth with leftover</li>
            <li>I do make a conscious effort not to apply any pressure when brushing for this reason.  </li>
            <li>It has a very defective battery design and you&#x27;ll likely need to replace it before you even get 6 months to a year&#x27;s usage out of it.</li>
            <li>I used to use sonicare complete.</li>
            <li>WARRENTY!&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, do not waste your money on this.</li>
            <li>and if you have sensitive gums like I do, it is the toothbrush for you.  </li>
            <li>So far no problems at all</li>
            <li>I had the OLD model with a rocker switch for 15 yrs</li>
            <li>The concept is that it is better for those with receding gums because of the soft bristles and slow speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just ordered a good old German engineered top-of-the line Braun at less than half the price.  </li>
            <li>While it worked, it did clean my teeth well, but it died after a few months of use.  </li>
            <li>My advise to those with gum disease is a normal soft bristle brush, twice daily flossing, and frequent professional cleanings (my pockets have gone from 4-5mms with the Rotadent to 2-4mms with a basic toothbrush).  </li>
            <li>Found it a bit rough at first.</li>
            <li>i love these brushes, but they don&#x27;t last very long, the last one, which was a replacement for my first one, only lasted 3 months, the one before that a little over a year...</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s fair, especially when the reason I&#x27;m replacing it is because the product itself is just poorly made and breaks down once a month.  </li>
            <li>I needed a new one and my current dentist does not sell this toothbrush</li>
            <li>This means calling them up about every month when it breaks, getting a new one, and calling up the next month.</li>
            <li>I bought a new Rotadent in 2013 and noticed that the brush heads have been changed to a different material.  </li>
            <li>Essentially, you are almost paying for a new power handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, that is what he has, but he said that almost everyone he talks to that uses the new on has the same problem, it dies in two months.</li>
            <li>In fact, I actually had to get a second deep cleaning less than 12 months after I started using it (mostly 4-5 mm pockets).  </li>
            <li>My dentist recommended changing to Oral B professional with extra soft head.  </li>
            <li>I use the short pointy bit to get the backs of my teeth that the flat head can&#x27;t get easily, as well as up and down the backs of my front teeth.   </li>
            <li>This thing cleans like no other electric toothbrush I have had.  </li>
            <li>Two months later, the two month old brush head died again!</li>
            <li>This new one does away with any direct metal connection that can rust out due to all the water a toothbrush is near.</li>
            <li>It has a sensitive mode and also a red light that tells you when you are pressing too hard.</li>
            <li>/whatever is just cheaply made and SUCKS.  </li>
            <li>I initially bought this from my dentist&#x27;s office as he recommended it to me for my extremely sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>Their warranty only covers units purchased from a dental office or directly from the Zila website.  </li>
            <li>The second unit broke in about a month and the dental office asked me to return directly to the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>Went back to my Oral B that was 5 years old when I bought the Rotadent.  </li>
            <li>Alas, you can&#x27;t buy it any more.</li>
            <li>Do your own homework or you&#x27;ll be sorry.</li>
            <li>I also just bought the new Rotadent Plus (my 3rd brush) to leave at a home I travel to several weeks a year.  </li>
            <li>The new one is starting to have the same problems.  </li>
            <li>Not to mention that those other brands are much louder.  </li>
            <li>I am experiencing the same issue that others are having - the power switch no longer functions and the toothbrush turns on and off on its own at random intervals.</li>
            <li>The motor is weak, battery charge doesn&#x27;t last and the second the brush lightly touches the surface of my teeth, the brush head stops spinning!</li>
            <li>I have read that the new Zila rodadent Plus will not last that long.</li>
            <li>At least they have an adequate return policy when something breaks, then they have to deal with the manufacturer, not you.</li>
            <li>I loved the earlier versions of Rotadent and am very sorry to see the changes.  </li>
            <li>Constantly replacing brushes gets very expensive when brushes are a good $15 each.</li>
            <li>The new one turned out to be much worse: after only two weeks, the battery could last only one day after a full charge, so now I have to charge it every day.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> and it was wonderful</li>
            <li> BEST EQUIPMENT</li>
            <li> My Dentist recommended this toothbrush series and it is the best.</li>
            <li> the best I&#x27;ve ever used......</li>
            <li> If you have braces or are getting &amp;#34;long in the tooth&amp;#34; the tip brush is perfect.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The best electric brush for myself.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Rotodent is still an excellent product for my teeth.</li>
            <li> VERY UPSET!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The design itself is very good.</li>
            <li> Brilliant machine  </li>
            <li> GREAT about honoring warranty and replacing malfunctioned items in my experience.</li>
            <li> I purchased a Braun Oral-B toothbrush which is great.</li>
            <li> although it looks like they die quicker than they should, the customer service was great in my book.</li>
            <li> Rotadent stole the great design of the Sonicare but didn&#x27;t bother to use a lithium ion battery like the Sonicare that has no memory effect.  </li>
            <li> For the money though, it should have lithium batteries or an intelligent charger</li>
            <li> who&#x27;s effectiveness seemed greatly reduced after just a couple months use.  </li>
            <li> Did a great job, while it lasted.  </li>
            <li> Great customer service and well made.</li>
            <li> I think that it does a great job cleaning your teeth.</li>
            <li> I am sticking with Rotadent for now because it is great for people with braces.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is used by both my husband and myself, and does a great cleaning job.</li>
            <li> and they were great.  </li>
            <li> Great tooth brush.</li>
            <li> It does a great job of cleaning your teeth without damaging your gums but it&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, with one exception.  </li>
            <li> I think the produce design is great</li>
            <li> I think it does a better job than Sonicare or Oral-B, even their best</li>
            <li> PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT AT YOUR OWN PERIL!</li>
            <li> Than dental Inc with a good rating was in words helpful, and that was it after returning it they promised to replace it.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start with the good.</li>
            <li> and yes, I have had good oral health since using it.</li>
            <li> The concept and design are good.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s where the good part stops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will admit that this is a good product in terms of how well it works... when it does work.</li>
            <li> I loved the toothbrush however, it does not hold the charge up to 2 weeks as the package says...</li>
            <li> However good Rotadent was - they are no longer.  </li>
            <li> However, inspection of the warranty conditions reveals a surprisingly hefty \\&quot;exchange fee\\&quot; for a defective toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Loved the toothbrush when it worked, but quit after 5 months.  </li>
            <li> but this is a good thing.</li>
            <li> If you purchase a Rotadent there is a good chance</li>
            <li> But as it is, I am looking for a good durable toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The original Rodadent had a lifetime warranty and excellent customer service.</li>
            <li> /&gt;TL;DR -- Great toothbrush, but messes up very easily.  </li>
            <li> I said, I would never pay $160 for this toothbrush again, but I have been very pleased that they have honored the lifetime warranty they advertise on the box.  </li>
            <li> did not like the plus brush,, but most certainly am happy with the service received from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Better materials and/or design in this one area would make it a great product.  </li>
            <li> I took very good care of the unit because the cost factor is significant .</li>
            <li> I love the way it brushes!</li>
            <li> it is even better than this one!</li>
            <li> Love the charger!</li>
            <li> The brush itself was amazing - my teeth got whiter by the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve liked dealing with Amazon and this item came from another supplier who sold thru Amazon.  </li>
            <li> After charging this product it began to turn on and off on its own.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is extremely effective for plaque removal and gum disease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Who stays in business with that kind of response?</li>
            <li> I tried it and really liked it</li>
            <li> I had an original Rotadent and it was a great toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Leaves your mouth with a great clean feeling&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> This is the best toothbrush for my teeth and sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> I DON&#x27;T THINK THAT THIS ROTODENT IS AS GOOD AS MY ORIGINAL ,</li>
            <li> It came with a special brush for orthodontics, so I thought we were good to go.  </li>
            <li> Also, I want to mention that I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Inspired by this, I bought Rotadent Plus for my daughter and a 3 more as gifts for my friends.</li>
            <li> And I paid my dentist for his lovely handiwork.  </li>
            <li> Then to top that, the toothbrush stopped charging for some reason.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE that the Rotadent system helps me improve my gingivitis</li>
            <li> I have been using Rotadent products for more than 10 years.  </li>
            <li> LOVE THIS UPDATED MODEL.</li>
            <li> the Zila company that makes this product: Please, build a better product.</li>
            <li> and I cannot find any tool that cleans my teeth and mouth while leaving my gums healthy like this does.</li>
            <li> Zila has been incredibley helpful and has replaced the unit more than six times.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> As many others mentioned, this toothbrush should come with a &#x27;buyer beware&#x27;</li>
            <li> understand that many dental offices are no longer selling the product because it is so unreliable.</li>
            <li> When the toothbrush is operating properly, it works great, but if you have any issues at all, good luck trying to get a competent person from Zila to handle a repair, because it just does not happen.  </li>
            <li> Now it seems that the Rotadent does a better job of cleaning, but takes longer.  </li>
            <li> Rotadent showed noticeably better cleaning at my dental check-ups than sonicare.</li>
            <li> it felt better for me.</li>
            <li> This is the most Customer UNFRIENDLY company I have ever seen.</li>
            <li> Now granted, my Sonicare gave out after more than a year and now is refusing to charge, but this thing is refusing to turn on regardless of being able to charge, after just ONE MONTH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And, I&#x27;ve never had the Nimbus stop working for any reason. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> SO SURE THAT I WOULD RECOMMEND IT .</li>
            <li> The 3000 is a much better product.</li>
            <li> They said that they did not send receipts but assured me that they keep excellent records and that it was not necessary.  </li>
            <li> It takes more space on the countertop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a braun before and it is 100 tmes better.  </li>
            <li> I brought the issue to my dentist, who mentioned, after the fact, that many of his clients had complaints with the brush not charging at all.</li>
            <li> have had this for 1 year to the day; I have used it every day with no problems, but now it keeps turning on by itself and will not turn off most of the time.</li>
            <li> My gums seem to be getting better.</li>
            <li> but after just 2 weeks it wouldn&#x27;t work any more.  </li>
            <li> It would have a more pleasing appearance on the counter top.</li>
            <li> It appears Amazon will let any vendor use their site for sales even if they do not offer appropriate customer service.</li>
            <li> Many dentists push this brush on their patients because they get a sizable kickback, and not because this is a better brush.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ll try to hit you up you for more money as if the defective design is your fault.</li>
            <li> Much better than oral B&#x27;s sonic or sonicare.  </li>
            <li> I love the way it cleans</li>
            <li> I am sure there are better choices.</li>
            <li> Your teeth feel very clean when you are done and even better if you use the pro dentec toothpaste gel with the rotadent.</li>
            <li> I believed since it was so highly recommended by Dentists that it would be a great product.</li>
            <li> Luckily, my dentist is awesome and took care of the replacement for me through the salesman he deals with directly.  </li>
            <li> I will admit I loved my Rotadent for the first month.  </li>
            <li> Just doesn&#x27;t live up to being a great product.</li>
            <li> It has been great, but I upgraded to the new plus</li>
            <li> It does a good job,  my present dentist said that if everyone did as good a job as I did on my teeth he would be out of business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve made a huge profit on this electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> The brush heads were really soft, which is great, but they&#x27;re 15 bucks and crack until they fall off while you&#x27;re brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I suggest you strongly consider one of the many alternatives available.</li>
            <li> At first I loved this toothbrush and how clean my mouth and teeth felt after using it.  </li>
            <li> Due to gum problems after treatment for oral cancer, the Rotadent brush is the best solution for my oral care.  </li>
            <li> it actually works, it&#x27;s pretty good, great even.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush regarding its capability to clean.</li>
            <li> I had a Braun before this and the Rota Dent doesn&#x27;t clean any better despite the platinum price.  </li>
            <li> The Oral B is still going strong at 8 years.  </li>
            <li> It does not hold a full charge for more than a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d send this in for warranty repair, but I&#x27;m guessing I will get the runaround because I did not purchase this from the dentist, and there&#x27;s probably some fine print saying the brush heads aren&#x27;t covered.  </li>
            <li> There is a huge defect and the handle needs re-engineered in order to make the switch waterproof.</li>
            <li> and she is sending a replacement handle free</li>
            <li> and now it no longer spins smoothly -</li>
            <li> If I am in a hurry, I still enjoy using my Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> and they wouldn&#x27;t replace the motor, but gave me two free brush heads.</li>
            <li> I do enjoy the way my teeth feel after using this product but considering the design flaws, I would not advise buying it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it is cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Each Rotadent® Plus power handle and charger unit is warranted to be free from defects in material and workmanship.</li>
            <li> This Rota Dent Plus is a great step up from the regular Rota Dent toothbrush model.  </li>
            <li> It shows that it&#x27;s charging (the light comes on)</li>
            <li> Long term results are yet to be determined, but hopefully it will be successful in keeping my gums healthy.</li>
            <li> but it really does leave my mouth feeling significantly more healthy</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the new rotadent toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I had purchased the original rotadent many years ago, and it finally was no longer working, so I purcased a rotadent Plus toothbrush, and am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> The battery is great and the motor is very powerful yet not loud.</li>
            <li> I had the original Rota-dent for 10+ yrs</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> I am also told that the original lasts longer than the Zila version.</li>
            <li> I registered it online when I purchased it from my dentist, who no longer sells Rotadent and I now understand why, and even have my original receipt and the printout when when I did register it.  </li>
            <li> WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT , MORE THAN 10 YEARS AGO .</li>
            <li> The first series was Nicad which were ok but not so convenient since you couldn&#x27;t leave it on the charger like the competition.</li>
            <li> As so many others have stated, I bought my first Rotodent from my dentist in the &#x27;90&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> At first, I love this brush.</li>
            <li> Unlike the original Rotadent, you can&#x27;t clean the electrical contact yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t work right, the top part comes off of the stem because it doesn&#x27;t fit right.</li>
            <li> My orthodontist commented on how clean my teeth were.</li>
            <li> Afterwards, my teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li> the item arrived quickly and in apparent good condition.  </li>
            <li> I first received the Rotadent Rota Dent PLUS model from my dentist and it worked perfectly for about two and half months, but then the plastic on toothbrush heads broke which prevented me from using the brush heads.  </li>
            <li> spinning microfiber brush head really does seem to do an exceptional job on my teeth and gums, but you have to use it gently.</li>
            <li> Nimbus makes the finest manual brush money can buy, and with proper technique should do as good a job as the Rotodent.</li>
            <li> actually its just good for one use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true, if you don&#x27;t buy from a dentist</li>
            <li> Just hold the brush at an angle to your gums, then flat to get a good clean.</li>
            <li> The first was fine for about 2 years - then it stopped working.</li>
            <li> The first time it was fine for a year, then as soon as the warranty was up, so was its life span.  </li>
            <li> I like it better than the Classic because the brushes are softer and it has 3 speeds</li>
            <li> and the company quickly replaced them.  </li>
            <li> Overall, though, this is a great toothbrush -- sturdy, gentle on teeth and gums, holds charge well.</li>
            <li> Lucky if it lasts 6 months.</li>
            <li> Their product if it would work would be excellent but it seems that after a short period of time using the motor stops working and it would start again until finally would stop.</li>
            <li> and I guess the older model is ok</li>
            <li> Okay, but would have preferred to charge it with a detachable charging cord (as the older models).</li>
            <li> It seems to be doing a super job on my teeth.</li>
            <li> I would say the new design is more desirable because you do not need to pull the power plug from the toothbrush to get it to start it.</li>
            <li> REALLY WORKS!!  </li>
            <li> It just vibrates a little bit to sound good</li>
            <li> This is probally the most convienient and soft way to remove plaque.</li>
            <li> Let the battery charge a full 24 hours before using the first time.</li>
            <li> After a considerable period of waiting, I was able to leave a message.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;He said it is the only kind he will use.</li>
            <li> The old Rotodent&#x27;s worked better</li>
            <li> and his response was \\&quot;Have fun with that.\\</li>
            <li> Yes, I have two power toothbrushes by my sink, and I use them several times a day, and love the clean feeling after brushing.</li>
            <li> went back to using the manual toothbrush and at my next dental appointment received a brand new Rotadent Rota Dent PLUS toothbrush and again it worked perfectly</li>
            <li> The power handle is warranted for so long as you own it and operate it according to instructions.</li>
            <li> The rotadent classic or plus is great for helping to keep the staining down from coffee and tea.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t fit the new model.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really use the multiple speeds, but the rest of the features are nice.  </li>
            <li> These are very gentle toothbrushes - which is what you want.</li>
            <li> After the first one malfunctioned, I called the customer service line and got ZERO satisfaction.  </li>
            <li> I got my first Rotadent through my dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> The brushes are junk,they broke the first time I used  them,again giving to the needy people,I called the factory and they  (customer service)informed me that I bought the item on line and not from a dentist so there for</li>
            <li> But it is actually cleaning your teeth much better than anything else on the market.  </li>
            <li> The most recent model I bought (this Plus model) lasted about 6 months</li>
            <li> I bought my first rota-dent plus from my dentist.</li>
            <li> Be aware of this scam..</li>
            <li> I was cautiously optimistic that this one would be of a higher quality but guess what?</li>
            <li> The first two I purchases didn&#x27;t work at all and had to be returned before this one broke after 6 months.</li>
            <li> The first three times (before the Plus) was a power issue.</li>
            <li> recommended by my dentist (At considerably higher cost in his surgery).  </li>
            <li> It is a bit noisy and vibrates a bit, but still, small &amp;#34;issues&amp;#34; on an overall excellent products</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than the last one I had.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Being in sales and customer service for many years myself this company is will be what I use as an example of how NOT to do business to my future employees.</li>
            <li> if I will purchase a replacement and hope it doesnt have the same battery issue... if I do... Will be sure to purchase from website where its under warranty</li>
            <li> Just like my first one, after 3 months, it doesn&#x27;t rotate anymore.</li>
            <li> The first one died of tropical humidity, so I don&#x27;t blame the company.</li>
            <li> most recent two</li>
            <li> I contacted Zila and they are supporting this.</li>
            <li> So in the end they are likely MAKING more money off me each time I&#x27;ll get a replacement.  </li>
            <li> When I first got it it lasted for over a week</li>
            <li> First it would not turn off.  </li>
            <li> After two weeks&#x27; use, the battery can not last more than a day.</li>
            <li> It comes with a lifetime warranty, so when the first one died in 6 months I called the company</li>
            <li> Looking for a good one to replace the one I have that has gone dead after just a couple of months.</li>
            <li> Great product but binds up easily when brushing back teeth have to take it out cycle thru next two speeds to turn off then back on and during one brushing have had it bind up (stop)</li>
            <li> I honestly could care less about how amazing the Rotadent is when the Rotadent lasts about 1/10th as long as either of their competitors, for 1.5x the price.</li>
            <li> But thanks to amazon they made it right in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li> First, the positive aspects.</li>
            <li> The nickel metal hydride battery in the new Rotadent is better than the old Nickel Cadmium battery, but not by much.  </li>
            <li> It is a great product OTHER THAN the fact that it seems to mess up easily.  </li>
            <li> I love the product and it works very well as a toothbrush, but I have yet to have one last longer than six months without malfunctioning.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised when my older model was no longer available.  </li>
            <li> I would strongly advise that you purchase a different product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had an OralB Triumph for several years and it is still going strong.  </li>
            <li> The $35 dollar shipping charge was pure stealing</li>
            <li> And then.... Expect to pay $18 shipping for each new unit that will arrive in 5 days!!</li>
            <li> (I keep one at work and one at home) are still working, but one developed the same kind of switch problem after normal use (I never used it in the shower).</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to replace the entire thing for a new one with my dentist, bc</li>
            <li> This new model is nice but is completely unadaptable to prior models so you can not interuse at all.</li>
            <li> On the Oral B, the brush head is soft (just like the original Rotadent) and there is not hard core.  </li>
            <li> I love the way my teeth feels after using this toothbrush, but it no longer seems worth the frustration of having to replace the toothbrush every few months.</li>
            <li> In fact, professional testing and reviews show that the brush does not perform well and has battery problems--they use old battery technology, really cheap stuff from China.  </li>
            <li> As my dentist explained it, you would not use an electric sander when polishing your car; you would use a gentle buffer.  </li>
            <li> If that is what you are used to, then the Rotadent will seem like it is not doing much.</li>
            <li> I suggest registering because some times the replacement heads are defective and that is the only way to get a free replacement.</li>
            <li> I will also point out that there is no real discount or better price for these online.</li>
            <li> but now I&#x27;m having the same problem with the cheap plastic brush heads....</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m having so much problem with a freakin toothbrush!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> KEEPS THE TEETH AND GUM LINE HEALTHY AND PINK.  </li>
            <li> Automatic charging when it&#x27;s docked is a real plus.  </li>
            <li> It really takes off the plaque.  </li>
            <li> YOU are the one responsible for footing the bill for shipping and handling fees.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately for me, this has not been a constant issue, but it is annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t care, because I just wanted my brush to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really like it when it was working</li>
            <li> It is gentle, yet cleans thoroughly</li>
            <li> Running your tongue along the back teeth after a thorough brushing feels almost as smooth as just coming from a dental cleaning.</li>
            <li> Amazon was very diligent in refunding me after I returned the article</li>
            <li> So, this is very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t even really given the choice - the dentist handed me this system and said I needed to use this to repair my gums and I was too...</li>
            <li> The only good thing about this toothbrush is the brush heads are much softer than other brands.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I loved the Rotadent classic but for a product which is supposed to perform better than the old model it fails.</li>
            <li> I bought the original Rotodent from my former dentist and it lasted 10 years.  </li>
            <li> The first 3 were the standard rotadent models but the most recent was the Rotadent</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B003UKKHB4 Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + Gum Care Precision 3000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush 1 Count]], for half the price of a new Rotadent, and</li>
            <li> fear that a real reliable decent  </li>
            <li> I simply don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews as I&#x27;ve had such a wonderful experience with my Rotadent Plus toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The Rotadent did do a much better job at cleaning below the gum line with the sweep bristle head (which is why I bought it), but not worth buying again if most only last 6 - 9 months.  </li>
            <li> I really like the settings on the new model (which can be adjusted for gum sensitivity).  </li>
            <li> This new rotodent does not rotate nearly as fast as the one I bought 7 years ago.</li>
            <li> assuming the outlet is ok, the battery may recover if you leave it charging for about 24hrs or slightly longer.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing the older model, which my mother has and has NEVER HAD A</li>
            <li> SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY THE OLDER MODEL....</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for an older model.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased three Rota Dent brushes - two of the older model and one of these Plus models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first 3 were the first model, this last was the Plus.  </li>
            <li> The most difficult thing is that I love the toothbrush</li>
            <li> I used the original product for many years and always felt the battery was weak.  </li>
            <li> I would have discarded it earlier, but I paid $150 for it and it was doing an adequate job, barely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used the rotadent classic for over 8 years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will be ordering the Rota Dent brush older model (which I have used for years) from you, after the holiday season is over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I must say there is a decent defect rate.</li>
            <li> I searching for an older model but never this one....</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend toothbrush, this but buy from a dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> This product was highly recommended by my dentist.  </li>
            <li> The Rotadent unit was highly recommended by my dentist, so I paid her $130 for the unit.  </li>
            <li> a new rotadent will let me see less of him:)  </li>
            <li> so I bought a new (Classic) one.</li>
            <li> Also, I cannot use my older model toothbrush heads on the new model.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect storm--a badly designed product sold by a a non-supportive</li>
            <li> so I can use the ultra gentle speed when my teeth feel sensitive.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve occasionally experienced weird behavior where it stops running and won&#x27;t restart without returning it to the charger.</li>
            <li> It has come to it not being worth it financially.</li>
            <li> , I just brush normally, three times a day, in front of a mirror.  </li>
            <li> and they took my address and said they would send another in 7-10 days, one month later I still did not have it, called again and they were really nice and said they would send it overnight, got it the next day, only problem it died in two months.</li>
            <li> so save money and buy online because you pay a lot more for the &#x27;lifetime&#x27; guarantee, and you don&#x27;t know how long it will last anyway....</li>
            <li> This low-quality product is costing me more and more money, and I&#x27;m curious to see how long would the third one keep functioning properly.</li>
            <li> At the end of a five minute conversation, she got some information from me and said I would have a new Rotadent Plus in the mail in 4-5 business days.  </li>
            <li> However, I registered my new one with the name of my dentist (who sells them) and had no problem getting the warranty.</li>
            <li> I attempted to return the product to the seller, Snafuaru2, who informed me \\&quot;you purchased a new toothbrush and that is what you received\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Then I got a new one(free of charge) via the warrantee.</li>
            <li> Like the new design otherwise.  </li>
            <li> The box was in new condition.  </li>
            <li> Within 3 months it broke and I was sent a new toothbrush through the Dentist office.</li>
            <li> Within 4 months the new Rotadent stopped working.</li>
            <li> Like the new stand that keeps it always charged.</li>
            <li> and I like the new features it has.</li>
            <li> I did not like he new rota dent Plus,  as it did not work well with a converter as stated in the instruction</li>
            <li> New Info:</li>
            <li> You can keep buying new brush heads at $30 a pop, but they will keep breaking.  </li>
            <li> For all I know, the new battery lasts a decade.  </li>
            <li> I had to get a new one</li>
            <li> A new product is a new product, regardless where it is purchased.  </li>
            <li> Initally, I thought the battery died or some sort, but after switching to a new head, it worked again.</li>
            <li> and I should return it to manufacturer to receive a new rotadent.</li>
            <li> and they sent me a new one.</li>
            <li> I bought the Classic version and it never died, it just got old looking</li>
            <li> The moral of the story is not to trust a product that does not compete in an open market and is sold primarily by dentists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> had the classic model 3 years-trouble with brushes coming off no lock-slow operation-lousy charger system-new brush heads frequently faulty-on/off</li>
            <li> This is how my dentist told me to use it and it does work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not yet comfortable using this as my only toothbrush - so it is adding extra time to routine -</li>
            <li> I bought it there, but the new one did the exact same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one comes with a power supply that will only work in countries with 110 volt systems, making this product much less useful and friendly to me.  </li>
            <li> This is pretty much standard procedures for all rechargeable batteries (including laptop computers).  </li>
            <li> The first one lasted close to ten years.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush through my periodontist about 2 months ago, who said the bristles were softer than the Sonicare I usually use and would be better for my gums.  </li>
            <li> The brush heads only lasted about 1.5weeks of consistent use.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s various phases first.</li>
            <li> But after few days you love it, it cleans really well, has briefs stops every 30 seconds to help as a reminder to go to the next section of teeth, and was quite powerful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teeth do not feel even half as clean with this model vs. the classic.  </li>
            <li> , they STRONGLY recommend you drain the battery to dead about 3 or 4 times a year and then recharge for 24 hours.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I had one brush head left before my next appointment.  </li>
            <li> I carefully dried it out and now it seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> This new brush is sluggish and since I still have an older brush, the difference is very obvious between the two.  </li>
            <li> but there are clearly problems with the manufacture.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even have to send the old one in.  </li>
            <li> This is the closest thing you can get to a professional cleaning at your dentist.</li>
            <li> The green light indicated that it was charging but when I tried to using it, it didn&#x27;t turn on.  </li>
            <li> IT WAS COMPLETELY DEAD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money here.</li>
            <li> I have an old Rotadent-</li>
            <li> You might as well use the old Rotadent</li>
            <li> , they refused stating they were to busy to call</li>
            <li> I have an old model Rotodent that has worked well.  </li>
            <li> I sent direct to Rotadent and they have not replaced</li>
            <li> the brush heads were soft.</li>
            <li> It will completely just stop working</li>
            <li> I have used the Rotadent for 10 years because of the soft brush heads.  </li>
            <li> My old one lasted 10+ years</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B003UKKHB4 Oral-B Professional Care 3000 Electric Toothbrush, 1 Count]] and also bought the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> B00006ANDK Oral-B Sensitive (3 Extra-Soft Brush heads)]] brushes.</li>
            <li> They told me to keep plugged in at all times except when doing this complete discharge.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> This is not a company that supports its customers as far as I can see.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame, because the cleaning action of the Rotadent is unsurpassed.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if the battery issues were fixed or not, because I burned through a half-dozen brush heads before I gave up.  </li>
            <li> I really have only used this for about a week.</li>
            <li> routine so far</li>
            <li> brush teeth with either soft brush and tooth paste or my oral b and toothpaste... use rotadent with the fluoride rinse... rinse mouth with leftover</li>
            <li> I do make a conscious effort not to apply any pressure when brushing for this reason.  </li>
            <li> It has a very defective battery design and you&#x27;ll likely need to replace it before you even get 6 months to a year&#x27;s usage out of it.</li>
            <li> I used to use sonicare complete.</li>
            <li> WARRENTY!&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, do not waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> and if you have sensitive gums like I do, it is the toothbrush for you.  </li>
            <li> So far no problems at all</li>
            <li> I had the OLD model with a rocker switch for 15 yrs</li>
            <li> The concept is that it is better for those with receding gums because of the soft bristles and slow speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just ordered a good old German engineered top-of-the line Braun at less than half the price.  </li>
            <li> While it worked, it did clean my teeth well, but it died after a few months of use.  </li>
            <li> My advise to those with gum disease is a normal soft bristle brush, twice daily flossing, and frequent professional cleanings (my pockets have gone from 4-5mms with the Rotadent to 2-4mms with a basic toothbrush).  </li>
            <li> Found it a bit rough at first.</li>
            <li> i love these brushes, but they don&#x27;t last very long, the last one, which was a replacement for my first one, only lasted 3 months, the one before that a little over a year...</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s fair, especially when the reason I&#x27;m replacing it is because the product itself is just poorly made and breaks down once a month.  </li>
            <li> I needed a new one and my current dentist does not sell this toothbrush</li>
            <li> This means calling them up about every month when it breaks, getting a new one, and calling up the next month.</li>
            <li> I bought a new Rotadent in 2013 and noticed that the brush heads have been changed to a different material.  </li>
            <li> Essentially, you are almost paying for a new power handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , that is what he has, but he said that almost everyone he talks to that uses the new on has the same problem, it dies in two months.</li>
            <li> In fact, I actually had to get a second deep cleaning less than 12 months after I started using it (mostly 4-5 mm pockets).  </li>
            <li> My dentist recommended changing to Oral B professional with extra soft head.  </li>
            <li> I use the short pointy bit to get the backs of my teeth that the flat head can&#x27;t get easily, as well as up and down the backs of my front teeth.   </li>
            <li> This thing cleans like no other electric toothbrush I have had.  </li>
            <li> Two months later, the two month old brush head died again!</li>
            <li> This new one does away with any direct metal connection that can rust out due to all the water a toothbrush is near.</li>
            <li> It has a sensitive mode and also a red light that tells you when you are pressing too hard.</li>
            <li> /whatever is just cheaply made and SUCKS.  </li>
            <li> I initially bought this from my dentist&#x27;s office as he recommended it to me for my extremely sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> Their warranty only covers units purchased from a dental office or directly from the Zila website.  </li>
            <li> The second unit broke in about a month and the dental office asked me to return directly to the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Went back to my Oral B that was 5 years old when I bought the Rotadent.  </li>
            <li> Alas, you can&#x27;t buy it any more.</li>
            <li> Do your own homework or you&#x27;ll be sorry.</li>
            <li> I also just bought the new Rotadent Plus (my 3rd brush) to leave at a home I travel to several weeks a year.  </li>
            <li> The new one is starting to have the same problems.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention that those other brands are much louder.  </li>
            <li> I am experiencing the same issue that others are having - the power switch no longer functions and the toothbrush turns on and off on its own at random intervals.</li>
            <li> The motor is weak, battery charge doesn&#x27;t last and the second the brush lightly touches the surface of my teeth, the brush head stops spinning!</li>
            <li> I have read that the new Zila rodadent Plus will not last that long.</li>
            <li> At least they have an adequate return policy when something breaks, then they have to deal with the manufacturer, not you.</li>
            <li> I loved the earlier versions of Rotadent and am very sorry to see the changes.  </li>
            <li> Constantly replacing brushes gets very expensive when brushes are a good $15 each.</li>
            <li> The new one turned out to be much worse: after only two weeks, the battery could last only one day after a full charge, so now I have to charge it every day.</li>
            <li> Electric toothbrushes like SonicCare are far too rough on your teeth and gums!</li>
            <li> Teeth feel like I just left the dentist after using the flat and pointed brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned two of the previous models, both of which eventually died because of a battery, and reluctantly upgraded to this new model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;You&#x27;ll feel stupid and wish you had read the reviews on Amazon instead of listening to your dentist, who was more interested in sending his kids to Harvard than taking care of your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Given the high price, a waste of over $115.00.  </li>
            <li> Wow Rotadent, great job on making what is possibly the worst quality electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> I really dislike having to carry transformers when a few cents spent on the charger will make it international.</li>
            <li> I do not generally trust online reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased two of these in the past year, one the older version, the second the plus.  </li>
            <li> Then let the battery run down completely before recharging.</li>
            <li> I do charge it according to the instructions, which is to charge it fully, then unplug the charger and use it until it&#x27;s completely run down before charging it again.</li>
            <li> I was on hold for a very long time only to have them tell me that my warranty information was not in their system.  </li>
            <li> I am just replacing it,  only because the charge does not hold very long.  </li>
            <li> than spend any more money on this, I&#x27;m cutting my losses and going back to my faithful Nimbus microfiber brushes.</li>
            <li> It is a big disappointment to spend the money it costs and not be able to use it.  </li>
            <li> This thing completely died and I&#x27;ve had it for less than two months.  </li>
            <li> The first model was good, this one is bad, and the newest one is even worse.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Eventually the unit has just lost so much power that barely letting it touch your teeth makes it spin so slow or not at all!</li>
            <li> I kept thinking her teeth looked dirty even after she brushed, but I just figured I was being ridiculous because my electric toothbrush works AMAZINGLY!  </li>
            <li> Too bad as it was a great toothbrush in the past.  </li>
            <li> Brushes are expensive but important to change every 3 months.</li>
            <li> The various 3 speeds would change arbitrarily as well.  </li>
            <li> (Long warranty)  </li>
            <li> It keeps a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s harder to attach &amp; detach the brush heads than on the earlier model.  </li>
            <li> The gears started slipping in the 3rd week.</li>
            <li> What good is having the charging cradle if you can&#x27;t use it as a storage base.  </li>
            <li> Rotadent is a thing of the past, and that we&#x27;ll all have to find a new brand.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clean as much, but getting ten fillings done a year would be cheaper than buying brush heads, and less painful than trying to get a warranty replacement, even if my dentist skipped the novocaine.</li>
            <li> do I try again or got two other companies take them back?</li>
            <li> So as soon as this one bites the dust (which won&#x27;t be long!)</li>
            <li> Maybe an issue with nickel cad batteries as some other reviews mention, maybe issue with internal corrosion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried to get along without it by using regular brushes and other electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Ultimately, the unit switch goes bad and you will not be able to turn it on.  </li>
            <li> HAVE DRY MOUTH.</li>
            <li> This is my second unit from this company, both have experience crash down and when writing to company not even an answer.</li>
            <li> It does, however, slow down at certain teeth or pressure on the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;d rather have the previous product back</li>
            <li> I had a rotadent previously, then got a sonicare and switched back to rotadent.</li>
            <li> and now my third one is failing, all in less than a year.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they don&#x27;t last as long and the replacement brush heads cost twice as much.</li>
            <li> Most disappointing is that after a little over a year the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; button has started to act up.  </li>
            <li> The customer service lady was rude and it took 3 or 4 days to call me back after I left a message.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to really be careful to not charge mine while it is wet this time and see how it works out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this item a few weeks,</li>
            <li> A few years later, I decided that maybe I just got a lemon and gave it another try.  </li>
            <li> purchased this toothbrush from my dentist so am eligible for the lifetime warranty, but the amount of times the toothbrush&#x27;s power switch mechanism fails is no longer making it worth my while to replace the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I bought it at my dentist’s suggestion after being diagnosed w/periodontal disease, and saw absolutely NO improvement in gum health or pocket reduction during the 1½ years I used it.</li>
            <li> Our third generation one is dead now.</li>
            <li> and then is not supported; that is not $120 well spent.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s is doing the same within a few weeks of mine doing it (&lt;1.5 years in).</li>
            <li> You just have to guess if the battery is low, and a couple of times the battery ran dead while I was still brushing.</li>
            <li> Flash back to Xbox 360&#x27;s red ring 30% failure rate.</li>
            <li> After a few months, the power switch developed the classic problems and the unit completely failed.</li>
            <li> Since I bought two at the same time, I took out the other one and it is dead again after two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no comparison with any other brushes.</li>
            <li> However, I am careful to remove the toothbrush head after use, and then I thoroughly dry out the base, making sure there is no accumulated water.</li>
            <li> simple issue is that the new brush head design is tragically flawed.  </li>
            <li> I am now having to take Rotadent to small claims to get my money back.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other brushes but none work like Rotadent.</li>
            <li> This is the third Roto-Dent I have bought in the past 20 years.  </li>
            <li> All on line purchases other than zila.com are not covered under warranty.</li>
            <li> Please think of that before you take any other customer&#x27;s money.</li>
            <li> The last (very last) brush head was all twisted after only four weeks use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use any other type of toothbrush</li>
            <li> Rotadent® Plus rotary toothbrushes obtained from a source other than a dental office.   </li>
            <li> Brush heads or components other than the power handle</li>
            <li> others have noted, calling Zila (manufacturer) gets you on endless hold.</li>
            <li> My oralB never failed me so ill stick to it.</li>
            <li> The other thing I don&#x27;t like about this toothbrush is it doesn&#x27;t have a battery level indicator.</li>
            <li> A total waste of money!  </li>
            <li> I am not able to contact the company as they NEVER answer their phone, so essentially the warranty is void and useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more than 6 months battery,with correct initial charge period and 2 times used per day.</li>
            <li> and I leave it in the cradle all the time, don&#x27;t understand other reviewers that have had problem with that.  </li>
            <li> So for the past several months, I&#x27;ve had this very expensive toothbrush sitting in the original packaging hoping Zila will return one of my calls.  </li>
            <li> Too bad it barely works in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> I have used other types or brands of electric toothbrushes with less impactful results.</li>
            <li> I confimend about the warrenty prior to the purchase from Amazon and now thy are giving hard time.</li>
            <li> It has no power and in general is not a good electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I attempted to contact Rota Dent with no success.  </li>
            <li> The heads are expensive and I change mine very often.</li>
            <li> I put up with it for a few weeks until I realized that I wont be able to take my toothbrush with me when I travelled. :(  </li>
            <li> It is not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> , the negative, this is my fourth one in about 10 years.</li>
            <li> The parts are expensive to buy and the head set is the real cost.  </li>
            <li> This model is better than the base model because the storage for the tips has a cover</li>
            <li> My only issue is that the rotary head seems to slow down a bit if I put heavier pressure on it.</li>
            <li> Don’t buy this or any other product from Zila!</li>
            <li> I thought my previous toothbrush did, but by watching the head, I could see that it does not rotate.  </li>
            <li> All previous models came with a power supply that would work in any country.  </li>
            <li> The item was purchased less than a year ago though...  </li>
            <li> With less than 3 months usage, it became unchargable.</li>
            <li> The one delivered less than a month ago needs to be recharged every 5-6 days.  </li>
            <li> I felt slight warmth off the one</li>
            <li> Died/froze up after less than 6 months use</li>
            <li> I bought the Rotadent Plus at my dentist office less than a year ago.</li>
            <li> Now, just 2 months later, the second one has failed.</li>
            <li> The bristles are stiff and there a hard core in the middle of the bristles.  </li>
            <li> On the down side, it looks like new brushes/heads are quite expensive.  </li>
            <li> There is a very thin strip of apparently brittle plastic on the mounting end of the brush that always breaks long before the heads are worn out.  </li>
            <li> Apparently Snafuaru2 does not stand behind the product they sell.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive and I left it too long before I realized it wasn&#x27;t working as it should</li>
            <li> was a little worried when I went to recharge it and the charger seemed not to work.  </li>
            <li> I put a little on the brush and then spread it on the teeth before turning the brush on.</li>
            <li> the battery goes out on you after a little use you&#x27;ll be stuck.</li>
            <li> The brush heads are expensive and don&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> It is no more messy than any other brush I have used.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> even if few ,if they get you to the point.....</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> If you’re thinking about buying this product for gum disease, don’t waste your money or time.</li>
            <li> However, there are a few things I don&#x27;t like:  1)  </li>
            <li> When turning off, you have to hit the button a few times, as it goes through</li>
            <li> Probably costs them $5 to make this cheap crap and max $5 to ship it with ground shipping...</li>
            <li> Rotadent stopped working after just a few months.  </li>
            <li> You have to charge it everyday.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> I have been through two of these items in the past year and a half.  </li>
            <li> finally got tired of an paying excessive amount of money for brush heads</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want to press down, press hard, or scrub.</li>
            <li> I did notice that if I press down too hard, the brush would stop spinning.</li>
            <li> If i would have been aware of the bad reviews i would have never bought this P.O.C.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It worked well, when it failed after a long time I tried other things, but gee, they didn&#x27;t treat my teeth as well.  </li>
            <li> It stops with very little pressure on the tooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is expensive, it is addictive, but it will not work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure, but I think you have to buy it from a dentist to get the life time warranty.</li>
            <li> It is working now, not sure what was going on.  </li>
            <li> The problem this last time was the brush running itself, turning on randomly, and often.</li>
            <li> no more to say.....</li>
            <li> Same problem each time: the handle/power button stops working and it&#x27;ll randomly turn on and off by itself.  </li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t do anything out of the ordinary with the toothbrush to be causing any problems</li>
            <li> prevent gum disease that an ordinary toothbrush doesn’t do.  </li>
            <li> In the past it would got 12 - 14 days and it had some energy.  </li>
            <li> Something in it is not waterproof, so the toothbrush actually ends up turning on by itself randomly at night, which is annoying, and secondly, tells you much about the poor construction.</li>
            <li> Im not sure</li>
            <li> Once the braces are off and my current units fail, I will move on to another company.</li>
            <li> a waste!  </li>
            <li> Of course it&#x27;s now past the warranty.  </li>
            <li> had a previous Rotadent for 6 years with no problems at all; I only replaced it because the battery life was slowly getting worse and worse.</li>
            <li> I now have $75 in heads from other companies, with rota dent poor reviews</li>
            <li> one and only experience calling customer support was to a person who spent the time arguing with me about the cause of my problem, and was obviously frustrated that my lifetime warranty brush wasn&#x27;t listed in their system.  </li>
            <li> I have MS and it is hard to shave with soap all over your hands and the handle of the razor.  </li>
            <li> So, the orthodontist just told us my daughter has a cavity in her newest tooth and commented on how it must just be a hard to reach spot.  </li>
            <li> It has hardly been used as the ad stated.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed that I spent so much money on the upgrade and got a downgrade in quality.</li>
            <li> They improved on the reason why my old Roto went bad; rusted electrical connections with the charger.</li>
            <li> I noticed some people have complained about the battery.</li>
            <li> so you can at least get the warranty.    </li>
            <li> So, although I do not know if this a common problem, at least they support.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I let him know that I would be posting a negative review</li>
            <li> Received my new one yesterday and  disappointed to find out that the warranty is not covered except when purchasing from a dentist.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve broken three brush heads due to the poor design of the locking</li>
            <li> Every time was because of a failure of the brush or its battery.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why they are so behind the technology curve as lithium</li>
            <li> Not worth buying a product that fails in under a year</li>
            <li> Zila is clearly taking advantage of people while they’re desperate and vulnerable.  </li>
            <li> Zila has some serious quality control issue when it comes to the battery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Rotadent for about 10 years and have only had 2 brush heads go bad</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even last a year, bad quality</li>
            <li> Too bad I had bought 6 replacement heads last year and need to make my money</li>
            <li> I will believe bad online reviews on Amazon in the future.</li>
            <li> That is not good.</li>
            <li> so not a good sign.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Worse yet, the Rotadent is expensive, messy, and time-consuming to use.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, over the past 15 years each brush I&#x27;ve purchased has had a shorter life span.  </li>
            <li> Apparently there is a chance the battery may recover to working status if it jump starts with the trickling charge from the base.</li>
            <li> Bad idea, the unit should be kept dry.</li>
            <li> If you press hard you are doing it wrong and are going to have squished brush heads to replace often.  </li>
            <li> This model is poorly made.</li>
            <li> I could only turn it off by returning it to the base twhen it was plugged in.</li>
            <li> This product is so poorly made...</li>
            <li> They do not stand behind what they sell and do not care about the customers in any way.</li>
            <li> Both the product and customer service are extremely of poor quality.</li>
            <li> Eventually, the entire locking mechanism on the base fell off.  </li>
            <li> This is a one of THE WORSE toothbrush that I have ever had.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Both brushes included with the toothbrush have broken.  </li>
            <li> The charge was progressively getting worse since I bought it.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get annoyed and go to Youtube looking for answers.</li>
            <li> But after just having it for four months, it&#x27;s broken.  </li>
            <li> Also, when I brush, I keep the base either upside down or horizontal to avoid any water running from the brush head to the handle--rather ridiculous precautions for a \\&quot;waterproof\\&quot; toothbrush.</li>
            <li> There is a very small, delicate bit of plastic that holds the head to the base.  </li>
            <li> the brush power is very weak.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately within 3-6 months all of them died.</li>
            <li> If it fails, well...we&#x27;ll hope it doesn&#x27;t.      </li>
            <li> three are now in a drawer having failed to keep working.</li>
            <li> I pointed out that I thought it was wrong that I would end up having to throw it away because it was a gift and the giver died.</li>
            <li> TO SPEND ON PHONE, WANT TO PAY A LOT FOR SOMETHING THAT WILL BREAK OVER AND OVER, AND  RECEIVE THE WORST CUSTOMER SERICE IN YOUR ENTIRE LIFE</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the Rotadent toothbrush stopped charging within three months.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t start, then starts but will not shut off or it randomly changes speeds.  </li>
            <li> The warranty is useless.</li>
            <li> the battery failed and they do not have my warranty registration but told me that if my dentist provided a receipt that they would honor the warranty.  </li>
            <li> ; sorry, unfortunately, we can not replace the battery.</li>
            <li> 3.-Brush is expensive.</li>
            <li> In about a month, give or take two weeks, something breaks inside of the 90-degree joint in the brush head, and it catastrophically fails.  </li>
            <li> I already had 2 newer models sealed from factory fail to charge on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Of the three that failed, I felt the bottom of the handle after hours on the charger.</li>
            <li> The locking mechanism on the heads is very poorly designed.  </li>
            <li> The design of the brush mounting is very poor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed since I spent over $120 on it!  </li>
            <li> worst part is that once you use it and see the results you wouldn&#x27;t want any other toothbrush.</li>
            <li> switch bad design failed.  </li>
            <li> Both malfunctioned within a few months and customer service at Zila was awful,</li>
            <li> Mine went crazy and is unusable, but they are replacing it.</li>
            <li> This rule really stinks.</li>
            <li> Find the button pushing speeds awkward to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the part that locks the head to the base has broken again and now the brush head doesn&#x27;t stay in place.  </li>
            <li> Well, when I told her that was impossible she said she could not help me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Rotodent&#x27;s service is as bad as it gets.  </li>
            <li> Too bad they can&#x27;t make the Rotadent that well.  </li>
            <li> I did not believe the bad review for this vendor and purchased a rotadent plus.</li>
            <li> &quot; This is not the customer service I have come to expect from Amazon vendors which is why I did not believe the online bad review.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> The heads stopped spinning within 1.5 years!!! :(</li>
            <li> 2.-Customer service stinks!</li>
            <li> you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be really sorry when you buy one of these brushes, have problems with it, and discover that the company that now sells these things, DenMat, has about the worst customer service you&#x27;ll find in the U.S.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been so disappointed in something that I bought on Amazon.</li>
            <li> You just set it in the base and it is automatically connected.</li>
            <li> They would crack at the base where it attached to the motor piece.</li>
            <li> I did buy this from a dentist and they have replaced the base and two of the brushes.  </li>
            <li> and/or charging base.   </li>
            <li> BUT this model SUCKS!!!!!  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> : 1.-Right out of the box the brush is worthless!</li>
            <li> The customer service at Zila is HORRIBLE!</li>
            <li> This is the worst product I ever had.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been through two of these items in the past year and a half.  I just received my third one yesterday.  I initially bought this from my dentist&#x27;s office as he recommended it to me for my extremely sensitive teeth.  I love the product and it works very well as a toothbrush, but I have yet to have one last longer than six months without malfunctioning.  After the first one malfunctioned, I called the customer service line and got ZERO satisfaction.  I was on hold for a very long time only to have them tell me that my warranty information was not in their system.  Luckily, my dentist is awesome and took care of the replacement for me through the salesman he deals with directly.  I also had my dentist&#x27;s secretary setup my warranty information for me over the phone.  Six months later, this one starts malfunctioning and eventually dies.  This is where the BUT comes in from my title ... I called the customer service line this time and immediately got a representative on the phone that took me through some troubleshooting steps.  At the end of a five minute conversation, she got some information from me and said I would have a new Rotadent Plus in the mail in 4-5 business days.  I didn&#x27;t even have to send the old one in.  It ended up arriving at my house the VERY NEXT day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, I would never pay $160 for this toothbrush again, but I have been very pleased that they have honored the lifetime warranty they advertise on the box.  Also, I want to mention that I love this toothbrush.  It is a great product OTHER THAN the fact that it seems to mess up easily.  I&#x27;m going to really be careful to not charge mine while it is wet this time and see how it works out.  If it messes up again, I will call them again and get another replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR -- Great toothbrush, but messes up very easily.  GREAT about honoring warranty and replacing malfunctioned items in my experience.</li>
            <li> This is probally the most convienient and soft way to remove plaque. It definitely replaces my toothbrush. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I loved the Rotadent classic but for a product which is supposed to perform better than the old model it fails. My teeth do not feel even half as clean with this model vs. the classic.  They&#x27;ve skimped on the quality of the bristles and you can definitely tell.  I am very disappointed that I spent so much money on the upgrade and got a downgrade in quality.</li>
            <li> I got my first Rotadent through my dentist&#x27;s office. The brush itself was amazing - my teeth got whiter by the day. There is absolutely no comparison with any other brushes. Inspired by this, I bought Rotadent Plus for my daughter and a 3 more as gifts for my friends. Unfortunately within 3-6 months all of them died. I had one of them replaced but the replacement one also died 2 months later. The construction and the battery are totally inadequate.&lt;br /&gt;The worst part is that once you use it and see the results you wouldn&#x27;t want any other toothbrush. I ended up using the brush tip manually - still beats the regular brush.&lt;br /&gt;It is expensive, it is addictive, but it will not work. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I had the original Rota-dent for 10+ yrs and it was wonderful; when it finally died I bought this Rotadent plus and it crashed within 30 days.  The battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge and it has a screwy design flaw where it stop/starts every 30 seconds.  i would not recommend this at all.</li>
            <li> THE ONLY WAY TO BRUSH</li>
            <li> The brushes are junk,they broke the first time I used  them,again giving to the needy people,I called the factory and they  (customer service)informed me that I bought the item on line and not from a dentist so there for I have no warranty and they refused to stand buy their junk.customer service said (they only warranty items bought from dentists</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased two of these in the past year, one the older version, the second the plus.  Both malfunctioned within a few months and customer service at Zila was awful, zero help, the customer service line puts you on hold for 20 minutes then drops the call.  Who has time to deal with this garbage?  I am now having to take Rotadent to small claims to get my money back.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!</li>
            <li> 1.  If you buy this toothbrush from anyone except a dentist you void the warranty.  The description does not tell you that and you do not find that out until you open the box, then you can&#x27;t return the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  I bought the original Rotodent from my former dentist and it lasted 10 years.  I needed a new one and my current dentist does not sell this toothbrush so I ordered the Plus model.  It does a good job,  my present dentist said that if everyone did as good a job as I did on my teeth he would be out of business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  If I had know that the lifetime warranty would be void because it was not bought from a dentist I would have looked for a dentist to buy it from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  Highly recommend toothbrush, this but buy from a dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000QUGLZW Rota-Dent Electric Toothbrush, Blue Model - 110v]]</li>
            <li> This product was highly recommended by my dentist.  It is supposed to be the only toothbrush head that goes all of the way in a circle.  I thought my previous toothbrush did, but by watching the head, I could see that it does not rotate.  Long term results are yet to be determined, but hopefully it will be successful in keeping my gums healthy.</li>
            <li> These are very gentle toothbrushes - which is what you want. As my dentist explained it, you would not use an electric sander when polishing your car; you would use a gentle buffer.  Electric toothbrushes like SonicCare are far too rough on your teeth and gums! If that is what you are used to, then the Rotadent will seem like it is not doing much. But it is actually cleaning your teeth much better than anything else on the market.  This is the closest thing you can get to a professional cleaning at your dentist. See the \\&quot;chalk board test\\&quot; comparing toothbrushes at zila.com/84/howtouse/.  I have gum disease and taking care of my teeth is a must. I have tried other brushes but none work like Rotadent. As a matter of fact, a couple of well known brands actually started to push my gums back! That is not good. Not to mention that those other brands are much louder.  The trick is to let the toothbrush do all of the work. You don&#x27;t want to press down, press hard, or scrub. Just hold the brush at an angle to your gums, then flat to get a good clean. If you press hard you are doing it wrong and are going to have squished brush heads to replace often.  I have purchased 3 Rotadent. I bought the Classic version and it never died, it just got old looking so I bought a new (Classic) one. I also just bought the new Rotadent Plus (my 3rd brush) to leave at a home I travel to several weeks a year.  I like it better than the Classic because the brushes are softer and it has 3 speeds so I can use the ultra gentle speed when my teeth feel sensitive.  I&#x27;m not sure, but I think you have to buy it from a dentist to get the life time warranty. However, I registered my new one with the name of my dentist (who sells them) and had no problem getting the warranty. I suggest registering because some times the replacement heads are defective and that is the only way to get a free replacement. I&#x27;ve been using Rotadent for about 10 years and have only had 2 brush heads go bad and the company quickly replaced them.  I noticed some people have complained about the battery. I have never had problems with it, though here is a tip. Let the battery charge a full 24 hours before using the first time. Then let the battery run down completely before recharging. This is pretty much standard procedures for all rechargeable batteries (including laptop computers).  I will also point out that there is no real discount or better price for these online. My dentist sells them for the same price and I have looked everywhere. However, if your dentist does not sell them, then pick one up here. I&#x27;m actually buying a 4th one for my sister whom I have convinced to ditch her Phillips Sonic Care.</li>
            <li> I have had an earlier version before from my dentist.  It worked well, when it failed after a long time I tried other things, but gee, they didn&#x27;t treat my teeth as well.  And I paid my dentist for his lovely handiwork.  Still like my dentist, but hope having a new rotadent will let me see less of him:)  I&#x27;ve only had this item a few weeks, was a little worried when I went to recharge it and the charger seemed not to work.  It is working now, not sure what was going on.  If it fails, well...we&#x27;ll hope it doesn&#x27;t.      btw the item arrived quickly and in apparent good condition.  I&#x27;ve liked dealing with Amazon and this item came from another supplier who sold thru Amazon.  So far, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> I first received the Rotadent Rota Dent PLUS model from my dentist and it worked perfectly for about two and half months, but then the plastic on toothbrush heads broke which prevented me from using the brush heads.  Luckily, I had one brush head left before my next appointment.  Then to top that, the toothbrush stopped charging for some reason.  The green light indicated that it was charging but when I tried to using it, it didn&#x27;t turn on.  IT WAS COMPLETELY DEAD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went back to using the manual toothbrush and at my next dental appointment received a brand new Rotadent Rota Dent PLUS toothbrush and again it worked perfectly but now I&#x27;m having the same problem with the cheap plastic brush heads....the part that locks the head to the base has broken again and now the brush head doesn&#x27;t stay in place.  I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m having so much problem with a freakin toothbrush!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;m getting older(42), I am realizing the importance of my health and especially the health of my gums which I took for granted when I was younger.  I LOVE that the Rotadent system helps me improve my gingivitis BUT this model SUCKS!!!!!  I will be purchasing the older model, which my mother has and has NEVER HAD A PROBLEM!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY THE OLDER MODEL....</li>
            <li> I have been using Rotadent products for more than 10 years.  All previous models came with a power supply that would work in any country.  This one comes with a power supply that will only work in countries with 110 volt systems, making this product much less useful and friendly to me.  I travel extensively for extended periods of time in places where the electrical system is 200-250 volts.  I really dislike having to carry transformers when a few cents spent on the charger will make it international.</li>
            <li> Purchased the product, tried it once, did not like it...the brush power is very weak.  I attempted to return the product to the seller, Snafuaru2, who informed me \\&quot;you purchased a new toothbrush and that is what you received\\&quot;.  Apparently Snafuaru2 does not stand behind the product they sell.  I attempted to contact Rota Dent with no success.  I purchased a Braun Oral-B toothbrush which is great.</li>
            <li> I came on here to read some reviews of the rotadent plus, as mine just died almost a year after purchasing it.  The handle wouldn&#x27;t turn on.  But...some reviewers said you can&#x27;t get the warranty if you don&#x27;t purchase from a dentists office....or if you don&#x27;t send in the warranty information.  I did neither.  I think they must have changed that rule, because the lady I spoke with from zila just asked me to give my proof of purchase (all I emailed her was a paypal receipt - I got it through an ebay seller)...and she is sending a replacement handle free (I payed shipping.)...The item was purchased less than a year ago though...  So all in all...although it looks like they die quicker than they should, the customer service was great in my book. Hopefully the replacement will work for longer...  I love the way it brushes!</li>
            <li> This is the third Roto-Dent I have bought in the past 20 years.  This model is better than the base model because the storage for the tips has a cover and you don&#x27;t have to physically plug it up.  You just set it in the base and it is automatically connected.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for an older model.  I really like the settings on the new model (which can be adjusted for gum sensitivity).  I do not like how the brush heads snap into place.  Also, I cannot use my older model toothbrush heads on the new model.  Overall, though, this is a great toothbrush -- sturdy, gentle on teeth and gums, holds charge well.</li>
            <li> All on line purchases other than zila.com are not covered under warranty. Their warranty only covers units purchased from a dental office or directly from the Zila website.  It states this on the bottom of Zila&#x27;s warranty registration page so you won&#x27;t know it until the purchased has already been made. The original Rodadent had a lifetime warranty and excellent customer service. I am also told that the original lasts longer than the Zila version. The first one lasted close to ten years. I have read that the new Zila rodadent Plus will not last that long. I would say the new design is more desirable because you do not need to pull the power plug from the toothbrush to get it to start it. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money here. This model is poorly made. The brush heads last about two weeks. The plastic breaks and the brush head will not stay on the unit. It happened with three brushheads. I emailed the seller and they did not respond.  I would not reccomend making any purchases with this seller. They are not helpful and will not stand by their products.</li>
            <li> I have MS and it is hard to shave with soap all over your hands and the handle of the razor.  So I don&#x27;t get cut.</li>
            <li> I have purchased three Rota Dent brushes - two of the older model and one of these Plus models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All three are now in a drawer having failed to keep working. The first was fine for about 2 years - then it stopped working. The second regular model lasted about 3 months. The most recent model I bought (this Plus model) lasted about 6 months and now it no longer spins smoothly - it judders and stops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion these things just aren&#x27;t well built....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:-(</li>
            <li> BEST EQUIPMENT ON THE MARKET FOR GUM HEALTH.  HAVE DRY MOUTH. I HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING FOR GUM HEALTH, THIS  REALLY WORKS!!  KEEPS THE TEETH AND GUM LINE HEALTHY AND PINK.  LOVE THIS UPDATED MODEL.</li>
            <li> I bought my first rota-dent plus from my dentist. With less than 3 months usage, it became unchargable. Then I got a new one(free of charge) via the warrantee. The new one turned out to be much worse: after only two weeks, the battery could last only one day after a full charge, so now I have to charge it every day. I called the Zila customer service to get the third one, and now they begin to charge the $8 shipping fees. This low-quality product is costing me more and more money, and I&#x27;m curious to see how long would the third one keep functioning properly.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I ordered this toothbrush.  The first time it was fine for a year, then as soon as the warranty was up, so was its life span.  A few years later, I decided that maybe I just got a lemon and gave it another try.  Same thing!  Just weeks after the one-year warranty expired, so did the toothbrush.  Like another reviewer here, I love the way it cleans my teeth and gums, but $100+ dollars every 12 months is just too expensive.  I will switch to another brand.</li>
            <li> When I received it ,I put it on the charger for 30 hours. But when I tried to use it , it barly rotated. Repeated the charge and noted the was on showing it was charging, 24 hours later still not working. And I noted that a lot of people had the same problem.  Than dental Inc with a good rating was in words helpful, and that was it after returning it they promised to replace it. One month later they say there waiting on the factory. But thanks to amazon they made it right in a timely fashion. I now have $75 in heads from other companies, with rota dent poor reviews do I try again or got two other companies take them back?</li>
            <li> After charging this product it began to turn on and off on its own. The various 3 speeds would change arbitrarily as well.  Had to throw it away when the seller would not replace it.  Given the high price, a waste of over $115.00.  Be aware of this scam..</li>
            <li> I bought this product from the dental hygienist at my dentist&#x27;s office. The motor is weak, battery charge doesn&#x27;t last and the second the brush lightly touches the surface of my teeth, the brush head stops spinning! What&#x27;s the point? Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Great product but binds up easily when brushing back teeth have to take it out cycle thru next two speeds to turn off then back on and during one brushing have had it bind up (stop) 3 times  I think I&#x27;d rather have the previous product back</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start with the good. This is the best toothbrush for my teeth and sensitive gums. Yes, my dentist recommended it and yes, I have had good oral health since using it. But, and it&#x27;s a giant but...it&#x27;s a piece of crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have probably purchased 4 of these toothbrushes over the last 4 years. Why would I do that? Well, as I said in the above paragraph, this brush gets the job done for me. The first 3 were the standard rotadent models but the most recent was the Rotadent Plus. I was cautiously optimistic that this one would be of a higher quality but guess what? It broke after 6 months? That&#x27;s totally unacceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the Zila company that makes this product: Please, build a better product. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve made a huge profit on this electric toothbrush but you are selling a fraudulent product. The first two I purchases didn&#x27;t work at all and had to be returned before this one broke after 6 months. For people to spend $130+, they should get something that is quality. You are not delivering on the value proposition that you are claiming to.  Please think of that before you take any other customer&#x27;s money.</li>
            <li> My Dentist recommended this toothbrush series and it is the best. I have used other types or brands of electric toothbrushes with less impactful results. This toothbrush is extremely effective for plaque removal and gum disease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely Buy this one!!!!</li>
            <li> Have had Rotadent for 12 years and it finally gave up the ghost.  Bought this as a replacement because I still had several replacement heads left (at $12 a pop).  Guess what?  They don&#x27;t fit the new model.  Should have guessed it, but there was not indication of this on the narrative.  Oh, well.  Like the new design otherwise.  Automatic charging when it&#x27;s docked is a real plus.  Don&#x27;t really use the multiple speeds, but the rest of the features are nice.  Hope this one lasts another 12 years.</li>
            <li> I just threw my 4th rotadent in 4 years in the garbage! The first 3 were the first model, this last was the Plus.  The most difficult thing is that I love the toothbrush and I cannot find any tool that cleans my teeth and mouth while leaving my gums healthy like this does. Every time was because of a failure of the brush or its battery. The problem this last time was the brush running itself, turning on randomly, and often. I could only turn it off by returning it to the base twhen it was plugged in. The first three times (before the Plus) was a power issue. Either the brush would stop spinning or just die. I took very good care of the unit because the cost factor is significant . The heads are expensive and I change mine very often. I received the last unit as a gift. I had the issue of it running itself and called the company. The woman told me to contact the person that gave the gift and find out where they purchased it and go that route. Well, when I told her that was impossible she said she could not help me. In all honesty I could not  provide the name of the seller. I pointed out that I thought it was wrong that I would end up having to throw it away because it was a gift and the giver died. She just paused and said I will l call you back. She has never called me back. I don&#x27;t understand the difficulty. I love this toothbrush regarding its capability to clean. It has come to it not being worth it financially. Especially when they wont help you when there is an issue. I am giving up.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for several years and thank goodness it has a lifetime warranty. Zila has been incredibley helpful and has replaced the unit more than six times. The issue...the on/off switch is not waterproof. The unit will turn itself on by itself and will cycle. Ultimately, the unit switch goes bad and you will not be able to turn it on.  There is a huge defect and the handle needs re-engineered in order to make the switch waterproof.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake to buy this from my dentist at a tune of $150.00..If i would have been aware of the bad reviews i would have never bought this P.O.C.&lt;br /&gt;I started having problems after 2 months.This product is so poorly made... the battery does not hold a charge why have a cradle??? the toothbrushes plastic breaks so they won&#x27;t stay on the machine ...replacement brushes are 35 dollars.. are you kidding me! Do you self a favor and buy a Sonic or a Braun. Stay away from this product at all cost!</li>
            <li> Pros:  I bought mine from my dentist, and I&#x27;ll get a lifetime warranty.  (Long warranty)  It really takes off the plaque.  I use the short pointy bit to get the backs of my teeth that the flat head can&#x27;t get easily, as well as up and down the backs of my front teeth.   Cons:  On the down side, it looks like new brushes/heads are quite expensive.  I was hoping to no longer need to floss (I don&#x27;t know why...), but, no, it doesn&#x27;t get between my teeth like floss would.  It helps.</li>
            <li> the best I&#x27;ve ever used...... no more to say.....no need to repeat words....even if few ,if they get you to the point.....</li>
            <li> This new rotodent does not rotate nearly as fast as the one I bought 7 years ago. It does come with enough brushes though.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush through my periodontist about 2 months ago, who said the bristles were softer than the Sonicare I usually use and would be better for my gums.  Since that purchase (over $100), I have gone through TWO of these toothbrushes.  Same problem each time: the handle/power button stops working and it&#x27;ll randomly turn on and off by itself.  Either my Rotadents have been possessed by spirits or the battery/handle/whatever is just cheaply made and SUCKS.  Mind you, I don&#x27;t do anything out of the ordinary with the toothbrush to be causing any problems, I just brush normally, three times a day, in front of a mirror.  I&#x27;ve got the lifetime warranty, but what they don&#x27;t tell you is that each time you replace it YOU are the one responsible for footing the bill for shipping and handling fees.  I really don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s fair, especially when the reason I&#x27;m replacing it is because the product itself is just poorly made and breaks down once a month.  Screw Rotadent, I&#x27;m going back to Sonicare.</li>
            <li> We got this toothbrush for my daughter when she got braces.  It came with a special brush for orthodontics, so I thought we were good to go.  I kept thinking her teeth looked dirty even after she brushed, but I just figured I was being ridiculous because my electric toothbrush works AMAZINGLY!  (a Waterpik of course)  So, the orthodontist just told us my daughter has a cavity in her newest tooth and commented on how it must just be a hard to reach spot.  I decided to brush her teeth myself, which is when I discovered what a piece of junk this Rotadent toothbrush is.  It doesn&#x27;t even come close to cleaning the way a sonic toothbrush does.  It just vibrates a little bit to sound good I guess, and leaves all the gunk on the teeth.  I&#x27;m now shopping for a Waterpik toothbrush for my daughter.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with the toothbrush.  It has hardly been used as the ad stated.  The box was in new condition.  the toothbrush base and heads were great also.  I have an old Rotadent- it is even better than this one!</li>
            <li> As many others mentioned, this toothbrush should come with a &#x27;buyer beware&#x27; warning.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this toothbrush from my dentist so am eligible for the lifetime warranty, but the amount of times the toothbrush&#x27;s power switch mechanism fails is no longer making it worth my while to replace the toothbrush. I am experiencing the same issue that others are having - the power switch no longer functions and the toothbrush turns on and off on its own at random intervals. This has happened to three replacement toothbrushes now, so it seems fruitless to try another one. I love the way my teeth feels after using this toothbrush, but it no longer seems worth the frustration of having to replace the toothbrush every few months.</li>
            <li> I will admit I loved my Rotadent for the first month.  Then the on/off button quit working and I have no option to fix it.  Rotadent will not honor a product warranty since I did not buy it through a dentist&#x27;s office.  The manufacturer says they never heard of the doctor mentioned on this website.  I am 2 days out of the Amazon return policy so I am stuck without a working toothbrush as well as my money!!  Do not buy this online!!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the charging cradle.  You can&#x27;t leave the brush handle in the charging cradle like you can with the sonicare.  Rotadent stole the great design of the Sonicare but didn&#x27;t bother to use a lithium ion battery like the Sonicare that has no memory effect.  The nickel metal hydride battery in the new Rotadent is better than the old Nickel Cadmium battery, but not by much.  I am not sure why they are so behind the technology curve as lithium is the only way to go.  What good is having the charging cradle if you can&#x27;t use it as a storage base.  You might as well use the old Rotadent</li>
            <li> The concept and design are good. HOWEVER, I purchased one from my dentist and it broke in short order. I returned to the dental office and they sent it in for repair. The second unit broke in about a month and the dental office asked me to return directly to the manufacturer. I called the customer service number to wait forever and finally  I heard and announcement to leave a message and the company would return my call within 2 business days, yes 2. I emailed them and was called back. They said I did not fill out a warranty card, I had, and did not have and account. Finally got the dental office to call they found my account. Rotodent called me back at work and wanted serial number and return number. I asked them to call me in 10 minutes and I would go to the house and they could call me and I would provide information, they refused stating they were to busy to call back.&lt;br /&gt;UNLESS YOU HAVE A LOT OF SPARE TIME TO SPEND ON PHONE, WANT TO PAY A LOT FOR SOMETHING THAT WILL BREAK OVER AND OVER, AND  RECEIVE THE WORST CUSTOMER SERICE IN YOUR ENTIRE LIFE DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT. If you have this product and it breaks, and it will, just throw it away and move on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand that many dental offices are no longer selling the product because it is so unreliable.</li>
            <li> recommended by my dentist (At considerably higher cost in his surgery).  This thing cleans like no other electric toothbrush I have had.  It is a bit noisy and vibrates a bit, but still, small &amp;#34;issues&amp;#34; on an overall excellent products</li>
            <li> I have an old model Rotodent that has worked well.  However, the switch corroded.  I have tried to obtain one form Rotodent.  I sent an email but received no answer.  I called the service line numerous times but no one answered.  After a considerable period of waiting, I was able to leave a message.  One time I received a call back but could not answer the phone.  The number left on the message was the service number.  I left several messages but never received a call back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rotodent&#x27;s service is as bad as it gets.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy another one.</li>
            <li> The Rotadent unit was highly recommended by my dentist, so I paid her $130 for the unit.  Unfortunately, the Rotadent toothbrush stopped charging within three months.  The dentist will not take the responsibility to return to Zila, the manufacturer.  When you call the support line at Zila, they send you to voice mail and never return your calls.  When the toothbrush is operating properly, it works great, but if you have any issues at all, good luck trying to get a competent person from Zila to handle a repair, because it just does not happen.  So for the past several months, I&#x27;ve had this very expensive toothbrush sitting in the original packaging hoping Zila will return one of my calls.  Do yourself a favor and buy a Phillips or OralB from your local SamsClub or Costco.  At least they have an adequate return policy when something breaks, then they have to deal with the manufacturer, not you.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush within three weeks.  It doesn&#x27;t start, then starts but will not shut off or it randomly changes speeds.  The warranty is not valid if bought here, so.... DO NOT BUY it!</li>
            <li> I bought a Rotadent at my Dentists office.  Within 3 months it broke and I was sent a new toothbrush through the Dentist office. Within 4 months the new Rotadent stopped working. I sent direct to Rotadent and they have not replaced and I get the run around. I&#x27;m going to buy a Philips.  Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Was stuck on Phillips Sonicare.  Dentist recomended Rotadent, so I thought I would try.  Now it seems that the Rotadent does a better job of cleaning, but takes longer.  If I am in a hurry, I still enjoy using my Sonicare.  Yes, I have two power toothbrushes by my sink, and I use them several times a day, and love the clean feeling after brushing.</li>
            <li> If you’re thinking about buying this product for gum disease, don’t waste your money or time. I bought it at my dentist’s suggestion after being diagnosed w/periodontal disease, and saw absolutely NO improvement in gum health or pocket reduction during the 1½ years I used it. In fact, I actually had to get a second deep cleaning less than 12 months after I started using it (mostly 4-5 mm pockets).  Zila’s marketing material suggests the brush will help to prevent / treat gum disease, which is totally misleading to the point of being fraudulent.  This brush does nothing to treat / prevent gum disease that an ordinary toothbrush doesn’t do.  Worse yet, the Rotadent is expensive, messy, and time-consuming to use.  My advise to those with gum disease is a normal soft bristle brush, twice daily flossing, and frequent professional cleanings (my pockets have gone from 4-5mms with the Rotadent to 2-4mms with a basic toothbrush).  Zila is clearly taking advantage of people while they’re desperate and vulnerable.  Don’t buy this or any other product from Zila!</li>
            <li> Due to gum problems after treatment for oral cancer, the Rotadent brush is the best solution for my oral care.  Unfortunately, over the past 15 years each brush I&#x27;ve purchased has had a shorter life span.  The one delivered less than a month ago needs to be recharged every 5-6 days.  In the past it would got 12 - 14 days and it had some energy.  This new brush is sluggish and since I still have an older brush, the difference is very obvious between the two.  My dentist no longer carries this brush so there is only a short 1 month guarantee through Amazon.  I have 3 days remaining and will probably return the brush.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the new rotadent toothbrush.  It&#x27;s better than the last one I had.  Love the charger!</li>
            <li> The brush heads only lasted about 1.5weeks of consistent use. They would crack at the base where it attached to the motor piece. The brush heads were really soft, which is great, but they&#x27;re 15 bucks and crack until they fall off while you&#x27;re brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called the customer service and they wouldn&#x27;t replace the motor, but gave me two free brush heads. They broke. The customer service lady was rude and it took 3 or 4 days to call me back after I left a message.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to replace the entire thing for a new one with my dentist, bc I bought it there, but the new one did the exact same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They get 1 star only bc the brush heads were soft. Otherwise I think this company should go out of business.</li>
            <li> I had a rotadent previously, then got a sonicare and switched back to rotadent. Rotadent showed noticeably better cleaning at my dental check-ups than sonicare. My teeth feel cleaner on a daily basis. Actually, I couldn&#x27;t wait for my sonicare to stop working so I could go back to a rotadent. My only issue is that the rotary head seems to slow down a bit if I put heavier pressure on it. Other than that, I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> While it worked, it did clean my teeth well, but it died after a few months of use.  I&#x27;m moving on to a competing product.</li>
            <li> I was surprised when my older model was no longer available.  But this one is a big improvement.  It keeps a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> Found it a bit rough at first. Went to lower speed it felt better for me. Like the new stand that keeps it always charged.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product.  It will completely just stop working and you have to start over in the process of using it.  I believed since it was so highly recommended by Dentists that it would be a great product. Just doesn&#x27;t live up to being a great product.</li>
            <li> The rotadent  plus brush was a Christmas gift for my son.&lt;br /&gt;He said it is the only kind he will use.</li>
            <li> This is the most Customer UNFRIENDLY company I have ever seen. They do not stand behind what they sell and do not care about the customers in any way. Being in sales and customer service for many years myself this company is will be what I use as an example of how NOT to do business to my future employees.</li>
            <li> The heads stopped spinning within 1.5 years!!! :(</li>
            <li> I like the way it works and its smaller, compact size.  However, there are a few things I don&#x27;t like:  1)  It&#x27;s harder to attach &amp; detach the brush heads than on the earlier model.  You have to twist them on &amp; off.  2)  The brush head holder case tends to fall off when moving the unit.  3)  When turning off, you have to hit the button a few times, as it goes through it&#x27;s various phases first.</li>
            <li> Wow Rotadent, great job on making what is possibly the worst quality electric toothbrush I have ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it actually works, it&#x27;s pretty good, great even. I think it does a better job than Sonicare or Oral-B, even their best models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that&#x27;s where the good part stops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is engineered like trash. Something in it is not waterproof, so the toothbrush actually ends up turning on by itself randomly at night, which is annoying, and secondly, tells you much about the poor construction. Then eventually it just stops working. Now granted, my Sonicare gave out after more than a year and now is refusing to charge, but this thing is refusing to turn on regardless of being able to charge, after just ONE MONTH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will admit that this is a good product in terms of how well it works... when it does work. Too bad it barely works in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and get something from Oral B or Sonicare. I honestly could care less about how amazing the Rotadent is when the Rotadent lasts about 1/10th as long as either of their competitors, for 1.5x the price.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t work right, the top part comes off of the stem because it doesn&#x27;t fit right. The old Rotodent&#x27;s worked better</li>
            <li> I purchased a Pro from my dentist at his recommendation, and have used it for over a year without a battery problem. I do charge it according to the instructions, which is to charge it fully, then unplug the charger and use it until it&#x27;s completely run down before charging it again. For the money though, it should have lithium batteries or an intelligent charger so you could just leave it plugged in continuously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spinning microfiber brush head really does seem to do an exceptional job on my teeth and gums, but you have to use it gently. I&#x27;ve broken three brush heads due to the poor design of the locking mechanism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve occasionally experienced weird behavior where it stops running and won&#x27;t restart without returning it to the charger. Fortunately for me, this has not been a constant issue, but it is annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather than spend any more money on this, I&#x27;m cutting my losses and going back to my faithful Nimbus microfiber brushes. Nimbus makes the finest manual brush money can buy, and with proper technique should do as good a job as the Rotodent. And, I&#x27;ve never had the Nimbus stop working for any reason. :)</li>
            <li> What a shame, stopped working after 6 months. VERY UPSET!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even last a year, bad quality</li>
            <li> Save your money and frustration.  I used the original product for many years and always felt the battery was weak.  I would have discarded it earlier, but I paid $150 for it and it was doing an adequate job, barely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally got tired of an paying excessive amount of money for brush heads who&#x27;s effectiveness seemed greatly reduced after just a couple months use.  The last (very last) brush head was all twisted after only four weeks use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one and only experience calling customer support was to a person who spent the time arguing with me about the cause of my problem, and was obviously frustrated that my lifetime warranty brush wasn&#x27;t listed in their system.  I registered it online when I purchased it from my dentist, who no longer sells Rotadent and I now understand why, and even have my original receipt and the printout when when I did register it.  It is not my fault that your company has since lost my registration information.  I can appreciate their frustration, but taking it out on the customer is not the way to go.  They were correct that my problem was actually the adapter and not the battery.  I really didn&#x27;t care, because I just wanted my brush to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently decided to purchase an Oral B 3000 [[ASIN:B003UKKHB4 Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + Gum Care Precision 3000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush 1 Count]], for half the price of a new Rotadent, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  I suggest you strongly consider one of the many alternatives available.</li>
            <li> This is my third rotadent- I&#x27;ve been using this type of toothbrush since 1998 and won&#x27;t use anything else! My dental hygenist agrees!</li>
            <li> Did a great job, while it lasted.  The on/off button broke after about 8 months.  Went back to my Oral B that was 5 years old when I bought the Rotadent.  The Rotadent did do a much better job at cleaning below the gum line with the sweep bristle head (which is why I bought it), but not worth buying again if most only last 6 - 9 months.  The Oral B is still going strong at 8 years.  Will buy another or consider a Sonicare next.</li>
            <li> I loved the toothbrush however, it does not hold the charge up to 2 weeks as the package says... actually its just good for one use. I put up with it for a few weeks until I realized that I wont be able to take my toothbrush with me when I travelled. :(  Im not sure if I will purchase a replacement and hope it doesnt have the same battery issue... if I do... Will be sure to purchase from website where its under warranty</li>
            <li> I DON&#x27;T THINK THAT THIS ROTODENT IS AS GOOD AS MY ORIGINAL , WHICH I BOUGHT FROM MY DENTIST WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT , MORE THAN 10 YEARS AGO . I&#x27;M NOT SO SURE THAT I WOULD RECOMMEND IT .</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd time I bought this model. Just like my first one, after 3 months, it doesn&#x27;t rotate anymore. I really like it when it was working but it doesn&#x27;t lasts.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t do it. It will break. We got one from our dentist, so we get lifetime warranty. This means calling them up about every month when it breaks, getting a new one, and calling up the next month. It is not worth the hassle. The first model was good, this one is bad, and the newest one is even worse. Our third generation one is dead now.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product Feb. 2013 and tooth brush handle stopped working only after six months. I confimend about the warrenty prior to the purchase from Amazon and now thy are giving hard time. Both the product and customer service are extremely of poor quality.</li>
            <li> The Rotadent, in theory, is terrific for dental hygiene. That said, it is a piece of junk. Lucky if it lasts 6 months. The warranty is useless. Zila wouldn&#x27;t honor the lifetime warranty from my dentist. They said, I quote, the Lifetime Warranty started the month after I bought my Rotadent. Who stays in business with that kind of response? Buy a Sonicare. Great customer service and well made.</li>
            <li> Brilliant machine  I now have two of them, one for home and one for travel.  I wouldn&#x27;t use any other type of toothbrush</li>
            <li> This is my second unit from this company, both have experience crash down and when writing to company not even an answer. Their product if it would work would be excellent but it seems that after a short period of time using the motor stops working and it would start again until finally would stop. I emailed Amazon and the promised to help, I&#x27;m still waiting.&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended at all</li>
            <li> I simply don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews as I&#x27;ve had such a wonderful experience with my Rotadent Plus toothbrush. It is gentle, yet cleans thoroughly and my teeth have never looked whiter or my gums healthier. The battery is great and the motor is very powerful yet not loud. I will not be switching to another brush.</li>
            <li> The locking mechanism on the heads is very poorly designed.  There is a very small, delicate bit of plastic that holds the head to the base.  For me, this bit of plastic falls apart every two weeks or so.  Eventually, the entire locking mechanism on the base fell off.  I did buy this from a dentist and they have replaced the base and two of the brushes.  The new one is starting to have the same problems.  I do enjoy the way my teeth feel after using this product but considering the design flaws, I would not advise buying it.  If anyone suspects that my problem can be solved please email me.</li>
            <li> I have used the Rotadent for 10 years because of the soft brush heads.  I bought a new Rotadent in 2013 and noticed that the brush heads have been changed to a different material.  The bristles are stiff and there a hard core in the middle of the bristles.  My dentist recommended changing to Oral B professional with extra soft head.  On the Oral B, the brush head is soft (just like the original Rotadent) and there is not hard core.  I loved the earlier versions of Rotadent and am very sorry to see the changes.  Would not recommend the Rotadent anymore.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush in 2011 and have had to replace it four times.  The company admits that the on/off switch is defective, but refuse to issue a different model or refund my money.  I would strongly advise that you purchase a different product!</li>
            <li> My old one lasted 10+ years and I trusted my history rather than the current reviews - my mistake.  Believe the reviews!  However good Rotadent was - they are no longer.  My &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; one is anemic - even after &amp;#34;fully&amp;#34; charging.  It does not hold a full charge for more than a couple of days.  So as soon as this one bites the dust (which won&#x27;t be long!) I will try another brand.  Fool me once - shame on you....fool me twice - shame on me&lt;br /&gt;Believe the Reviews!!</li>
            <li> I stopped using my Sonicare because my dentists said the sawing motion was eroding my gums and I bought this on his recommendation. The concept is that it is better for those with receding gums because of the soft bristles and slow speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it is cheaply made. It stops with very little pressure on the tooth. The gears started slipping in the 3rd week. I returned it to my dentist. The moral of the story is not to trust a product that does not compete in an open market and is sold primarily by dentists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So instead I bought an Oral B 3000  [[ASIN:B003UKKHB4 Oral-B Professional Care 3000 Electric Toothbrush, 1 Count]] and also bought the [[ASIN:B00006ANDK Oral-B Sensitive (3 Extra-Soft Brush heads)]] brushes. The 3000 is a much better product. It has a sensitive mode and also a red light that tells you when you are pressing too hard.</li>
            <li> I have used the rotadent classic for over 8 years. It has been great, but I upgraded to the new plus and I like the new features it has. The rotadent classic or plus is great for helping to keep the staining down from coffee and tea. Your teeth feel very clean when you are done and even better if you use the pro dentec toothpaste gel with the rotadent.</li>
            <li> Rota-dent refused to honor their lifetime warranty on the battery.  I purchased two Rota-Dents from my dentist about 3-4 years ago and Rota-dent promised a lifetime warranty on the battery if I turned in my warranty registration before their specified deadline.  Can&#x27;t remember, might have been within 30 days of purchase.  I called and asked them before sending in my warranty registration card if somehow I could get a confirmation.  They said that they did not send receipts but assured me that they keep excellent records and that it was not necessary.  Guess what....the battery failed and they do not have my warranty registration but told me that if my dentist provided a receipt that they would honor the warranty.  My dentist retired and I no longer have access to my file.  Bottom line; sorry, unfortunately, we can not replace the battery.</li>
            <li> This is my third Rotadent Plus toothbrush and my fourth Rotadent toothbrush. First, the positive aspects. I think that it does a great job cleaning your teeth. Running your tongue along the back teeth after a thorough brushing feels almost as smooth as just coming from a dental cleaning. My orthodontist commented on how clean my teeth were. This is only reason why I keep sticking with this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the negative, this is my fourth one in about 10 years. The first one died of tropical humidity, so I don&#x27;t blame the company. I then bought the Rotadent Plus, which was advertised a waterproof, so I used it in the shower. Bad idea, the unit should be kept dry. After a few months, the power switch developed the classic problems and the unit completely failed. Unlike the original Rotadent, you can&#x27;t clean the electrical contact yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose I could have saved myself some aggravation and purchased it from a dentist, because it then comes with a \\&quot;lifetime warranty\\&quot; on the power handle. However, inspection of the warranty conditions reveals a surprisingly hefty \\&quot;exchange fee\\&quot; for a defective toothbrush. Essentially, you are almost paying for a new power handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most recent two (I keep one at work and one at home) are still working, but one developed the same kind of switch problem after normal use (I never used it in the shower). I carefully dried it out and now it seems to work fine. However, I am careful to remove the toothbrush head after use, and then I thoroughly dry out the base, making sure there is no accumulated water. Also, when I brush, I keep the base either upside down or horizontal to avoid any water running from the brush head to the handle--rather ridiculous precautions for a \\&quot;waterproof\\&quot; toothbrush. I am sticking with Rotadent for now because it is great for people with braces. Once the braces are off and my current units fail, I will move on to another company.</li>
            <li> The parts are expensive to buy and the head set is the real cost.  The battery fade after 1 year of use/</li>
            <li> had the classic model 3 years-trouble with brushes coming off no lock-slow operation-lousy charger system-new brush heads frequently faulty-on/off switch bad design failed.  The plus has corrected all these problems-heads lock on the body-speedy operation-charger cradle can always be left on cant overcharge-sealed unit no water can get in.Teeth feel like I just left the dentist after using the flat and pointed brush.Will be extending my time between visits to the dentist</li>
            <li> I had an original Rotadent and it was a great toothbrush. It lasted for years and years, and worked well.&lt;br /&gt;But eventually it wore out. Alas, you can&#x27;t buy it any more. But there is this \\&quot;Rota Dent Plus\\&quot;. So I ordered one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mistake. It doesn&#x27;t have enough power. The battery didn&#x27;t last. The handle is shaped differently, so that it is much&lt;br /&gt;harder for me to hold. It takes more space on the countertop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After months of fussing with it I gave up and bought a Sonicare. We shall see if it does the job. Can&#x27;t be any worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fear that a real reliable decent  Rotadent is a thing of the past, and that we&#x27;ll all have to find a new brand.</li>
            <li> It has no power and in general is not a good electric toothbrush.  I had a braun before and it is 100 tmes better.  If I could return for a credit, I would.</li>
            <li> Loved the toothbrush when it worked, but quit after 5 months.  Contacted the seller, but they told me they do not take returns after 30 days and to contact rotadent.  Rotadent will not honor the warranty unless purchased by a Dentist.  If you are going to get one, get it from a dentist so you can at least get the warranty.    Each Rotadent® Plus power handle and charger unit is warranted to be free from defects in material and workmanship. The power handle is warranted for so long as you own it and operate it according to instructions. The charger unit is warranted for one (1) year from purchase. To activate the warranty, you must register online at [...] (or [...] for Canadian residents) or return the warranty registration card by mail within 30 days of receipt. This warranty does not cover:    Rotadent® Plus rotary toothbrushes obtained from a source other than a dental office.   Brush heads or components other than the power handle and/or charging base.   Any defects which do not affect the ability of the Rotadent® Plus to function properly.   Shipping and handling costs to and from the manufacturer for warranty service.   Misuse, abuse, damage caused by electrical power surge or operation in ways not recommended or authorized by Zila.</li>
            <li> I Purchased from my dentist the Rotadent Rota Dent Plus 2 months ago.  I tried charging the brush, complying with recommended 24hr charge requirement, and 24hrs later the brush would not charge.  In order to resolve this issue I called Zila Inc. left 3 messages (during the lapse of 2 days) on their phone line and none was returned. I brought the issue to my dentist, who mentioned, after the fact, that many of his clients had complaints with the brush not charging at all. So to sum this up: 1.-Right out of the box the brush is worthless! 2.-Customer service stinks! 3.-Brush is expensive. BUYER BEWARE...PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT AT YOUR OWN PERIL!</li>
            <li> I did not like he new rota dent Plus,  as it did not work well with a converter as stated in the instruction book.&lt;br /&gt; Amazon was very diligent in refunding me after I returned the article and I thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering the Rota Dent brush older model (which I have used for years) from you, after the holiday season is over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not like the plus brush,, but most certainly am happy with the service received from Amazon. Thankyou&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doug Rhyno</li>
            <li> New Info: I contacted Zila and they are supporting this. They charge $15 shipping if not from a Dental office but they do fix. Mine went crazy and is unusable, but they are replacing it. So, although I do not know if this a common problem, at least they support.&lt;br /&gt;Also, they STRONGLY recommend you drain the battery to dead about 3 or 4 times a year and then recharge for 24 hours. They suggest this will fix the problems since the battery will be reset. They told me to keep plugged in at all times except when doing this complete discharge.&lt;br /&gt;This may be what prevents these problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had this for 1 year to the day; I have used it every day with no problems, but now it keeps turning on by itself and will not turn off most of the time. I waited on hold with Zila for an hour and finally left a message - so not a good sign.&lt;br /&gt;I had a previous Rotadent for 6 years with no problems at all; I only replaced it because the battery life was slowly getting worse and worse. So, this is very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;As others have noted, calling Zila (manufacturer) gets you on endless hold. You leave a message for them and they do not call back. I have tried multiple times and had no response. This is not a company that supports its customers as far as I can see. Not worth buying a product that fails in under a year and then is not supported; that is not $120 well spent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame, because the cleaning action of the Rotadent is unsurpassed.  I&#x27;ve owned two of the previous models, both of which eventually died because of a battery, and reluctantly upgraded to this new model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The simple issue is that the new brush head design is tragically flawed.  In about a month, give or take two weeks, something breaks inside of the 90-degree joint in the brush head, and it catastrophically fails.  You can keep buying new brush heads at $30 a pop, but they will keep breaking.  Sometimes you can get a couple of months from one.  Sometimes they break in two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if the battery issues were fixed or not, because I burned through a half-dozen brush heads before I gave up.  For all I know, the new battery lasts a decade.  Maybe the person who fishes mine out of the garbage will find out.  I&#x27;d send this in for warranty repair, but I&#x27;m guessing I will get the runaround because I did not purchase this from the dentist, and there&#x27;s probably some fine print saying the brush heads aren&#x27;t covered.  Life&#x27;s too short - I junked it, learned my lesson, and switched back to a Sonicare.  It doesn&#x27;t clean as much, but getting ten fillings done a year would be cheaper than buying brush heads, and less painful than trying to get a warranty replacement, even if my dentist skipped the novocaine.</li>
            <li> The design itself is very good. Zila has some serious quality control issue when it comes to the battery. The first series was Nicad which were ok but not so convenient since you couldn&#x27;t leave it on the charger like the competition. Then they moved to Lith batteries and I must say there is a decent defect rate. Flash back to Xbox 360&#x27;s red ring 30% failure rate. I already had 2 newer models sealed from factory fail to charge on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Troubleshooting tip: assuming the outlet is ok, the battery may recover if you leave it charging for about 24hrs or slightly longer. Apparently there is a chance the battery may recover to working status if it jump starts with the trickling charge from the base. How do I know? Of the three that failed, I felt the bottom of the handle after hours on the charger. I felt slight warmth off the one so I just kept them all on the charger for another day. Guess what...the 1 recovered and is fully functional. Give it a shot, what do u have to lose. Hope this helps. Otherwise, if u have an oralB get the ortho or end tufted head and it will reach like the Rotadent but just different motion. My oralB never failed me so ill stick to it.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Leaves your mouth with a great clean feeling&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Provides a deep clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Replacement brush head cost</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about 1.5 years. At first it took a bit getting used to since I never used an electric toothbrush with a small head. But after few days you love it, it cleans really well, has briefs stops every 30 seconds to help as a reminder to go to the next section of teeth, and was quite powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 6-9 months the heads stop spinning and you have to turn on/off to get it working again for another 20-30 seconds. Figured out that&#x27;s a sign you need to change the head (and at about $8 per head it&#x27;s not cheap).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually the unit has just lost so much power that barely letting it touch your teeth makes it spin so slow or not at all! My wife&#x27;s is doing the same within a few weeks of mine doing it (&lt;1.5 years in). Maybe an issue with nickel cad batteries as some other reviews mention, maybe issue with internal corrosion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless we have lifetime warranty and called their warranty department. Be prepared to stay on hold for hours, eventual getting routed to a different dept even after talking to someone for 20 mins. And then.... Expect to pay $18 shipping for each new unit that will arrive in 5 days!! Are you kidding?? Probably costs them $5 to make this cheap crap and max $5 to ship it with ground shipping... So in the end they are likely MAKING more money off me each time I&#x27;ll get a replacement.  Too bad I had bought 6 replacement heads last year and need to make my money back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually it will be back to regular toothbrushes or maybe trying Phillips out.</li>
            <li> I really have only used this for about a week. I wasn&#x27;t even really given the choice - the dentist handed me this system and said I needed to use this to repair my gums and I was too... myself... to push any further about it. It is a pain to start with - increases the tooth brushing time I&#x27;m used to taking with my oral-b... but this is a good thing. It is no more messy than any other brush I have used. It does, however, slow down at certain teeth or pressure on the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My routine so far (therapeutic aftercare for deep cleaning at dentist): brush teeth with either soft brush and tooth paste or my oral b and toothpaste... use rotadent with the fluoride rinse... rinse mouth with leftover rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is done at night. Afterwards, my teeth feel so clean. My gums seem to be getting better. I have just started using it in the morning as well, with regular toothpaste... I put a little on the brush and then spread it on the teeth before turning the brush on. This is how my dentist told me to use it and it does work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not yet comfortable using this as my only toothbrush - so it is adding extra time to routine - but it really does leave my mouth feeling significantly more healthy</li>
            <li> This is a one of THE WORSE toothbrush that I have ever had.&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy any product from JANNS MARKETPLACE. YOU WILL NOT HAVE WARRANTY ON THAT.</li>
            <li> I bought my rotadent plus from my dentist, it lasted 2 months, called customer service and they took my address and said they would send another in 7-10 days, one month later I still did not have it, called again and they were really nice and said they would send it overnight, got it the next day, only problem it died in two months. talked to my dentist about it and I guess the older model is ok, that is what he has, but he said that almost everyone he talks to that uses the new on has the same problem, it dies in two months.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this several years ago and I&#x27;m on my third one ( I keep one overseas ). The $35 dollar shipping charge was pure stealing and I don&#x27;t know how or why Amazon let them get away with it but I suffered through it because this is the only one I want. If you have braces or are getting &amp;#34;long in the tooth&amp;#34; the tip brush is perfect.</li>
            <li> This new model is nice but is completely unadaptable to prior models so you can not interuse at all. Plus it has no european converter to charge.</li>
            <li> I have receding gums and my dentist insists this is the only toothbrush that won&#x27;t cause further damage. The only good thing about this toothbrush is the brush heads are much softer than other brands. Unfortunately, they don&#x27;t last as long and the replacement brush heads cost twice as much. So instead of spending $30 per year on brush heads, I&#x27;m now spending $75 per year. The other thing I don&#x27;t like about this toothbrush is it doesn&#x27;t have a battery level indicator. You just have to guess if the battery is low, and a couple of times the battery ran dead while I was still brushing. Now I keep it plugged in all the time, which uses more electricity, which also adds to the cost of this already expensive toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This Rota Dent Plus is a great step up from the regular Rota Dent toothbrush model.  This toothbrush is used by both my husband and myself, and does a great cleaning job.</li>
            <li> sealed rechargeable battery turn on/off by itself after about 8 months of uses there is no way to replace the battery,  wont buy this product again!</li>
            <li> A total waste of money!  I had Rotadents years ago and they were great.  I had to get a new one and it lasted just a couple of months.  I am not able to contact the company as they NEVER answer their phone, so essentially the warranty is void and useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a waste!  Too bad as it was a great toothbrush in the past.  Looking for a good one to replace the one I have that has gone dead after just a couple of months.</li>
            <li> I bought the Rotadent Plus for my daughter as a gift.  She used it for a short while and put it away.  She said the brushes were too big.  When she came to visit me several months later I told her to bring it to me.  I tried it and really liked it but after just 2 weeks it wouldn&#x27;t work any more.  I would push the on button and it wouldn&#x27;t turn on.  I put it in the charger and it started running and wouldn&#x27;t stop.  It is a big disappointment to spend the money it costs and not be able to use it.  I&#x27;ve had an OralB Triumph for several years and it is still going strong.  Too bad they can&#x27;t make the Rotadent that well.  If you purchase a Rotadent there is a good chance you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I used to have a Rotadent for years but it finally died. I tried to get along without it by using regular brushes and other electric toothbrushes. I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore and purchased this.....What a difference!</li>
            <li> As so many others have stated, I bought my first Rotodent from my dentist in the &#x27;90&#x27;s.  I am just replacing it,  only because the charge does not hold very long.  Received my new one yesterday and  disappointed to find out that the warranty is not covered except when purchasing from a dentist.  This should have been noted by the seller.  A new product is a new product, regardless where it is purchased.  This rule really stinks.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent toothbrush. They improved on the reason why my old Roto went bad; rusted electrical connections with the charger. This new one does away with any direct metal connection that can rust out due to all the water a toothbrush is near. Great tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Okay, but would have preferred to charge it with a detachable charging cord (as the older models). It would have a more pleasing appearance on the counter top.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush through my dentist. By trusting my dentist, I bought this item instantly without doing any form of research. At first, I love this brush. I did notice that if I press down too hard, the brush would stop spinning. However, my biggest pet peeve is that the THE BRUSH HEAD STOPS WORKING AFTER 2 MONTHS! Initally, I thought the battery died or some sort, but after switching to a new head, it worked again. Two months later, the two month old brush head died again! The customer service at Zila is HORRIBLE! Each brush head is $35 and it only last for 2 months! I do NOT recommend this prodcut what so ever! I wish I did my research before buying this peice of junk! Stay away and Get Oral B or Sonicare cuz this company is a scam!</li>
            <li> I do not generally trust online reviews. I did not believe the bad review for this vendor and purchased a rotadent plus. It was defective. The vendor told me it was under warrantee and I should return it to manufacturer to receive a new rotadent. When I pointed out that the warrantee was only valid when purchased from a dentist he instructed me to lie to the manufacturer and say it was purchased from a dentist. I let him know that I would be posting a negative review and his response was \\&quot;Have fun with that.\\&quot; This is not the customer service I have come to expect from Amazon vendors which is why I did not believe the online bad review. I will believe bad online reviews on Amazon in the future. It appears Amazon will let any vendor use their site for sales even if they do not offer appropriate customer service.</li>
            <li> Both brushes included with the toothbrush have broken.  The tabs that hold the brush on the motor unit are not sturdy enough to keep the brush on the motor unit.  This is unacceptable performance.</li>
            <li> Our dentist told us to get this toothbrush.  It does a great job of cleaning your teeth without damaging your gums but it&lt;br /&gt;does take some getting used to.</li>
            <li> I had purchased the original rotadent many years ago, and it finally was no longer working, so I purcased a rotadent Plus toothbrush, and am very satisfied with it. It seems to be doing a super job on my teeth.</li>
            <li> This thing completely died and I&#x27;ve had it for less than two months.  I&#x27;m very disappointed since I spent over $120 on it!  It shows that it&#x27;s charging (the light comes on) but the toothbrush itself won&#x27;t turn on.  The charge was progressively getting worse since I bought it.  It said that each charge should last about two weeks.  When I first got it it lasted for over a week but then it went to lasting just two days then not working at all.</li>
            <li> Rotadent stopped working after just a few months.  First it would not turn off.  Now it does not turn on.  Amazon does not disclose that the warranty does not apply if purchased through Amazon.  This was a total loss.  Stay away.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years.  It&#x27;s a great product, with one exception.  The design of the brush mounting is very poor.  There is a very thin strip of apparently brittle plastic on the mounting end of the brush that always breaks long before the heads are worn out.  It&#x27;s nothing for a brush to only last a week and they rarely last longer than two weeks.  I do make a conscious effort not to apply any pressure when brushing for this reason.  Constantly replacing brushes gets very expensive when brushes are a good $15 each. Better materials and/or design in this one area would make it a great product.  But as it is, I am looking for a good durable toothbrush.  Any suggestions?</li>
            <li> Died/froze up after less than 6 months use</li>
            <li> This is not the electronic toothbrush to purchase. It has a very defective battery design and you&#x27;ll likely need to replace it before you even get 6 months to a year&#x27;s usage out of it. Many dentists push this brush on their patients because they get a sizable kickback, and not because this is a better brush. In fact, professional testing and reviews show that the brush does not perform well and has battery problems--they use old battery technology, really cheap stuff from China.  Do your own homework or you&#x27;ll be sorry. You&#x27;ll be really sorry when you buy one of these brushes, have problems with it, and discover that the company that now sells these things, DenMat, has about the worst customer service you&#x27;ll find in the U.S. It&#x27;s the perfect storm--a badly designed product sold by a a non-supportive company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the battery goes out on you after a little use you&#x27;ll be stuck. Your teeth will start rotting because you can&#x27;t brush them; you&#x27;ll gums will suffer. Your dentist will yell at you for not brushing properly. You&#x27;ll call the company that makes these brushes and they&#x27;ll hassle you about your warranty. They&#x27;ll try to hit you up you for more money as if the defective design is your fault. You&#x27;ll get annoyed and go to Youtube looking for answers. You&#x27;ll find an unauthorized video showing you how to replace the battery with a hammer and duct tape:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;uWRQ9m1k9tg&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll get depressed and find another Youtube video telling you that even the Justin Bieber singing electric toothbrush outperforms the Rotadent:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;9-_43GtYhE0&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll feel stupid and wish you had read the reviews on Amazon instead of listening to your dentist, who was more interested in sending his kids to Harvard than taking care of your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy Rotadent and don&#x27;t lose your teeth.</li>
            <li> i love these brushes, but they don&#x27;t last very long, the last one, which was a replacement for my first one, only lasted 3 months, the one before that a little over a year...so save money and buy online because you pay a lot more for the &#x27;lifetime&#x27; guarantee, and you don&#x27;t know how long it will last anyway....</li>
            <li> This is the worst product I ever had. DO NOT BUY. I used to use sonicare complete. My dentist recommend this to me and advocate that it has lifetime warrenty. After two weeks&#x27; use, the battery can not last more than a day. You have to charge it everyday. Since I bought two at the same time, I took out the other one and it is dead again after two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I went back to the website and it has only ONE YEAR WARRENTY!&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, do not waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> Piece of junk.No more than 6 months battery,with correct initial charge period and 2 times used per day.Do not spend your money.</li>
            <li> The best electric brush for myself.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  I purchased a Rota Dent Plus from my dentist at her recommendation (I now believe she&#x27;s getting a kickback and this is part of her scheme to put her kids through Ivy League Colleges).  The brush heads are expensive and don&#x27;t last very long.  I had a Braun before this and the Rota Dent doesn&#x27;t clean any better despite the platinum price.  Most disappointing is that after a little over a year the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; button has started to act up.  Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t.  Of course it&#x27;s now past the warranty.  I just ordered a good old German engineered top-of-the line Braun at less than half the price.  My last Braun lasted almost 15 years.  Be forewarned about Rota Dent.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Rotadent Plus for about 4 months and if you have sensitive gums like I do, it is the toothbrush for you.  It&#x27;s true, if you don&#x27;t buy from a dentist the warranty is void and no returning.  I bought from my dentist and they keep on file for me.  Believe it is a lifetime warranty.  Much better than oral B&#x27;s sonic or sonicare.  So far no problems at all and I leave it in the cradle all the time, don&#x27;t understand other reviewers that have had problem with that.  Brushes are expensive but important to change every 3 months.</li>
            <li> Thought I would try a newer model.  Find the button pushing speeds awkward to use.&lt;br /&gt;Rotodent is still an excellent product for my teeth.</li>
            <li> At first I loved this toothbrush and how clean my mouth and teeth felt after using it.  But after just having it for four months, it&#x27;s broken.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the battery or something internal, but it won&#x27;t turn on at all now.  Save your money, buy something else.  I&#x27;ve never been so disappointed in something that I bought on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I bought the Rotadent Plus at my dentist office less than a year ago. I love the way it cleans but I&#x27;ve had to replace it twice and now my third one is failing, all in less than a year. Rotadent replaced them all free of charge, but I&#x27;m getting tired of calling Rotadent and sending them back.  I think the produce design is great but there are clearly problems with the manufacture.</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these through my dentist. It comes with a lifetime warranty, so when the first one died in 6 months I called the company and they sent me a new one. Now, just 2 months later, the second one has failed. I will see if they will take it back...but overall, I would prefer a quality product. I am sure there are better choices.</li>
            <li> WARNING!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this model of the Rotodent, the power button does not work. It&#x27;s expensive and I left it too long before I realized it wasn&#x27;t working as it should and then it did n&#x27;t at all.Of course this was when I had no return time left. I had the OLD model with a rocker switch for 15 yrs so I got sucked in .Don&#x27;t you do it,I&#x27;m trying to save you $150.00 so please listen . I searching for an older model but never this one....I&#x27;m using a manual toothbrush which doesn&#x27;t work like the Rotodent .</li>
