            <li> I was given one of the samples by my hair dresser and loved it.  I ordered the small bottle that I received and it has absolutely no fragrance to  it.</li>
            <li> Not worththe price VERY small and its bot a spray on it baded on</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay I believe I have it confused with another scent</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE SMELL OF THIS PERFUME :)</li>
            <li> I might were sop or deodorant for the care my husband pays to my perfumes. It&#x27;s kind of a game for me to see if he notices,  a 7 year old game. So I bought this one because I just love Marc Jacobs. Know I love him even more. I win the game! My significant other actually turned around and sniffed me! Well done Mr Jacobs and 5 stares for the delivery and packaging. Also, I loved the surprise that came with my perches.</li>
            <li> I recommend a reseller</li>
            <li> Small bottle is perfect size for trying out this scent.  Very pretty and have received many compliments on it.  Came quickly in the mail.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to pay the top dollar for this in the department store and buying this little guy really scratched my itch to have this....without the huge investment.  It is Iddy biddy, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I smells so good. Love marc jacobs. I wish I had the whole bottle! Smells like just like daisies , heavenly</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this and really love the scent so I decided to buy a little bit bigger size. I wear different perfumes so I prefer smaller sizes as they seem to last forever.</li>
            <li> I love the light playful springtime fragrance.  It just doesn&#x27;t last on me. Maybe it&#x27;s my chemistry, won&#x27;t blame the fragrance itself.  It&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance for the summer.</li>
            <li> Had a sample so had to get some.  (The little bottle since it&#x27;s not cheap)  Very light and summery.  Not sure if it smells like daisies though.  But although it&#x27;s cute, I really don&#x27;t like the flower on the lid.  Makes it harder to open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;MEF</li>
            <li> I ordered this little bottle for my girl friend.. we wanted to test it and see if it smelled good on her, before we spent a lot of money.  thank god we did.. we did not like this smell on her..</li>
            <li> Arrived on time , does not have spray nossle., smells great</li>
            <li> ...am on my way to get a bigger version of this....it is so flowery and the scent is gentle to the nose and very femimine.....suggest it if you want to try it out!.....</li>
            <li> I love this scent, and the little bottle is great for your purse or carry on.  The bottle hold about  a 2-3 week supply, depending how much you use each day.  I use just a little bit for a delicate scent.  This size also make it great for sampling this perfume.</li>
            <li> Top service. And the seller is very helpful and prices are great... Thanks and I will continue to order more</li>
            <li> I tried it when I got a sample by Sephora, and absolutely fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> i love the smell. i bought this for my girlfriend on her wedding day but it came totally battered up. The mini design is great for the purse though</li>
            <li> my daugter loved this gift</li>
            <li> Very disappointed this doesn&#x27;t have a spray top!</li>
            <li> Is a gift but came quickly and was as advertised</li>
            <li> I got this for my mom and she really likes it!  The bottle is cute and she likes the fragrance, very feminine!</li>
            <li> It smells really pretty however the scent only last about 2 hrs before it fades and you can no longer smell a trace of it on your skin.</li>
            <li> Smells lovely! Arrived in good time. It&#x27;s a small bottle however the scent is dainty but powerful so a little dab will do ya just fine... on your pulse points (neck, wrists, etc).  I don&#x27;t see why I would need a bigger bottle than this one. It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> too small for the price</li>
