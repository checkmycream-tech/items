            <li>It&#x27;s great for what im going to use it for!!!</li>
            <li>I was very impressed by the length.</li>
            <li>Perfect for our Sonny and Cher Skit!</li>
            <li>I saw this wig and thought it would probably be my best option.  </li>
            <li>The fiber of the wig itself was great</li>
            <li>I love the wig!!</li>
            <li>A good buy.</li>
            <li>a good buy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d still recommend it but doubling up is probably wise.</li>
            <li>Worked perfect for my Princess Jasmine out fit.</li>
            <li>; I didn&#x27;t measure it, but it seems a good bit longer than in the picture.</li>
            <li>But for the price, this is a really good wig.</li>
            <li>Shipper was good at communicating and a pleasure to work with.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Very lovely wig.</li>
            <li>This wig is amazing.</li>
            <li>This wig is nice, but it tangles a lot which hampers styling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good wig, but it could be better.</li>
            <li>After that it was nice.</li>
            <li>The fibers of the wig feel nice</li>
            <li>Super great for the price.</li>
            <li>All of them came tangled beyond repair, when i tried to brush them with a wig brush bunches of hair fell out, the wigs are NOT 40&amp;#34; like they say it is, its more like 25&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Dollar store wigs are probably much better than these ones.</li>
            <li>All in all, a lovely wig, and</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Otherwise I love it</li>
            <li>but it made it unwearable without stacking another wig on top of it, defeating the purpose.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I know most people are using this wig for anime cosplay.  </li>
            <li>This wig is longer than Morticia&#x27;s hair but that&#x27;s much easier to overlook since it looks so great, even with my dreads underneath.  </li>
            <li>Great, high quality wig.</li>
            <li>Pretty good wig for the price.</li>
            <li>Wig looked realistic and had a nice sheen to it!</li>
            <li>Great quality even though shipping is kind of long.</li>
            <li>Otherwise very nice and extremely soft.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s an easy fix.</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s great quality and the free wig cap is nice.</li>
            <li>This is so so good, very soft.</li>
            <li>its a beautiful and long wig that doesn&#x27;t tangle easy.</li>
            <li>but with a quick brush through its good as new!</li>
            <li>I feel these wigs are worth 5$ and nothing more.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel as cheap as one of the witches wigs from Party City.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited to see it all together with the costume I made.  </li>
            <li>Nice natural looking part.</li>
            <li>but I ca deal with it , overall gorgeous wig</li>
            <li>Came in quick.</li>
            <li>I do not recommend heating the hair  to style because it burns quickly.</li>
            <li>i may get some wigs just for fun because they are such good quality for a steal of a price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The skin top is a nice touch and adds to the realism, but there are bangs sewn in front of the skin part which are the same length as the rest of the wig and are very unruly to sweep and pin out of the face.</li>
            <li>great condition, exactly what i expected</li>
            <li>well worth the price, even if it&#x27;s not the 40&amp;#34; advertized.  </li>
            <li>Very shiny, very soft and very easy to tangle.</li>
            <li>It got tangled pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>but it looked right.</li>
            <li>It was packaged very nicely with the hair in a loose ponytail and wrapped in a net, so it was easy to unfold and wasn&#x27;t tangled at all, and there were no weird kinks in the hair.</li>
            <li>This wig isn&#x27;t as thick as I had hoped it would be, but there is still plenty of hair and the hair is beautiful.</li>
            <li>This wig was so cute and not cheap looking like most costume wigs I find</li>
            <li>thick coverage (no bald spots), soft hair, arrived perfectly combed out.</li>
            <li>Has a natural part with a skin top to make it look realistic.</li>
            <li>This is my first wig</li>
            <li>I need a wig because Morticia most definitely does not have dreads.  </li>
            <li>It feels so soft and natural, easy to brush and looks very realistic when worn.</li>
            <li>totally amazing product for so little $.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>haha)</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t really part it.</li>
            <li>This would not pass for real hair.</li>
            <li>Looks and feels like real hair.</li>
            <li>The wig came very frizzy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;shipping is free, but can take up to a month, so if you&#x27;re ordering for a specific event- order ASAP.</li>
            <li>And i have a very small head, yet even on the loosest the straps will go, it does not even fit on the top of my head.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since my original feedback form however, this company has been harassing me with daily emails and phone calls wanting to give me a $4 refund.</li>
            <li>Once you stack on the second wig it would be as full as a real head of hair.</li>
            <li>Which is sweet, except it is starting to feel like harassment.</li>
            <li>High quality.</li>
            <li>This wig fits great and does not fit too tight.</li>
            <li>I bought this wig for my girlfriend for her Morticia costume, and the wig is so much higher quality than those at the local Halloween/costume stores.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very thick and it sheds a lot</li>
            <li>The wig was great otherwise except for the fact that it is very thin in the back as previously mentioned and the netting easily showed through when I wore it.</li>
            <li>The hair is soft, and the ends feel fuller than the rest of the wig.</li>
            <li>Detangling it was a pain after opening the packaging the first time, and it did shed a bit, but neither proved to be a long term issue.</li>
            <li>The hair is very silky and shiny and came with a hair net.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m hoping it would disappear once it&#x27;s been aired out.</li>
            <li>It is pretty thin, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to pose a huge problem.</li>
            <li>We will definitely check this store &amp; brand for future purchases first.</li>
            <li>Finally, it comes with no bangs or layers cut into it, which is what I was particularly looking for.</li>
            <li>its not a super thick wig but its still good.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that this wig is not, in fact, 40&amp;#34;--it&#x27;s more like 28-1/2&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>One black, one red, one light blonde.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s still pretty dang long, of course (I think it comes down to my waist, and I&#x27;m not particularly short for a lady), and I didn&#x27;t actually need it to be 40&amp;#34; for my purposes, but others should be aware.</li>
            <li>I have bought other Mapo wigs that are of much better quality and thickness, so I&#x27;m not sure what to say.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, the fibers are very soft and smooth, and the wig is not too thin (it is thinner in the back, but the sides are where that really counts, I suppose).</li>
            <li>As soon as I took it out of the bag it was tangled and frayed, not to mention it was super thin nearly bald.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit large for my head but a few bobby pins can fix that.</li>

            <li> That&#x27;s still pretty dang long, of course (I think it comes down to my waist, and I&#x27;m not particularly short for a lady), and I didn&#x27;t actually need it to be 40&amp;#34; for my purposes, but others should be aware.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a bit large for my head but a few bobby pins can fix that.</li>
            <li> So overall, I would say not any better or worse quality than any other costume wig we&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> A little thinner than expected , tangles fast</li>
            <li> The wigs are soft and jet black and were in two separate zip-lock bags.</li>
            <li> The wig itself is incredibly soft and is the correct length, but the part where your head goes is so small it barely stays on my head.</li>
            <li> It also seems less prone to tangling than other long wigs I&#x27;ve had, but I think that&#x27;s because the others were curly, while this one is straight.</li>
            <li> Wig is very thin and tangles easily.  </li>
            <li> you could see the hair cap and tracks in the back, there was no way of hiding it at all the tracks were showing because of how thin it is, and one side of the wig had more hair than the other .. waste of my money I don&#x27;t recommended.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair that was wrapped a bit lumpily so that might have contributed</li>
            <li> Leave to air dry, no heat</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty thin, and mine came tangled.</li>
            <li> I had black hairs constantly tangled in my fingers, clothes, phone cord, etc,</li>
            <li> It even came with a little net wig cap.</li>
            <li> and so I am inexperienced with the combing and brushing of one, and the brush I use makes it shed.</li>
            <li> I ended up chucking it out of frustration after soaking it twice in fabric softener and spending hours with a wide toothed comb.</li>
            <li> Wig was not what I expected it to be it was so tangled</li>
            <li> I spent an hour untangling it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long, and it&#x27;s black.</li>
            <li> It shed long black hairs everywhere.</li>
            <li> Looking at the Morticia and other long black wigs, I realized they would not work with dreads.  </li>
            <li> Some of the hair does shed but not as bad as cheap halloween wigs.</li>
            <li> and it goes down to my butt</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewer that the back is a little thin.</li>
            <li> It smelled a little plasticky (?)</li>
            <li> It is CONSTANTLY in my face, its so whispy and easily tangled its very annoying.</li>
            <li> They already looked unnaturally thick on top with very artificial looking parts.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 5&#x27;6, this wig ended a little bit past my waist.</li>
            <li> Wears it everyday!</li>
            <li> Really bad quality, hair comes off when brushed / combed.</li>
            <li> I had to cut it because it was so uneven and weirdly cut.</li>
            <li> I needed it for cosplay, it is way too thin and very delicate.</li>
            <li> I was so hyped when I got it and then discovered how thin it was...</li>
            <li> but it came so severely tangled and thin</li>
            <li> Its a really thin wig</li>
            <li> Ordered 2 pieces just in case it was too thin.</li>
            <li> This is one of those wigs where you can tell is fake.</li>
            <li> (a LOT of cutting and styling</li>
            <li> Useless dollar store pieces of crap.</li>
            <li> It tangled so badly</li>
            <li> Tangles Really bad</li>
            <li> This DOES NOT frame the face at all even after cutting it to frame my face it still slides annoyingly into my eyes.</li>

            <li> Fast delivery. Great product! Wig looked realistic and had a nice sheen to it!</li>
            <li> These are terrible wigs. DO NOT BUY. I ordered 3. One black, one red, one light blonde. All of them came tangled beyond repair, when i tried to brush them with a wig brush bunches of hair fell out, the wigs are NOT 40&amp;#34; like they say it is, its more like 25&amp;#34;. And i have a very small head, yet even on the loosest the straps will go, it does not even fit on the top of my head. And there are spots where the wigs are see through. I feel these wigs are worth 5$ and nothing more. Useless dollar store pieces of crap. Actually, nevermind. Dollar store wigs are probably much better than these ones.</li>
            <li> I bought this wig for my girlfriend for her Morticia costume, and the wig is so much higher quality than those at the local Halloween/costume stores. The hair feels like well-kept hair, not like stringy polyester. We will definitely check this store &amp; brand for future purchases first.</li>
            <li> got tangled even before we tried it</li>
            <li> Came in quick. Not knotted up, well packaged. Came with hair net as well.</li>
            <li> As soon as I took it out of the bag it was tangled and frayed, not to mention it was super thin nearly bald. It tangled so badly it&#x27;s not even fixable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long, and it&#x27;s black. It got tangled pretty quickly. It shed long black hairs everywhere. While my daughter was wearing it I had black hairs constantly tangled in my fingers, clothes, phone cord, etc, which was annoying. So overall, I would say not any better or worse quality than any other costume wig we&#x27;ve purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my original feedback form however, this company has been harassing me with daily emails and phone calls wanting to give me a $4 refund. Which is sweet, except it is starting to feel like harassment. And a small reduction in price doesn&#x27;t exactly change the quality of the product, does it?</li>
            <li> This wig was terrible. I was so hyped when I got it and then discovered how thin it was...you could see the hair cap and tracks in the back, there was no way of hiding it at all the tracks were showing because of how thin it is, and one side of the wig had more hair than the other .. waste of my money I don&#x27;t recommended.  I was disappointed: (</li>
            <li> Wig is very thin and tangles easily.  I have bought other Mapo wigs that are of much better quality and thickness, so I&#x27;m not sure what to say.  I guess it is hit or miss.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for what im going to use it for!!! (a LOT of cutting and styling haha)</li>
            <li> Bought it for my sis and she loves it! Wears it everyday! Tangles Really bad but that&#x27;s an easy fix. Wash with conditioner only, not shampoo. Buy yourself a detangling brush, and detangling spray before you buy it, cause you&#x27;ll need it. Leave to air dry, no heat what so ever.</li>
            <li> The hair is soft, and the ends feel fuller than the rest of the wig. It is pretty thin, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to pose a huge problem. Detangling it was a pain after opening the packaging the first time, and it did shed a bit, but neither proved to be a long term issue.</li>
            <li> This wig is nice, but it tangles a lot which hampers styling. This is my first wig and so I am inexperienced with the combing and brushing of one, and the brush I use makes it shed. The wig is thinner than I thought, and I can feel the wig cap in some places. It&#x27;s a good wig, but it could be better.</li>
            <li> The fiber of the wig itself was great but it came so severely tangled and thin I couldn&#x27;t do anything with it. I ended up chucking it out of frustration after soaking it twice in fabric softener and spending hours with a wide toothed comb.</li>
            <li> Really bad quality, hair comes off when brushed / combed.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that this wig is not, in fact, 40&amp;#34;--it&#x27;s more like 28-1/2&amp;#34;. That&#x27;s still pretty dang long, of course (I think it comes down to my waist, and I&#x27;m not particularly short for a lady), and I didn&#x27;t actually need it to be 40&amp;#34; for my purposes, but others should be aware. Other than that, the fibers are very soft and smooth, and the wig is not too thin (it is thinner in the back, but the sides are where that really counts, I suppose). It also seems less prone to tangling than other long wigs I&#x27;ve had, but I think that&#x27;s because the others were curly, while this one is straight. Finally, it comes with no bangs or layers cut into it, which is what I was particularly looking for. All in all, a lovely wig, and well worth the price, even if it&#x27;s not the 40&amp;#34; advertized.  :)</li>
            <li> Wig was not what I expected it to be it was so tangled I could do anything thing with it and also the package came really later</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t really part it. Otherwise I love it</li>
            <li> This wig fits great and does not fit too tight. Some of the hair does shed but not as bad as cheap halloween wigs. This would not pass for real hair. I do not recommend heating the hair  to style because it burns quickly.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a Halloween outfit.  It&#x27;s not very thick and it sheds a lot but it looked right.</li>
            <li> A good buy. Doesn&#x27;t feel as cheap as one of the witches wigs from Party City. Seems like it could last a while.</li>
            <li> its a beautiful and long wig that doesn&#x27;t tangle easy. yes it gets some frizz but with a quick brush through its good as new! its not a super thick wig but its still good. you will not see the track or stretching of the wig. a good buy. I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Very shiny, very soft and very easy to tangle. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;6, this wig ended a little bit past my waist. The skin top is a nice touch and adds to the realism, but there are bangs sewn in front of the skin part which are the same length as the rest of the wig and are very unruly to sweep and pin out of the face. The wig was great otherwise except for the fact that it is very thin in the back as previously mentioned and the netting easily showed through when I wore it. I have long hair that was wrapped a bit lumpily so that might have contributed but it made it unwearable without stacking another wig on top of it, defeating the purpose. I&#x27;d still recommend it but doubling up is probably wise.</li>
            <li> This is so so good, very soft. But don&#x27;t brush it a lot.</li>
            <li> Its a really thin wig and I can see my wig cap and hair through it.</li>
            <li> This wig is amazing. Looks and feels like real hair. It&#x27;s a bit large for my head but a few bobby pins can fix that. It also came with two wig caps. Love it.</li>
            <li> This wig was alright. It&#x27;s pretty thin, and mine came tangled. I spent an hour untangling it. After that it was nice. It even came with a little net wig cap. I was very impressed by the length. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;6 and the wig reached my bum. Pretty good wig for the price.</li>
            <li> Great, high quality wig. Worked perfect for my Princess Jasmine out fit.</li>
            <li> This wig was so cute and not cheap looking like most costume wigs I find</li>
            <li> great condition, exactly what i expected</li>
            <li> I needed it for cosplay, it is way too thin and very delicate. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. But hey, it wasn&#x27;t itchy i guess.</li>
            <li> The wig itself is incredibly soft and is the correct length, but the part where your head goes is so small it barely stays on my head. Other than that it&#x27;s great quality and the free wig cap is nice.</li>
            <li> This wig.. Dont waist your money. It is CONSTANTLY in my face, its so whispy and easily tangled its very annoying. I had to cut it because it was so uneven and weirdly cut. This DOES NOT frame the face at all even after cutting it to frame my face it still slides annoyingly into my eyes. This is one of those wigs where you can tell is fake.</li>
            <li> The wig came very frizzy. Otherwise very nice and extremely soft.</li>
            <li> Great quality even though shipping is kind of long.</li>
            <li> I love the wig!! It feels so soft and natural, easy to brush and looks very realistic when worn.</li>
            <li> Perfect for our Sonny and Cher Skit!</li>
            <li> Super great for the price.</li>
            <li> This wig isn&#x27;t as thick as I had hoped it would be, but there is still plenty of hair and the hair is beautiful. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;2 and it goes down to my butt; I didn&#x27;t measure it, but it seems a good bit longer than in the picture. It was packaged very nicely with the hair in a loose ponytail and wrapped in a net, so it was easy to unfold and wasn&#x27;t tangled at all, and there were no weird kinks in the hair. The hair is very silky and shiny and came with a hair net.</li>
            <li> Ordered 2 pieces just in case it was too thin. Package arrived earlier than estimated delivery time. It came with 2 pieces of wig caps and a stick on tattoo (i guess that&#x27;s a freebie?). The wigs are soft and jet black and were in two separate zip-lock bags. It smelled a little plasticky (?) but I&#x27;m hoping it would disappear once it&#x27;s been aired out. Nice natural looking part. I agree with the other reviewer that the back is a little thin. But for the price, this is a really good wig. Once you stack on the second wig it would be as full as a real head of hair.</li>
            <li> Has a natural part with a skin top to make it look realistic. Shipper was good at communicating and a pleasure to work with. The fibers of the wig feel nice and I got it sooner than expect. I recommend.</li>
            <li> I know most people are using this wig for anime cosplay.  My family and I are dressing up as the Addams family with myself as Morticia.  I need a wig because Morticia most definitely does not have dreads.  Looking at the Morticia and other long black wigs, I realized they would not work with dreads.  They already looked unnaturally thick on top with very artificial looking parts.  I saw this wig and thought it would probably be my best option.  I even paid extra for shipping.  It just got here about 20 minutes ago and I tried it on immediately.  The two wig caps were added bonuses since my daughter&#x27;s Wednesday wig didn&#x27;t come with one and I was contemplating buying them for both of us as, with my dreads and her mass of curly hair, we definitely need them.  This wig is longer than Morticia&#x27;s hair but that&#x27;s much easier to overlook since it looks so great, even with my dreads underneath.  I&#x27;m so excited to see it all together with the costume I made.  Now, I can focus my attention to my husband/Gomez and my son/Pugsley.  Forget the Halloween sellers, I&#x27;ll choose cosplayers any day.</li>
            <li> A little thinner than expected , tangles fast but I ca deal with it , overall gorgeous wig</li>
            <li> believe the hype! totally amazing product for so little $. thick coverage (no bald spots), soft hair, arrived perfectly combed out. i may get some wigs just for fun because they are such good quality for a steal of a price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;shipping is free, but can take up to a month, so if you&#x27;re ordering for a specific event- order ASAP.</li>
            <li> Very lovely wig. High quality.</li>
