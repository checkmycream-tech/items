            <li>Love the smell.</li>

            <li>I will be trying more of their products.</li>
            <li>At least my bedroom smells wonderful :)</li>
            <li>My daughter had very good week by using this product along with other required products.</li>
            <li>Also it seems very fresh to me.  </li>
            <li>It has a very distinct strong aroma, which some might not like, but the healing properties in this EO are worth the strong scent.</li>
            <li>It has a very small dropper, which makes it perfect to use without any waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Came quickly.</li>
            <li>It was well worth the price, as I have been searching for a good supplier of the carrier oils and essential oils</li>

            <li>The packaging of this item is really pretty.</li>
            <li>I received the amount ordered, but being visual I relied on the photo more than I should have.  </li>
            <li>I love this Essential Oil.</li>

            <li>The quality seems to be fine, but I have no other experience with this oil, so I have no other comparisons.</li>

            <li>I purchased three items including this one from High Altitude Organics</li>
            <li>It arrived on time and was fun to open...like getting a present.</li>

            <li>I like to use for myself, family, friends for holistic natural healing.</li>

            <li> Came quickly and in the little box as shown.</li>
            <li> Not sure how much of it is a carrier oil.</li>
            <li> The noise has been with me, possibly too long.</li>
            <li> The bottle/quantity was much smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> Received on a timely basis; actually before expected.</li>
            <li> Anyone who suffers from tinnitus (constant loud ringing/roaring in the ear) is willing to try almost anything for relief.  </li>
            <li> I have gotten other eo of this cultivar, and they were not the same.</li>
            <li> as it is so expensive, It was worth it.</li>
            <li> Viscosity is thinner than I expected, so I&#x27;m careful dispensing drops.</li>
            <li> While product is expensive, it appears to be worth the price.  </li>
            <li> I will be shopping from this reliable vendor and brand again soon for more eo and carrier oils, as the cheaper oils are usually not pure cold pressed, and heli eo is very expensive, but so worth it.</li>
            <li> A little drop goes a long way.</li>
            <li> like I have from other companies.</li>
            <li> bottle is so tiny that I had a very difficult time trying to open it with my arthritic hands~ when I finally did, I dropped it and spilt virtually all of the oil.</li>
            <li> thought about this long and hard,</li>
            <li> I call it my little treasure.</li>
            <li> I end up dabbing a little like perfume.</li>
            <li> I use this in my ear canal when symptoms worsen (usually when the barometric pressure is dropping) and it does relieve it some.  </li>
            <li> Small bottle!</li>
            <li> but it seemed too expensive to try.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t review the efficacy :(</li>
            <li> In that, I was disappointed, because in the picture the scale is off.  </li>

            <li> The packaging is exquisite, and the scent heavenly.  Those both get 5 stars.  Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t review the efficacy :(&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is so tiny that I had a very difficult time trying to open it with my arthritic hands~ when I finally did, I dropped it and spilt virtually all of the oil. At least my bedroom smells wonderful :)</li>
            <li> Nice package.  Good quality oil.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Very nicely packaged.  I used it to make a pain medication.  Seems to be doing well.</li>
            <li> Quality product. Packaged well. Works perfectly.</li>
            <li> very fast shipping, great product and very cute packaging! thank you</li>
            <li> Since an accident in 97&#x27;, I have had tinnitus. It rises to meet outside sound.... up to 85 Db. This took awhile to arrive with &amp;#34;free shipping&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Hilichrysum was suggested years ago for the tinnitus but it seemed too expensive to try. I have used it morning and at bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;The price was low enough to try and Helichrysum italicum appeared to be the strongest available. I only wish I had tried this years ago. The noise has been with me, possibly too long. It would be a relief for the ringing to subside. Its worth a try.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and in the little box as shown. I call it my little treasure. I have TN and it really helped with my pain. I want to thank the maker of this product.</li>
            <li> The packaging of this item is really pretty. It arrived on time and was fun to open...like getting a present. The quality seems to be fine, but I have no other experience with this oil, so I have no other comparisons. The bottle/quantity was much smaller than I expected. This is not a 5 or 10 ml bottle of essential oil like I have from other companies. In that, I was disappointed, because in the picture the scale is off.  I received the amount ordered, but being visual I relied on the photo more than I should have.  I probably would order elsewhere next time just for that reason, to compare oil quality and amount for the money.</li>
            <li> Came quickly. Wrapped and packaged just like the picture shows (beautifully). Smells wonderful. I just used one drop on my sore neck, pain gone instantly. I wish I could afford a 10 gallon drum of this stuff. It has a very small dropper, which makes it perfect to use without any waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought about this long and hard, as it is so expensive, It was worth it.</li>
            <li> This oil was reccomended for tinnitus so I tried it.  Anyone who suffers from tinnitus (constant loud ringing/roaring in the ear) is willing to try almost anything for relief.  I use this in my ear canal when symptoms worsen (usually when the barometric pressure is dropping) and it does relieve it some.  The noise doesn&#x27;t go away but this seems to reduce the symptoms by about 50 %.  There is no cure for Meniere&#x27;s disease or tinnuitis but anything that can help reduce the symptoms provides welcome relief!</li>
            <li> This is a precious oil and the little dropper makes it easy to make sure that one doesn&#x27;t squander their investment.  Love the smell.</li>
            <li> Beautifully packaged, good quality, makes a nice gift for the aromatherapist in your life (or anyone who can appreciate fragrance and is interested in some of the uses for this product.  This is the italicum variety, which I have read is superior.  On the strength of the excellent labeling and packaging, I just ordered the Bulgarian Rose (also, pricey, but it is advertised to be pure).</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t have done a nicer way for such a great essential oil.</li>
            <li> Great authentic Helichrysum imortalle EO. I have gotten other eo of this cultivar, and they were not the same. It was well worth the price, as I have been searching for a good supplier of the carrier oils and essential oils I like to use for myself, family, friends for holistic natural healing. Gets rid of bruises, helps fade scars and brown spots/stretch marks. It has a very distinct strong aroma, which some might not like, but the healing properties in this EO are worth the strong scent. I will be shopping from this reliable vendor and brand again soon for more eo and carrier oils, as the cheaper oils are usually not pure cold pressed, and heli eo is very expensive, but so worth it. Tired of wasting my money on things that aren&#x27;t the genuine thing. Looking forward to trying the rose trinity, carrot seed and rosehip seed cold pressed oils as well as jasmine and rose oils.</li>
            <li> I love this Essential Oil. Fresh Lemony scent. I use it for inflammatory joints. It smells so nice I end up dabbing a little like perfume. Nicely packaged. Small bottle! I&#x27;d rather have less invested in packaging and more product! A little drop goes a long way. Also like having the squeeze dropper as opposed to shaking drops thru the plastic top. Viscosity is thinner than I expected, so I&#x27;m careful dispensing drops. Especially since this is pricey oil.</li>
            <li> This oil is really amazing. A tiny drop does wonders for various skin ailments. Beautiful packaging as well!</li>
            <li> Helichrysum Italicum (Immortelle - Everlasting) is my very favorite scent so I have purchased dozens if not hundreds of times and I can tell you that this sold by High Altitude Organics is the real deal.  Also it seems very fresh to me.  I love that it comes with a small dropper for easy control of amount per usage!  The seller has it all gift-wrapped like in the photograph making it a perfect gift for someone or yourself; I had so much pleasurable enjoyment opening my package.  I purchased three items including this one from High Altitude Organics and I am so impressed.  I will be trying more of their products.</li>
            <li> While product is expensive, it appears to be worth the price.  Very nice unique packaging!</li>
            <li> Awesome Product. Received on a timely basis; actually before expected. Performed as described.  My daughter had very good week by using this product along with other required products.</li>
            <li> The dropper is so nice to have. It helps be more efficient with the excellent product</li>
            <li> Superb aroma quality, one of the nicest batches I have tested of this oil.</li>
            <li> Works wonders on scrapes, cuts. Helps with the healing more than neosporin ever did!  Does wonders for the skin, as in anti aging and reversing damage.  I havent found a reason not to love it!</li>
            <li> It does smell nice. Not sure how much of it is a carrier oil. Not 100% pure essential oil. Oily</li>
