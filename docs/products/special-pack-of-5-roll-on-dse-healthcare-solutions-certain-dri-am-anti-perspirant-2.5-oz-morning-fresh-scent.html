            <li>/&gt;So, great product.  </li>
            <li>Love this product, its perfect for summer,.!</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best!!!</li>
            <li>It was a great price and arrived quickly</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t  stop you from sweeting completely but this is the best I can find and I have been using it for 2 years now</li>
            <li>Good product; arrived quickly</li>
            <li>On Amazon, through this seller, it is easy to buy in reasonable bulk and get a good price and reliably swift delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ahhh!  </li>
            <li>The scent is refreshing and not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li>I know most people who will buy this aren&#x27;t taking Adderall, but I do and the days I take it</li>
            <li>Nice fresh scent</li>
            <li>CERTAIN DRY AM IS THE BEST STUFF ON THE MARKET!!</li>
            <li>I sweet a lot</li>
            <li>A true godsend.</li>
            <li>I love Certain Dri and I have been using it for months with much success.  </li>
            <li>It came quickly and was cheaper than others I looked at.</li>
            <li>This is a nice pair with the regular certain dri that you use before bedtime .</li>
            <li>the original Certain Dri at night and Certain Dri AM in the morning.</li>
            <li>So many products tried and this is the only one that has worked.</li>
            <li>I sweat even more than regularly.</li>
            <li>Certain Dri is an absolute miracle.  </li>
            <li>This is very ineffective.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use the roll-on as it causes too much skin irritation for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Certain Dri AM is the companion product that you use in the morning as a deodorant (the regular Certain Dri is used at night before you go to bed).  </li>
            <li>As always received items on time, brand new.</li>
            <li>It can make you itch, but it&#x27;s totally worth it to have dry underarms.  </li>
            <li>Before Certain Dry A M I would sweat profusely but not anymore!</li>

            <li> So many products tried and this is the only one that has worked. The scent is refreshing and not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> I would not buy again. The PM version is a pain to remember, but it works. This is very ineffective.</li>
            <li> This product is great for being none perspiration.  I sweet a lot and this works great for me. It doesn&#x27;t  stop you from sweeting completely but this is the best I can find and I have been using it for 2 years now and I like the product.</li>
            <li> I am all desperate to find an antiperspirant with deodorant that will work for my hyperhidrosis. I know most people who will buy this aren&#x27;t taking Adderall, but I do and the days I take it I sweat even more than regularly. This will not fight it even a little...and it takes forever to dry because my armpits won&#x27;t stop sweating. When I don&#x27;t take Adderall, I notice a bit of an improvement, but not enough to rave about this product. I think I may need a miracle.</li>
            <li> I love Certain Dri and I have been using it for months with much success.  I always buy it online here at Amazon and came across this 5 pack deal.  Please note that this is for 5 Roll-on deodorants.  The description doesn&#x27;t specify at all and I was expecting to receive the solid stick.  I can&#x27;t use the roll-on as it causes too much skin irritation for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, great product.  Just know what you are buying with this 5-pack deal!!</li>
            <li> If nothing else works...this will.&lt;br /&gt;Use the original Certain Dri at night and Certain Dri AM in the morning.</li>
            <li> This and it&#x27;s antiperspirant are miracles in bottle!  No sweaty pits for me!</li>
            <li> Certain Dri is an absolute miracle.  After years of unsuccessfully trying to find an antiperspirant that actually worked for me, I stumbled across Certain Dri in a random publication.  It can make you itch, but it&#x27;s totally worth it to have dry underarms.  I&#x27;ll take a moderate amount of discomfort over wet armpits any day.  Certain Dri AM is the companion product that you use in the morning as a deodorant (the regular Certain Dri is used at night before you go to bed).  I buy both of these items in bulk so that I have them on hand.  A true godsend.</li>
            <li> It came quickly and was cheaper than others I looked at. This is a nice pair with the regular certain dri that you use before bedtime .</li>
            <li> As an essential part of an easy-to-follow antiperspirant and deodorant system, this product makes one of life&#x27;s nagging details fade away.  On Amazon, through this seller, it is easy to buy in reasonable bulk and get a good price and reliably swift delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ahhh!  All is as it should be!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take it from me, I&#x27;m the man with an eye for design who shops for a living!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this product, its perfect for summer,.!</li>
            <li> Good product; arrived quickly</li>
            <li> As always received items on time, brand new. Listen this product works, I have been using it for almost a year, I have no more sweaty under arms. I recommend this product and the seller!!!!!</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time.  It is hard to find at a lot of stores.  It was a great price and arrived quickly</li>
            <li> I sweat alot under my arm. After using this solution for about a week my arm pitts was dry all day long. Nice fresh scent</li>
            <li> This is the best deodorant I have ever used!! My daughter uses it now, too!  I perspired very badly before and could not control it.  this is the only one that helped both of us! And I can never find it in the stores!!!</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE ONLY ROLL ON THAT WORKS FOR ME! CERTAIN DRY AM IS THE BEST STUFF ON THE MARKET!! Before Certain Dry A M I would sweat profusely but not anymore! I have been using it for the past five years. You couldn&#x27;t get me to try a different product today! Absolutely the best!!!</li>
            <li> This is hard to find in stores and I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.  Does not mark clothing and keeps me very dry.</li>
