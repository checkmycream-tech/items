            <li>so it is great than I can order from you!</li>
            <li>I especially love this after I&#x27;ve had a keratin treatment and can&#x27;t wash my hair for a couple of days.</li>
            <li>It also smells great, which is a bonus!</li>
            <li>Because it is, in a word, awesome.</li>
            <li>best part -</li>

            <li>It works and smells great.</li>
            <li>LOL.</li>
            <li>when I don&#x27;t have time to wash my hair - like in the morning before I go to the gym - I&#x27;ve also found it&#x27;s a great way to increase body and to extend the life of your shampoo.</li>
            <li>hair looks great and smells good too.</li>
            <li>Also it smells perfect not too strong and not chemically at all.</li>
            <li>Good product and covers the gray well,</li>
            <li>good product, but shows up on your hands and clothing.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, my stylist recommended it since my top hair is thinning and it gives me volume.  </li>
            <li>Very glad I switched.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think of how much I love it and need to write a review!</li>

            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, compact packaging great for travel.</li>
            <li>This dry shampoo powder is brilliant &amp; works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing for brunettes.  </li>
            <li>and they did not work as effective.</li>
            <li>The brown color of this product blends nicely with my hair.  </li>
            <li>and I love it love it!  </li>
            <li>I love this product and I am so glad that I found it!  </li>
            <li>Much better than the spray in kinds, plus is smells so nice.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Compact in size and easy to use, this powder has a nice scent to it.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>It works ok</li>
            <li>It absorbs the oil and leaves my hair fuller and with more volume.</li>
            <li>love the fact that it is scentless and not sticky.</li>
            <li>This works 100 times better than the Jonthan version.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how great my very greasy hair looks once I apply this.  </li>
            <li>Did make my hair look better, but brown rubbed off on anything it touched.  </li>
            <li>Now I look forward to day two because I know my hair will look better</li>
            <li>Have I mentioned how much I love this stuff?</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Also you dont get as many uses with it as you would expect....</li>
            <li>Does a great job absorbing oil.  </li>
            <li>You get much more volume if you use a powder spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I like this better because of the darker color and the scent.</li>
            <li>The product itself is great, but it comes out of the brush WAY too fast.</li>
            <li>Meh, its okay.</li>
            <li>It really gave my roots a very nice lift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t buy this again and will stick to Pssst as it seems to leave my hair feeling clean and smelling nice.</li>
            <li>Great scent, no chalky residue (the brown shade blends perfectly with hair), and best of all, the dry shampoo leaves hair looking (and smelling) clean and fresh, even after a long sweaty run.</li>
            <li>The product is pretty good</li>
            <li>Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever had-and I&#x27;ve tried literally dozens.</li>
            <li>I tried my best to not douse my routes with the powder and tried to carefully work around the area.</li>
            <li>This is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky when you use it.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and place just where it&#x27;s needed.</li>
            <li>(when) it spills it is easy to wipe off skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Until this product I had yet to find a dry shampoo that did more then smell good.</li>
            <li>Great dry shampoo for brunettes.</li>
            <li>Pros:&lt;br /&gt;I does absorb oil and give hair a clean look.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This powder is the best thing ever, my hair is very oily and i have to wash it everyday with this product i dont&#x27; have to do it everyday and smells really good!!</li>
            <li>Good overall though.</li>
            <li>Good in a pinch, but I wouldn&#x27;t say I actually like it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many dry shampoo sprays and nothing works well this powder is AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>This has been a lifesaver when I have been traveling--a quick fix.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The powder can come out of the brush quite quickly, but after using it a couple of times, you&#x27;ll get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>it comes out quickly</li>
            <li>I use it pretty much every other day and it works great!</li>
            <li>The brush applicator is a fabulous way to apply the powder to certain oily areas on your head, and just pat and lift, pat and lift.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really, truly brown - maybe a somewhat light or ashy brown but still blends well with my medium brown hair.</li>
            <li>I tried several times and it honestly did nothing for me.</li>
            <li>I would use this every day, even on freshly washed hair, if I could afford it.</li>
            <li>Ladies, It is worth every penny</li>
            <li>This is light, blends easily, smells nice and makes hair look far less greasy if you&#x27;re taking a day off from washing it.  </li>
            <li>Awesome, especially for dark hair!</li>
            <li>This is good for brunettes, seems to work fairly well on dirty hair.</li>
            <li>I was using a spray dry shampoo for brunettes which I liked,  </li>
            <li>I gave it 2 stars only because my hair did look better after using it.</li>
            <li>Much better then spray instant shampoo</li>
            <li>I love the fact there are different hair colors for this</li>
            <li>product made it easier to get through the first 4 days of treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If it makes it in your hair it does a good job soaking up any oils and adding volume, but the design of the container makes it pretty messy to apply.  </li>
            <li>Upon first use I was cautious, as the color is lighter tan</li>
            <li>I love the powder color as it doesn&#x27;t leave a white or powder looking hue on my brunette hair.</li>
            <li>It also does a pretty decent job of hiding those pesky gray roots!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the white version of this product and while it also works great, you have to be very careful to rub/comb thoroughly</li>
            <li>As far as if your hair feels clean or not, I can&#x27;t really tell because the cornstarch and heaviness seems to overshadow that.</li>
            <li>Recommend to anyone who has tried dry shampoo and wasn&#x27;t pleased with results.</li>
            <li>The fact that the powder is colored means greater use for dry shampoo without making me look like I have cobwebs in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I love this dry shampoo powder.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite Dry Shampoo.  </li>
            <li>so many dry shampoos look ashy on my hair.</li>
            <li>The only dry shampoo that I have ever found and loved.</li>
            <li>I have used MANY different dry shampoos and this is my favorite by far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the original white dry shampoo and prefer this one because I&#x27;m brunette and it blends a bit better.  </li>
            <li>But the brunette had too much color in it.</li>
            <li>The product absolutely destroys an oily buildup at the root of your hair and also adds volume.  </li>
            <li>The brush attachment on this uses way too much of the product and there isn&#x27;t a lot of it to begin with.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t spill too much powder on my scalp.</li>
            <li>and it gets oily fast.</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>If you are dealing with thinning hair, or just want to go an extra day between shampooing, this product is worth the price!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m tempted to use it on clean hair just for the extra perks!</li>
            <li>My go-to dry shampoo-works fantastic, I even use it when my hair isn&#x27;t dirty so that I can get the awesome lift it gives my roots!</li>
            <li>I add it to my problem spots after washing and styling, and my hair is much less oily and retains more volume throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t washing my thick hair on a regular basis and this product did a great job at masking that fact.</li>
            <li>My hair can&#x27;t typically last for more than one day, but this product makes it possible.  </li>
            <li>A good dry shampoo should be impossible to detect and I think this one does a good job.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand the high reviews for this product.</li>
            <li>This little number is absolutely fabulous!</li>
            <li>(it comes out pretty generously if you are not careful)</li>
            <li>If, like me, you try to keep your blow-dried hair as smooth and clean as possible for as long between washes as possible, this is for you.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I tried a spray sold on Amazon that purported to be \\&quot;brown\\&quot; but nonetheless came out white much of the time - despite shaking the container - seem to be no way to get it shaken enough to consistently get a brown colored spray.</li>
            <li>I put it on before going to bed and apply a little more in the morning, if necessary.  </li>
            <li>This is much better than some other spray dry shampoos I have tried.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping for the price that it would last longer.</li>
            <li>This powder does not smell, can be applied directly to the area, and after a couple minutes on is undetectable.  </li>
            <li>I love Keratin Complex products.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s more expensive than some, but it&#x27;s well worth it</li>
            <li>It does smell good and worked decently for my dirty hair days...</li>
            <li>My first thought when I used this was: FINALLY a dry shampoo that doesn&#x27;t make me look like I&#x27;m going gray!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It is pretty messy because it comes out very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
            <li>I was using it fairly regularly, since as a new mom, let&#x27;s face it:</li>
            <li>This is good for anybody who has a &#x27;dirty&#x27; feeling scalp or hair roots.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this dry shampoo because it came highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It also comes in blonde and clear (white).</li>
            <li>However, when I really worked it in and flipped my head upside down and let the excess powder fall off...</li>
            <li>It does leave a really cornstarch feeling on my hair and it seems to weigh it down.</li>
            <li>In addition, compared to other dry shampoos, this product is not cheap, so I felt like I wasted a good amount of money.</li>
            <li>where it becomes a little oily in between washes, which was fine, only that the baby powder would turn my dark brown hair gray at the roots.&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> As far as if your hair feels clean or not, I can&#x27;t really tell because the cornstarch and heaviness seems to overshadow that.</li>
            <li> Recommend to anyone who has tried dry shampoo and wasn&#x27;t pleased with results.</li>
            <li> The fact that the powder is colored means greater use for dry shampoo without making me look like I have cobwebs in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I love this dry shampoo powder.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite Dry Shampoo.  </li>
            <li> so many dry shampoos look ashy on my hair.</li>
            <li> The only dry shampoo that I have ever found and loved.</li>
            <li> I have used MANY different dry shampoos and this is my favorite by far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the original white dry shampoo and prefer this one because I&#x27;m brunette and it blends a bit better.  </li>
            <li> But the brunette had too much color in it.</li>
            <li> The product absolutely destroys an oily buildup at the root of your hair and also adds volume.  </li>
            <li> The brush attachment on this uses way too much of the product and there isn&#x27;t a lot of it to begin with.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t spill too much powder on my scalp.</li>
            <li> and it gets oily fast.</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> If you are dealing with thinning hair, or just want to go an extra day between shampooing, this product is worth the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tempted to use it on clean hair just for the extra perks!</li>
            <li> My go-to dry shampoo-works fantastic, I even use it when my hair isn&#x27;t dirty so that I can get the awesome lift it gives my roots!</li>
            <li> I add it to my problem spots after washing and styling, and my hair is much less oily and retains more volume throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t washing my thick hair on a regular basis and this product did a great job at masking that fact.</li>
            <li> My hair can&#x27;t typically last for more than one day, but this product makes it possible.  </li>
            <li> A good dry shampoo should be impossible to detect and I think this one does a good job.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the high reviews for this product.</li>
            <li> This little number is absolutely fabulous!</li>
            <li> (it comes out pretty generously if you are not careful)</li>
            <li> If, like me, you try to keep your blow-dried hair as smooth and clean as possible for as long between washes as possible, this is for you.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I tried a spray sold on Amazon that purported to be \\&quot;brown\\&quot; but nonetheless came out white much of the time - despite shaking the container - seem to be no way to get it shaken enough to consistently get a brown colored spray.</li>
            <li> I put it on before going to bed and apply a little more in the morning, if necessary.  </li>
            <li> This is much better than some other spray dry shampoos I have tried.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping for the price that it would last longer.</li>
            <li> This powder does not smell, can be applied directly to the area, and after a couple minutes on is undetectable.  </li>
            <li> I love Keratin Complex products.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s more expensive than some, but it&#x27;s well worth it</li>
            <li> It does smell good and worked decently for my dirty hair days...</li>
            <li> My first thought when I used this was: FINALLY a dry shampoo that doesn&#x27;t make me look like I&#x27;m going gray!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It is pretty messy because it comes out very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
            <li> I was using it fairly regularly, since as a new mom, let&#x27;s face it:</li>
            <li> This is good for anybody who has a &#x27;dirty&#x27; feeling scalp or hair roots.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this dry shampoo because it came highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It also comes in blonde and clear (white).</li>
            <li> However, when I really worked it in and flipped my head upside down and let the excess powder fall off...</li>
            <li> It does leave a really cornstarch feeling on my hair and it seems to weigh it down.</li>
            <li> In addition, compared to other dry shampoos, this product is not cheap, so I felt like I wasted a good amount of money.</li>
            <li> where it becomes a little oily in between washes, which was fine, only that the baby powder would turn my dark brown hair gray at the roots.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It volumizes only because it soaks up the oil and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair flat.</li>
            <li> Nothing more that slightly tinted baby powder which flies everywhere and does nothing to cover thin spots or to make hair appear thicker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried adjusting how much I use, but even a small amount leaves hair feeling cornstarchy</li>
            <li> is much too small a container</li>
            <li> and last a long time.</li>
            <li> out\\&quot; up keep and then a regular spray dry shampoo for during the week work schedule rush...</li>
            <li> Not easy to apply, falls out of the container and spills everywhere, wouldn&#x27;t recommend on dark brown / black hair as this is a light brown.  </li>
            <li> I prefer aerosol dry shampoo personally.</li>
            <li> I am sorry I spent that much money ( I usually LOVE Keratin  Complex products.)</li>
            <li> And the products that aren&#x27;t explicitly for brown hair - forget it - they make me look like I have grey</li>
            <li> I will never use another spray dry shampoo again.</li>
            <li> I will start by saying that I&#x27;ve used Ambiance&#x27;s dry shampoo before</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and this product makes it look so much thicker!</li>
            <li> This product allows me to wear my hair down on the second day of not washing my hair!!  </li>
            <li> and that usually means there&#x27;s a certain amount of wasted product.</li>
            <li> and because it only takes a small amount it will last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I have used many other dry shampoos that either reduce the life of my keratin treatments, irritate my scalp and skin or it leaves a heavy white residue on my hair that I look dirty or</li>
            <li> I was afraid of getting it in my easy chair or pillowcase.  </li>
            <li> I just brush it into my hair only tilting the bottle half way</li>
            <li> Gives a little extra body.</li>
            <li> this product helps when i need to extend shampoo a little longer.it also covers the gray grow back to extend time between glazing</li>
            <li> I used other \\&quot;spray\\&quot; versions of dry shampoo</li>
            <li> I have tried some other spray dry shampoos and didn&#x27;t like them.  </li>
            <li> But that is minimal based on how well it works.</li>
            <li> I have thin, straight hair.</li>
            <li> While I do use it for the expected - ie.</li>
            <li> A total waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I ordered this dry shampoo because of the dark color of the powder and the brush applicator.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel dirty/coated nor does it make my scalp itch like other products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> It ends up being on the brush, all around the sink and other places.</li>
            <li> No longer need to wash every other day.  </li>
            <li> Although I was using it almost daily, I didn&#x27;t think I was using it excessively in each use.</li>
            <li> but a little goes a very long way.  </li>
            <li> I tried being very careful with it.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I have tried every dry shampoo out there and this is the only one that works.  </li>
            <li> I also ordered the Jonathan Product Green Rootine Dry Shampoo Brush On Powder (For Dark Hair)</li>
            <li> I have dark black-brown-reddish hair.  </li>
            <li> Expensive product with not that much bang for your buck....</li>
            <li> I have really dark hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;The applicator dumps out a lot of product when you turn it upside down - it&#x27;s either all or nothing</li>
            <li> Just be careful though as it&#x27;s a little messy when you use it and store it.</li>
            <li> but I have had the same experience as others in that the sprays are expensive and stop working while there is still product left.</li>
            <li> Previously, I was applying baby powder with a make up brush to the roots of my hair</li>
            <li> The brush applicator was very messy and made loose powder go all over my clothes and bathroom every time.</li>
            <li> have very dark brown hair</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I wasted more than half of the product due to the terrible packaging and distribution design.</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s messy and hard to control the amount coming out.</li>
            <li> but I recommend using a small applicator brush for applying.  </li>
            <li> Total game changer!</li>
            <li> This did not make my hair dull, or off color where applied.  </li>
            <li> I usually rub it thru my scalp with my fingers instead of a brush because I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> The only thing that is a little annoying is that when you are using it there is a lot of  brown powder that comes out.</li>
            <li> small applicator with brush is a bit expensive, but to me, worthwhile.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only compaint is that it gets under your finger nails and makes you look like you have dirty hands!</li>
            <li> It is expensive for a small vial-</li>
            <li> My hair falls out a lot and washing often made things worse.  </li>
            <li> switched to this after using the Bumble and Bumble brown powder spray because I  was tired of having the brown spray rub off on my fingers when I touched my hair.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that it was gone after less than a month of use.</li>
            <li> Any of the spray kinds I&#x27;ve tried make my hair feel heavy and nasty.  </li>
            <li> Hate this stuff.</li>
            <li> Too disappointed with the results, hav to trash!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I gave it 2 stars only because my hair did look better after using it. But the brunette had too much color in it. I got brown fingernails if I forgot and scratched or rubbed my hair. Gross!. I was afraid of getting it in my easy chair or pillowcase.  I am sorry I spent that much money ( I usually LOVE Keratin  Complex products.) I will NOT use it again!</li>
            <li> I wish I invented this. Much better then spray instant shampoo and it does help cover the grays. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Awesome, especially for dark hair! The only dry shampoo that I have ever found and loved. Easy to use, compact packaging great for travel.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It&#x27;s the 2nd time I have purchased it. I use it to fill in my eyebrows. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing for brunettes.  The product absolutely destroys an oily buildup at the root of your hair and also adds volume.  Unfortunately I wasted more than half of the product due to the terrible packaging and distribution design.</li>
            <li> Good product and covers the gray well, but I recommend using a small applicator brush for applying.  The brush attachment on this uses way too much of the product and there isn&#x27;t a lot of it to begin with. Good overall though.</li>
            <li> Great product! I have thin hair and this product makes it look so much thicker! I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever had-and I&#x27;ve tried literally dozens. I know it&#x27;s more expensive than some, but it&#x27;s well worth it and last a long time. I love the fact there are different hair colors for this and it&#x27;s a brush instead of a spray. Just be careful though as it&#x27;s a little messy when you use it and store it. But that is minimal based on how well it works.</li>
            <li> This has been a lifesaver when I have been traveling--a quick fix.&lt;br /&gt;My hair looks great and smells good too.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, my stylist recommended it since my top hair is thinning and it gives me volume.  She is sometimes out of product in her shop so it is great than I can order from you!</li>
            <li> This is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky when you use it.  Great product for the price and because it only takes a small amount it will last a very long time.  Recommend to anyone who has tried dry shampoo and wasn&#x27;t pleased with results.</li>
            <li> I use this as a volumizer and as a camouflage for gray roots.  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel dirty/coated nor does it make my scalp itch like other products I&#x27;ve tried.  I only wish that there was a darker ash blonde color offered - the blonde shade currently offered is too yellow so I have to mix the white color with the brunette.</li>
            <li> This product works great. I used other \\&quot;spray\\&quot; versions of dry shampoo and they did not work as effective. I use it for thinning hair and it provides great coverage.</li>
            <li> The product is pretty good and I&#x27;m happy with it. The only thing that is a little annoying is that when you are using it there is a lot of  brown powder that comes out. It ends up being on the brush, all around the sink and other places.</li>
            <li> this is not like the spray&#x27;s at all and I love it love it!  it doesn&#x27;t have that weird feeling to it when you try to wash it out love that it comes in this color for brunettes.</li>
            <li> It works ok but if you touch your hair the brown powder gets in your fingernails</li>
            <li> This powder is the best thing ever, my hair is very oily and i have to wash it everyday with this product i dont&#x27; have to do it everyday and smells really good!!</li>
            <li> I love this product and I am so glad that I found it!  It absorbs the oil and leaves my hair fuller and with more volume. I&#x27;m tempted to use it on clean hair just for the extra perks!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as well as the sprays but I have had the same experience as others in that the sprays are expensive and stop working while there is still product left. This is good for brunettes, seems to work fairly well on dirty hair. Also covers gray roots somewhat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 6 months and every time I use it I think of how much I love it and need to write a review! I just brush it into my hair only tilting the bottle half way so I don&#x27;t spill too much powder on my scalp. I use it pretty much every other day and it works great! I will never use another spray dry shampoo again. Also it smells perfect not too strong and not chemically at all.</li>
            <li> I ordered this dry shampoo because it came highly recommended. I have used many other dry shampoos that either reduce the life of my keratin treatments, irritate my scalp and skin or it leaves a heavy white residue on my hair that I look dirty or old.&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that it is scentless and not sticky. The fact that the powder is colored means greater use for dry shampoo without making me look like I have cobwebs in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The small applicator with brush is a bit expensive, but to me, worthwhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I truly don&#x27;t like is the residue under finger nails when  I have to scratch my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product made it easier to get through the first 4 days of treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason, I never got updates between for product tracking and delivery. All i got was notification or made, package sent, then delivery. Communication could have been better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again.</li>
            <li> This works 100 times better than the Jonthan version.  My only compaint is that it gets under your finger nails and makes you look like you have dirty hands! I don&#x27;t think there is any way to get around this though.  It also does a pretty decent job of hiding those pesky gray roots!</li>
            <li> Seriously, I have tried every dry shampoo out there and this is the only one that works.  This product allows me to wear my hair down on the second day of not washing my hair!!  Love, love, love!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the high reviews for this product. I was using a spray dry shampoo for brunettes which I liked,  but I wanted to try something different and chose this one based on the reviews. I tried several times and it honestly did nothing for me. In fact, I felt like my hair felt greasier and flatter AFTER use! In addition, compared to other dry shampoos, this product is not cheap, so I felt like I wasted a good amount of money. I am going back to my spray, Batiste for brunettes.. $8.99. Don&#x27;t know why I ever switched.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It helps to cover scalp and also adds body to my hair!  If you are dealing with thinning hair, or just want to go an extra day between shampooing, this product is worth the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many dry shampoo sprays and nothing works well this powder is AMAZING.  I can&#x27;t believe how great my very greasy hair looks once I apply this.  No longer need to wash every other day.  Can go up to 4-5 days no problem.  My hair falls out a lot and washing often made things worse.  With this I don&#x27;t need to wash as often.</li>
            <li> Did make my hair look better, but brown rubbed off on anything it touched.  I had to rub a towel over my head to try to absorb some of the color.  If I forgot and scratched my head I got brown under my nails.  I will not likely use again.</li>
            <li> Works great and looks great!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Easy to use and place just where it&#x27;s needed. Gives a little extra body.</li>
            <li> I love this dry shampoo powder.  Any of the spray kinds I&#x27;ve tried make my hair feel heavy and nasty.  This is light, blends easily, smells nice and makes hair look far less greasy if you&#x27;re taking a day off from washing it.  I especially love this after I&#x27;ve had a keratin treatment and can&#x27;t wash my hair for a couple of days.</li>
            <li> This powder gets all over the place.  If it makes it in your hair it does a good job soaking up any oils and adding volume, but the design of the container makes it pretty messy to apply.  If you touch your scalp at all throughout the day after using this product your fingers will be brown - gross.  I do not recommend this.</li>
            <li> Glamazons, rejoice! This little number is absolutely fabulous! It also comes in blonde and clear (white). Stick to the brunette or blonde. The white tends to look powdery in the hair. Use, repeat, love! Buy this, Buy this, Buy this. BOOM!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Licensed Beauty Pro</li>
            <li> I have thin, straight hair. I try not to wash it every day but it can look oily by day two. Until this product I had yet to find a dry shampoo that did more then smell good. This powder makes my hair look thicker, it gives it a texture so it adds volume and styles like I would have never imagined. Now I look forward to day two because I know my hair will look better then it did on the day I washed it. I would use this every day, even on freshly washed hair, if I could afford it.</li>
            <li> My first thought when I used this was: FINALLY a dry shampoo that doesn&#x27;t make me look like I&#x27;m going gray! It works and smells great. I was using it fairly regularly, since as a new mom, let&#x27;s face it: I wasn&#x27;t washing my thick hair on a regular basis and this product did a great job at masking that fact. I was disappointed that it was gone after less than a month of use. I was really hoping for the price that it would last longer. Although I was using it almost daily, I didn&#x27;t think I was using it excessively in each use.</li>
            <li> This is good for anybody who has a &#x27;dirty&#x27; feeling scalp or hair roots.  I have tried some other spray dry shampoos and didn&#x27;t like them.  They made me feel even dirtier, and got over all of my hair.  This powder does not smell, can be applied directly to the area, and after a couple minutes on is undetectable.  My head felt like normal- not freshly washed, but not greasy either.  I have dark black-brown-reddish hair.  This did not make my hair dull, or off color where applied.  There wasn&#x27;t a lot of volume added to the area but I also have not applied copious quantities of this either.  It is expensive for a small vial- but a little goes a very long way.  I will be getting this again.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Dry Shampoo.  My hair can&#x27;t typically last for more than one day, but this product makes it possible.  I&#x27;ve used the original white dry shampoo and prefer this one because I&#x27;m brunette and it blends a bit better.  I put it on before going to bed and apply a little more in the morning, if necessary.  Total game changer!</li>
            <li> this product helps when i need to extend shampoo a little longer.it also covers the gray grow back to extend time between glazing</li>
            <li> good product, but shows up on your hands and clothing.</li>
            <li> I love Keratin Complex products. This dry shampoo powder is brilliant &amp; works wonderfully. The brush applicator is a fabulous way to apply the powder to certain oily areas on your head, and just pat and lift, pat and lift.You get the idea... I usually rub it thru my scalp with my fingers instead of a brush because I have very thick hair and it gets oily fast. But then I remember it&#x27;s tinted for brunettes when my finger tips are brown. LOL. No biggie just use a brush if you can. Ladies, It is worth every penny and I promise you, you will not regret it. I have this as my go to \\&quot;bombshell blow out\\&quot; up keep and then a regular spray dry shampoo for during the week work schedule rush...</li>
            <li> I will start by saying that I&#x27;ve used Ambiance&#x27;s dry shampoo before and I would rate that 5*. However, I have recently started to get Brazilian blowouts regularly and because of that I have switched all my products to lines that advertise being sulfate-free and keratin-enriched. I came across this product by searching for \\&quot;Keratin shampoo\\&quot; and I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very dark brown hair so I ordered the brunettes version. Upon first use I was cautious, as the color is lighter tan my hair... I tried my best to not douse my routes with the powder and tried to carefully work around the area. It was still very obvious and visible. However, when I really worked it in and flipped my head upside down and let the excess powder fall off... Wow! It really gave my roots a very nice lift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now learned how to control the pour (it comes out pretty generously if you are not careful) and I&#x27;ve been using it between washes... It works really well. My hair does not feel oily at all and if I work it in well it does not look \\&quot;powdery\\&quot; either. A good dry shampoo should be impossible to detect and I think this one does a good job. It also smells great, which is a bonus!</li>
            <li> If, like me, you try to keep your blow-dried hair as smooth and clean as possible for as long between washes as possible, this is for you. Great scent, no chalky residue (the brown shade blends perfectly with hair), and best of all, the dry shampoo leaves hair looking (and smelling) clean and fresh, even after a long sweaty run. Have I mentioned how much I love this stuff? Because it is, in a word, awesome.</li>
            <li> I love the powder color as it doesn&#x27;t leave a white or powder looking hue on my brunette hair. It does leave a really cornstarch feeling on my hair and it seems to weigh it down. I&#x27;ve tried adjusting how much I use, but even a small amount leaves hair feeling cornstarchy and my volume goes away. As far as if your hair feels clean or not, I can&#x27;t really tell because the cornstarch and heaviness seems to overshadow that. I won&#x27;t buy this again and will stick to Pssst as it seems to leave my hair feeling clean and smelling nice.</li>
            <li> Not easy to apply, falls out of the container and spills everywhere, wouldn&#x27;t recommend on dark brown / black hair as this is a light brown.  Waste of money</li>
            <li> I have used MANY different dry shampoos and this is my favorite by far. Much better than the spray in kinds, plus is smells so nice. Helps with volume without the sticky residue of a spray in.</li>
            <li> I love this product. While I do use it for the expected - ie. when I don&#x27;t have time to wash my hair - like in the morning before I go to the gym - I&#x27;ve also found it&#x27;s a great way to increase body and to extend the life of your shampoo. I add it to my problem spots after washing and styling, and my hair is much less oily and retains more volume throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part - It&#x27;s really, truly brown - maybe a somewhat light or ashy brown but still blends well with my medium brown hair. I tried a spray sold on Amazon that purported to be \\&quot;brown\\&quot; but nonetheless came out white much of the time - despite shaking the container - seem to be no way to get it shaken enough to consistently get a brown colored spray. And the products that aren&#x27;t explicitly for brown hair - forget it - they make me look like I have grey roots!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells the best of any dry-shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;This is much too small a container - I&#x27;d really appreciate double the amount - no matter the price - I just don&#x27;t want to worry about replacing it every few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;The applicator dumps out a lot of product when you turn it upside down - it&#x27;s either all or nothing and that usually means there&#x27;s a certain amount of wasted product. It takes a bit of finess to manage no over-applying.</li>
            <li> Expensive product with not that much bang for your buck.... Was dissapointed after reading all the reviews. The brush applicator was very messy and made loose powder go all over my clothes and bathroom every time. I tried being very careful with it. Also you dont get as many uses with it as you would expect....It doesn&#x27;t have a lot of powder. It does smell good and worked decently for my dirty hair days...so theres that but I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Does a great job absorbing oil.  The brown color of this product blends nicely with my hair.  I&#x27;ve used the white version of this product and while it also works great, you have to be very careful to rub/comb thoroughly or else it will leave white traces in your hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered this dry shampoo because of the dark color of the powder and the brush applicator. Previously, I was applying baby powder with a make up brush to the roots of my hair where it becomes a little oily in between washes, which was fine, only that the baby powder would turn my dark brown hair gray at the roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compact in size and easy to use, this powder has a nice scent to it. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this as a volumizing product. It volumizes only because it soaks up the oil and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair flat. You get much more volume if you use a powder spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched to this after using the Bumble and Bumble brown powder spray because I  was tired of having the brown spray rub off on my fingers when I touched my hair. Very glad I switched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The powder can come out of the brush quite quickly, but after using it a couple of times, you&#x27;ll get the hang of it. I also ordered the Jonathan Product Green Rootine Dry Shampoo Brush On Powder (For Dark Hair) the same time I ordered this, and I like this better because of the darker color and the scent.</li>
            <li> The product itself is great, but it comes out of the brush WAY too fast.</li>
            <li> This is much better than some other spray dry shampoos I have tried. It doesn&#x27;t leave a residue at all.</li>
            <li> Total loss! Even Jhonsons baby powder is thousand times better than this useless product. Too disappointed with the results, hav to trash!</li>
            <li> Works well for soaking up oil at the hairline. Color blends well into brunette hair. Beware if you touch your hair, though. It will come off on your fingers throughout the day. Ew. Good in a pinch, but I wouldn&#x27;t say I actually like it.</li>
            <li> Great dry shampoo for brunettes.</li>
            <li> Hate this stuff. Nothing more that slightly tinted baby powder which flies everywhere and does nothing to cover thin spots or to make hair appear thicker. A total waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;I does absorb oil and give hair a clean look.&lt;br /&gt;If (when) it spills it is easy to wipe off skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It is pretty messy because it comes out very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Because it comes out quickly it gets on my forehead, in my ears, and on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my skin break out.</li>
            <li> I would have given it 4 stars if the powder didn&#x27;t come flying out when you turn it over.  Takes finesse to use.</li>
            <li> Meh, its okay. I have really dark hair so many dry shampoos look ashy on my hair. I like the actual powder but I&#x27;m not sold on the dispensing method. It&#x27;s messy and hard to control the amount coming out. I prefer aerosol dry shampoo personally.</li>
            <li> My go-to dry shampoo-works fantastic, I even use it when my hair isn&#x27;t dirty so that I can get the awesome lift it gives my roots!</li>
