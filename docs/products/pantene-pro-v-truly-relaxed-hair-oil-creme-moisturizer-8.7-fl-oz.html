            <li>Always love this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This was more oil than creme.  </li>
            <li>so I tend to use it more in the winter months.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more when depleted..</li>
            <li>Although, I&#x27;m not too sure for us curly girls...</li>
            <li>and it went much better</li>
            <li>However, it does the job OK.</li>
            <li>This is a great way to moisturize without adding too much weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I avoid heat styling most days.</li>
            <li>It has a nice, light smell.</li>
            <li>I love this product...keeps hair</li>
            <li>Gives my hair a healthy glow and people always compliment me on my hair.</li>
            <li>Love it .</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product and ordered more since I have not been able to find this item in the stores.</li>
            <li>my hair looks much better after applying this creme</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It has taken me 31 years to find something I love.  </li>
            <li>It has changed my hair for the better.</li>
            <li>They arrived safe and sound in about three days.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised and very appreciative.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product!</li>
            <li>If you have fine hair, this might be too oily.</li>
            <li>If you are allergic to mineral oil, stay away from this product as it is the primary ingredient.</li>
            <li>I have light, curly-frizzy hair, and I have tried just about every salon-recommended product out there, to the detriment of my checking account.</li>
            <li>Great product for mixed race hair</li>
            <li>and I got it as an add-on for free shipping.</li>
            <li>and I added it to another purchase so my shipping was free.</li>
            <li>This product gives what&#x27;s left of my hair a great shine and texture.  </li>
            <li>I received this item one week after placing the order using the Free Shipping option.  </li>
            <li>and I thought this might help smooth the frizzies out and/or moisturize it a bit.</li>
            <li>Good and nourishing for women of colour who want to wear their natural hair.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft, smelling good and moisturized</li>
            <li>We will continue to use this until it stops working like a miracle cream, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>It is a good moisturizer and leaves my hair (Type 4B) soft and manageable for about 2-3 days.  </li>
            <li>Her daughter&#x27;s hair has significantly gotten softer.</li>
            <li>Great for helping your hair to grow long.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using this, I no longer see a wig&#x27;s worth of my hair on the bathroom floor after blow-drying and styling it!  </li>
            <li>More like modern day</li>
            <li>The Pantene Pro-V Hair Oil Cr√®me is in the sweet spot for me.  </li>
            <li>I found such a wonderful styling product and will always keep buying, especially from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>great on natural curls, and natural hair.</li>
            <li>Admittedly - it kind of does so this will probably sit unused until out next under the sink clean out.</li>
            <li>and it comes out soft, silky, and smooth every time!</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li>It would not have been worth it to pay shipping.</li>
            <li>I love this product and how soft and moisturized</li>
            <li>However, this creme is great, smells amazing, and actually helps to tame my frizz.  </li>
            <li>Perfect light moisturizer and a little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li>Just kind of made it feel greasy and flat.</li>
            <li>I apply right after I wash my hair.</li>
            <li>It has been hard for me to find the right product that takes care of my friz and allows my curls to look great.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly as described</li>
            <li>Pantene changed the original formula and I prefer the original to the current formula.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair very manageable to comb through and style!</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have used many other hair products, but none have really worked like this one!!  </li>
            <li>I have always been one to get compliments, pretty much, everywhere I would go.  </li>
            <li>My daughters enjoy this product and I must say their hair looks much better after 2 months of use - much smoother and tame.</li>
            <li>When I take my hair down its always in better condition than I think and definitely better condition than it was prior to using this.</li>
            <li>I love the prompt delivery of it whenever it is due, cant have too much of this moisturizer!</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t put way, way, way too much on your hair.</li>
            <li>Too much and hair will look greasy.</li>
            <li>real  </li>
            <li>This stuff claims to keep your hair moisturized for up to 72 hours &amp; it does, but it is really greasy.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair very moist.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The results were very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, you don&#x27;t want to use too much.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve known that I need to keep it moisturized, but never could really find the product that did so without leaving my hair smelling like a car engine or oatmeal.</li>
            <li>and this product is one of the few moisturizer the gives my hair a nice sheen look and feel.</li>
            <li>I am of mixed decent and have fine but very curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I have been natural for 3 years and am still trying to find the right regimen/products for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I love Pantene relaxed range and use all of their other products.</li>
            <li>but it kept my frizz in check better than some other oils/gels I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic on grey hair.</li>
            <li>usually will run this through my hair then brush it through to keep it looking nice and shiny.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The humidity here is to high and hair tend to frizz and deshidrates.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone that needs moisture and wants soft manageable hair.</li>
            <li>I like a leave-in conditioner that leaves my curls looking soft and smooth - without having to blow dry or style my hair.</li>
            <li>I am biracial [black and white] and can use this after washing my hair and let it go curly in the summer; it moisturizes great with out the feel of grease or oil while in the winter it keeps my hair moisturized and feeling soft when flat ironed.</li>
            <li>Pantene is notorious for dropping products and making new ones, but this one deserves permanence.  </li>
            <li>This is a product that I have used for years but could not find it anywhere in the town in which I live.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li>I live in a tropical country (Dominican Republic)</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly for natural or relaxed hair because it doesn&#x27;t make the hair greasy.  </li>
            <li>I think this actually &amp;#34;conditions&amp;#34; the hair, as opposed to many other products labeled &amp;#34;conditioner&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li>If you are a natural try it out as a styler cream -- just before you add your gel!</li>
            <li>I have soft, shiny hair that looks straightened!</li>
            <li>The only time I have noticed a positive difference in my hair has been with this line of products.</li>
            <li>But moisturizers for white hair are too light and leave my hair feeling dry and uncontrollable.  </li>
            <li>It is a good product for dry hair but the problem with it is it makes my hair too soft which makes it too hard to style.</li>
            <li>This stuff really makes my hair soft, especially if I use it before curling it.</li>
            <li>I put some on at night and brush it through my hair before tying my hair up and by morning it&#x27;s so soft.</li>
            <li>Keeps hair moisturized and soft.  </li>
            <li>But I really like it for my coarse, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>My daughter has wildly curly hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as coarse as typical African-American hair, but it&#x27;s not as fine as Caucasian hair either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>if you have dry hair this is just the product for you just use a dime size amount hair looks very healthly.</li>
            <li>The ONLY thing that has EVER kept my naturally kinky hair soft for days, not hours.  </li>
            <li>I got a second bottle for myself and my hair is incredibly soft!</li>
            <li>It made my hair really greasy and wet.  </li>
            <li>I recently relaxed my hair after several years of being natural.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend only reason it didn&#x27;t get  stars is because its not necessarily a stand alone product on natural hair depending on your type.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an experiment for the first few times used.</li>
            <li>I like this product--which is hard to find in stores--because it gives a quick moisture with a shine.  </li>
            <li>it does contain one or two &#x27;cones, which usually dry out and break natural 4a to 4c hair, do I gave this product a couple weeks before writing a review.  </li>
            <li>The closest I&#x27;ve ever gotten previously is using straight jojoba oil, but that looks oily if I brush my hair or *have</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love this product and how soft and moisturized</li>
            <li> However, this creme is great, smells amazing, and actually helps to tame my frizz.  </li>
            <li> Perfect light moisturizer and a little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Just kind of made it feel greasy and flat.</li>
            <li> I apply right after I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> It has been hard for me to find the right product that takes care of my friz and allows my curls to look great.  </li>
            <li> It was exactly as described</li>
            <li> Pantene changed the original formula and I prefer the original to the current formula.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair very manageable to comb through and style!</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have used many other hair products, but none have really worked like this one!!  </li>
            <li> I have always been one to get compliments, pretty much, everywhere I would go.  </li>
            <li> My daughters enjoy this product and I must say their hair looks much better after 2 months of use - much smoother and tame.</li>
            <li> When I take my hair down its always in better condition than I think and definitely better condition than it was prior to using this.</li>
            <li> I love the prompt delivery of it whenever it is due, cant have too much of this moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t put way, way, way too much on your hair.</li>
            <li> Too much and hair will look greasy.</li>
            <li> real  </li>
            <li> This stuff claims to keep your hair moisturized for up to 72 hours &amp; it does, but it is really greasy.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair very moist.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The results were very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , you don&#x27;t want to use too much.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve known that I need to keep it moisturized, but never could really find the product that did so without leaving my hair smelling like a car engine or oatmeal.</li>
            <li> and this product is one of the few moisturizer the gives my hair a nice sheen look and feel.</li>
            <li> I am of mixed decent and have fine but very curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I have been natural for 3 years and am still trying to find the right regimen/products for my hair.  </li>
            <li> I love Pantene relaxed range and use all of their other products.</li>
            <li> but it kept my frizz in check better than some other oils/gels I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic on grey hair.</li>
            <li> usually will run this through my hair then brush it through to keep it looking nice and shiny.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The humidity here is to high and hair tend to frizz and deshidrates.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone that needs moisture and wants soft manageable hair.</li>
            <li> I like a leave-in conditioner that leaves my curls looking soft and smooth - without having to blow dry or style my hair.</li>
            <li> I am biracial [black and white] and can use this after washing my hair and let it go curly in the summer; it moisturizes great with out the feel of grease or oil while in the winter it keeps my hair moisturized and feeling soft when flat ironed.</li>
            <li> Pantene is notorious for dropping products and making new ones, but this one deserves permanence.  </li>
            <li> This is a product that I have used for years but could not find it anywhere in the town in which I live.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li> I live in a tropical country (Dominican Republic)</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly for natural or relaxed hair because it doesn&#x27;t make the hair greasy.  </li>
            <li> I think this actually &amp;#34;conditions&amp;#34; the hair, as opposed to many other products labeled &amp;#34;conditioner&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li> If you are a natural try it out as a styler cream -- just before you add your gel!</li>
            <li> I have soft, shiny hair that looks straightened!</li>
            <li> The only time I have noticed a positive difference in my hair has been with this line of products.</li>
            <li> But moisturizers for white hair are too light and leave my hair feeling dry and uncontrollable.  </li>
            <li> It is a good product for dry hair but the problem with it is it makes my hair too soft which makes it too hard to style.</li>
            <li> This stuff really makes my hair soft, especially if I use it before curling it.</li>
            <li> I put some on at night and brush it through my hair before tying my hair up and by morning it&#x27;s so soft.</li>
            <li> Keeps hair moisturized and soft.  </li>
            <li> But I really like it for my coarse, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter has wildly curly hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as coarse as typical African-American hair, but it&#x27;s not as fine as Caucasian hair either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> if you have dry hair this is just the product for you just use a dime size amount hair looks very healthly.</li>
            <li> The ONLY thing that has EVER kept my naturally kinky hair soft for days, not hours.  </li>
            <li> I got a second bottle for myself and my hair is incredibly soft!</li>
            <li> It made my hair really greasy and wet.  </li>
            <li> I recently relaxed my hair after several years of being natural.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend only reason it didn&#x27;t get  stars is because its not necessarily a stand alone product on natural hair depending on your type.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an experiment for the first few times used.</li>
            <li> I like this product--which is hard to find in stores--because it gives a quick moisture with a shine.  </li>
            <li> it does contain one or two &#x27;cones, which usually dry out and break natural 4a to 4c hair, do I gave this product a couple weeks before writing a review.  </li>
            <li> The closest I&#x27;ve ever gotten previously is using straight jojoba oil, but that looks oily if I brush my hair or *have</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s grown at least two inches during the first month of use, applying it every three days (since it says 72 hour care).</li>
            <li> However, I have used this with my flat irons on occasion.</li>
            <li> but if you have a sensitive scalp or don&#x27;t want weighed down hair then this is not for you.</li>
            <li> (I haven&#x27;t tried styling with it - only using it as a leave-in to have my hair dry curly.)</li>
            <li> Ok, as someone who decided to go natural without the &amp;#34;big chop&amp;#34; &amp; a little over a year later, am still technically transitioning from relaxed to natural, I&#x27;ve been desperately seeking something that can keep my hair from looking like dried tumbleweeds.</li>
            <li> And with the help of Pantene Daily Moisture Renewal shampoo and conditioner, my 6-decade-old hair is no longer dry!</li>
            <li> Well, lately that had not been happening as much.  </li>
            <li> When I blow dry my hair</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that has coconut in it and keeps my hair looking moist without that oily residue as I have incredibly dry hair.</li>
            <li> Well, same results,  her hair came back from the dead as well.  </li>
            <li> After less then a week, I started noticing that my hair was actually moving again.  </li>
            <li> styling it in the morning even takes less time and it has made it possible to start shampooing in the morning, before work, again.  </li>
            <li> I used to be able to get this product at Walmart, but within the last 6 months, they discontinued it :(.  </li>
            <li> i have very dry hair</li>
            <li> AND - only a little bit is needed.</li>
            <li> I have never really used a oil cream moisturizer before</li>
            <li> You can then scrunch up, fluff up or brush out your hair</li>
            <li> have long (mid back) very thick hair.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way; it is not too greasy and brings out my coils.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel greasy and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I used this in my hair every day or every other day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get excessive build up from using this so long as it&#x27;s used sparingly .</li>
            <li> Keeps it moisturized, without making it feel weighed down or sticky.</li>
            <li> It does not weigh the hair down and leave any oily residue.  </li>
            <li> A little does go a long way, and I have thick hair.</li>
            <li> I am African-American and I have thick, dry hair that needs lots of moisture.  </li>
            <li> and it gives a little set.  </li>
            <li> I have a porky little Quarter horse whose tail doesn&#x27;t surpass his hocks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little heavy</li>
            <li> For reference, I am a mixed race woman with very thick curly hair.  </li>
            <li> moisturizers made for African-American hair are too heavy mine and leave it greasy.  </li>
            <li> Is less expensive formulation from the same manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> Just a small amount can give your hair shine without that heavy oil feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not sure that this one measures up.  </li>
            <li> used re-grow in the past but that did not work for me.  </li>
            <li> It also made my hair feel very heavy.</li>
            <li> I gave this item 4 stars because it does what it says, but I can&#x27;t use it that often because there&#x27;s a thin like between having moisturized hair &amp; curls that are limp from heavy oils.</li>
            <li> My wife had been looking around and it seems this is hard to find.</li>
            <li> I use it on my natural hair as well as when I am in braids or havana twists using synthetic hair,it keeps my hair from drying out under all that fake hair that&#x27;s cutting off its air supply.</li>
            <li> This was not a good thing.  </li>
            <li> I tried other products for a while and was highly disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It made my scalp itch like mad so bad that I was constantly stratching until I washed it out.</li>
            <li> This product caused an unfortunate rash on my neckline.</li>
            <li> I am unable to find it in stores.</li>
            <li> I had curly/wavy hair,  and I hated using gel and mousse.</li>
            <li> But I was very disappointed with this one.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair all greasy and nasty.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the only product that has worked for my hair.  It is so moisturizing and smells so good!  I bought three at once,  because it&#x27;s 9 bucks where I&#x27;m from.  Amazon always has good deals, and this was a steal.  I had curly/wavy hair,  and I hated using gel and mousse. I found such a wonderful styling product and will always keep buying, especially from Amazon.  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> This is great &amp; I can comb my hair right out of the shower with no tangles!!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  For those who like their hair to be in tip-top shape, use the oil cr&amp;egrave;me.  For me one tube lasts for two months, and it is a great way to treat your scalp and your hair.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Family loves Pantene products and religiously buys Pantene Shampoo and Conditioner but they complain this product makes their hair look greasy. Admittedly - it kind of does so this will probably sit unused until out next under the sink clean out.</li>
            <li> works great in my daughters hair!</li>
            <li> Great product from a reliable beauty company.  Good and nourishing for women of colour who want to wear their natural hair.</li>
            <li> This product caused an unfortunate rash on my neckline. If you are allergic to mineral oil, stay away from this product as it is the primary ingredient.</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders. I recently relaxed my hair after several years of being natural. Having go find staple products all over again seemed intimidated. I decided to try out the pantene relaxed line and bought this stuff at walmart. My hair finally feels moisturized! I won&#x27;t need to look any further and it&#x27;s such a relief</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer!  lightweight, pleasant smell.  great on natural curls, and natural hair.</li>
            <li> This product works. It&#x27;s work for me and for friends and family members. Last week, I offered an entire tube to a friend whose daughter has very coarse hair. She used it and sent me a text raving about the product. Her daughter&#x27;s hair has significantly gotten softer. The same happens to my nieces as well. My sister loves to use it on their hair even when they have braids on. I use this product daily on my scalp and hair. People are constantly asking me about the product I&#x27;m using on my hair - - I love this cream.</li>
            <li> My daughters enjoy this product and I must say their hair looks much better after 2 months of use - much smoother and tame. It smells great too.</li>
            <li> this is the only product that works to maintain my hair.  is keeps is not frizzy n healthy.  Great for helping your hair to grow long.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes without leaving your hair with any greasy residue.  It is also very light weight and has a really nice smell that is not over powering.</li>
            <li> This stuff really makes my hair soft, especially if I use it before curling it. I put some on at night and brush it through my hair before tying my hair up and by morning it&#x27;s so soft.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as described. I would order this product again.  I have enjoyed using this product,</li>
            <li> The ONLY thing that has EVER kept my naturally kinky hair soft for days, not hours.  it does contain one or two &#x27;cones, which usually dry out and break natural 4a to 4c hair, do I gave this product a couple weeks before writing a review.  Pantene is notorious for dropping products and making new ones, but this one deserves permanence.  in love with my hair again.</li>
            <li> Always love this product. It does not leave my hair oily. Just don&#x27;t put way, way, way too much on your hair. And with the help of Pantene Daily Moisture Renewal shampoo and conditioner, my 6-decade-old hair is no longer dry!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product! I have light, curly-frizzy hair, and I have tried just about every salon-recommended product out there, to the detriment of my checking account. I like a leave-in conditioner that leaves my curls looking soft and smooth - without having to blow dry or style my hair. The closest I&#x27;ve ever gotten previously is using straight jojoba oil, but that looks oily if I brush my hair or *have* to style it. This Pantene product is he best of all worlds. (I haven&#x27;t tried styling with it - only using it as a leave-in to have my hair dry curly.) AND - only a little bit is needed. Too much and hair will look greasy. It&#x27;s an experiment for the first few times used. Works for days!  UPDATE: After using this product for a week, I feel like my hair is healthier than ever. I think this actually &amp;#34;conditions&amp;#34; the hair, as opposed to many other products labeled &amp;#34;conditioner&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li> So I only used the product once and I do like how it smells. I have never really used a oil cream moisturizer before but I like it</li>
            <li> This is all I use on my hair after washing and blow drying.  I use it every day as well.  Keeps hair moisturized and soft.  I have noticed hair growth while using it too.  Definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I wrote to the Pantene company because I could not find the product I had been using and they said that this one replaced the one I was looking for.  I&#x27;m just not sure that this one measures up.  However, it does moisturize the hair without leaving a greasy look and I will probably continue to use it.  I do like the facts that you can use it daily and you don&#x27;t have to rinse it out.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a relaxer in years and this stuff still works well for my hair. A little does go a long way, and I have thick hair. If you are a natural try it out as a styler cream -- just before you add your gel! I love it. :) And it smells great, too. :)</li>
            <li> Really nice creme for my straight-wavy hair! When I blow dry my hair I add some of this creme and before I know it I have soft, shiny hair that looks straightened! I absolutely love it! I use my tresemme heat protectant, a bit of africas kids organics shea butter detangled and this creme before blowdrying my hair and it comes out soft, silky, and smooth every time! Pictures coming soon!</li>
            <li> Great product for mixed race hair</li>
            <li> This was more oil than creme.  It made my hair really greasy and wet.  This was not a good thing.  More like modern day jehri curl juice; yuck.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my hair soft. It&#x27;s a little heavy so I tend to use it more in the winter months.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft, smelling good and moisturized</li>
            <li> Just a small amount can give your hair shine without that heavy oil feeling. I apply right after I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> if you have dry hair this is just the product for you just use a dime size amount hair looks very healthly.</li>
            <li> It is a good product for dry hair but the problem with it is it makes my hair too soft which makes it too hard to style.</li>
            <li> Repairs damage! Brings hair back to life! Keeps it moisturized, without making it feel weighed down or sticky. What&#x27;s not to love?!</li>
            <li> Great price and I got it as an add-on for free shipping. It would not have been worth it to pay shipping. My wife had been looking around and it seems this is hard to find. It was exactly as described and I added it to another purchase so my shipping was free.</li>
            <li> This is a product that I have used for years but could not find it anywhere in the town in which I live. Whenever I purchased it I would have to do so in a larger city or have my family buy it and send it to me.  I took a chance that Amazon could provide it and I ordered three.  They arrived safe and sound in about three days.  I was surprised and very appreciative.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t  like the autumn v  vivica Fox wig  I  don&#x27;t  like  the  hair  not  real  look  for African-American women</li>
            <li> This product gives what&#x27;s left of my hair a great shine and texture.  I will be ordering more when depleted..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pantene for over 20 years now.  All I can say is that it works...I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> I like this product--which is hard to find in stores--because it gives a quick moisture with a shine.  You can then scrunch up, fluff up or brush out your hair and it gives a little set.  Smells good too!</li>
            <li> This sounds kind of crazy...I have a porky little Quarter horse whose tail doesn&#x27;t surpass his hocks and I&#x27;ve tried three different hair oils on it to make it grow and thus is the knot one that works! It&#x27;s grown at least two inches during the first month of use, applying it every three days (since it says 72 hour care). I got a second bottle for myself and my hair is incredibly soft! Just don&#x27;t make the mistake of putting it too close to your roots.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer for African-American hair.  For reference, I am a mixed race woman with very thick curly hair.  It&#x27;s not as coarse as typical African-American hair, but it&#x27;s not as fine as Caucasian hair either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most moisturizers made for African-American hair are too heavy mine and leave it greasy.  But moisturizers for white hair are too light and leave my hair feeling dry and uncontrollable.  The Pantene Pro-V Hair Oil Cr√®me is in the sweet spot for me.  It keeps my hair moisturized but not greasy.  My hair looks shiny and controllable during the day.  No fly-aways or dryness.  As a result, my hair is the healthiest it&#x27;s ever been.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this by reading all those good reviews, but I didn&#x27;t like it  ( may be just my hair type ) now I am thinking what to do with that.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for years. I do like it. It adds control without adding weight. Pantene changed the original formula and I prefer the original to the current formula. Still it is the only styling product I use.</li>
            <li> bought this in quantity because I love it!  I can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li> Works the way it says and it has truly revived my hair.  I have always been blessed when it comes to my hair.  I have always been one to get compliments, pretty much, everywhere I would go.  Well, lately that had not been happening as much.  Even my hair dresser said she was seeing some breakage along the collar line ( area where your coat collar rubs up against your neck).  I started to look for another moisturizer since I realized the change occurred soon after I had changed my last moisturizer.  After reading the reviews on multiple products, I decided to try Pantene Pro-V for relaxed hair.  After less then a week, I started noticing that my hair was actually moving again.  Believe it or not, I had actually grown accustomed to it not moving.  styling it in the morning even takes less time and it has made it possible to start shampooing in the morning, before work, again.  My God, what a difference a moisturizer makes.  My daughter started using this as well even though she had still been using our last moisturizer.  She noticed the shine movement and the shine and realized her hair no longer looked as gorgeous as it once had.  Well, same results,  her hair came back from the dead as well.  We will continue to use this until it stops working like a miracle cream, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Ok, as someone who decided to go natural without the &amp;#34;big chop&amp;#34; &amp; a little over a year later, am still technically transitioning from relaxed to natural, I&#x27;ve been desperately seeking something that can keep my hair from looking like dried tumbleweeds. This stuff claims to keep your hair moisturized for up to 72 hours &amp; it does, but it is really greasy. I gave this item 4 stars because it does what it says, but I can&#x27;t use it that often because there&#x27;s a thin like between having moisturized hair &amp; curls that are limp from heavy oils. I will say, if your hair is relaxed &amp; looking for a good moisturized, then this is it! Although, I&#x27;m not too sure for us curly girls...</li>
            <li> Not as I was expecting. It made my hair look greasy and oily. I&#x27;ll never buy it again.</li>
            <li> The product that I purchased did not do the effect I was expecting I have bought another item basically the same and it went much better</li>
            <li> Item is not Pro-V as shown.  Is less expensive formulation from the same manufacturer.  However, it does the job OK.</li>
            <li> helpful. makes the hair easier to organize and makes it looks healthier</li>
            <li> MY hair did not like it.</li>
            <li> I love this product and how soft and moisturized my hair feels after using it. It makes my hair very manageable to comb through and style! I will definitely continue to use this product!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I am biracial [black and white] and can use this after washing my hair and let it go curly in the summer; it moisturizes great with out the feel of grease or oil while in the winter it keeps my hair moisturized and feeling soft when flat ironed. I would recommend this to anyone that needs moisture and wants soft manageable hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a godsend. The only time I have noticed a positive difference in my hair has been with this line of products.</li>
            <li> Works great for me. I was looking for something that has coconut in it and keeps my hair looking moist without that oily residue as I have incredibly dry hair. This does the trick and smells great as well. Hair looks healthier and nourished after extended use</li>
            <li> I used this in my hair every day or every other day. It keeps my hair very moist.&lt;br /&gt;I used re-grow in the past but that did not work for me.  I appreciate the pantene line of products.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to moisturize without adding too much weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long (mid back) very thick hair. I avoid heat styling most days. However, I have used this with my flat irons on occasion. The results were very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually will run this through my hair then brush it through to keep it looking nice and shiny. I don&#x27;t get excessive build up from using this so long as it&#x27;s used sparingly . It has a nice, light smell. Not overly floral or too perfumey.</li>
            <li> Perfect. I am unable to find it in stores. I am thrilled and totally pleased!!</li>
            <li> I love Pantene relaxed range and use all of their other products. But I was very disappointed with this one. It made my scalp itch like mad so bad that I was constantly stratching until I washed it out. It also made my hair feel very heavy. Great value for money but if you have a sensitive scalp or don&#x27;t want weighed down hair then this is not for you.</li>
            <li> I live in a tropical country (Dominican Republic) The humidity here is to high and hair tend to frizz and deshidrates. this help me a lot to hidratate my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product...keeps hair so moisturized I use it on my natural hair as well as when I am in braids or havana twists using synthetic hair,it keeps my hair from drying out under all that fake hair that&#x27;s cutting off its air supply. When I take my hair down its always in better condition than I think and definitely better condition than it was prior to using this. I would definitely recommend only reason it didn&#x27;t get  stars is because its not necessarily a stand alone product on natural hair depending on your type.</li>
            <li> My hair loves this cream. It soaks it up and it feels like it is actually doing the job. Smells great too!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking oily. Gives my hair a healthy glow and people always compliment me on my hair. Will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> I have horrendously frizzy hair.  I have never found a product that seems to help.  However, this creme is great, smells amazing, and actually helps to tame my frizz.  I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note, you don&#x27;t want to use too much.  It makes your hair all greasy and nasty.</li>
            <li> Love it . This product adds a great shine to my hair.</li>
            <li> I received this item one week after placing the order using the Free Shipping option.  I have been natural for 3 years and am still trying to find the right regimen/products for my hair.  This has done wonders for me.  It is a good moisturizer and leaves my hair (Type 4B) soft and manageable for about 2-3 days.  A little goes a long way; it is not too greasy and brings out my coils. I will continue to use this product and ordered more since I have not been able to find this item in the stores.</li>
            <li> I am African-American and I have thick, dry hair that needs lots of moisture.  This hair oil creme provides a lot of moisture without being too oily.  It does not weigh the hair down and leave any oily residue.  I would purchase this product again without hesitation.  I LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> Woks well.smells good.</li>
            <li> Great for my hair, gives me shine and moisture to make my hair more manageable.</li>
            <li> Beautiful. My hair takes a beating with the regimen I put it through and I&#x27;ve known that I need to keep it moisturized, but never could really find the product that did so without leaving my hair smelling like a car engine or oatmeal. But this!! Perfect light moisturizer and a little bit goes a long way! Since I&#x27;ve been using this, I no longer see a wig&#x27;s worth of my hair on the bathroom floor after blow-drying and styling it!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and have always found it to be a great moisturizer and not too oily.  I recommend it highly for natural or relaxed hair because it doesn&#x27;t make the hair greasy.  It&#x27;s fantastic on grey hair.</li>
            <li> Loved it and it work just as I thought it would on my hair.</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair, this might be too oily. But I really like it for my coarse, frizzy hair. This is supposed to be for relaxed hair, and mine is not--but it kept my frizz in check better than some other oils/gels I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> My daughter has wildly curly hair and I thought this might help smooth the frizzies out and/or moisturize it a bit. Just kind of made it feel greasy and flat.</li>
            <li> i have very dry hair and this product is one of the few moisturizer the gives my hair a nice sheen look and feel. I love the prompt delivery of it whenever it is due, cant have too much of this moisturizer!</li>
            <li> my hair looks much better after applying this creme</li>
            <li> This is a nice leave in moisturizer. It leaves my hair feeling soft and smooth. I even bought one for my mom to use as well. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel greasy and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I have used many other hair products, but none have really worked like this one!!  I am of mixed decent and have fine but very curly hair.  It has been hard for me to find the right product that takes care of my friz and allows my curls to look great.  This is definitely the product for me. It has taken me 31 years to find something I love.  I used to be able to get this product at Walmart, but within the last 6 months, they discontinued it :(.  I tried other products for a while and was highly disappointed.  So, I checked online and there it was.  I was so happy that I ordered 7!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lets just say, thank God for Pantene Pro-V Relaxed Hair Oil Cream.  It has changed my hair for the better.</li>
