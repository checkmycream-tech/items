            <li>One of my most regretful purchases from amazon!!</li>

            <li>Did not come in the box, but they work well and are very nice.</li>
            <li>It creates very nice curlers.</li>
            <li>I love it&#x27;s the best my friends like it and my mom?</li>
            <li>price is good and the product seems durable.</li>
            <li>These rollers did a fairly good job.</li>
            <li>So i gave it a 3 because it works for her and shipping was good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product.  </li>
            <li>My daughter ordered these and loved them.</li>
            <li>They are good, just not for hair longer than your shoulders and wand is not included.</li>
            <li>And also it takes a good minute for them to come in</li>
            <li>well were in good shape.</li>
            <li>She loved it</li>
            <li>These are so good.</li>
            <li>makes really good curls.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;d almost have to have a twa for them to be any good.</li>
            <li>but honestly they work great</li>
            <li>Good quality and good price.  </li>
            <li>the ones I bought from Sally&#x27;s people loved it and asked where to get them too...</li>
            <li>I will say the communication was good...</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li>When i bought these i loved the concept...</li>
            <li>are good.  </li>
            <li>They do a good job.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>This set is good if you want to TRY curlformers, to see if it works for you or not.</li>
            <li>I will rerate if I have a good experience.</li>
            <li>Good set.</li>
            <li>This package is a good starter</li>
            <li>It is real easy to use with no heat.</li>
            <li>Materials used are very cheap and flimsy!</li>
            <li>I knocked a star because the wand is not the best; it&#x27;s pretty flimsy.</li>
            <li>Flexirods are a much better product than these!</li>
            <li>I have had so many people ask me how I did it!</li>
            <li>Make sure you convert their metrics into inches if you are unsure!</li>
            <li>Scrooge and just pay the money for the better product sold stateside!</li>
            <li>Curlers like this are great and easy to use.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and work great.  </li>
            <li>They are easy to use and a great deal for the buck.</li>
            <li>I recommended to my friends because it&#x27;s so amazing.</li>
            <li>Be sure to find a good product to go with the rollers, or they won&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li>I honestly think almost lost this trip, not counting the time to request a refund.</li>
            <li>Full, bouncy, beautiful spiral curls.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, got nice bouncy curls and didn&#x27;t have to use any heat.</li>
            <li>I used these to curl the ends of my hair and liked the look.</li>
            <li>The price is also nice.</li>
            <li>She looked really cute and she loved her hair.</li>
            <li>but I love the product easy to use and my hair looks great every time</li>
            <li>Price was great and came in quickly.</li>
            <li>They make good curls but they are not that easy to handle.</li>
            <li>This product is very easy to use</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>it, love it love it!</li>
            <li>She says there better than spongrollers and nice to sleep in.</li>
            <li>but The are a great fun to use.</li>
            <li>the hook in this box does kind of suck and yes the directions on the box are comical and make no sense, but watch a youtube video and give it a try.</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say they are much better sleeping in than the flexi rods.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the fact that I can get nice, bouncey, and shiny curls without sitting under a dryer.  </li>
            <li>I remain excited and hopeul that I&#x27;ll get good results also&lt;</li>
            <li>Very cheap made.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, and nice colors.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, nice .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just started transitioning from relaxed to natural hair and since twists don&#x27;t work as nicely with my hair being still mostly relaxed, I wanted to try these curlers to see if I could get some spiral curls and after using this product, it worked beautifully.  </li>
            <li>They are super easy to put in and look AMAZING after!</li>
            <li>These are just okay.</li>
            <li>The rubber or plastic at the top and bottom of the curlers are not well made, and deformed.&lt;br /&gt;Made</li>
            <li>I then realized that I needed one more set.</li>
            <li>I got my rollers and I love them.</li>
            <li>I love these rollers.</li>
            <li>Since my hair has a tighter curl than the rollers, I enjoyed seeing my spiral curls elongated.</li>
            <li>They were just perfect for my short hair</li>
            <li>So i gave them to my sister who has short hair and they work perfect for her.</li>
            <li>Wish there were more to use as we ran out before all of her hair was wrapped and curled</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s why I love this item.im</li>
            <li>i thought these would be the perfect size for my hair since they were short ..</li>
            <li>I would return them, but it would cost more than I paid for them.</li>
            <li>Curls were cute.</li>
            <li>Perhaps I&#x27;d get better results with a thinner roller.  </li>
            <li>Months later, &amp; I still haven&#x27;t used them in my own hair!!!  </li>
            <li>Great price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>I need more.</li>
            <li>Better than all the rollers i had before.</li>
            <li>i love these things..</li>
            <li>i wasnt sure if they were gonna work</li>
            <li>If I was more organized around the time of purchase, I would have returned them.</li>
            <li>The ones I got from NAVA were much better than these.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I got these.</li>
            <li>I love the curls that these make.  </li>
            <li>We needed 2 or more to cover her head.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE my curlformers.</li>
            <li>Glad they were cheap!</li>
            <li>I look like Medusa but the ringlets are cute.</li>
            <li>and you should - do yourself a favor and, for more money, get better-quality curlformers and hook.</li>
            <li>I did not want to pay over 60 bucks for curlformers if I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like them.  </li>
            <li>and I just love the price.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I wasn&#x27;t totally satisfied with the QUALITY, but I guess I got what I paid for.  </li>
            <li>May be better for longer hair, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>I bought more on AMAZON</li>
            <li>I tried it so many times in so many ways and nothing worked......</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t mind having 4-5 more curlers and may end up ordering another</li>
            <li>I Love the snail rolls styling curler tools, would recommend to anyone, received ahead of schedule.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to find just the hook to purchase.</li>
            <li>does not curl hair have tried many times.</li>
            <li>and I love &#x27;em.</li>
            <li>I love the curls.</li>
            <li>I was able to sleep without a problem .</li>
            <li>I wish I had more long pieces, but the product was excellent.</li>
            <li>lol I found it easy to use, no broken ones.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m ordering another so they can be nice and full.</li>
            <li>My curls came out beautiful and I have natural hair (no perm).</li>
            <li>I love them very easy and quick once you get the hang of them..</li>
            <li>This is the best and more practical way I found so far to curl my hair without a hot curler.</li>
            <li>I bought similar ones from sally beauty supply for way more ( better quality) worked great but needed more for my daughters hair..</li>
            <li>they work best on soaking wet hair</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product for inexperienced DIY hair stylers.</li>
            <li>Time took shorter than expected which was wonderful.</li>
            <li>I found a great startup kit with everything you need to go Natural.</li>
            <li>It does good work with a straight hair like mine, who doesn&#x27;t want it with permanent.  </li>
            <li>I originally ordered 2 to be on the safe side..</li>
            <li>Really easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Slides on and off easily.</li>

            <li>18pcs Hair Rollers Snail Rolls Styling Curler Tools, Easy</li>
            <li>Loved the results on my natural hair, wished more came in a pack.</li>
            <li>Great for natural hair especially when trying to avoid heat but still get great curls.</li>
            <li>Beautiful curls with no heat was my objective.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re super easy to install, come in cute colors, &amp; spare my hair heat damage (since you don&#x27;t have to use heat with these if you don&#x27;t want to).</li>
            <li>The stick was fine.</li>
            <li>Luckily I ordered another pack from another seller and got a better one.</li>
            <li>The delivery was sooner than expected and very good</li>
            <li>huge dissapointment</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think all that work and not being able to sleep was worth one day of beauty.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this is cheap pieces of junk from china.</li>
            <li>Overall really great product for the price.</li>
            <li>so I had to buy two of them just to try to fit all of my hair.</li>
            <li>Great if you have really short hair.  </li>
            <li>The hook is cheap and has a seam on the inside where your hair slides.</li>
            <li>Also, the hook broke in my luggage on a trip because its cheap.</li>
            <li>The curlers themselves are fantastic.</li>
            <li>Also smooth out the eye of the hook, since the plastic at the seam can damage your hair, and 4) PREPARE TO WAIT 2-3 WEEKS</li>
            <li>They are comfortable to sleep in when I use a satin bonnet.</li>
            <li>This is SUPER easy and quick!  </li>
            <li>Very flimsy!!!  </li>
            <li>But other than that I love them and will be ordering more soon!!</li>
            <li>super easy to use.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use and isn&#x27;t too time consuming.</li>
            <li>The delivery was also quick and easy.</li>
            <li>but it was more noticible when I first go them).</li>
            <li>i bought them and was excited to get them.</li>
            <li>SO worth ordering!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still willing to try the authentic original product, but this was a lesson learnt in &amp;</li>
            <li>love these so much, work like a charm!</li>
            <li>they make pretty curls but it works better on shorter hair that is shoulder length or shorter.</li>
            <li>I was excited when my first set arrived before I went out of town, so I was sure they would all be there when I got home.</li>
            <li>They are cheaper than the original.</li>
            <li>Because so many women stated the product was not properly advertised since their hair is long, I knew it would be a perfect fit for me.</li>
            <li>They are easy to install and fun to put in (why, I dont know they just are lol)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After using it for while my hair grew longer so I placed an order from the same seller, thinking it would be good to have another set and use the longer once since my hair had grown longer.</li>
            <li>Overall, a good bang for your buck.</li>
            <li>They were easy for her to use on her own as she is only 11.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Actually it was pretty easy to figure out.</li>
            <li>so I had to use super glue to keep it from coming apart when I used it.  </li>
            <li>Once you get the hang of it, this is a quick process.</li>
            <li>I had seen these 2 years ago and am so excited to finally have a set of my own.  </li>
            <li>the material seems pretty cheap and sometimes gets tangled with my hair.</li>
            <li>I was able to realize that the new set is actuality shorter.</li>
            <li>It arrived fast and they are easy to use.</li>
            <li>They are very comfy to sleep in and easy to put in, directions would have helped, but I just watched some youtube videos to guide me.</li>
            <li>First off, AMERICANS OF THE UNITED STATES PLEASE BE MINDFUL THAT THE REST OF THE WORLD OPERATES SOLELY ON THE METRIC SYSTEM!</li>
            <li>fit much hair into each roller.&lt;br /&gt;Felt</li>
            <li>My hair is natural though, so these as not the easiest to install and since my length is shorter I did not get as much curl as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>I saw so many women of my ethnicity rave about using curlformers on their natural hair.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>They are definetly worth the investment.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always looking for a no heat alternative for curling my hair, but these are not even useful.</li>
            <li>but it was really worth the wait.</li>
            <li>and I thought this would be fun to try as an alternative to heat curling.</li>
            <li>Second Great for Natural Hair Folks and all hair types.</li>
            <li>I think I will have fun with these.</li>
            <li>I managed to complete were nice, but couldn&#x27;t get the whole head done.</li>
            <li>Once you master these are fun to use and results</li>
            <li>Fun using them.</li>
            <li>Definetly worth it.</li>
            <li>Super easy for a 3 year old who won&#x27;t hold still.  </li>
            <li>I loved these roller, they were extremely well priced,&lt;br /</li>
            <li>no instructions looked up on line and hair just goes right through the hole and wont curl hanging thru there</li>
            <li>So I am still trying to find the right product to use a setting lotion.</li>
            <li>They suck to sleep in if you have them right on your roots.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve been doing my own as well as friends&#x27; hair for a long time and caught on pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Works super well, but you will need more than just one pack for your entire hair.</li>
            <li>so I really couldn&#x27;t rate it in a positive light.</li>
            <li>the other brand is better Vakind Hair Curler Magic Spiral Ringlets, I guess there ok for short hair</li>
            <li>I ordered 2 sets of this product previously and loved it.</li>
            <li>There is definitely a learning curve, but there are several great YouTube videos to explain how to use them.  </li>
            <li>they are easy to sleep in and in the morning it looks like it is natural</li>
            <li>This is a great way to get the same look achieved using the traditional rods.  </li>
            <li>I like the curlers only problem is they are alot smaller then pictured , would be great for some one with shorter hair</li>
            <li>BTW, this does not come with instructions so you may want to watch a tutorial first.</li>
            <li>: These rollers are better for short to medium length.</li>
            <li>I love these and cannot compliment them enough.</li>
            <li>The style only lasted a day but it was cute.</li>
            <li>I could&#x27;ve used a hot curler or flexi-rods.</li>
            <li>This product was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m adding to this post, because sure enough, the day I rated it one star, the item arrived, but it still took a month to get here.  </li>
            <li>First thing I noticed was the lack of instructions.  </li>
            <li>buy the longer ones,you could still use them when hair grows these ones broke the first time i used them</li>
            <li>I will be making more purches in the future.</li>
            <li>the tool used to pull the hair through broke on me during the first use.  </li>
            <li>Next time, I will look for a better product.</li>
            <li>There came exactly as stated on line.</li>
            <li>This pack would be better suited to short or children&#x27;s hair that is not longer than shoulder length.</li>
            <li>The plastic tool broke during my first use.</li>
            <li>First DO your reasearch, its a knock off of Sally&#x27;s Curlformers so just google and youtube curlformers and they are a ton of video tutorial.</li>
            <li>My daughter ( Age 9.5) actually likes these more cause</li>
            <li>so I had to order more and from a different company.</li>
            <li>Is great for short and long hair.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>The first time I used them the plastic hook broke, so literally took the product out of the box and it broke.</li>
            <li>so you can see the pretty curls</li>
            <li>Pretty curls.</li>
            <li>Keep my hair looking good and growing since I don&#x27;t have to me with it everyday.</li>
            <li>I took them out after a few hours and my hair was curly, but not in a good way.</li>
            <li>just letting it hangs as you seen at the ad, is not for me, since it made it look flat at the top.</li>
            <li>The product overall is fairly good, my only problem is that the 2piece wand always comes out when I pull my hair through the curlformers and that gets aggravating.</li>
            <li>Tried on my wet, naturally curly hair and LOVED it.</li>
            <li>Got this smaller, shorter set for the shorter sections of my hair, which was good, then got a bigger group of longer ones.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something I can wear over night and the next day just be able to take them off and be ready (since I don&#x27;t have time at all to do my hair).</li>
            <li>I wish they could be a little longer, but other than that, they are great!</li>
            <li>They kind of train you to use small enough sections because only so much fits in the hook, which is a good thing for even-ness and for drying quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m OK with the  18pcs rollers, just it take to long to curl</li>
            <li>After you get the hand of how to get them on you can pretty much breeze through the process</li>
            <li>My hair is about 5 inches long so the length is better for those with shorter hair.</li>
            <li>Just make sure your hair is completely dry before taking the curlers out and use a sculpting or setting lotion or gel.  </li>
            <li>what no one told me was that ur hair had to be a certain length to use the curl formers...</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t consider yourself a wiz with your own hair (or others), or haven&#x27;t used curlers before, this might be a little tricky to catch onto.</li>
            <li>When I emailed my concerns to the seller, they said thanks for contacting them, and &amp;#34;Have a nice life&amp;#34;, but they offered no solutions, not even a  replacement roller for the missing roller.</li>
            <li>So like I expected, Amazon has everything and more reasonable than the Beauty Supply store.</li>
            <li>I really like them.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend if for anyone with roots that aren&#x27;t naturally straight and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>Thanks for making them affordable to buy.</li>
            <li>I will just buy the real product instead.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready to toss</li>
            <li>the threading tool used to get your hair into the curler does as much damage as you are trying to avoid.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product works very well on my 3b hair.</li>
            <li>had these for year now they have held up very well.</li>
            <li>but I really thought that this product would have worked.</li>
            <li>I really thought it would be a waist of money</li>
            <li>These you can sleep in without waking up with a headache and it is fast.</li>
            <li>its a real at home item.</li>
            <li>This product wont be one I use very often</li>
            <li>she wants it done all the time.</li>
            <li>Trick is not to section too much hair to pull through the roller.  </li>
            <li>You will know if you have too much hair if the hair does not slide through the curler.</li>
            <li>Packaged as described and priced reasonably.  </li>
            <li>They are knock off of the real curl formers and they do not work at all.  </li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>These are not the real curl formers they are a knock off version of the real product.</li>
            <li>I have really coily hair and didnt think they would work</li>
            <li>Very disapinted.</li>
            <li>Such is the case with these cheaply manufactured curlformers.</li>
            <li>Item Arrived fast, as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My product came really fast.</li>
            <li>You still get a really straight root when using these rollers.</li>
            <li>I was really dissapointed.</li>
            <li>Very.</li>
            <li>it works very well</li>
            <li>I was so ready to use them.  </li>
            <li>With one pack I was using way too much hair</li>
            <li>My hair looks straight and permed when using these with no heat damage.</li>
            <li>Works great for short or extra short hair.</li>
            <li>Go with the  real deal brand</li>
            <li>i really wont buy these again</li>
            <li>Then you wrap the hair , but not to much hair, around the loop at the end of the stick.</li>
            <li>This process hurts sometimes if you grab to much hair, if you twirl hair around loop or if not all the hair is in the loop.</li>
            <li>The concept is great, but the product is poor.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really really really</li>
            <li>I really like these curlers.</li>
            <li>Go for the real thing.</li>
            <li>I will probably be purchasing another box (because the cost :)) or find the specific size for my 5 year old daughter and go from there.  </li>
            <li>it clean and moisterized, moisterized- moisterized (ESPECIALLY YOUR ENDS).</li>
            <li>And it looks much nicer when you use less hair and more curlers anyway.</li>
            <li>just realize, these rollers will definitely hold your hair at its full length.</li>
            <li>but if you want a full head of curls you need to get a bigger quantity .</li>
            <li>This time I pulled the &amp;#34;roller&amp;#34; down from the root to make the top of her head not curley.  </li>
            <li>Since the back of my hair always gets frizziest first, I love that the short curlformers are able to tame those pesky frizzies and make my hair silky &amp; curly.</li>
            <li>You will have great Shirley Temple like curls - a little tight on the first day.</li>
            <li>They also give off a smell (like burned tyres) which could indicate the use of cheap and toxic (and probably illegal) plastics (that is also probably why they are so cheap in comparison with the original Curlformers).</li>
            <li>These leave my daughter&#x27;s hair in bouncy spiral curls for most of the day as long as we set them right after her bath and leave them in until her hair is completely dry (morning).</li>
            <li>Better safe then sorry.</li>
            <li>But the company is decent.</li>
            <li>Next time i will go for a different brand even if i have to pay more money....</li>
            <li>My hair is actually too long for them, it was a misjudgment on my part, but I&#x27;m sure they would work very well on shorter hair...</li>
            <li>I was excited that I did not have to wait long to try them.</li>
            <li>First the rollers were not spirals they were only rolled up second the hair wand that was in the box was cheaply made and continued to come apart when using it</li>
            <li>They fit too loose to do what they are designed to do.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They should be fine if you wear them while you&#x27;re not sleeping and your hair is wet.&lt;br /&gt;In order to curl your hair, your hair has to be wet</li>
            <li>I would recommend paying a little more and getting something made in the US.</li>
            <li>My daugher has shoulder length hair and these were very easy to make her straight, thick hair CURLEY.  </li>
            <li>That makes these curlers an absolutely genius design as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li>The price was really low, so I found that it was worth the risk.  </li>
            <li>gonna order a few more.</li>
            <li>They measure, stretched, 6 inches (longer ones are 9&amp;#34;) and have exactly 2 turns, whereas those in the photo have 2 1/2 turns.</li>
            <li>That makes a big difference in terms of whether they would be useful.</li>
            <li>I would recommend a different set with more long rollers for someone with hair any longer than mine.</li>
            <li>Make sure when you ordered that they will be long enough according with your hair</li>
            <li>Then I tried to insert it into one of the rollers and it ripped right through the plastic mesh to the point where I can&#x27;t even get the wand back out.  </li>
            <li>I went to a known beauty supply store this weekend to see if they had extra large and the price difference is enough to make me to come back to the site to buy more.</li>
            <li>In conjunction with the right styling products, these curlformers work wonders on my hair &amp; produce curls that last me 4-5 days.</li>
            <li>All the sizes are super different and weren&#x27;t right for people with long hair.</li>
            <li>in other words CHEAP.</li>
            <li>I wish the seller had created a separate profile for the new rollers, because they are no longer the ones in the picture.</li>
            <li>My items was not brand new.</li>
            <li>NOTHING seems to make my hair curl, but with wet hair, these not only managed to create a lasting curl, but even did it quickly (only a few hours - since the hair doesn&#x27;t roll on top of itself, it dries so much more quickly).</li>
            <li>After receiving a new order, it was pretty obvious that the quality had changed dramatically!!!</li>
            <li>Also the rollers have a funny plastic smell (it is starting to go away</li>
            <li>Ultimately I had pretty curls</li>
            <li>After seeing results of curlformers on some CGs on YouTube, I decided to try these out, only I was NOT about to pay so much money for the kit at Sally&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>1 pack was just not enough for me the first time.</li>
            <li>It actually holds all day long in her fine hair</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for curlers that allow you to avoid heating tools and work in all kinds of hair, and you&#x27;re willing to put in a little time to learn how these work, these are quite worth it.</li>
            <li>The old one measures 11 1/2\\&quot; inch, the new one 10\\&quot; inch.</li>
            <li>I am new to managing my natural and transitioning hair.</li>
            <li>Once you get the hang of it, these rollers are much easier to put in than regular hair rollers and help ones hair dry quickly.</li>
            <li>Easy to use but not really comfortable to sleep in....</li>
            <li>I got down to the last one and was praying that it wouldn&#x27;t break or I wouldn&#x27;t be able to finish my hair.</li>
            <li>Since my hair is long the curlers clamp on to my hair far enough from my head that I can sleep comfortably.</li>
            <li>i mostly use them to air dry my wet hair overnight.</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s not a variety of curlers; my hair is shoulder lenght and maybe only half of the curlers I would be able to use bc</li>
            <li>If you leave them in over night they are relatively comfortable and make tight curls</li>
            <li>Next time, I won&#x27;t be duped by the positive reviews, I&#x27;ll buy the real thing and tell everyone else to do the same.</li>
            <li>These came in clear plastic wrapping and 2 of them were frayed.</li>
            <li>They were just in a clear bag.</li>
            <li>but it did come clear from CHina.</li>
            <li>As far as results, it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>They came early</li>
            <li>My young daughter (who is not as picky as I am) loves them.  </li>
            <li>my rating for the old set months ago was five, now that I have gotten this</li>
            <li>I transitioned from Perms to natural hair 6 years ago.</li>
            <li>It took about three weeks for them to arrive but they are coming directly from China so plan accordingly.  </li>
            <li>The hook is different from the real hook.</li>
            <li>pieces wasn&#x27;t enough for me to cover my whole head.&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I will probably just go to my local Sally beauty Supply and buy real curlformers.</li>
            <li>The hook is cheap and their are a few tears in the curlers themselves</li>
            <li>It was very flimsy and broke almost instantly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m natural so</li>
            <li>Do NOT waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li>You will need at last a 30 pack of either size to finish a whole head of hair though.</li>
            <li>I use them one and the style last a whole week.</li>
            <li>The set is nice and just as described, but the plastic tool provided in the set was broken when I recieved it.</li>
            <li>They are just as good as those expensive ones..</li>
            <li>They work just as good as the expensive, name brand rollers.</li>
            <li>My hair is around 7 inches long, and only half of what came in the bag was suitable for my hair, meaning if you have longer hair</li>
            <li>This is a mix of snail rolls, so be aware that if you have longer hair, with several smaller rolls.  </li>
            <li>The smaller rolls in the old set measures 7 1/2\\&quot; inch and the new sets</li>
            <li>It did not take long for them to arrive and shipping was reasonable.</li>
            <li>I was still surprised at how long my hair actually was, though, so had to pull these away from my scalp a little to make sure the ends curled, too, so</li>
            <li>Based on the previous reviews, I purchased 2 sets to make sure I have enough long rollers and 2 sets give me a plenty of options in length.  </li>
            <li>My hair has gotten longer so I will be buying a new and bigger set sometime soon.</li>
            <li>There is not enough curlers to cover your whole head in addition to that they are all different sizes.</li>
            <li>The longer roles in this set are equivalent to the shorter once in the old set I got way back.</li>
            <li>definitely recommend this product for Natural hair styles.</li>
            <li>barely made it a day.</li>
            <li>having a hard with it.hair not sliding out easily as stated,will try again later or ask somebody to help me..</li>
            <li>Hard to sleep in, but definitely work and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is too much effort to put these in only to have them fall out before her hair is dry.  </li>
            <li>it mean the edges needed to be smooth.</li>
            <li>Because I use my hair dryer to set after curlers are in, my hair is less damaged compared to using a hot curling iron.  </li>
            <li>She did part of her head with these and other with sponge and these dryed soo fast.</li>
            <li>I have natural African American hair</li>
            <li>Lastly it&#x27;s no where near enough curlers.</li>
            <li>These rollers rip your hair out and while they may curl your hair if left in long enough they really aren&#x27;t made for use with African American hair.</li>
            <li>Since the curlformers in this pack are so short, I only use them in the very back of my hair near the nape of my neck &amp; on the sides of my head (since hair in those areas tends to be shorter).</li>
            <li>That being said, I have used these before an event with barely dampened hair and left in for about 3 hours.</li>
            <li>This may be usefull for people with fine, shoulder length hair, but not at all for long, thick hair like mine.</li>
            <li>I got these because I wanted something I could let my hair dry naturally in and avoid using heating tools all the time.</li>
            <li>I frequently blow dry, straighten, and curl my hair.</li>
            <li>First, I only got the upper half of the hook, which is too short to be of any use.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t last long with natural hair but that is not the products fault.</li>
            <li>my freaken hair only comes down to my shoulders, i even had to use two of them for one strand of hair because they didn&#x27;t take in the whole piece</li>
            <li>First off, for us thick haired natural girls, I suggest purchasing TWO of these so that you can insert LESS hair through each curlformer and still have enough for your whole head.</li>
            <li>My hair is shoulder length and the rollers were not long enough for my hair.</li>
            <li>More positive than bad.</li>
            <li>The only  issue I had was, they were not long enough from my hair and that was my fault.  </li>

            <li> These are so good.</li>
            <li> makes really good curls.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;d almost have to have a twa for them to be any good.</li>
            <li> but honestly they work great</li>
            <li> Good quality and good price.  </li>
            <li> the ones I bought from Sally&#x27;s people loved it and asked where to get them too...</li>
            <li> I will say the communication was good...</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li> When i bought these i loved the concept...</li>
            <li> are good.  </li>
            <li> They do a good job.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> This set is good if you want to TRY curlformers, to see if it works for you or not.</li>
            <li> I will rerate if I have a good experience.</li>
            <li> Good set.</li>
            <li> This package is a good starter</li>
            <li> It is real easy to use with no heat.</li>
            <li> Materials used are very cheap and flimsy!</li>
            <li> I knocked a star because the wand is not the best; it&#x27;s pretty flimsy.</li>
            <li> Flexirods are a much better product than these!</li>
            <li> I have had so many people ask me how I did it!</li>
            <li> Make sure you convert their metrics into inches if you are unsure!</li>
            <li> Scrooge and just pay the money for the better product sold stateside!</li>
            <li> Curlers like this are great and easy to use.</li>
            <li> They are easy to use and work great.  </li>
            <li> They are easy to use and a great deal for the buck.</li>
            <li> I recommended to my friends because it&#x27;s so amazing.</li>
            <li> Be sure to find a good product to go with the rollers, or they won&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> I honestly think almost lost this trip, not counting the time to request a refund.</li>
            <li> Full, bouncy, beautiful spiral curls.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, got nice bouncy curls and didn&#x27;t have to use any heat.</li>
            <li> I used these to curl the ends of my hair and liked the look.</li>
            <li> The price is also nice.</li>
            <li> She looked really cute and she loved her hair.</li>
            <li> but I love the product easy to use and my hair looks great every time</li>
            <li> Price was great and came in quickly.</li>
            <li> They make good curls but they are not that easy to handle.</li>
            <li> This product is very easy to use</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> it, love it love it!</li>
            <li> She says there better than spongrollers and nice to sleep in.</li>
            <li> but The are a great fun to use.</li>
            <li> the hook in this box does kind of suck and yes the directions on the box are comical and make no sense, but watch a youtube video and give it a try.</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say they are much better sleeping in than the flexi rods.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I can get nice, bouncey, and shiny curls without sitting under a dryer.  </li>
            <li> I remain excited and hopeul that I&#x27;ll get good results also&lt;</li>
            <li> Very cheap made.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, and nice colors.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, nice .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started transitioning from relaxed to natural hair and since twists don&#x27;t work as nicely with my hair being still mostly relaxed, I wanted to try these curlers to see if I could get some spiral curls and after using this product, it worked beautifully.  </li>
            <li> They are super easy to put in and look AMAZING after!</li>
            <li> These are just okay.</li>
            <li> The rubber or plastic at the top and bottom of the curlers are not well made, and deformed.&lt;br /&gt;Made</li>
            <li> I then realized that I needed one more set.</li>
            <li> I got my rollers and I love them.</li>
            <li> I love these rollers.</li>
            <li> Since my hair has a tighter curl than the rollers, I enjoyed seeing my spiral curls elongated.</li>
            <li> They were just perfect for my short hair</li>
            <li> So i gave them to my sister who has short hair and they work perfect for her.</li>
            <li> Wish there were more to use as we ran out before all of her hair was wrapped and curled</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s why I love this item.im</li>
            <li> i thought these would be the perfect size for my hair since they were short ..</li>
            <li> I would return them, but it would cost more than I paid for them.</li>
            <li> Curls were cute.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I&#x27;d get better results with a thinner roller.  </li>
            <li> Months later, &amp; I still haven&#x27;t used them in my own hair!!!  </li>
            <li> Great price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I love the product.</li>
            <li> I need more.</li>
            <li> Better than all the rollers i had before.</li>
            <li> i love these things..</li>
            <li> i wasnt sure if they were gonna work</li>
            <li> If I was more organized around the time of purchase, I would have returned them.</li>
            <li> The ones I got from NAVA were much better than these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I got these.</li>
            <li> I love the curls that these make.  </li>
            <li> We needed 2 or more to cover her head.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE my curlformers.</li>
            <li> Glad they were cheap!</li>
            <li> I look like Medusa but the ringlets are cute.</li>
            <li> and you should - do yourself a favor and, for more money, get better-quality curlformers and hook.</li>
            <li> I did not want to pay over 60 bucks for curlformers if I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like them.  </li>
            <li> and I just love the price.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t totally satisfied with the QUALITY, but I guess I got what I paid for.  </li>
            <li> May be better for longer hair, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> I bought more on AMAZON</li>
            <li> I tried it so many times in so many ways and nothing worked......</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t mind having 4-5 more curlers and may end up ordering another</li>
            <li> I Love the snail rolls styling curler tools, would recommend to anyone, received ahead of schedule.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to find just the hook to purchase.</li>
            <li> does not curl hair have tried many times.</li>
            <li> and I love &#x27;em.</li>
            <li> I love the curls.</li>
            <li> I was able to sleep without a problem .</li>
            <li> I wish I had more long pieces, but the product was excellent.</li>
            <li> lol I found it easy to use, no broken ones.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m ordering another so they can be nice and full.</li>
            <li> My curls came out beautiful and I have natural hair (no perm).</li>
            <li> I love them very easy and quick once you get the hang of them..</li>
            <li> This is the best and more practical way I found so far to curl my hair without a hot curler.</li>
            <li> I bought similar ones from sally beauty supply for way more ( better quality) worked great but needed more for my daughters hair..</li>
            <li> they work best on soaking wet hair</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product for inexperienced DIY hair stylers.</li>
            <li> Time took shorter than expected which was wonderful.</li>
            <li> I found a great startup kit with everything you need to go Natural.</li>
            <li> It does good work with a straight hair like mine, who doesn&#x27;t want it with permanent.  </li>
            <li> I originally ordered 2 to be on the safe side..</li>
            <li> Really easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Slides on and off easily.</li>
            <li> &gt; so easy to used and leaves my hair as curly as iI want them to be-</li>
            <li> And easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to put these in</li>
            <li> makes it easy to store away.  </li>
            <li> They are really easy to use, and coming from me</li>
            <li> 18pcs Hair Rollers Snail Rolls Styling Curler Tools, Easy</li>
            <li> Loved the results on my natural hair, wished more came in a pack.</li>
            <li> Great for natural hair especially when trying to avoid heat but still get great curls.</li>
            <li> Beautiful curls with no heat was my objective.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re super easy to install, come in cute colors, &amp; spare my hair heat damage (since you don&#x27;t have to use heat with these if you don&#x27;t want to).</li>
            <li> The stick was fine.</li>
            <li> Luckily I ordered another pack from another seller and got a better one.</li>
            <li> The delivery was sooner than expected and very good</li>
            <li> huge dissapointment</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think all that work and not being able to sleep was worth one day of beauty.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is cheap pieces of junk from china.</li>
            <li> Overall really great product for the price.</li>
            <li> so I had to buy two of them just to try to fit all of my hair.</li>
            <li> Great if you have really short hair.  </li>
            <li> The hook is cheap and has a seam on the inside where your hair slides.</li>
            <li> Also, the hook broke in my luggage on a trip because its cheap.</li>
            <li> The curlers themselves are fantastic.</li>
            <li> Also smooth out the eye of the hook, since the plastic at the seam can damage your hair, and 4) PREPARE TO WAIT 2-3 WEEKS</li>
            <li> They are comfortable to sleep in when I use a satin bonnet.</li>
            <li> This is SUPER easy and quick!  </li>
            <li> Very flimsy!!!  </li>
            <li> But other than that I love them and will be ordering more soon!!</li>
            <li> super easy to use.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use and isn&#x27;t too time consuming.</li>
            <li> The delivery was also quick and easy.</li>
            <li> but it was more noticible when I first go them).</li>
            <li> i bought them and was excited to get them.</li>
            <li> SO worth ordering!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still willing to try the authentic original product, but this was a lesson learnt in &amp;</li>
            <li> love these so much, work like a charm!</li>
            <li> they make pretty curls but it works better on shorter hair that is shoulder length or shorter.</li>
            <li> I was excited when my first set arrived before I went out of town, so I was sure they would all be there when I got home.</li>
            <li> They are cheaper than the original.</li>
            <li> Because so many women stated the product was not properly advertised since their hair is long, I knew it would be a perfect fit for me.</li>
            <li> They are easy to install and fun to put in (why, I dont know they just are lol)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using it for while my hair grew longer so I placed an order from the same seller, thinking it would be good to have another set and use the longer once since my hair had grown longer.</li>
            <li> Overall, a good bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> They were easy for her to use on her own as she is only 11.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Actually it was pretty easy to figure out.</li>
            <li> so I had to use super glue to keep it from coming apart when I used it.  </li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of it, this is a quick process.</li>
            <li> I had seen these 2 years ago and am so excited to finally have a set of my own.  </li>
            <li> the material seems pretty cheap and sometimes gets tangled with my hair.</li>
            <li> I was able to realize that the new set is actuality shorter.</li>
            <li> It arrived fast and they are easy to use.</li>
            <li> They are very comfy to sleep in and easy to put in, directions would have helped, but I just watched some youtube videos to guide me.</li>
            <li> First off, AMERICANS OF THE UNITED STATES PLEASE BE MINDFUL THAT THE REST OF THE WORLD OPERATES SOLELY ON THE METRIC SYSTEM!</li>
            <li> fit much hair into each roller.&lt;br /&gt;Felt</li>
            <li> My hair is natural though, so these as not the easiest to install and since my length is shorter I did not get as much curl as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> I saw so many women of my ethnicity rave about using curlformers on their natural hair.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> They are definetly worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for a no heat alternative for curling my hair, but these are not even useful.</li>
            <li> but it was really worth the wait.</li>
            <li> and I thought this would be fun to try as an alternative to heat curling.</li>
            <li> Second Great for Natural Hair Folks and all hair types.</li>
            <li> I think I will have fun with these.</li>
            <li> I managed to complete were nice, but couldn&#x27;t get the whole head done.</li>
            <li> Once you master these are fun to use and results</li>
            <li> Fun using them.</li>
            <li> Definetly worth it.</li>
            <li> Super easy for a 3 year old who won&#x27;t hold still.  </li>
            <li> I loved these roller, they were extremely well priced,&lt;br /</li>
            <li> no instructions looked up on line and hair just goes right through the hole and wont curl hanging thru there</li>
            <li> So I am still trying to find the right product to use a setting lotion.</li>
            <li> They suck to sleep in if you have them right on your roots.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve been doing my own as well as friends&#x27; hair for a long time and caught on pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Works super well, but you will need more than just one pack for your entire hair.</li>
            <li> so I really couldn&#x27;t rate it in a positive light.</li>
            <li> the other brand is better Vakind Hair Curler Magic Spiral Ringlets, I guess there ok for short hair</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 sets of this product previously and loved it.</li>
            <li> There is definitely a learning curve, but there are several great YouTube videos to explain how to use them.  </li>
            <li> they are easy to sleep in and in the morning it looks like it is natural</li>
            <li> This is a great way to get the same look achieved using the traditional rods.  </li>
            <li> I like the curlers only problem is they are alot smaller then pictured , would be great for some one with shorter hair</li>
            <li> BTW, this does not come with instructions so you may want to watch a tutorial first.</li>
            <li> : These rollers are better for short to medium length.</li>
            <li> I love these and cannot compliment them enough.</li>
            <li> The style only lasted a day but it was cute.</li>
            <li> I could&#x27;ve used a hot curler or flexi-rods.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m adding to this post, because sure enough, the day I rated it one star, the item arrived, but it still took a month to get here.  </li>
            <li> First thing I noticed was the lack of instructions.  </li>
            <li> buy the longer ones,you could still use them when hair grows these ones broke the first time i used them</li>
            <li> I will be making more purches in the future.</li>
            <li> the tool used to pull the hair through broke on me during the first use.  </li>
            <li> Next time, I will look for a better product.</li>
            <li> There came exactly as stated on line.</li>
            <li> This pack would be better suited to short or children&#x27;s hair that is not longer than shoulder length.</li>
            <li> The plastic tool broke during my first use.</li>
            <li> First DO your reasearch, its a knock off of Sally&#x27;s Curlformers so just google and youtube curlformers and they are a ton of video tutorial.</li>
            <li> My daughter ( Age 9.5) actually likes these more cause</li>
            <li> so I had to order more and from a different company.</li>
            <li> Is great for short and long hair.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> The first time I used them the plastic hook broke, so literally took the product out of the box and it broke.</li>
            <li> so you can see the pretty curls</li>
            <li> Pretty curls.</li>
            <li> Keep my hair looking good and growing since I don&#x27;t have to me with it everyday.</li>
            <li> I took them out after a few hours and my hair was curly, but not in a good way.</li>
            <li> just letting it hangs as you seen at the ad, is not for me, since it made it look flat at the top.</li>
            <li> The product overall is fairly good, my only problem is that the 2piece wand always comes out when I pull my hair through the curlformers and that gets aggravating.</li>
            <li> Tried on my wet, naturally curly hair and LOVED it.</li>
            <li> Got this smaller, shorter set for the shorter sections of my hair, which was good, then got a bigger group of longer ones.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something I can wear over night and the next day just be able to take them off and be ready (since I don&#x27;t have time at all to do my hair).</li>
            <li> I wish they could be a little longer, but other than that, they are great!</li>
            <li> They kind of train you to use small enough sections because only so much fits in the hook, which is a good thing for even-ness and for drying quickly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m OK with the  18pcs rollers, just it take to long to curl</li>
            <li> After you get the hand of how to get them on you can pretty much breeze through the process</li>
            <li> My hair is about 5 inches long so the length is better for those with shorter hair.</li>
            <li> Just make sure your hair is completely dry before taking the curlers out and use a sculpting or setting lotion or gel.  </li>
            <li> what no one told me was that ur hair had to be a certain length to use the curl formers...</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t consider yourself a wiz with your own hair (or others), or haven&#x27;t used curlers before, this might be a little tricky to catch onto.</li>
            <li> When I emailed my concerns to the seller, they said thanks for contacting them, and &amp;#34;Have a nice life&amp;#34;, but they offered no solutions, not even a  replacement roller for the missing roller.</li>
            <li> So like I expected, Amazon has everything and more reasonable than the Beauty Supply store.</li>
            <li> I really like them.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend if for anyone with roots that aren&#x27;t naturally straight and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> Thanks for making them affordable to buy.</li>
            <li> I will just buy the real product instead.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ready to toss</li>
            <li> the threading tool used to get your hair into the curler does as much damage as you are trying to avoid.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product works very well on my 3b hair.</li>
            <li> had these for year now they have held up very well.</li>
            <li> but I really thought that this product would have worked.</li>
            <li> I really thought it would be a waist of money</li>
            <li> These you can sleep in without waking up with a headache and it is fast.</li>
            <li> its a real at home item.</li>
            <li> This product wont be one I use very often</li>
            <li> she wants it done all the time.</li>
            <li> Trick is not to section too much hair to pull through the roller.  </li>
            <li> You will know if you have too much hair if the hair does not slide through the curler.</li>
            <li> Packaged as described and priced reasonably.  </li>
            <li> They are knock off of the real curl formers and they do not work at all.  </li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> These are not the real curl formers they are a knock off version of the real product.</li>
            <li> I have really coily hair and didnt think they would work</li>
            <li> Very disapinted.</li>
            <li> Such is the case with these cheaply manufactured curlformers.</li>
            <li> Item Arrived fast, as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My product came really fast.</li>
            <li> You still get a really straight root when using these rollers.</li>
            <li> I was really dissapointed.</li>
            <li> Very.</li>
            <li> it works very well</li>
            <li> I was so ready to use them.  </li>
            <li> With one pack I was using way too much hair</li>
            <li> My hair looks straight and permed when using these with no heat damage.</li>
            <li> Works great for short or extra short hair.</li>
            <li> Go with the  real deal brand</li>
            <li> i really wont buy these again</li>
            <li> Then you wrap the hair , but not to much hair, around the loop at the end of the stick.</li>
            <li> This process hurts sometimes if you grab to much hair, if you twirl hair around loop or if not all the hair is in the loop.</li>
            <li> The concept is great, but the product is poor.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really really really</li>
            <li> I really like these curlers.</li>
            <li> Go for the real thing.</li>
            <li> I will probably be purchasing another box (because the cost :)) or find the specific size for my 5 year old daughter and go from there.  </li>
            <li> it clean and moisterized, moisterized- moisterized (ESPECIALLY YOUR ENDS).</li>
            <li> And it looks much nicer when you use less hair and more curlers anyway.</li>
            <li> just realize, these rollers will definitely hold your hair at its full length.</li>
            <li> but if you want a full head of curls you need to get a bigger quantity .</li>
            <li> This time I pulled the &amp;#34;roller&amp;#34; down from the root to make the top of her head not curley.  </li>
            <li> Since the back of my hair always gets frizziest first, I love that the short curlformers are able to tame those pesky frizzies and make my hair silky &amp; curly.</li>
            <li> You will have great Shirley Temple like curls - a little tight on the first day.</li>
            <li> They also give off a smell (like burned tyres) which could indicate the use of cheap and toxic (and probably illegal) plastics (that is also probably why they are so cheap in comparison with the original Curlformers).</li>
            <li> These leave my daughter&#x27;s hair in bouncy spiral curls for most of the day as long as we set them right after her bath and leave them in until her hair is completely dry (morning).</li>
            <li> Better safe then sorry.</li>
            <li> But the company is decent.</li>
            <li> Next time i will go for a different brand even if i have to pay more money....</li>
            <li> My hair is actually too long for them, it was a misjudgment on my part, but I&#x27;m sure they would work very well on shorter hair...</li>
            <li> I was excited that I did not have to wait long to try them.</li>
            <li> First the rollers were not spirals they were only rolled up second the hair wand that was in the box was cheaply made and continued to come apart when using it</li>
            <li> They fit too loose to do what they are designed to do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They should be fine if you wear them while you&#x27;re not sleeping and your hair is wet.&lt;br /&gt;In order to curl your hair, your hair has to be wet</li>
            <li> I would recommend paying a little more and getting something made in the US.</li>
            <li> My daugher has shoulder length hair and these were very easy to make her straight, thick hair CURLEY.  </li>
            <li> That makes these curlers an absolutely genius design as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> The price was really low, so I found that it was worth the risk.  </li>
            <li> gonna order a few more.</li>
            <li> They measure, stretched, 6 inches (longer ones are 9&amp;#34;) and have exactly 2 turns, whereas those in the photo have 2 1/2 turns.</li>
            <li> That makes a big difference in terms of whether they would be useful.</li>
            <li> I would recommend a different set with more long rollers for someone with hair any longer than mine.</li>
            <li> Make sure when you ordered that they will be long enough according with your hair</li>
            <li> Then I tried to insert it into one of the rollers and it ripped right through the plastic mesh to the point where I can&#x27;t even get the wand back out.  </li>
            <li> I went to a known beauty supply store this weekend to see if they had extra large and the price difference is enough to make me to come back to the site to buy more.</li>
            <li> In conjunction with the right styling products, these curlformers work wonders on my hair &amp; produce curls that last me 4-5 days.</li>
            <li> All the sizes are super different and weren&#x27;t right for people with long hair.</li>
            <li> in other words CHEAP.</li>
            <li> I wish the seller had created a separate profile for the new rollers, because they are no longer the ones in the picture.</li>
            <li> My items was not brand new.</li>
            <li> NOTHING seems to make my hair curl, but with wet hair, these not only managed to create a lasting curl, but even did it quickly (only a few hours - since the hair doesn&#x27;t roll on top of itself, it dries so much more quickly).</li>
            <li> After receiving a new order, it was pretty obvious that the quality had changed dramatically!!!</li>
            <li> Also the rollers have a funny plastic smell (it is starting to go away</li>
            <li> Ultimately I had pretty curls</li>
            <li> After seeing results of curlformers on some CGs on YouTube, I decided to try these out, only I was NOT about to pay so much money for the kit at Sally&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> 1 pack was just not enough for me the first time.</li>
            <li> It actually holds all day long in her fine hair</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for curlers that allow you to avoid heating tools and work in all kinds of hair, and you&#x27;re willing to put in a little time to learn how these work, these are quite worth it.</li>
            <li> The old one measures 11 1/2\\&quot; inch, the new one 10\\&quot; inch.</li>
            <li> I am new to managing my natural and transitioning hair.</li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of it, these rollers are much easier to put in than regular hair rollers and help ones hair dry quickly.</li>
            <li> Easy to use but not really comfortable to sleep in....</li>
            <li> I got down to the last one and was praying that it wouldn&#x27;t break or I wouldn&#x27;t be able to finish my hair.</li>
            <li> Since my hair is long the curlers clamp on to my hair far enough from my head that I can sleep comfortably.</li>
            <li> i mostly use them to air dry my wet hair overnight.</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s not a variety of curlers; my hair is shoulder lenght and maybe only half of the curlers I would be able to use bc</li>
            <li> If you leave them in over night they are relatively comfortable and make tight curls</li>
            <li> Next time, I won&#x27;t be duped by the positive reviews, I&#x27;ll buy the real thing and tell everyone else to do the same.</li>
            <li> These came in clear plastic wrapping and 2 of them were frayed.</li>
            <li> They were just in a clear bag.</li>
            <li> but it did come clear from CHina.</li>
            <li> As far as results, it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> They came early</li>
            <li> My young daughter (who is not as picky as I am) loves them.  </li>
            <li> my rating for the old set months ago was five, now that I have gotten this</li>
            <li> I transitioned from Perms to natural hair 6 years ago.</li>
            <li> It took about three weeks for them to arrive but they are coming directly from China so plan accordingly.  </li>
            <li> The hook is different from the real hook.</li>
            <li> pieces wasn&#x27;t enough for me to cover my whole head.&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I will probably just go to my local Sally beauty Supply and buy real curlformers.</li>
            <li> The hook is cheap and their are a few tears in the curlers themselves</li>
            <li> It was very flimsy and broke almost instantly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m natural so</li>
            <li> Do NOT waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> You will need at last a 30 pack of either size to finish a whole head of hair though.</li>
            <li> I use them one and the style last a whole week.</li>
            <li> The set is nice and just as described, but the plastic tool provided in the set was broken when I recieved it.</li>
            <li> They are just as good as those expensive ones..</li>
            <li> They work just as good as the expensive, name brand rollers.</li>
            <li> My hair is around 7 inches long, and only half of what came in the bag was suitable for my hair, meaning if you have longer hair</li>
            <li> This is a mix of snail rolls, so be aware that if you have longer hair, with several smaller rolls.  </li>
            <li> The smaller rolls in the old set measures 7 1/2\\&quot; inch and the new sets</li>
            <li> It did not take long for them to arrive and shipping was reasonable.</li>
            <li> I was still surprised at how long my hair actually was, though, so had to pull these away from my scalp a little to make sure the ends curled, too, so</li>
            <li> Based on the previous reviews, I purchased 2 sets to make sure I have enough long rollers and 2 sets give me a plenty of options in length.  </li>
            <li> My hair has gotten longer so I will be buying a new and bigger set sometime soon.</li>
            <li> There is not enough curlers to cover your whole head in addition to that they are all different sizes.</li>
            <li> The longer roles in this set are equivalent to the shorter once in the old set I got way back.</li>
            <li> definitely recommend this product for Natural hair styles.</li>
            <li> barely made it a day.</li>
            <li> having a hard with it.hair not sliding out easily as stated,will try again later or ask somebody to help me..</li>
            <li> Hard to sleep in, but definitely work and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is too much effort to put these in only to have them fall out before her hair is dry.  </li>
            <li> it mean the edges needed to be smooth.</li>
            <li> Because I use my hair dryer to set after curlers are in, my hair is less damaged compared to using a hot curling iron.  </li>
            <li> She did part of her head with these and other with sponge and these dryed soo fast.</li>
            <li> I have natural African American hair</li>
            <li> Lastly it&#x27;s no where near enough curlers.</li>
            <li> These rollers rip your hair out and while they may curl your hair if left in long enough they really aren&#x27;t made for use with African American hair.</li>
            <li> Since the curlformers in this pack are so short, I only use them in the very back of my hair near the nape of my neck &amp; on the sides of my head (since hair in those areas tends to be shorter).</li>
            <li> That being said, I have used these before an event with barely dampened hair and left in for about 3 hours.</li>
            <li> This may be usefull for people with fine, shoulder length hair, but not at all for long, thick hair like mine.</li>
            <li> I got these because I wanted something I could let my hair dry naturally in and avoid using heating tools all the time.</li>
            <li> I frequently blow dry, straighten, and curl my hair.</li>
            <li> First, I only got the upper half of the hook, which is too short to be of any use.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t last long with natural hair but that is not the products fault.</li>
            <li> my freaken hair only comes down to my shoulders, i even had to use two of them for one strand of hair because they didn&#x27;t take in the whole piece</li>
            <li> First off, for us thick haired natural girls, I suggest purchasing TWO of these so that you can insert LESS hair through each curlformer and still have enough for your whole head.</li>
            <li> My hair is shoulder length and the rollers were not long enough for my hair.</li>
            <li> More positive than bad.</li>
            <li> The only  issue I had was, they were not long enough from my hair and that was my fault.  </li>
            <li> I hate rolling my hair, but this is easy and quick.</li>
            <li> They curled so good, she was afraid to keep it down because she is not used to seeing her hair curley.  </li>
            <li> I thought the old once might of been stretched from use for months, but after lining the rolls next to each other</li>
            <li> It was hard trying to get the hang of the curlformers at first, but I have them now.</li>
            <li> I would have gotten the extra long.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say it took sooo long for these to finally come in the mail.</li>
            <li> my hair is mid bacl lenght and they wont work the long ones work for my side bangs.</li>
            <li> But long haired girls stay away buy a different set.</li>
            <li> These are long curlers but you can use on short hair just leave the rest of the curl dangling.</li>
            <li> If you have long hair you might want longer ones only though.</li>
            <li> not only it takes so long to come because it comes from China</li>
            <li> The rollers are tiny, not workable for long hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of kinds of curlers, but my thick hair never seems to dry right when I sleep in curlers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As well as this, the hook provided is very weak and breaks easily.</li>
            <li> She did walk around looking like Nelly Olsen from Little House on the Prairie for a few hours but the curls were worth it.  </li>
            <li> The curls do not last very long.</li>
            <li> 36 curlformers were not enough for my hair, so if you have thick hair, buy at least 3 packs to have a full head of popping curls!</li>
            <li> They are to complicated and with fine hair</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t take long to use them</li>
            <li> My hair was too long from this length of rollers</li>
            <li> i dont think anyone with long hair should get these ones because you will need the ones that are way longer</li>
            <li> Took a long time to get them</li>
            <li> and I got it was because I spent almost the entire trip trying to track my orders, and going to the FedEx office to pick my products.</li>
            <li> but i dont like them because my hair is to long.</li>
            <li> use the maybe 10 times.not for long hair</li>
            <li> but, if you have long hair you will need longer ones.</li>
            <li> For as long as it took</li>
            <li> so I guess I can forgive to long delivery time.  </li>
            <li> Giving the impression that they can be used with long hair.  </li>
            <li> this also a disappointment,,looks as if made for kid doll and the box on came in says it is for a doll baby not adult</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy it if your hair is long.</li>
            <li> my hair is too long for the rest.</li>
            <li> I thought they would be as long as the picture.</li>
            <li> have relatively long hair and while this won&#x27;t curl from root to tip, it curls from about</li>
            <li> It took too long to deliver and tracking info was not provided.</li>
            <li> I wish I had returned them, but may have waited too long.</li>
            <li> I would look into the longer ones for medium or long lenght hair.</li>
            <li> Not for people with long hair.</li>
            <li> Some of the curlers did not work and would only hang limply on the head and the curlers are too short - unless you have very, very short hair.  </li>
            <li> The instructions were not clear and it did not curl my hair the way it should have.</li>
            <li> I filed the seam down because it definitely can damage your hair if its left as is.</li>
            <li> It shouldn&#x27;t be hard to figure out, but when I tried to assemble the wand that is used to pull hair through, the fit was so tight it cracked in half.  </li>
            <li> have use both products several times and find them extremely comparable.</li>
            <li> Even if you don&#x27;t buy another pack they are only like $4 at Sally&#x27;s and some other beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li> just start with the extra long ones and dont waste time or money dealing with tiny curlers</li>
            <li> If you look at the picture of product you see a girl with very long hair.  </li>
            <li> are for the hair to dry.</li>
            <li> WHen the hair is dry and it must be completely dry, just pull them out.</li>
            <li> If you hair dry them</li>
            <li> the air doesn&#x27;t get through to the hair and if you let it air dry</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have the patience to blow dry them either.</li>
            <li> I tried but I didn&#x27;t have the time to put them all in then take time to dry them.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t feel like doing that because hair takes FORVER to dry when you&#x27;re wearing those.</li>
            <li> However my daughter who does not live at home also bought it and said she got wondeful results.</li>
            <li> A complete mess and waste  just spend the extra money and get the  curlformers</li>
            <li> I have soft, thick, curly, kinky, coarse African American hair.&lt;br /&gt;Today I have long (past my shoulder blades) hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered the long and wide curl formers from another seller, Curls.  </li>
            <li> They are tightly coiled and are not stretched.</li>
            <li> would recommend these if you want to loose curl.</li>
            <li> the curl that they produce is really loose and doesnt curl to the end...</li>
            <li> They refunded me half of the money back.</li>
            <li> It kept pulling my hair out and at one point the blue tool you use to pull your hair through the curler snapped in half.</li>
            <li> With this product just set on wet hair and let it air dry.  </li>
            <li> The blue stick was flimsy and snapped in half.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these with both wet hair and dry hair and after sleeping in them overnight, the curls look great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> set of curlformers with all the different colors \\&quot;seem\\&quot; to have variety but the set is literally a waste unless your hair is max 5\\&quot; long.</li>
            <li> The rollers were more flimsy, narrow, and in random odd sizes....</li>
            <li> When done properly and with a little patience, they will do the job, BUT...</li>
            <li> These are so hard as far as texture.</li>
            <li> i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to people who have long hair plus its really tiny and a very little amount.</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re exactly as i expected.</li>
            <li> Guuurl, let me tell ya, if your hair is wet</li>
            <li> getting another set for days when I wan extra curls and body</li>
            <li> It took quite a while for delivery but the product was what I expected.</li>
            <li> I have pink and Orange.</li>
            <li> the product is no the real think this is some boot leg thing poorly made from China with all the plastic material was coming out of the rollers therefore pulling my hair.  </li>
            <li> The curlers work as expected</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just harder to use and insert hair into.</li>
            <li> and it was harder to pull through, also that risks damage that way.</li>
            <li> but then the curlers tangled my hair and and did not really curl anything.</li>
            <li> For us natural haired girls with thick, unruly hair; this is the product to use (but this product will work with ANY hair type).</li>
            <li> : IF you&#x27;re going to order these, 1) order TWO of these (I was using them and half-way through realized that I simply did not have enough rollers to cover my thick TWA)</li>
            <li> I have thick longish hair (below the shoulder above back of bra)</li>
            <li> We tried a second time and again we had to put her hair in pigtails to try to tame the curles.  </li>
            <li> It only took half of my strands and the other half were just sticking out.</li>
            <li> However, a major drawback is it is hard to sleep on these things.  </li>
            <li> Oh and \\&quot;random color\\&quot; really means \\&quot;whatever we can find to fill the damned box.\\&quot; My box contained pink, green, orange and 1 lonely yellow.</li>
            <li> They are not as well put together as the other ones I ordered.</li>
            <li> These curlformers alot cheaper then the other curlformers I have seen.</li>
            <li> The blue ones included in the packet is for 3\\&quot; hair SO SMALL.</li>
            <li> In the photo, and in the other sets of these spiral curlers sold, half of the curlers curl in each direction.</li>
            <li> The ends are so hard to open.</li>
            <li> for short hair that&#x27;s at least chin</li>
            <li> Only recommendation I have is you will need at least 2 packages</li>
            <li> Also I bought two bags and still didn&#x27;t have enough to cover my head, but my hair is THICK.</li>
            <li> and it is thick, then I consider looking for another knockoff or just buying the actual curlformers from the official website.</li>
            <li> This is a draw back because it takes time to put the curl formers in -  If your hair is thick like mine - you have to use a lot of these curlers.  </li>
            <li> your hair gets stuck every time, even before you try to pull it down....</li>
            <li> my chin/ear down (depends on what size I&#x27;m using and where on my head</li>
            <li> This can cause damage, so what I suggest is take a knife or something that can so in and rub/saw that down.</li>
            <li> and it cut away the seem and smoothed it down.</li>
            <li> I estimate the pictured ones are about an inch and a half longer.</li>
            <li> When this happens use less hair.</li>
            <li> The curlers tear with the slightest touch and curling tool instrument is made from the cheapest plastic,and emitted an odd odor.</li>
            <li> The curling tool instrument broke in half after just using it twice.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t really mess it  up.</li>
            <li> This is not true.  </li>
            <li> This was a waste of money and I would not purchase this item or any other item from this vendor again!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect tight curls</li>
            <li> but  if  you want high quality buy the $70 version, if you don&#x27;t want to do that buy these,other than a few tears in some curlers and a mediocre hook  </li>
            <li> The only complaint is that I wish the curlers were longer (I have longish hair about 3 inches past my shoulders).  </li>
            <li> Takes a little bit to get the hang of putting them in.</li>
            <li> but - I need something that will keep the style a little longer.</li>
            <li> It took a little while to get here</li>
            <li> waste your money on these.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;I accepted the suggestion, and with it, the few products that I bought</li>
            <li> They are not comfortable to sleep in either.</li>
            <li> I wasted my time and money buying this product.</li>
            <li> Pulled out a few strand of hair.</li>
            <li> My hair got tangled in the stick a few times.</li>
            <li> I curl my hair up in them after I washed and towel dried my hair.</li>
            <li> I used this product a few times.</li>
            <li> Got on You Tube to see the tutorials - there are quite a few on there.  </li>
            <li> A waste of money if your hair is passed your ears.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Some girls seem to have trouble getting them out of their hair and they also sustain damage from the hook.</li>
            <li> but if your a mom, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> The 18pc curler set didn&#x27;t work for my 4c hair even with it blow dried.  </li>
            <li> Waste of my time and money.</li>
            <li> waste of money</li>
            <li> Watch a few youtube tutorials if your unsure.</li>
            <li> these were a waste of my $$$.</li>
            <li> The package was damaged, and one roller was missing.</li>
            <li> It was a plain plastic bag with the curlers and rod in them,  </li>
            <li> The piece that pulls your hair through the curler has a hard time staying together no matter how little strands of hair you pull through it comes apart.</li>
            <li> but the way they shipped it sucks not to mention im missing 2 curlers.</li>
            <li> Not sure if they work yet</li>
            <li> I was not satisfied with this product because it did not work.</li>
            <li> and I had no good results till snail rollers.i have thin hair and short</li>
            <li> small rolls measures 5 1/2\\&quot; inches.</li>
            <li> I have medium length hair that reaches just past my shoulders.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this is a common problem or just in my case.</li>
            <li> They are much less expensive than the Curl Formers brand; however, a few of these have snagged with time, making them catch on and pull the hair.</li>
            <li> They pull your hair and are quite hard.</li>
            <li> but the one i got came with at least 16.</li>
            <li> and it did not arrive until late August.  </li>
            <li> I use at least 45 on my head.</li>
            <li> It is extremely cheap but awful.</li>
            <li> you will need at least 3 packs for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a learning curve to these suckers.</li>
            <li> I have past-the-shoulder thick hair</li>
            <li> I mean.</li>
            <li> the pack is very small....</li>
            <li> The curlers were very small</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is the stick used to put the rollers in didnt stay connecetd for long,I have to glue the two pieces together</li>
            <li> my hair is short. :(</li>
            <li> read some very negative reviews on this product but ordered it anyway.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> but these are poorly made.  </li>
            <li> I am not a happy camper.</li>
            <li> This product was frustrating for me.</li>
            <li> These are a cheaper, poor quality version of the curl formers.</li>
            <li> pulled a bit behind to add volume to your hair...</li>
            <li> I hate the size of these curlers its like someone just mixed everything together in one box without any thought.</li>
            <li> and im still secretly waiting even though Amazon has refunded my money because the company (lucky_beauty) is no longer with them.</li>
            <li> This product was poorly made (curlers and curling tool instrument).</li>
            <li> However my hair didn&#x27;t hold the curls very long :(</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how horrible this new set is.</li>
            <li> I hate gels as they dry my hair out.</li>
            <li> Tried on flat ironed hair- hated it.</li>
            <li> This product is clearly an illegal and counterfeit product.</li>
            <li> and it was difficult to use needle.  </li>
            <li> And there was no hook included to pull hair through the curlers so they are useless.  </li>
            <li> Finally, the plastic that the tool was made of has a terrible smell.  </li>
            <li> but once I did use them, I was not impressed with the results.  </li>
            <li> bought one of the expensive name brand and one of these.</li>
            <li> My daughter said they are difficult to sleep on.  </li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> but also it&#x27;s fake.</li>
            <li> However, they were uncomfortable to sleep in.</li>
            <li> Putting the curlers over the tool is difficult because some of the ends were stuck together.</li>
            <li> Sad.</li>
            <li> And they are EXTREAMLY uncomfortable to sleep in</li>
            <li> you cannot go wrong</li>
            <li> You will be mad at yourself for not purchasing them sooner.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality!</li>
            <li> Sleeping on them was impossible.</li>
            <li> I had lots of bad hair days while I worked on training and growing my hair.</li>
            <li> But if you put them in an inch or two below the roots they are not even bad to sleep in.</li>
            <li> So painful.</li>
            <li> So it took two weeks before I got my product.. :(</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s very painful to put in and have in, and painful to take out.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed :(</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product it terrible.</li>
            <li> I have asked for a refund, even though it was inexpensive, because the item is really awful.  </li>
            <li> These curlers are terrible.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Worst product that I have ever purchased!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The set is nice and just as described, but the plastic tool provided in the set was broken when I recieved it. I am not sure if this is a common problem or just in my case.</li>
            <li> Rollers worked great they arrived on time it didn&#x27;t take long to use them are for the hair to dry. I really like them.</li>
            <li> Really easy to use.  The only complaint is that I wish the curlers were longer (I have longish hair about 3 inches past my shoulders).  Also the rollers have a funny plastic smell (it is starting to go away but it was more noticible when I first go them).</li>
            <li> For the price you cant beat it. Takes a little bit to get the hang of putting them in. I would not recommend sleeping in them though.</li>
            <li> These are just okay. The blue styling rod kept breaking. Since I bought 4 packs, I had 4 different sticks. I got down to the last one and was praying that it wouldn&#x27;t break or I wouldn&#x27;t be able to finish my hair. Ultimately I had pretty curls but they only lasted a day. I don&#x27;t think all that work and not being able to sleep was worth one day of beauty. I may be reselling them.</li>
            <li> The product overall is fairly good, my only problem is that the 2piece wand always comes out when I pull my hair through the curlformers and that gets aggravating.</li>
            <li> The rubber or plastic at the top and bottom of the curlers are not well made, and deformed.&lt;br /&gt;Made for short hair that&#x27;s at least chin length.&lt;br /&gt; I wouldn&#x27;t recommend if for anyone with roots that aren&#x27;t naturally straight and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Good if you just want to curl your ends.</li>
            <li> The product did not come with instructions so I had to go to you tube to find out how to use it. I am still having difficulty with using it. However my daughter who does not live at home also bought it and said she got wondeful results. I&#x27;ll continue to try to get a hang of it and then do another review. I remain excited and hopeul that I&#x27;ll get good results also&lt;br /&gt;The price is good and the product seems durable.</li>
            <li> I ordered the long and wide curl formers from another seller, Curls.  They work great but these are poorly made.  The ends don&#x27;t close on the hair so they don&#x27;t stay in.  My daughter has a lot of hair.  It is too much effort to put these in only to have them fall out before her hair is dry.  I am returning these to the seller and trying another company.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 sets of this product previously and loved it. I then realized that I needed one more set. After receiving a new order, it was pretty obvious that the quality had changed dramatically!!! The rollers were more flimsy, narrow, and in random odd sizes.... in other words CHEAP. Very disappointed. I wish the seller had created a separate profile for the new rollers, because they are no longer the ones in the picture.</li>
            <li> The price was really low, so I found that it was worth the risk.  There is definitely a learning curve, but there are several great YouTube videos to explain how to use them.  This is a mix of snail rolls, so be aware that if you have longer hair, with several smaller rolls.  I will probably be purchasing another box (because the cost :)) or find the specific size for my 5 year old daughter and go from there.  Be sure to find a good product to go with the rollers, or they won&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used them yet but they&#x27;re exactly as i expected. my hair is too short now but i&#x27;ll use them all the time once it gets a bit longer</li>
            <li> I ordered this just to try it. They say it has 18pcs but the one i got came with at least 16. not to mention it didn&#x27;t come in a box. the shipped it in the plastic and put the box in the plastic. the rollers work yeah but the way they shipped it sucks not to mention im missing 2 curlers.</li>
            <li> they often get stuck in hair and makes it WAY too curly. only recommended for cheerleaders who need curly ponytails</li>
            <li> My hair was too long from this length of rollers so I really couldn&#x27;t rate it in a positive light.</li>
            <li> I got my rollers and I love them. Easy to use, and nice colors. They are just as good as those expensive ones..you know the ones I mean. I will get a larger size next time for longer curls.</li>
            <li> These rollers rip your hair out and while they may curl your hair if left in long enough they really aren&#x27;t made for use with African American hair.</li>
            <li> having a hard with it.hair not sliding out easily as stated,will try again later or ask somebody to help me..</li>
            <li> I love these rollers. Because so many women stated the product was not properly advertised since their hair is long, I knew it would be a perfect fit for me. Once you get the hang of it, these rollers are much easier to put in than regular hair rollers and help ones hair dry quickly. Since my hair has a tighter curl than the rollers, I enjoyed seeing my spiral curls elongated.</li>
            <li> Now if I had known my hair was going to be a tad longer... I would have gotten the extra long.</li>
            <li> I saw a tutorial on YouTube so I decided to check it out myself.  This is SUPER easy and quick!  Because I use my hair dryer to set after curlers are in, my hair is less damaged compared to using a hot curling iron.  Based on the previous reviews, I purchased 2 sets to make sure I have enough long rollers and 2 sets give me a plenty of options in length.  BTW, this does not come with instructions so you may want to watch a tutorial first.</li>
            <li> I love these hair curlers!!!!!!!! They were just perfect for my short hair i dont think anyone with long hair should get these ones because you will need the ones that are way longer</li>
            <li> These rollers did a fairly good job. My hair is natural though, so these as not the easiest to install and since my length is shorter I did not get as much curl as I would have liked. I think I still prefer my bendy foam rollers, for a tighter curl that lasts.&lt;br /&gt;Note: These rollers are better for short to medium length. Also I bought two bags and still didn&#x27;t have enough to cover my head, but my hair is THICK.</li>
            <li> I love these and cannot compliment them enough. Thanks for making them affordable to buy. They are made of excellent quality. You will not be disappoint with them. You will be mad at yourself for not purchasing them sooner.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say it took sooo long for these to finally come in the mail. When I did get them I noticed that there were really short pieces. My hair is around 7 inches long, and only half of what came in the bag was suitable for my hair, meaning if you have longer hair and it is thick, then I consider looking for another knockoff or just buying the actual curlformers from the official website. As far as results, it gets the job done. I tried it on my hair but unfortunately I ran out and a portion of the top of my head was still not done. There was no instructions so you might have to turn to youtube and another downside was that it snags and breaks off your hair. I will just buy the real product instead. Better safe then sorry.</li>
            <li> This product is clearly an illegal and counterfeit product. The curlers are sub-standard, and are not the size advertised. They also give off a smell (like burned tyres) which could indicate the use of cheap and toxic (and probably illegal) plastics (that is also probably why they are so cheap in comparison with the original Curlformers). As well as this, the hook provided is very weak and breaks easily. However, the most urgent issue is that these products are being sold illegally. Next time, I won&#x27;t be duped by the positive reviews, I&#x27;ll buy the real thing and tell everyone else to do the same.</li>
            <li> no instructions looked up on line and hair just goes right through the hole and wont curl hanging thru there</li>
            <li> These came in clear plastic wrapping and 2 of them were frayed. Why do I get the feeling these were used and sold from someone&#x27;s house in China. Yes, they actually shipping from China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these curlers a dozen times now and I&#x27;m ready to toss em.&lt;br /&gt;first off the rubber ends of the curlers are coming off. the threading tool used to get your hair into the curler does as much damage as you are trying to avoid.&lt;br /&gt;this is cheap pieces of junk from china. buy american and reap the benifits</li>
            <li> Took a long time to get them but I love the product easy to use and my hair looks great every time</li>
            <li> I planned a trip to the United States in advance, bought products on the Amazon site, choose gifts for my son, as well as products of interest to me, but to close the purchase, the site informed me that the address was inconsistent and suggested changing it.&lt;br /&gt;I accepted the suggestion, and with it, the few products that I bought and I got it was because I spent almost the entire trip trying to track my orders, and going to the FedEx office to pick my products. I honestly think almost lost this trip, not counting the time to request a refund.</li>
            <li> These are a great affordable alternative to curlformers. I knocked a star because the wand is not the best; it&#x27;s pretty flimsy. But if you purchase the curlformers wand with this kit it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Beautiful curls with no heat was my objective. This product works very well on my 3b hair. I would purchase these again</li>
            <li> I am an African American woman.  I saw so many women of my ethnicity rave about using curlformers on their natural hair.  It felt like I was ripping hair from my scalp and it was difficult to use needle.  I don&#x27;t think I will use these again.  The style only lasted a day but it was cute.</li>
            <li> i bought them and was excited to get them. They came early but i dont like them because my hair is to long. my hair is mid bacl lenght and they wont work the long ones work for my side bangs. So i gave them to my sister who has short hair and they work perfect for her. She says there better than spongrollers and nice to sleep in. She did part of her head with these and other with sponge and these dryed soo fast. So i gave it a 3 because it works for her and shipping was good. But long haired girls stay away buy a different set.</li>
            <li> Not sure if they work yet but The are a great fun to use. I will try them out soon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product.  I thought they would be easier to put in your hair, but sometimes they get stuck and need to be redone.  My young daughter (who is not as picky as I am) loves them.  They work perfect for her.</li>
            <li> Did not come in the box, but they work well and are very nice. They are not comfortable to sleep in either.</li>
            <li> My daughter ordered these and loved them. They were easy for her to use on her own as she is only 11.</li>
            <li> When these curlers arrived 1 1/2 months later they were not in the shown package.  They were just in a clear bag. Very cheap made.  And there was no hook included to pull hair through the curlers so they are useless.  Do not buy this product!!!</li>
            <li> had these for year now they have held up very well. use the maybe 10 times.not for long hair&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these if you want to loose curl. I have natural African American hair i mostly use them to air dry my wet hair overnight. they work best on soaking wet hair</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it at all. I was not satisfied with this product because it did not work. I wasted my time and money buying this product. I don&#x27;t know if its the length of the product or what but I really thought that this product would have worked.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used them once yet and won&#x27;t. Smaller than I thought they would be and the heads of them are cracked. Don&#x27;t want to put them on my hair and they pull at my hair. But the company is decent. They refunded me half of the money back.</li>
            <li> beautiful results.  Wish there were more to use as we ran out before all of her hair was wrapped and curled</li>
            <li> These snail rolls are great. Keep my hair looking good and growing since I don&#x27;t have to me with it everyday. I like to pin curl them at night and walk it with fab hair.</li>
            <li> They are good, just not for hair longer than your shoulders and wand is not included. My hair is at shoulder length, but I have some parts that are longer,which stuck out of the formers a bit.</li>
            <li> I really thought it would be a waist of money but I&#x27;ve been  different ones and I had no good results till snail rollers.i have thin hair and short that&#x27;s why I love this item.im gonna order a few more. The delivery was sooner than expected and very good condition.thank you</li>
            <li> Guuurl, let me tell ya, if your hair is wet IT WILL CURRRRRL like there is no tomorrow. the drier the hair the softer the curl. Great product</li>
            <li> The wand is flimsy. They pull out my hair and hurt once you get them in. They are difficut to use.</li>
            <li> I will not recommend this product to anyone... I guess thats what i get for the price. Next time i will go for a different brand even if i have to pay more money....</li>
            <li> Tried on flat ironed hair- hated it. Tried on my wet, naturally curly hair and LOVED it. Full, bouncy, beautiful spiral curls.</li>
            <li> i thought these would be the perfect size for my hair since they were short .. but they are suprisingly too short .. for my shoulder lenth hair .. and i am 5&#x27; 4&#x27;&#x27;  but if my hair was shorter they would be great ..</li>
            <li> These you can sleep in without waking up with a headache and it is fast. It is real easy to use with no heat. You don&#x27;t need, but could use garnier curl spray with it.</li>
            <li> Curlers like this are great and easy to use. No pulling no tugging. Slides on and off easily. Price was great and came in quickly.</li>
            <li> The items received are significantly different from what is shown. First, I only got the upper half of the hook, which is too short to be of any use. Secondly, the curlers I receive all curl in the same direction. In the photo, and in the other sets of these spiral curlers sold, half of the curlers curl in each direction. Last, the shorter curlers I got are quite a bit shorter than those pictured. They measure, stretched, 6 inches (longer ones are 9&amp;#34;) and have exactly 2 turns, whereas those in the photo have 2 1/2 turns. I estimate the pictured ones are about an inch and a half longer. That makes a big difference in terms of whether they would be useful. I would return them, but it would cost more than I paid for them. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Loved the results on my natural hair, wished more came in a pack. I originally ordered 2 to be on the safe side.. It did the job but I&#x27;m ordering another so they can be nice and full. And also it takes a good minute for them to come in but that&#x27;s no problem.</li>
            <li> I got a pack of these while ago, they were great worked well were in good shape. After using it for while my hair grew longer so I placed an order from the same seller, thinking it would be good to have another set and use the longer once since my hair had grown longer. I placed an order on October and I just got it today. I can&#x27;t believe how horrible this new set is. The longer roles in this set are equivalent to the shorter once in the old set I got way back. I thought the old once might of been stretched from use for months, but after lining the rolls next to each other I was able to realize that the new set is actuality shorter. The old one measures 11 1/2\\&quot; inch, the new one 10\\&quot; inch. The smaller rolls in the old set measures 7 1/2\\&quot; inch and the new sets small rolls measures 5 1/2\\&quot; inches. Now keep this in mind the measurements I done in not the curly roll,I put the rolls on the stick it came with and used a ruler to measure. FYI my rating for the old set months ago was five, now that I have gotten this I am giving it a one. Don&#x27;t buy this product it terrible.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product for inexperienced DIY hair stylers. the wand should be one piece instead of two. you can&#x27;t really mess it  up.</li>
            <li> I ordered two packs and the only sent me one hook. I am not a happy camper. I emailed them and i didn&#x27;t get a response.</li>
            <li> Easy to use but not really comfortable to sleep in.... Regardless, it did curl my hair in a short period of time.</li>
            <li> These are great for hair that is shoulder length but, if you have long hair you will need longer ones. They do work great. I didn&#x27;t like the rod that pulls the hair through had a roughness to it mean the edges needed to be smooth.</li>
            <li> Pulled out a few strand of hair. My hair got tangled in the stick a few times. Curls were cute. Don&#x27;t try to sleep in them!! For as long as it took I could&#x27;ve used a hot curler or flexi-rods.</li>
            <li> it was a simple to use product. super easy to use. its a real at home item. I curl my hair up in them after I washed and towel dried my hair. they are easy to sleep in and in the morning it looks like it is natural</li>
            <li> Saw these curlers on youtube and was so amazed to find them here AND THEY WORKED!! getting another set for days when I wan extra curls and body</li>
            <li> I wish I had more long pieces, but the product was excellent. Time took shorter than expected which was wonderful.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try these but kept putting it off than I found them on amazon and ordered them. I like them a lot the are east to use</li>
            <li> Overall really great product for the price. One thing....the curl wand is too flimsy. Need to make a sturdier wand.</li>
            <li> I used this product a few times. I have a lot of hair so I had to buy two of them just to try to fit all of my hair. This product was frustrating for me. It kept pulling my hair out and at one point the blue tool you use to pull your hair through the curler snapped in half. This product wont be one I use very often</li>
            <li> I used the product 3 times since I&#x27;ve bought them. I like the outcome of the look but you have to TUUUUGGGG on your hair which obviously weakens it and and break it off.</li>
            <li> It took quite a while for delivery but the product was what I expected.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly as described.  I received the shipment in a timely manner.  They are easy to use and work great.  The only  issue I had was, they were not long enough from my hair and that was my fault.  If you hair is beyond shoulder length you may need to get the longer set of curlers.</li>
            <li> I loved these roller, they were extremely well priced,&lt;br /&gt; so easy to used and leaves my hair as curly as iI want them to be-</li>
            <li> I placed this order July 23, 2013 and it did not arrive until late August.  When I ordered it, I did not realize it would be shipping from China so I guess I can forgive to long delivery time.  I addition to that, the tool that is used to pull the hair through the Snail rool comes in 2 pieces and is designed to snap together but the one I received would not lock in place so I had to use super glue to keep it from coming apart when I used it.  Finally, the plastic that the tool was made of has a terrible smell.  I would recommend paying a little more and getting something made in the US.</li>
            <li> It arrived fast and they are easy to use. My baby girls&#x27; hair was beautiful. She loved it she wants it done all the time.</li>
            <li> The instructions were not clear and it did not curl my hair the way it should have. But I will still keep on trying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m adding to this post, because sure enough, the day I rated it one star, the item arrived, but it still took a month to get here.  First thing I noticed was the lack of instructions.  It shouldn&#x27;t be hard to figure out, but when I tried to assemble the wand that is used to pull hair through, the fit was so tight it cracked in half.  Then I tried to insert it into one of the rollers and it ripped right through the plastic mesh to the point where I can&#x27;t even get the wand back out.  I have asked for a refund, even though it was inexpensive, because the item is really awful.  Lesson learned:  you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> buy the longer ones,you could still use them when hair grows these ones broke the first time i used them</li>
            <li> These suck, my stick would not stay together and continuously fell apart. I will only buy the named brand of this type of product.</li>
            <li> I figured out how to used this but once I did use them, I was not impressed with the results.  I will use them for a softer curl, and not try to look like the picture on the box</li>
            <li> And easy to use.  Got on You Tube to see the tutorials - there are quite a few on there.  Trick is not to section too much hair to pull through the roller.  If you have difficulty pulling the hair through, make a smaller section and you shouldn&#x27;t have any problems.  I was hoping that I could make spiral curls that would stand (I&#x27;m African), but couldn&#x27;t do it with the size I got.  Perhaps I&#x27;d get better results with a thinner roller.  Otherwise, got nice bouncy curls and didn&#x27;t have to use any heat.</li>
            <li> Months later, &amp; I still haven&#x27;t used them in my own hair!!!  My grandmother, two of my co-workers, &amp; a cousin have used them.  The reviews are mixed.  More positive than bad.</li>
            <li> I like the spring curls without the perm, cost and smell.  Well worth the price. The hook did break around the third time that I used it.</li>
            <li> These are so good.My hair curls perfectly every time. The only &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; is now I have to buy the longer ones because my hair is getting longer.</li>
            <li> I transitioned from Perms to natural hair 6 years ago. I had lots of bad hair days while I worked on training and growing my hair. I have soft, thick, curly, kinky, coarse African American hair.&lt;br /&gt;Today I have long (past my shoulder blades) hair. This is a great way to get the same look achieved using the traditional rods.  In order for your hair to grow - one must leave it alone -keep it clean and moisterized, moisterized- moisterized (ESPECIALLY YOUR ENDS). With this product just set on wet hair and let it air dry.  You will have great Shirley Temple like curls - a little tight on the first day. I hate gels as they dry my hair out. So I am still trying to find the right product to use a setting lotion. Shea butter works well as a leave in conditioner but - I need something that will keep the style a little longer. The curls do not last very long. This is a draw back because it takes time to put the curl formers in -  If your hair is thick like mine - you have to use a lot of these curlers.  You will know if you have too much hair if the hair does not slide through the curler. It will get caught as you pull with the rod. When this happens use less hair. And it looks much nicer when you use less hair and more curlers anyway. I use at least 45 on my head. WHen the hair is dry and it must be completely dry, just pull them out. You can use a hair dryer also. I never use a dryer. However, a major drawback is it is hard to sleep on these things.  Always wear a satin cap to bed. I found a great startup kit with everything you need to go Natural. Email me for link.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product for Natural hair styles. You can go to YouTube for demonstrations on how to DIY at home.  Buy the longer ones so as your hair grows, you won&#x27;t be stuck with the short ones. I have pink and Orange. Use the same color in one area so the curls are going in the same direction.</li>
            <li> It took about three weeks for them to arrive but they are coming directly from China so plan accordingly.  Packaged as described and priced reasonably.  I will definitely order from this company again</li>
            <li> These curlers are terrible.  They are knock off of the real curl formers and they do not work at all.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great if you have really short hair.  I don&#x27;t think the description of this product gives anough information.  If you look at the picture of product you see a girl with very long hair.  Giving the impression that they can be used with long hair.  This is not true.  These are made for women with short hair.  A waste of money if your hair is passed your ears.</li>
            <li> Great price and fast delivery. Colors indicate the size and the way the curl faces. These are long curlers but you can use on short hair just leave the rest of the curl dangling. If you don&#x27;t wish to buy two different sizes.</li>
            <li> My items was not brand new. I tried to connect the sticks and they broke. I purchased two of these and they was suppose to be a gift. I do it recommend.</li>
            <li> Hard to sleep in, but definitely work and easy to use.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t work very well. If you hair dry them the air doesn&#x27;t get through to the hair and if you let it air dry it takes 3-5 hours. Also, it&#x27;s very painful to put in and have in, and painful to take out. Sleeping in them doesn&#x27;t work even with a hair net, it digs into your head.</li>
            <li> I love it&#x27;s the best my friends like it and my mom? I recommended to my friends because it&#x27;s so amazing.</li>
            <li> I love the product. Works greats! I need more. I recommend buying from them. I will be making more purches in the future.</li>
            <li> They work, but the odor they release makes me almost gag. All the sizes are super different and weren&#x27;t right for people with long hair.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, nice . It creates very nice curlers. Better than all the rollers i had before. Go for it.</li>
            <li> makes really good curls.  the tool used to pull the hair through broke on me during the first use.  ugghhh.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t work at all. It is extremely cheap but awful. There is not enough curlers to cover your whole head in addition to that they are all different sizes. A complete mess and waste  just spend the extra money and get the  curlformers</li>
            <li> the pack is very small.... you will need at least 3 packs for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;and my freaken hair only comes down to my shoulders, i even had to use two of them for one strand of hair because they didn&#x27;t take in the whole piece</li>
            <li> i love these things.. i wasnt sure if they were gonna work and they did.. just like a curling iron..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started transitioning from relaxed to natural hair and since twists don&#x27;t work as nicely with my hair being still mostly relaxed, I wanted to try these curlers to see if I could get some spiral curls and after using this product, it worked beautifully.  I had great curls.  Just make sure your hair is completely dry before taking the curlers out and use a sculpting or setting lotion or gel.  Curls lasted 3 days with me doing nothing to them.  Just put on satin cap and get up in the morning and shake out.  Still perfect curls.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money. This product arrived with torn plastic ends. It also does not work. I purchased two packages and they are in the bottom of my closet. If I was more organized around the time of purchase, I would have returned them. Flexirods are a much better product than these! I purchased flexi-rods from my local beauty supply to avoid shipping cost and it creates the same effect and styles as what this product was suppose to do!</li>
            <li> These work great! They are super easy to put in and look AMAZING after! I have used them twice now and they are wonderful! I just put them in before bed and when I wake up... perfect curls! I have had so many people ask me how I did it! SO worth ordering! If you have long hair you might want longer ones only though.</li>
            <li> The ones I got from NAVA were much better than these. They are not as well put together as the other ones I ordered. Some of them are so short!!! You&#x27;d almost have to have a twa for them to be any good. Not to mention they are shipped from China. Invest in the NAVA 26 pc set which aren&#x27;t expensive, you&#x27;ll get more for your money.</li>
            <li> These are not the real curl formers they are a knock off version of the real product. Came in a ziplock bag with no instructions. The hook is different from the real hook. The hooks gets caught onto my hair when I try to pull it through</li>
            <li> They are easy to use and a great deal for the buck. I went to a known beauty supply store this weekend to see if they had extra large and the price difference is enough to make me to come back to the site to buy more. Thank you.</li>
            <li> My daugher has shoulder length hair and these were very easy to make her straight, thick hair CURLEY.  They curled so good, she was afraid to keep it down because she is not used to seeing her hair curley.  We tried a second time and again we had to put her hair in pigtails to try to tame the curles.  This time I pulled the &amp;#34;roller&amp;#34; down from the root to make the top of her head not curley.  Hopefully this will work so she will let me just pull back the sides and tie in back.  I&#x27;m so glad I got these.</li>
            <li> read some very negative reviews on this product but ordered it anyway. bought one of the expensive name brand and one of these. have use both products several times and find them extremely comparable. the hook in this box does kind of suck and yes the directions on the box are comical and make no sense, but watch a youtube video and give it a try. the name brand ones come in two colors because they each curl a different direction where as these all curl one direction. you can see the quality difference in the rubberized end but honestly they work great and i think are easier to remove.</li>
            <li> I love the curls that these make.  They are not the easiest to use and the wand breaks apart all the time.  My daughter said they are difficult to sleep on.  We needed 2 or more to cover her head.  Several of the curlers had snags and tears.  Next time, I will look for a better product.</li>
            <li> For us natural haired girls with thick, unruly hair; this is the product to use (but this product will work with ANY hair type). I LOVE my curlformers. They&#x27;re super easy to install, come in cute colors, &amp; spare my hair heat damage (since you don&#x27;t have to use heat with these if you don&#x27;t want to). I ordered this pack in addition to a 40 pack of longer length (from a different seller). Since the curlformers in this pack are so short, I only use them in the very back of my hair near the nape of my neck &amp; on the sides of my head (since hair in those areas tends to be shorter). Since the back of my hair always gets frizziest first, I love that the short curlformers are able to tame those pesky frizzies and make my hair silky &amp; curly. In conjunction with the right styling products, these curlformers work wonders on my hair &amp; produce curls that last me 4-5 days. They are definetly worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I have read reviews of this type of roller all over the internet. Some girls seem to have trouble getting them out of their hair and they also sustain damage from the hook. The hook is cheap and has a seam on the inside where your hair slides. I filed the seam down because it definitely can damage your hair if its left as is. Also, the hook broke in my luggage on a trip because its cheap. I had to order another one for about $3.50. The curlers themselves are fantastic. Since my hair is long the curlers clamp on to my hair far enough from my head that I can sleep comfortably. That makes these curlers an absolutely genius design as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m OK with the  18pcs rollers, just it take to long to curl you have to wait two ours for it.</li>
            <li> This is the best and more practical way I found so far to curl my hair without a hot curler. Works super well, but you will need more than just one pack for your entire hair.</li>
            <li> The colors don&#x27;t tell a different size. They are just like the short curlformers. I will return the ones I brought from sallys</li>
            <li> I have been waiting for this product for almost two months now and did not get it! I am very disappointed!</li>
            <li> This may be usefull for people with fine, shoulder length hair, but not at all for long, thick hair like mine. I&#x27;m always looking for a no heat alternative for curling my hair, but these are not even useful. Glad they were cheap!</li>
            <li> I like the curlformers. Super easy to use and isn&#x27;t too time consuming. However my hair didn&#x27;t hold the curls very long :( barely made it a day.</li>
            <li> My hair is actually too long for them, it was a misjudgment on my part, but I&#x27;m sure they would work very well on shorter hair...</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Much cheaper than Curlformers.&lt;br /&gt;They curl hair well if your hair length is between 2 to 6 inches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;18 pieces wasn&#x27;t enough for me to cover my whole head.&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t fit much hair into each roller.&lt;br /&gt;Felt like I was about to rip my hair out sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;No directions included with package (check out Youtube for tutorials).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;Worth a try if your hair is 2 - 6 inches long.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely use some hair product before putting your hair into the rollers. Hair with product in it resulted in perfectly formed ringlets. Hair without product just wound up looking frayed out once I took the rollers out.</li>
            <li> These are a cheaper, poor quality version of the curl formers. The blue stick was flimsy and snapped in half. Also the rollers snagged my hair. The majority of the curl formers were short. My hair is shoulder length and the rollers were not long enough for my hair. I would recommend spending the extra money on the name brand Curl formers.</li>
            <li> this also a disappointment,,looks as if made for kid doll and the box on came in says it is for a doll baby not adult</li>
            <li> This product is very easy to use and I&#x27;m happy I bought them. There came exactly as stated on line.</li>
            <li> It took a little while to get here but it was really worth the wait. I have really coily hair and didnt think they would work but I was wrong. They are very comfy to sleep in and easy to put in, directions would have helped, but I just watched some youtube videos to guide me. The only bad thing is the stick used to put the rollers in didnt stay connecetd for long,I have to glue the two pieces together so they won&#x27;t pull apart while I&#x27;m applying them to my hair. But other than that I love them and will be ordering more soon!!</li>
            <li> I like this product the only thing is the curls don&#x27;t last long with natural hair but that is not the products fault.</li>
            <li> The picture shows as though the curlers would be in retail packaging, they are not. It was a plain plastic bag with the curlers and rod in them,  no instructions.</li>
            <li> It does good work with a straight hair like mine, who doesn&#x27;t want it with permanent.  I play around with it, until I found out that you have to do it....pulled a bit behind to add volume to your hair...just letting it hangs as you seen at the ad, is not for me, since it made it look flat at the top.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that your hair had to be so short to use them. I tried to use them and my hair stuck out of the end of it. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it if your hair is long. I can use it on my shorter layers though.</li>
            <li> It is easy to put these in but if you intend to sleep in them, don&#x27;t buy them. They pull your hair and are quite hard. I didn&#x27;t have the patience to blow dry them either. I tried but I didn&#x27;t have the time to put them all in then take time to dry them. If you have the time to use them then you will like them.. but if your a mom, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I had seen these 2 years ago and am so excited to finally have a set of my own.  They work great.</li>
            <li> the product is no the real think this is some boot leg thing poorly made from China with all the plastic material was coming out of the rollers therefore pulling my hair.  don&#x27;t get it from this seller not only it takes so long to come because it comes from China but also it&#x27;s fake.</li>
            <li> Have not used. Don&#x27;t know how to put them on. No directions at all. Very disapinted.</li>
            <li> The 18pc curler set didn&#x27;t work for my 4c hair even with it blow dried.  They fit too loose to do what they are designed to do.</li>
            <li> 3 stars only because these specific curl formers are for people with short hair. I used these on the shorter part of my hair in the front (my bangs) and they worked great!</li>
            <li> i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to people who have long hair plus its really tiny and a very little amount. gonna save it until one day my hair is short. :( huge dissapointment</li>
            <li> I have medium length hair that reaches just past my shoulders. This pack would be better suited to short or children&#x27;s hair that is not longer than shoulder length. I used these to curl the ends of my hair and liked the look. However, they were uncomfortable to sleep in. That being said, I have used these before an event with barely dampened hair and left in for about 3 hours. I look like Medusa but the ringlets are cute. Will probably buy the longer set and give these to my neice. The price is also nice. DId take forever to arrive but it did come clear from CHina.</li>
            <li> These are not curl formers! I should have known when they didn&#x27;t say that on the information. They are imitations. On one end of the curler the plastic is melted shut so you have to break it apart to use it. There are no instructions so I had to YouTube how to use them and there&#x27;s not a variety of curlers; my hair is shoulder lenght and maybe only half of the curlers I would be able to use bc my hair is too long for the rest. Lastly it&#x27;s no where near enough curlers. So I have not even used them. I will probably just go to my local Sally beauty Supply and buy real curlformers. I did give then 3 stars though bc once you get them open they are usable if you have short hair.</li>
            <li> Super easy for a 3 year old who won&#x27;t hold still.  Bonus..It actually holds all day long in her fine hair</li>
            <li> I have short-medium length hair, so this set worked perfectly for me. I would recommend a different set with more long rollers for someone with hair any longer than mine.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.  It&#x27;s flexibility makes it easy to store away.  It does what it suppose to but it seems that the curls fall out quicker.</li>
            <li> After seeing results of curlformers on some CGs on YouTube, I decided to try these out, only I was NOT about to pay so much money for the kit at Sally&#x27;s! So I ordered these just to see if they would work. When done properly and with a little patience, they will do the job, BUT...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my fellow thick-haired women: IF you&#x27;re going to order these, 1) order TWO of these (I was using them and half-way through realized that I simply did not have enough rollers to cover my thick TWA), 2) be mindful of the hook: it tends to come apart, 3) Also smooth out the eye of the hook, since the plastic at the seam can damage your hair, and 4) PREPARE TO WAIT 2-3 WEEKS (the package ships all the way from China!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OR - and you should - do yourself a favor and, for more money, get better-quality curlformers and hook. Bottom line: You get what you pay for. Such is the case with these cheaply manufactured curlformers.</li>
            <li> Good quality and good price.  I did not want to pay over 60 bucks for curlformers if I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like them.  These do the same thing and I just love the price.  It did not take long for them to arrive and shipping was reasonable.</li>
            <li> Item Arrived fast, as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t totally satisfied with the QUALITY, but I guess I got what I paid for.  The plastic tool broke during my first use. Oh Well.</li>
            <li> My hair is short/medium and I thought this would be fun to try as an alternative to heat curling. Sleeping on them was impossible. So painful. I took them out after a few hours and my hair was curly, but not in a good way. May be better for longer hair, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> First DO your reasearch, its a knock off of Sally&#x27;s Curlformers so just google and youtube curlformers and they are a ton of video tutorial. Second Great for Natural Hair Folks and all hair types. I used them in my friends hair because my hair is like 4inches. She looked really cute and she loved her hair. The hook is cheap and their are a few tears in the curlers themselves but  if  you want high quality buy the $70 version, if you don&#x27;t want to do that buy these,other than a few tears in some curlers and a mediocre hook  it works and I can&#x27;t wait to use them in my hair when it grows longer. Great for natural hair especially when trying to avoid heat but still get great curls. They don&#x27;t come with instructions so look up how to use them and follow all the tips because if you don&#x27;t you may risk ripping your hair out with the hook or breaking the curler</li>
            <li> These leave my daughter&#x27;s hair in bouncy spiral curls for most of the day as long as we set them right after her bath and leave them in until her hair is completely dry (morning). They are much less expensive than the Curl Formers brand; however, a few of these have snagged with time, making them catch on and pull the hair. Overall, a good bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> I bought similar ones from sally beauty supply for way more ( better quality) worked great but needed more for my daughters hair.. I bought more on AMAZON put these in my daughters hair and had her wear them all day and through the night for school the next day. . My daughter ( Age 9.5) actually likes these more cause they come off easier then the ones I bought from Sally&#x27;s people loved it and asked where to get them too... Only recommendation I have is you will need at least 2 packages</li>
            <li> This product does not work at all.... your hair gets stuck every time, even before you try to pull it down.... I tried it so many times in so many ways and nothing worked......</li>
            <li> I Didn&#x27;t get any instructions with this. Was there supposed to be?Can you send me some ,or email them to me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually it was pretty easy to figure out. I think I will have fun with these.</li>
            <li> My product came really fast. I was excited that I did not have to wait long to try them. They work just as good as the expensive, name brand rollers. My curls came out beautiful and I have natural hair (no perm). You still get a really straight root when using these rollers. The only thing I did not like is the hair feeding tool. It was very flimsy and broke almost instantly. Luckily I ordered another pack from another seller and got a better one. Even if you don&#x27;t buy another pack they are only like $4 at Sally&#x27;s and some other beauty supply stores. The length of the rollers were great. My hair still had plenty of room to grow.</li>
            <li> The curlers work as expected but I find them somewhat time consuming putting in.&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping they would be easier to use</li>
            <li> it &amp;#34;did what its suppose to do&amp;#34; but the pictures were misleading. I thought they would be as long as the picture. I have armpit length 4a/4b hair and these were waaaaaay to short for my hair. I was very disappointed :(</li>
            <li> First the rollers were not spirals they were only rolled up second the hair wand that was in the box was cheaply made and continued to come apart when using it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these with both wet hair and dry hair and after sleeping in them overnight, the curls look great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have relatively long hair and while this won&#x27;t curl from root to tip, it curls from about my chin/ear down (depends on what size I&#x27;m using and where on my head I&#x27;m curling). I got these because I wanted something I could let my hair dry naturally in and avoid using heating tools all the time. I frequently blow dry, straighten, and curl my hair. I&#x27;ve tried lots of kinds of curlers, but my thick hair never seems to dry right when I sleep in curlers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a learning curve to these suckers. If you don&#x27;t consider yourself a wiz with your own hair (or others), or haven&#x27;t used curlers before, this might be a little tricky to catch onto. But I&#x27;ve been doing my own as well as friends&#x27; hair for a long time and caught on pretty quickly. Once you get the hang of it, this is a quick process. I have past-the-shoulder thick hair and I can squeeze all my hair into these, but I wouldn&#x27;t mind having 4-5 more curlers and may end up ordering another package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for curlers that allow you to avoid heating tools and work in all kinds of hair, and you&#x27;re willing to put in a little time to learn how these work, these are quite worth it.</li>
            <li> The pack should have included both clockwise and counter clockwise formers, but they were all counter clockwise. Waste of my time and money. It took too long to deliver and tracking info was not provided. POS!</li>
            <li> I hate the size of these curlers its like someone just mixed everything together in one box without any thought. Not to mention it took forever to arrive</li>
            <li> The curlers were very small so I had to order more and from a different company.</li>
            <li> No information on how to use it .it does not come in box like is shown just on a plastic bag with no info</li>
            <li> The piece that pulls your hair through the curler has a hard time staying together no matter how little strands of hair you pull through it comes apart. Putting the curlers over the tool is difficult because some of the ends were stuck together. I was really dissapointed.</li>
            <li> These curlformers alot cheaper then the other curlformers I have seen. The delivery was also quick and easy. I plan purchasing these again also. The only&lt;br /&gt;bad thing about this is there were no directions on how to use them.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!! Very. Very poor quality! They are tightly coiled and are not stretched. Very flimsy!!!  I wish I had returned them, but may have waited too long. One of my most regretful purchases from amazon!!</li>
            <li> The curlers do what they are supposed to do. After you get the hand of how to get them on you can pretty much breeze through the process and I can honestly say they are much better sleeping in than the flexi rods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set of curlformers with all the different colors \\&quot;seem\\&quot; to have variety but the set is literally a waste unless your hair is max 5\\&quot; long. The blue ones included in the packet is for 3\\&quot; hair SO SMALL. I would suggest if you have medium length hair and you want to grow your hair out just start with the extra long ones and dont waste time or money dealing with tiny curlers</li>
            <li> You guys sent me ripped curlformers, how can i put them in my hair when the material is coming apart ! waste of money</li>
            <li> the material seems pretty cheap and sometimes gets tangled with my hair. I bought this because of a youtube video by Bubzbeauty and I think that this is nowhere close to the one that she used.&lt;br /&gt;It still works though, it&#x27;s just harder to use and insert hair into.</li>
            <li> I Love the snail rolls styling curler tools, would recommend to anyone, received ahead of schedule. Great product and it works very well</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I have used it both on my braided hair as well as on my hair without braids.&lt;br /&gt;They are the best hair rollers I&#x27;ve ever had.  I&#x27;m definitely introducing this to family and friends.&lt;br /&gt;Love it, love it love it!</li>
            <li> My order was lost in transit for a week before it was brought to their attention by myself. I will say the communication was good... However I would have like to have seen some accountability on their part... No discount was provided after I asked.. So it took two weeks before I got my product.. :(</li>
            <li> These worked GREAT on my daughter&#x27;s hair. She did walk around looking like Nelly Olsen from Little House on the Prairie for a few hours but the curls were worth it.  lol I found it easy to use, no broken ones. The stick was fine. Watch a few youtube tutorials if your unsure. It really is simple to figure out.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I can get nice, bouncey, and shiny curls without sitting under a dryer.  All I have to do is wash and condition my hair, put in a leave in conditioner or moisterizer and these curlers.  I leave them in over night and when I wake up take them out.  They are really easy to use, and coming from me that&#x27;s good.  I hate rolling my hair, but this is easy and quick.</li>
            <li> Is great for short and long hair. Make sure when you ordered that they will be long enough according with your hair</li>
            <li> These are so hard as far as texture. I was so ready to use them.  The ends are so hard to open. This is definitely for people with short hair and a lot of time to put this in. I&#x27;m still willing to try the authentic original product, but this was a lesson learnt in &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; theory.</li>
            <li> GREAT! love these so much, work like a charm! I wish they could be a little longer, but other than that, they are great!</li>
            <li> First off, for us thick haired natural girls, I suggest purchasing TWO of these so that you can insert LESS hair through each curlformer and still have enough for your whole head. 1 pack was just not enough for me the first time. My hair is about 5 inches long so the length is better for those with shorter hair. With one pack I was using way too much hair and it was harder to pull through, also that risks damage that way. My hair looks straight and permed when using these with no heat damage. They are comfortable to sleep in when I use a satin bonnet. They are easy to install and fun to put in (why, I dont know they just are lol)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is the stick. There is a seam inside the eyelet of the hook. This can cause damage, so what I suggest is take a knife or something that can so in and rub/saw that down. I used the tip of a knife and it cut away the seem and smoothed it down.</li>
            <li> This product would probably be a five star if I had shorter hair. I have thick longish hair (below the shoulder above back of bra) and so the ends of my hair stick out of these. Next time I will go for the longer version. They do curl your hair though - even without heat.</li>
            <li> Works great for short or extra short hair. I would look into the longer ones for medium or long lenght hair. But they do the job, they look great people always ask how I did my hair. They suck to sleep in if you have them right on your roots. But if you put them in an inch or two below the roots they are not even bad to sleep in. I gave it four stars because the picture shows all one length and it come with two different lenghts. But like I said it works for short hair. My hair has gotten longer so I will be buying a new and bigger set sometime soon.</li>
            <li> I dont recommend. Had the hardest time pulling my hair through. You get what you pay for. Go with the  real deal brand</li>
            <li> 18pcs Hair Rollers Snail Rolls Styling Curler Tools, Easy At Home these help alot and look just like I curled them with the curlers I&#x27;m natural so this works well</li>
            <li> I like the curlers only problem is they are alot smaller then pictured , would be great for some one with shorter hair</li>
            <li> When i bought these i loved the concept...what no one told me was that ur hair had to be a certain length to use the curl formers...the curl that they produce is really loose and doesnt curl to the end...these were a waste of my $$$.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted. You definitely get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Wand kept separating and rips my hair out. Gave up after second try. The one or two curls I managed to complete were nice, but couldn&#x27;t get the whole head done.</li>
            <li> If someone asked me to describe the product from this seller in 1 word, it would be \\&quot;JANKY!\\&quot; (Check [...] for the meaning) These aren&#x27;t even factory seconds! They have to be 5ths or rejects that someone needing some money sifted from the trash. First off, AMERICANS OF THE UNITED STATES PLEASE BE MINDFUL THAT THE REST OF THE WORLD OPERATES SOLELY ON THE METRIC SYSTEM! Make sure you convert their metrics into inches if you are unsure! Oh and \\&quot;random color\\&quot; really means \\&quot;whatever we can find to fill the damned box.\\&quot; My box contained pink, green, orange and 1 lonely yellow. Sad. Let me stop being Ebenezia (the female version) Scrooge and just pay the money for the better product sold stateside!</li>
            <li> I didt like the amount of time they took to arrive but learning patience helped a lot. Ive used these curlformers on my 4\\&quot; hair about 4 times and I finally got the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;Patience and determination prevail</li>
            <li> The rollers are tiny, not workable for long hair. It would take 2 or 3 rollers on one strand for shoulder-blade length hair. The package was damaged, and one roller was missing. When I emailed my concerns to the seller, they said thanks for contacting them, and &amp;#34;Have a nice life&amp;#34;, but they offered no solutions, not even a  replacement roller for the missing roller.</li>
            <li> Not for people with long hair. It only took half of my strands and the other half were just sticking out.</li>
            <li> Before I could finish my hair the hook broke. I have not been able to find just the hook to purchase.</li>
            <li> i really wont buy these again the other brand is better Vakind Hair Curler Magic Spiral Ringlets, I guess there ok for short hair but you will need a million of them</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect tight curls</li>
            <li> Some rolls got up to your sholduers and some are like 2 inches! And there&#x27;s not enough. And they are EXTREAMLY uncomfortable to sleep in</li>
            <li> Once you master these are fun to use and results are good.  Take a chance - you cannot go wrong</li>
            <li> Worst product that I have ever purchased!  Some of the curlers did not work and would only hang limply on the head and the curlers are too short - unless you have very, very short hair.  Do NOT waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> I got it on time, work really good, nice hair rollers, doesn&#x27;t hurt when I go to sleep !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish if they sold it by the size!</li>
            <li> they make pretty curls but it works better on shorter hair that is shoulder length or shorter. I have bra strap length hair i planned to order this product again but the longer set.</li>
            <li> does not curl hair have tried many times. my hair and my sister hair at two different types but still didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I bought this product because a friend recommended them to me. I was excited when my first set arrived before I went out of town, so I was sure they would all be there when I got home. Sadly enough they weren&#x27;t and im still secretly waiting even though Amazon has refunded my money because the company (lucky_beauty) is no longer with them. Oh yea but the ones I did get I have uses and I love &#x27;em.</li>
            <li> NOTHING seems to make my hair curl, but with wet hair, these not only managed to create a lasting curl, but even did it quickly (only a few hours - since the hair doesn&#x27;t roll on top of itself, it dries so much more quickly). Got this smaller, shorter set for the shorter sections of my hair, which was good, then got a bigger group of longer ones. They kind of train you to use small enough sections because only so much fits in the hook, which is a good thing for even-ness and for drying quickly.  I was still surprised at how long my hair actually was, though, so had to pull these away from my scalp a little to make sure the ends curled, too, so just realize, these rollers will definitely hold your hair at its full length.</li>
            <li> They make good curls but they are not that easy to handle. You have to use the stick and run it up the middle of the curler. Then you wrap the hair , but not to much hair, around the loop at the end of the stick. Then you pull your hair through the curler to the end and unloop your hair. This process hurts sometimes if you grab to much hair, if you twirl hair around loop or if not all the hair is in the loop. If you leave them in over night they are relatively comfortable and make tight curls</li>
            <li> Completely happy about getting this, it gives me the curles i wanted and was looking for with out parming and killing my hair.</li>
            <li> I am new to managing my natural and transitioning hair. I bought these so that I could use them as a protective hairstyle and I love them!! I love the curls. It was hard trying to get the hang of the curlformers at first, but I have them now. I should have bought the three packs instead of 2. 36 curlformers were not enough for my hair, so if you have thick hair, buy at least 3 packs to have a full head of popping curls!</li>
            <li> This product was poorly made (curlers and curling tool instrument). Materials used are very cheap and flimsy! The curlers tear with the slightest touch and curling tool instrument is made from the cheapest plastic,and emitted an odd odor. The curling tool instrument broke in half after just using it twice. Without the curling tool instrument you cannot use the curlers. This was a waste of money and I would not purchase this item or any other item from this vendor again!</li>
            <li> The concept is great, but the product is poor. The first time I used them the plastic hook broke, so literally took the product out of the box and it broke. I used a knitting hook and that worked but then the curlers tangled my hair and and did not really curl anything.</li>
            <li> They do a good job.&lt;br /&gt;But personally I don&#x27;t find them helpful for me. I was looking for something I can wear over night and the next day just be able to take them off and be ready (since I don&#x27;t have time at all to do my hair). You can wear those over night but it&#x27;s really really really uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;They should be fine if you wear them while you&#x27;re not sleeping and your hair is wet.&lt;br /&gt;In order to curl your hair, your hair has to be wet and you have to wait until it dries so you can see the pretty curls, I don&#x27;t feel like doing that because hair takes FORVER to dry when you&#x27;re wearing those.</li>
            <li> I really like these curlers. They are cheaper than the original. This set is good if you want to TRY curlformers, to see if it works for you or not. You will need at last a 30 pack of either size to finish a whole head of hair though.</li>
            <li> I saw a YouTube on how to use these and I was sold. So like I expected, Amazon has everything and more reasonable than the Beauty Supply store. I understand you need to have time to get use to these, so that&#x27;s what my weekend is for. I will rerate if I have a good experience. Besides that, it arrived when promised and as promised.</li>
            <li> Good set. Fun using them. Pretty curls. I paid $5.22 for the set. Great value for the price. Definetly worth it.</li>
            <li> I love them very easy and quick once you get the hang of them.. I use them one and the style last a whole week.</li>
            <li> The hair rollers did the job of curling my hair great  . I was able to sleep without a problem . This package is a good starter but if you want a full head of curls you need to get a bigger quantity .</li>
            <li> They had no instructions with them. They are to complicated and with fine hair I can&#x27;t afford to lose anymore trying to figure out how to use these.</li>
            <li> I rated this product 3 stars because there was no size assortment.  It had a lot of pieces but not the sizes you would expect.  I would not buy this item again.  Go for the real thing.</li>
