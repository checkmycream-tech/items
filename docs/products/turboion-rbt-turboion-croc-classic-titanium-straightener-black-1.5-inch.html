            <li>This is the best. . .EVER!</li>
            <li>I shopped around and found the best deal at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>Basically, the straightner was plugged in, and he held the power button for 10 seconds, it flashed, and then he turned it on - AND it works :D  </li>
            <li>The 1.5 inch plate is perfect for any hair length.</li>

            <li>I have a burnt smell now, lol.</li>
            <li>huge!!!</li>
            <li>This straightner is amazing!  </li>
            <li>But I do know that when this thing worked, it was amazing!  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled!  </li>
            <li>I have incredibly curly hair and it has been amazing.  </li>
            <li>The weight of the Croc and the perfect size is what makes it better than the rest I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Awesome job straightening my hair and easy to curve ends.  </li>
            <li>Great flatiron, better than a chi!</li>
            <li>She had purchased one at a hair show and just loved it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my croc straightner for about 1 1/2 years, and have loved it.</li>
            <li>(I kinda laughed as I asked)...</li>
            <li>I loved it until today.</li>
            <li>I had a Babyliss Pro Nano and its good</li>
            <li>I will attempt to exchange it, I hope this company has good customer service.</li>
            <li>I loved how the hand grips were b/c it helped apply the right pressure to obtain the tension needed to get the best results.</li>
            <li>It would have been great if they put in a better spring but</li>
            <li>and I really love this straightener!</li>
            <li>Love the bonus heat mat too!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>i love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite straighter ever!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>It went through my hair easily, and the swivel cord was great</li>
            <li>This straightener was a great choice for my hair because it&#x27;s a fine texture.  </li>
            <li>, today I asked my friend (who is a amazing and can fix almost anything)</li>
            <li>This is amazing.</li>
            <li>Another nice feature is that this iron will turn itself off after a period of time.</li>
            <li>I liked how it was straightening my hair</li>
            <li>so I was kind of dissappointed.</li>
            <li>, I will buy my own CROC as wellâ€¦</li>
            <li>She loved it better than her chi</li>
            <li>This one is just as good or better.  </li>
            <li>It would be very easy to upset a good customer that purchases many things from you, and have them go elsewhere.</li>
            <li>comfortable, heating element is great, easy on the hair shape is good.</li>
            <li>I had an old Cros and it lasted almost 5 years, it was amazing and the best straghtener ever!</li>
            <li>The iron has a nice design to it and is very comfortable and lightweight in the hand.</li>
            <li>Really happy and worth the money.</li>
            <li>The Croc is great b/c I can adjust the heat setting (making it higher for stubborn areas)</li>
            <li>I knew it was too good to be true for the price.</li>
            <li>I always get my hair trimmed so it stays healthy, so it is not because my my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But compared to top quality brands, its so-so.</li>
            <li>Like I said it does everything the reviews said and more.  </li>
            <li>and I like it better than my CHI - eventually</li>
            <li>because many times these items are rebuilt or refurbished.  </li>
            <li>Love this straightener</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that my Croc Straightner is working again.</li>
            <li>I am sure not every croc iron does this</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t touching it,</li>
            <li>I used K-Pack on the fried hair, and followed up with Redken Anti-Snap serum - it&#x27;s not restoredmy hair, but it&#x27;s better than it was.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>Love that it never burns my hair or leaves it smelling burnt.  </li>
            <li>I like it much better than the ceramic irons.  </li>
            <li>I would most definitly reccomend it.to.anyone</li>
            <li>A friend of mine had a croc and after using once I fell in love.</li>
            <li>but I so love this and love doing the smoothing treatment.</li>
            <li>but the Croc I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>Love the auto shut off.</li>
            <li>THEREFORE, YOU END UP PAYING A LOT MORE FOR THE STRAIGHTNER.</li>
            <li>They have more reviews on Ulta which I wish I had read.</li>
            <li>Nothing better on the market IMHO.</li>
            <li>I love this product it is the best flat iron I have ever had.</li>
            <li>Best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used, and</li>
            <li>I thought it was the best flat iron I ever use.</li>
            <li>This is the best flat iron out on the market.</li>
            <li>best flat iron ever!!</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a new flat iron this is the best one on the market and at a great price.</li>
            <li>When Chi became popular, they started mass producing their products and the quality quickly diminished.</li>
            <li>The digital display makes it easy to find the perfect setting for your hair and the design makes it easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love how fast it heats up and how superior the process.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money for sure!</li>
            <li>So far, my Croc straightner has been working GREAT, just like it did before.</li>
            <li>All the products I have purchased so far have been great.</li>
            <li>Also, it heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li>It is easy to hold and the cord swivels.  </li>
            <li>I used to cry from frustration when trying to straighten my hair with a blowdryer/brush, but with this, it was so easy.  </li>
            <li>(Also easy to bend a curl with this iron.)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to get on the site and delivery is prompt.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Handle is easy to hold&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not because it stops working, but because my daughters love it so much they each now have their own.  </li>
            <li>The instruction booklet says for my kind of hair 350 - 400 degrees should be fine, but that is way too hot.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best.</li>
            <li>For longer hair it would probably work fine though.</li>
            <li>Great product, came exactly as described in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly, and I love the adjustable temperature gauge.  </li>
            <li>When I looked at the crock, there was a huge chunk of fried hair on it.</li>
            <li>Maybe these people compared this iron to drugstore brands, or had smooth hair to begin with.</li>
            <li>My clients are amazed at how smooth and shiny their hair is with this iron.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job with my coarse wavy hair.</li>
            <li>had bought a cheap straightner at the drugstore.</li>
            <li>I am a cosmetologist and I needed an iron that would get to 450 degrees to do the simply smooth keratin treatment.</li>
            <li>While putting on my makeup, I heard the croc make the sound it makes when I turn it on.</li>
            <li>My best guess is that earlier, when I heard the beeping sound, it had started getting too warm, and turned itself off, then turning itself back on.</li>
            <li>The iron grips it securely.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the fact that I can control the temperature.</li>
            <li>So far so good though</li>
            <li>great flat iron.</li>
            <li>This is a great flat iron!  </li>
            <li>It heats quickly and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is truly a great product but does have a long lifetime.</li>
            <li>its super light.....</li>
            <li>Better than a chi by far. :)</li>
            <li>I am a stylist and this has been by far the best flat iron I have tried!!!&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>for smooth, straight hair!!</li>
            <li>I spent $150 on a chi a couple of years ago and thought it was a great straightener, but the chi has nothing on the croc.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve own a ton of straighteners over the years and this one by far beats them all.  </li>
            <li>Also I love how fast it heats up.</li>
            <li>I can syle my hair in half the time and it can also produce beautiful beach waves too.</li>
            <li>A coworker told me how good of a flat iron this was.</li>
            <li>Luckily when I purchased the item I completed the warranty card and submitted it to Croc.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so lucky to have a friend like him.</li>
            <li>COMPANY QUICK E WHO SENT IT</li>
            <li>She loves how quickly it gets done and has cut minutes off straightening her hair.  </li>
            <li>is super long&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair, and the Turboion Croc does a great job of making my hair very soft and stick straight.    </li>
            <li>but it slides easy and heats up fast.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this flat iron.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, but it&#x27;s very wavy</li>
            <li>It heats up super fast...gets super hot..... straightens the hair with one pass.....</li>
            <li>Best straightener ever for people with tones of tick heavy hair!!!</li>
            <li>I had a Chi that I used to smooth frizzies when my hair was straight, and it worked well for that, but as my hair became curlier</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too harsh on my hair and the fact i can control the temperature was also great.  </li>
            <li>This straightener Stop working after 3 months, worked great until then used it everyday.</li>
            <li>I had only a cheap one and wanted to upgrade and wanted the most for my money.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this flat iron 3 times now and love it!</li>
            <li>It can get hotter than the Chi, which is great for me, but for those people that don&#x27;t need such high heat it would work really well because it can also be set to a lower temperature.</li>
            <li>I bought this and didn&#x27;t use right away, because I had a blow-out.</li>
            <li>Croc Classic (I bought this at the recommendation of my stylist, who swears by the brand), with it&#x27;s easy to use temperature setting, has not failed yet.  </li>
            <li>This one does a pretty good job, but you have to be careful as to how hot you make it.</li>
            <li>The Croc heats up fast but the exterior stays cool.  </li>
            <li>It heats up super fast and turns itself off if you forget.</li>
            <li>Had a great flat iron but accidentally left it in a hotel.  </li>
            <li>One pass and straight!</li>
            <li>It looks/feels like it&#x27;s worth how much I paid for it.</li>
            <li>I have used Hot Tools, Kenta, and Hai, and this one beats them all.</li>
            <li>just have to make sure if you are using it for personal use</li>
            <li>After taking out a ponytail, my hair is still straight!</li>
            <li>I purchased the croc the first time I wanna say 3 years ago?</li>
            <li>and she recommended this exact model.</li>
            <li>It worked well at first, but after 6 months it died on my daughter.</li>
            <li>most models in this price range and even to about $150 all have the same problem.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways, she had gone through a handful of straighteners in our first four years of dating.  </li>
            <li>this is the first croc we ever owned and our first one broke and here in Hawaii</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, and this was the first iron that would actually smooth my hair like it had been done at the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It  heat up fast and shipping was right on time...</li>
            <li>this is a much better flat iron than the one I used before.</li>
            <li>I have used many flat irons in my lifetime.</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron!</li>
            <li>I actually bought this one as a gift because people are always wanting to borrow mine because it does such a good job on my hair.</li>
            <li>The iron is great for natural, African American hair.</li>
            <li>THE TUROION CROC CLASSIC TITANIUM HAD A LOUD, BUZZING SOUND WHEN PLUGGED IN.  </li>
            <li>If you own a standard flat iron - i.e. Hot Tools - what a difference upgrading makes!  </li>
            <li>With a little bit of heat protectant spray on first, I get a really nice finish on my hair.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, big handle.</li>
            <li>It heats up within seconds, has an extra long cord, does a fantastic job on my hair that holds all day, and all without causing any static at all.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t use it much</li>
            <li>and now I can have straight hair in about 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I spent many days and hours pouring over reviews and descriptions of hair straightening irons.  </li>
            <li>I would defintely recommend to anyone looking for a straight iron.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast</li>
            <li>It heats and curls really fast also.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair straight  </li>
            <li>really does make a difference.  </li>
            <li>It really does wonders.</li>
            <li>Had it for 2 years, I have not had problem and heats up fast and turns off automatically</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a well constructed flat iron this is a great little appliance.  </li>
            <li>As a stylist, I have used many other irons, including Chi.  </li>
            <li>I love it and all my other straighteners were put in the trash.</li>
            <li>My hair is normally very frizzy and curly and the Croc straightener works better than any other I have ever used!  </li>
            <li>This straightener did not work on it nearly as well as my Chi does, despite the fact that it gets to higher temperatures.  </li>
            <li>and so i purchased a new one!</li>
            <li>I had the croc classic straightener recommended to me by a hairdresser.</li>
            <li>It actually glides through my hair better than traditional ceramic plates.</li>
            <li>The digital temperature you can watch how quickly it heats up.</li>
            <li>Great straighter, after years of looking finally found one for my thick hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical of buying a new brand but could not have been more pleased with this choice.</li>
            <li>It is true that this flat iron heats up to 450 degress and cools down when shut off very quickly.</li>
            <li>Every bit worth the money, and this is my second one.</li>
            <li>I feel like this flat iron was definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>to self- when the spring breaks on this straightening iron, it&#x27;s time for a new one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;MY NEW BESTFRIEND</li>
            <li>My recommendation is, IF you want to purchase this item (and it is well worth the money), pay the extra money and get it directly from Croc.</li>
            <li>So I purchased this particular item because I have two daughters who frequently straighten their hair.</li>
            <li>definitely interested if someone else has experience with this in private apartments (as opposed to hotels) in the UK and/or France.</li>
            <li>and at first it was obvious.  </li>
            <li>My first one lasted me almost four years before it died and so I replaced it with the same model.</li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly and takes much less time to use than my old straightener.  </li>
            <li>Never have had any issues with either new or old straightener.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves it and it seems better than previous flat irons she used.</li>
            <li>, I only used it maybe around 10 times for the whole year</li>
            <li>I owned it, because I like my natural curl.</li>
            <li>pleas can any on tell me can i use it world wild ?</li>
            <li>However, when I contacted Croc they informed me that unless I purchased the item directly from them the warranty was void...especially if the item was purchased from Overstocked, Amazon, etc.</li>
            <li>The spring to open and close the iron stopped working about 6 months ago, but I adapted and kept using it, because I&#x27;m stubborn and wasn&#x27;t ready to fork out the dough unless I had</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think much of it, and later I proceeded to put the finishing touches on my hair, ie.</li>
            <li>It is very lightweight and heats up INSTANTLY.</li>
            <li>This makes my hair look soft and silky.</li>
            <li>My hair stays straight (even when it is pulled back into a ponytail).</li>
            <li>&amp; anyone.with wild hair....</li>
            <li>Professional used</li>
            <li>Your hair doesn&#x27;t have a burnt smell and still remained soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I immediately threw out my old straightener and have used this one exclusively since.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was a splurge for me, but so far it seems to be money well-invested!&lt;br /&gt;Yay</li>
            <li>It heats up very fast, has different settings so I can use it on my thick wavy hair and also on my daughters fine wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>Some of the people on here have said the item broke down quickly - hers has worked flawlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and live in a high humidity part of the country, and I have notices less frizz than with the Chi.</li>
            <li>It took me a while to finally order a new flat iron and much research.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the Chi flat iron with blue ceramic plates but saw a friend who&#x27;s hair is exactly like mine</li>
            <li>I will use no other iron than the Croc.  </li>
            <li>This flat iron not only leaves your hair bone straight</li>
            <li>I am highly dissatisfied and feel that this product should be removed from the advertisement, it simple did not last at all...</li>
            <li>You do have to be careful since the heat level on this guy is much different than Hot Tools...</li>
            <li>To Amazon I say, \\&quot;thank you\\&quot; for standing behind the product, but you may want to know more about the companies you are allowing to sell products under your name.  </li>
            <li>Well luckily Amazon allowed me to return it even if it was past the 30 day mark.</li>
            <li>only used this iron on it&#x27;s lowest setting (275 degrees), and I never above because I have naturally wavy hair with a semi-coarse texture, which is prone to breakage.</li>
            <li>Only flat iron that can really straighten my long think hair.  </li>
            <li>be careful though, too high of heat</li>
            <li>So for the past few days I&#x27;ve been using my old flat iron and there is a huge difference!</li>
            <li>I have only used it a few times, but so far it is working really well.</li>
            <li>This was only for a second, no more, because I quickly jerked the croc out of my hair, worried it might fry it.</li>
            <li>My hair used to be naturally straight, but over the course of a year and a half has become progressively curlier.</li>
            <li>The old one left my hair dry and frizzy.</li>

            <li> but a wonderful product...perfect every time...</li>
            <li> Great!</li>
            <li> This is the best. . .EVER!</li>
            <li> I shopped around and found the best deal at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Basically, the straightner was plugged in, and he held the power button for 10 seconds, it flashed, and then he turned it on - AND it works :D  </li>
            <li> The 1.5 inch plate is perfect for any hair length.</li>
            <li> Great buy!!</li>
            <li> Best straightener ever!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best straightening iron I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>

            <li> I am really happy with the purchase and the titanium</li>

            <li> at a cooler setting it does a great job.</li>
            <li> I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Great straightener, just not reliable.</li>
            <li> Still working great, she has had it for a while now.</li>
            <li> I have a burnt smell now, lol.</li>
            <li> huge!!!</li>
            <li> This straightner is amazing!  </li>
            <li> But I do know that when this thing worked, it was amazing!  </li>
            <li> I was thrilled!  </li>
            <li> I have incredibly curly hair and it has been amazing.  </li>
            <li> The weight of the Croc and the perfect size is what makes it better than the rest I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Awesome job straightening my hair and easy to curve ends.  </li>
            <li> Great flatiron, better than a chi!</li>
            <li> She had purchased one at a hair show and just loved it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my croc straightner for about 1 1/2 years, and have loved it.</li>
            <li> (I kinda laughed as I asked)...</li>
            <li> I loved it until today.</li>
            <li> I had a Babyliss Pro Nano and its good</li>
            <li> I will attempt to exchange it, I hope this company has good customer service.</li>
            <li> I loved how the hand grips were b/c it helped apply the right pressure to obtain the tension needed to get the best results.</li>
            <li> It would have been great if they put in a better spring but</li>
            <li> and I really love this straightener!</li>
            <li> Love the bonus heat mat too!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> i love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite straighter ever!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this!</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> It went through my hair easily, and the swivel cord was great</li>
            <li> This straightener was a great choice for my hair because it&#x27;s a fine texture.  </li>
            <li> , today I asked my friend (who is a amazing and can fix almost anything)</li>
            <li> This is amazing.</li>
            <li> Another nice feature is that this iron will turn itself off after a period of time.</li>
            <li> I liked how it was straightening my hair</li>
            <li> so I was kind of dissappointed.</li>
            <li> , I will buy my own CROC as wellâ€¦</li>
            <li> She loved it better than her chi</li>
            <li> This one is just as good or better.  </li>
            <li> It would be very easy to upset a good customer that purchases many things from you, and have them go elsewhere.</li>
            <li> comfortable, heating element is great, easy on the hair shape is good.</li>
            <li> I had an old Cros and it lasted almost 5 years, it was amazing and the best straghtener ever!</li>
            <li> The iron has a nice design to it and is very comfortable and lightweight in the hand.</li>
            <li> Really happy and worth the money.</li>
            <li> The Croc is great b/c I can adjust the heat setting (making it higher for stubborn areas)</li>
            <li> I knew it was too good to be true for the price.</li>
            <li> I always get my hair trimmed so it stays healthy, so it is not because my my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But compared to top quality brands, its so-so.</li>
            <li> Like I said it does everything the reviews said and more.  </li>
            <li> and I like it better than my CHI - eventually</li>
            <li> because many times these items are rebuilt or refurbished.  </li>
            <li> Love this straightener</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that my Croc Straightner is working again.</li>
            <li> I am sure not every croc iron does this</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t touching it,</li>
            <li> I used K-Pack on the fried hair, and followed up with Redken Anti-Snap serum - it&#x27;s not restoredmy hair, but it&#x27;s better than it was.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> Love that it never burns my hair or leaves it smelling burnt.  </li>
            <li> I like it much better than the ceramic irons.  </li>
            <li> I would most definitly reccomend it.to.anyone</li>
            <li> A friend of mine had a croc and after using once I fell in love.</li>
            <li> but I so love this and love doing the smoothing treatment.</li>
            <li> but the Croc I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> Love the auto shut off.</li>
            <li> THEREFORE, YOU END UP PAYING A LOT MORE FOR THE STRAIGHTNER.</li>
            <li> They have more reviews on Ulta which I wish I had read.</li>
            <li> Nothing better on the market IMHO.</li>
            <li> I love this product it is the best flat iron I have ever had.</li>
            <li> Best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used, and</li>
            <li> I thought it was the best flat iron I ever use.</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron out on the market.</li>
            <li> best flat iron ever!!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a new flat iron this is the best one on the market and at a great price.</li>
            <li> When Chi became popular, they started mass producing their products and the quality quickly diminished.</li>
            <li> The digital display makes it easy to find the perfect setting for your hair and the design makes it easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love how fast it heats up and how superior the process.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money for sure!</li>
            <li> So far, my Croc straightner has been working GREAT, just like it did before.</li>
            <li> All the products I have purchased so far have been great.</li>
            <li> Also, it heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li> It is easy to hold and the cord swivels.  </li>
            <li> I used to cry from frustration when trying to straighten my hair with a blowdryer/brush, but with this, it was so easy.  </li>
            <li> (Also easy to bend a curl with this iron.)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to get on the site and delivery is prompt.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Handle is easy to hold&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not because it stops working, but because my daughters love it so much they each now have their own.  </li>
            <li> The instruction booklet says for my kind of hair 350 - 400 degrees should be fine, but that is way too hot.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best.</li>
            <li> For longer hair it would probably work fine though.</li>
            <li> Great product, came exactly as described in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly, and I love the adjustable temperature gauge.  </li>
            <li> When I looked at the crock, there was a huge chunk of fried hair on it.</li>
            <li> Maybe these people compared this iron to drugstore brands, or had smooth hair to begin with.</li>
            <li> My clients are amazed at how smooth and shiny their hair is with this iron.  </li>
            <li> It does a great job with my coarse wavy hair.</li>
            <li> had bought a cheap straightner at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> I am a cosmetologist and I needed an iron that would get to 450 degrees to do the simply smooth keratin treatment.</li>
            <li> While putting on my makeup, I heard the croc make the sound it makes when I turn it on.</li>
            <li> My best guess is that earlier, when I heard the beeping sound, it had started getting too warm, and turned itself off, then turning itself back on.</li>
            <li> The iron grips it securely.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the fact that I can control the temperature.</li>
            <li> So far so good though</li>
            <li> great flat iron.</li>
            <li> This is a great flat iron!  </li>
            <li> It heats quickly and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is truly a great product but does have a long lifetime.</li>
            <li> its super light.....</li>
            <li> Better than a chi by far. :)</li>
            <li> I am a stylist and this has been by far the best flat iron I have tried!!!&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> for smooth, straight hair!!</li>
            <li> I spent $150 on a chi a couple of years ago and thought it was a great straightener, but the chi has nothing on the croc.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve own a ton of straighteners over the years and this one by far beats them all.  </li>
            <li> Also I love how fast it heats up.</li>
            <li> I can syle my hair in half the time and it can also produce beautiful beach waves too.</li>
            <li> A coworker told me how good of a flat iron this was.</li>
            <li> Luckily when I purchased the item I completed the warranty card and submitted it to Croc.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so lucky to have a friend like him.</li>
            <li> COMPANY QUICK E WHO SENT IT</li>
            <li> She loves how quickly it gets done and has cut minutes off straightening her hair.  </li>
            <li> is super long&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair, and the Turboion Croc does a great job of making my hair very soft and stick straight.    </li>
            <li> but it slides easy and heats up fast.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, but it&#x27;s very wavy</li>
            <li> It heats up super fast...gets super hot..... straightens the hair with one pass.....</li>
            <li> Best straightener ever for people with tones of tick heavy hair!!!</li>
            <li> I had a Chi that I used to smooth frizzies when my hair was straight, and it worked well for that, but as my hair became curlier</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too harsh on my hair and the fact i can control the temperature was also great.  </li>
            <li> This straightener Stop working after 3 months, worked great until then used it everyday.</li>
            <li> I had only a cheap one and wanted to upgrade and wanted the most for my money.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this flat iron 3 times now and love it!</li>
            <li> It can get hotter than the Chi, which is great for me, but for those people that don&#x27;t need such high heat it would work really well because it can also be set to a lower temperature.</li>
            <li> I bought this and didn&#x27;t use right away, because I had a blow-out.</li>
            <li> Croc Classic (I bought this at the recommendation of my stylist, who swears by the brand), with it&#x27;s easy to use temperature setting, has not failed yet.  </li>
            <li> This one does a pretty good job, but you have to be careful as to how hot you make it.</li>
            <li> The Croc heats up fast but the exterior stays cool.  </li>
            <li> It heats up super fast and turns itself off if you forget.</li>
            <li> Had a great flat iron but accidentally left it in a hotel.  </li>
            <li> One pass and straight!</li>
            <li> It looks/feels like it&#x27;s worth how much I paid for it.</li>
            <li> I have used Hot Tools, Kenta, and Hai, and this one beats them all.</li>
            <li> just have to make sure if you are using it for personal use</li>
            <li> After taking out a ponytail, my hair is still straight!</li>
            <li> I purchased the croc the first time I wanna say 3 years ago?</li>
            <li> and she recommended this exact model.</li>
            <li> It worked well at first, but after 6 months it died on my daughter.</li>
            <li> most models in this price range and even to about $150 all have the same problem.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways, she had gone through a handful of straighteners in our first four years of dating.  </li>
            <li> this is the first croc we ever owned and our first one broke and here in Hawaii</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, and this was the first iron that would actually smooth my hair like it had been done at the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It  heat up fast and shipping was right on time...</li>
            <li> this is a much better flat iron than the one I used before.</li>
            <li> I have used many flat irons in my lifetime.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron!</li>
            <li> I actually bought this one as a gift because people are always wanting to borrow mine because it does such a good job on my hair.</li>
            <li> The iron is great for natural, African American hair.</li>
            <li> THE TUROION CROC CLASSIC TITANIUM HAD A LOUD, BUZZING SOUND WHEN PLUGGED IN.  </li>
            <li> If you own a standard flat iron - i.e. Hot Tools - what a difference upgrading makes!  </li>
            <li> With a little bit of heat protectant spray on first, I get a really nice finish on my hair.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, big handle.</li>
            <li> It heats up within seconds, has an extra long cord, does a fantastic job on my hair that holds all day, and all without causing any static at all.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t use it much</li>
            <li> and now I can have straight hair in about 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I spent many days and hours pouring over reviews and descriptions of hair straightening irons.  </li>
            <li> I would defintely recommend to anyone looking for a straight iron.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast</li>
            <li> It heats and curls really fast also.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair straight  </li>
            <li> really does make a difference.  </li>
            <li> It really does wonders.</li>
            <li> Had it for 2 years, I have not had problem and heats up fast and turns off automatically</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a well constructed flat iron this is a great little appliance.  </li>
            <li> As a stylist, I have used many other irons, including Chi.  </li>
            <li> I love it and all my other straighteners were put in the trash.</li>
            <li> My hair is normally very frizzy and curly and the Croc straightener works better than any other I have ever used!  </li>
            <li> This straightener did not work on it nearly as well as my Chi does, despite the fact that it gets to higher temperatures.  </li>
            <li> and so i purchased a new one!</li>
            <li> I had the croc classic straightener recommended to me by a hairdresser.</li>
            <li> It actually glides through my hair better than traditional ceramic plates.</li>
            <li> The digital temperature you can watch how quickly it heats up.</li>
            <li> Great straighter, after years of looking finally found one for my thick hair.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of buying a new brand but could not have been more pleased with this choice.</li>
            <li> It is true that this flat iron heats up to 450 degress and cools down when shut off very quickly.</li>
            <li> Every bit worth the money, and this is my second one.</li>
            <li> I feel like this flat iron was definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> to self- when the spring breaks on this straightening iron, it&#x27;s time for a new one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;MY NEW BESTFRIEND</li>
            <li> My recommendation is, IF you want to purchase this item (and it is well worth the money), pay the extra money and get it directly from Croc.</li>
            <li> So I purchased this particular item because I have two daughters who frequently straighten their hair.</li>
            <li> definitely interested if someone else has experience with this in private apartments (as opposed to hotels) in the UK and/or France.</li>
            <li> and at first it was obvious.  </li>
            <li> My first one lasted me almost four years before it died and so I replaced it with the same model.</li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly and takes much less time to use than my old straightener.  </li>
            <li> Never have had any issues with either new or old straightener.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it and it seems better than previous flat irons she used.</li>
            <li> , I only used it maybe around 10 times for the whole year</li>
            <li> I owned it, because I like my natural curl.</li>
            <li> pleas can any on tell me can i use it world wild ?</li>
            <li> However, when I contacted Croc they informed me that unless I purchased the item directly from them the warranty was void...especially if the item was purchased from Overstocked, Amazon, etc.</li>
            <li> The spring to open and close the iron stopped working about 6 months ago, but I adapted and kept using it, because I&#x27;m stubborn and wasn&#x27;t ready to fork out the dough unless I had</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think much of it, and later I proceeded to put the finishing touches on my hair, ie.</li>
            <li> It is very lightweight and heats up INSTANTLY.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair look soft and silky.</li>
            <li> My hair stays straight (even when it is pulled back into a ponytail).</li>
            <li> &amp; anyone.with wild hair....</li>
            <li> Professional used</li>
            <li> Your hair doesn&#x27;t have a burnt smell and still remained soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I immediately threw out my old straightener and have used this one exclusively since.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was a splurge for me, but so far it seems to be money well-invested!&lt;br /&gt;Yay</li>
            <li> It heats up very fast, has different settings so I can use it on my thick wavy hair and also on my daughters fine wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> Some of the people on here have said the item broke down quickly - hers has worked flawlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and live in a high humidity part of the country, and I have notices less frizz than with the Chi.</li>
            <li> It took me a while to finally order a new flat iron and much research.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the Chi flat iron with blue ceramic plates but saw a friend who&#x27;s hair is exactly like mine</li>
            <li> I will use no other iron than the Croc.  </li>
            <li> This flat iron not only leaves your hair bone straight</li>
            <li> I am highly dissatisfied and feel that this product should be removed from the advertisement, it simple did not last at all...</li>
            <li> You do have to be careful since the heat level on this guy is much different than Hot Tools...</li>
            <li> To Amazon I say, \\&quot;thank you\\&quot; for standing behind the product, but you may want to know more about the companies you are allowing to sell products under your name.  </li>
            <li> Well luckily Amazon allowed me to return it even if it was past the 30 day mark.</li>
            <li> only used this iron on it&#x27;s lowest setting (275 degrees), and I never above because I have naturally wavy hair with a semi-coarse texture, which is prone to breakage.</li>
            <li> Only flat iron that can really straighten my long think hair.  </li>
            <li> be careful though, too high of heat</li>
            <li> So for the past few days I&#x27;ve been using my old flat iron and there is a huge difference!</li>
            <li> I have only used it a few times, but so far it is working really well.</li>
            <li> This was only for a second, no more, because I quickly jerked the croc out of my hair, worried it might fry it.</li>
            <li> My hair used to be naturally straight, but over the course of a year and a half has become progressively curlier.</li>
            <li> The old one left my hair dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> It heats up really fast and gets my hair done in less then 10 mins!</li>
            <li> it gets to 450 F and based on my hair stylist who ahs this type of flat iron it will last for years.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY flat iron that, I have owned that has broke.  </li>
            <li> I tried over a dozen flat irons before I finally got my hands on one of these</li>
            <li> I had to order a new one less than 6 months ago and it just died this weekend.</li>
            <li> Some flat irons give you that shiney smoothness.</li>
            <li> and I would have to keep going over each section with my flat iron to straighten it.</li>
            <li> Got the flat iron for my sisters kids</li>
            <li> but they usually don&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> Our hairdresser recommended this flat iron after our Chi broke.  </li>
            <li> It just said croc classic, so Im not sure</li>
            <li> I was horrified, and stood there holding it, not sure what to do, when a loud pop came from the iron, and the titanium plates of the burst off, only dangling by the cords they were connected</li>
            <li> Total waste , I finally contacted Amazon to return it , they did take it back, but charged a restock fee of $16.90.</li>
            <li> lasted a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have very curly and thick hair</li>
            <li> and I did not want to as I assumed they were a waste of money and similar to your standard $20 flat irons.</li>
            <li> My hair length is just above my shoulders, and since the plates are 1.5 inches my hair is a little too short to curl well.</li>
            <li> so there is plenty of room to use the other plug above (or below) it.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to spend an extra $30 or so for the other one.</li>
            <li> Looks and works exactly as described...at least my wife thinks so!</li>
            <li> so I felt my hair turned out dry.</li>
            <li> It may only last a few months.  </li>
            <li> I have had several flat irons in the past Baby Bliss, Blue Sapphire and a Chi.  </li>
            <li> The only down side is the temperature setting is on the hand grip and when styling your fingers can slip over the temp set and change the setting or sometimes turn it off which can be a pain.</li>
            <li> I saw this in person at the local beauty supply for $150 and found it on Amazon for 1/3 less.</li>
            <li> its still the same price as it was before, wish it was a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and this iron works fast with what seems to be minimal damage.  </li>
            <li> to.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had this happen, never really fried my hair like this.</li>
            <li> A few seconds only.</li>
            <li> A waste of money buying these items on Amazon because the actual manufacturer will not honor the year warranty if purchased on amazon.</li>
            <li> Such a waste of money.</li>
            <li> the few times it did heat -total frizz!</li>
            <li> WTF right?</li>
            <li> girlfriend&#x27;s hair is LONG, THICK and RED.  </li>
            <li> But other than that, its just a plain flat iron.</li>
            <li> tried it on the other outlet in the house, it didn&#x27;t turn on!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had the iron set at 275 degrees (the lowest setting), no higher, which has never burned my hair.</li>
            <li> The manufacturer does not honor warranties from amazon.com (as well as other sites) as the stores selling this product are NOT authorized to do so.</li>
            <li> The only complaint about the Croc is that it does not hold the hair as tight as I would like so curling with this flat iron</li>
            <li> superhero-esque speed!&lt;br /&gt;It tames my thick, coarse hair like no iron I&#x27;ve tried before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As I did this, I noticed I was getting tons of resistance as I tried to pull the croc down my section of hair.</li>
            <li> WHEN IT BROKE DOWN.</li>
            <li> Smooths down my frizzies.</li>
            <li> I purchased the croc in February 2011 so less than a year ago.  </li>
            <li> she can do the kids hair in half the time</li>
            <li> I bought this product less than a year ago.  </li>
            <li> however Croc&#x27;s are supposed to be less damaging on the hair.  </li>
            <li> My previous T3 Duality did not work as well.</li>
            <li> long and hard about it.  </li>
            <li> I turn temp down a little so not to damage my hair.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve got long, thick hair - this is the straightener for you.</li>
            <li> I am humbled and warn others not to buy this product until this company changes a few of their policies and product design.  </li>
            <li> I contacted Amazon who told me that the order was not filled by them but by Beauty One.  </li>
            <li> it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> But obviously no one wants a tool to \\&quot;crap</li>
            <li> I also have a double cowlick on the back of my head that likes to make a tight ugly wave around it.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair, and I use the iron at 450 degrees, after I blow dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not sure if it even matters.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, heavy hair.</li>
            <li> Another thing I like about it is that it uses a small plug (as opposed to a box)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m going to take the chance and buy another croc or go with another company.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I want to do...</li>
            <li> but I have read the reviews about how this has happened in the past...</li>
            <li> and you will burn your pretty hair :(</li>
            <li> Too late.</li>
            <li> I have thick silky hair and she has thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> I live in Hawaii where the humidity is crazy, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems with my hair frizzing out even if I work out!  </li>
            <li> I have even recommended it to friends, however, this past week it just stopped working!  </li>
            <li> I have previously owned one and found that the cord at the base tends to get a short in it.</li>
            <li> I received it in May 2011, and on April 26, 2012 it SHOT OFF ON ME while I was done with half of my hair!!!</li>
            <li> This is not a good product.</li>
            <li> I am greatly disappointed in the fact that I had it for less than half a year.</li>
            <li> In the middle of me using it, it just quit and will not restart :(</li>
            <li> It worked perfectly on my thick and curly hair!  </li>
            <li> I have very thick and curly hair</li>
            <li> I was confused. .</li>
            <li> Not a happy camper.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad because this company almost had me as a lifelong customer!</li>
            <li> So suddenly my $75 flat iron was worthless.  </li>
            <li> (Sorry Amazon)  </li>
            <li> so it did get all twisted up.  </li>
            <li> So I have weird curly, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I had another hair straightener before and it SHOT OFF on me in less than a year, now I am so disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> its 220v iam afraid if i use it here it will burn the iron</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong!  </li>
            <li> but I was wrong!</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the bad reviews on here.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> it gets to 450 F and based on my hair stylist who ahs this type of flat iron it will last for years.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this flat iron. It is digital so I can control the heat with the press of a button. Also, it heats up very quickly. Another nice feature is that this iron will turn itself off after a period of time. I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this iron two months ago through Amazon (Turboion will not recognize products bought through this site).  It worked perfectly on my thick and curly hair!  I was thrilled!  I even recommended it to others who went out and purchased this product.  Now I am panicking because the unit will not heat up.  It turns to \\&quot;69\\&quot;, then shows an \\&quot;err\\&quot; message and turns off.  I have been searching the web for a troubleshooting guide to help me fix it.  I emailed the company....let&#x27;s see what they say \\&quot;if\\&quot; they get back to me.  I was convinced this would never happen to me.  I am humbled and warn others not to buy this product until this company changes a few of their policies and product design.  It&#x27;s too bad because this company almost had me as a lifelong customer! Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> If you own a standard flat iron - i.e. Hot Tools - what a difference upgrading makes!  You do have to be careful since the heat level on this guy is much different than Hot Tools...but a wonderful product...perfect every time...oh and spend the extra and get the carrying sack....Great!</li>
            <li> I purchased the croc in February 2011 so less than a year ago.  I have incredibly curly hair and it has been amazing.  I have even recommended it to friends, however, this past week it just stopped working!  Didn&#x27;t drop it, nothing happened, just wouldn&#x27;t turn on.  I even tried different outlets around my house in a panic with a hairful of frizz!  $80 + dollars for a teacher is a lot of money to spend, and I&#x27;d like to contact the company to complain!  Anyone know how I could do that?  I saved the Amazon email confirmation but not the box! : (  So disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I liked how it was straightening my hair but it started to now straightening my hair well enough when my hair became longer. I always get my hair trimmed so it stays healthy, so it is not because my my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t use it much, I only used it maybe around 10 times for the whole year I owned it, because I like my natural curl. I only used this hair straightener around 10 times just to look different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I received it in May 2011, and on April 26, 2012 it SHOT OFF ON ME while I was done with half of my hair!!! so I didn&#x27;t know what to do with my hair!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on the other outlet in the house, it didn&#x27;t turn on!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I had another hair straightener before and it SHOT OFF on me in less than a year, now I am so disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> This is not a good product. It fell apart after only two months. I am highly dissatisfied and feel that this product should be removed from the advertisement, it simple did not last at all...</li>
            <li> It is true that this flat iron heats up to 450 degress and cools down when shut off very quickly. But other than that, its just a plain flat iron. The plates aren&#x27;t ceramic coated so I felt my hair turned out dry. Some flat irons give you that shiney smoothness. I read all of these reviews before purchasing so I was kind of dissappointed. Maybe these people compared this iron to drugstore brands, or had smooth hair to begin with. But compared to top quality brands, its so-so. I knew it was too good to be true for the price. Great seller though.</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener a couple of months ago and I don&#x27;t know how I lived without it!  I spent $150 on a chi a couple of years ago and thought it was a great straightener, but the chi has nothing on the croc.  I have fine hair, but it&#x27;s very wavy and now I can have straight hair in about 10 minutes.  I live in Hawaii where the humidity is crazy, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems with my hair frizzing out even if I work out!  This is the best. . .EVER!</li>
            <li> I bought this because my hair stylist recommended it. It heats up super fast and turns itself off if you forget. It straightens my curly hair in one swipe. I like how you can adjust the temperature so you can do touch-up straightening on a lower setting. I feel like this flat iron was definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> As a stylist, I have used many other irons, including Chi.  I will use no other iron than the Croc.  My clients are amazed at how smooth and shiny their hair is with this iron.  One pass and straight!</li>
            <li> I spent many days and hours pouring over reviews and descriptions of hair straightening irons.  I had only a cheap one and wanted to upgrade and wanted the most for my money.  This has been everything the reviews said!  It heats up very fast, has different settings so I can use it on my thick wavy hair and also on my daughters fine wavy hair.  It curls and straightens and the style lasts all day!  It is easy to hold and the cord swivels.  It remembers your last setting.  Like I said it does everything the reviews said and more.  I would defintely recommend to anyone looking for a straight iron.</li>
            <li> I have only used it a few times, but so far it is working really well. My hair used to be naturally straight, but over the course of a year and a half has become progressively curlier. I had a Chi that I used to smooth frizzies when my hair was straight, and it worked well for that, but as my hair became curlier it became resistant to straightening and I would have to keep going over each section with my flat iron to straighten it. The Croc is great b/c I can adjust the heat setting (making it higher for stubborn areas) so that I don&#x27;t have to keep going over the same section over and over. It can get hotter than the Chi, which is great for me, but for those people that don&#x27;t need such high heat it would work really well because it can also be set to a lower temperature. My hair length is just above my shoulders, and since the plates are 1.5 inches my hair is a little too short to curl well. For longer hair it would probably work fine though. I need it for straightening so the wider plates make it easier for me. So far so good though and I really love this straightener!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve own a ton of straighteners over the years and this one by far beats them all.  I can syle my hair in half the time and it can also produce beautiful beach waves too.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product 3 times now.  Not because it stops working, but because my daughters love it so much they each now have their own.  Heats up fast and I like it better than my CHI - eventually, I will buy my own CROC as wellâ€¦.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are hoping it works with a plug adapter overseas this yearâ€¦. definitely interested if someone else has experience with this in private apartments (as opposed to hotels) in the UK and/or France.</li>
            <li> Got the flat iron for my sisters kids and she loves it she can do the kids hair in half the time and it&#x27;s leaves there hair sleek, shine. It  heat up fast and shipping was right on time...</li>
            <li> I bought this product less than a year ago.  I have had several flat irons in the past Baby Bliss, Blue Sapphire and a Chi.  This is the ONLY flat iron that, I have owned that has broke.  This product abandoned me on Christmas Eve:&#x27;(...... Not impressed! BEWARE.....</li>
            <li> My hairstylist recommended the Croc when I had my hair done. I shopped around and found the best deal at Amazon.com. I love this product it is the best flat iron I have ever had. It heats up within seconds, has an extra long cord, does a fantastic job on my hair that holds all day, and all without causing any static at all. If you are looking for a new flat iron this is the best one on the market and at a great price.</li>
            <li> pleas can any on tell me can i use it world wild ? iam out side the us now in kuwait its 220v iam afraid if i use it here it will burn the iron</li>
            <li> Great product, came exactly as described in a very timely manner. Love the bonus heat mat too!</li>
            <li> This is a great flat iron!  I have very thick hair, and I use the iron at 450 degrees, after I blow dry my hair.  With a little bit of heat protectant spray on first, I get a really nice finish on my hair.  Best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve used several.</li>
            <li> I was told about this product from my hair dresser.  She had purchased one at a hair show and just loved it.  I have very curly hair, and the Turboion Croc does a great job of making my hair very soft and stick straight.    I purchased this item from Amazon back in October.  It died in December.  Luckily when I purchased the item I completed the warranty card and submitted it to Croc.  This is something I almost never do, but for some reason I completed the card as instructed and mailed it in.  When the item died, I had no concerns because I knew it would be replaced.  However, when I contacted Croc they informed me that unless I purchased the item directly from them the warranty was void...especially if the item was purchased from Overstocked, Amazon, etc. because many times these items are rebuilt or refurbished.  I contacted Amazon who told me that the order was not filled by them but by Beauty One.  I was confused. . .I thought I was buying it from Amazon.  So I contacted Beautyone.  When I contacted them, they told me they only offered a 30 day warranty on the item.  So suddenly my $75 flat iron was worthless.  I went back to Amazon who in the end did replace this item.    My recommendation is, IF you want to purchase this item (and it is well worth the money), pay the extra money and get it directly from Croc. (Sorry Amazon)  If you find it cheaper on line (especially from Beauty One)think long and hard about it.  It may only last a few months.  To Amazon I say, \\&quot;thank you\\&quot; for standing behind the product, but you may want to know more about the companies you are allowing to sell products under your name.  It would be very easy to upset a good customer that purchases many things from you, and have them go elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I used to cry from frustration when trying to straighten my hair with a blowdryer/brush, but with this, it was so easy.  It went through my hair easily, and the swivel cord was great so it did get all twisted up.  Heats up quickly, and I love the adjustable temperature gauge.  It looks/feels like it&#x27;s worth how much I paid for it.</li>
            <li> This straightner is amazing!  It straightens the hair with just one pass through. The iron is great for natural, African American hair.</li>
            <li> Love this straightener</li>
            <li> This works great but they usually don&#x27;t last long.  I&#x27;ve had to replace mine about once a year because they tend to break, but I&#x27;ve bought 3 in a row because they straighten well.  This one is supposed to be a turboion croc, but the one that came didnt&#x27; say that on the straightner.  It just said croc classic, so Im not sure if I got the turboion or not.  i&#x27;m not sure if it even matters.  this straightner straigtens well.  I hope it lasts...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my croc straightner for about 1 1/2 years, and have loved it. It does a great job with my coarse wavy hair. But recently, it starting saying err or 069 and then shutting off. I was so frustrated and disappointed, and I almost threw it away. I looked everywhere for a solution, reset button or manual for it. Couldn&#x27;t find it :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, today I asked my friend (who is a amazing and can fix almost anything)...I asked him if he could fix my straightner (I kinda laughed as I asked)...He said \\&quot;yeah.\\&quot;  Well, It took him a couple of minutes. Basically, the straightner was plugged in, and he held the power button for 10 seconds, it flashed, and then he turned it on - AND it works :D  I&#x27;m so excited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had bought a cheap straightner at the drugstore. It was a piece of crap that was FRYING my hair. I&#x27;m so glad that my Croc Straightner is working again. I&#x27;m so lucky to have a friend like him. He fixes all kinds of stuff for me :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway....If your croc straightner does this, just reset it. So far, my Croc straightner has been working GREAT, just like it did before. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this flat iron 3 times now and love it!</li>
            <li> I have course, curly hair.  This straightener did not work on it nearly as well as my Chi does, despite the fact that it gets to higher temperatures.  It is not &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; enough for my hair type.</li>
            <li> I wish i purchased this straightener earlier...it is amazing!! It heats up super fast...gets super hot..... straightens the hair with one pass..... its super light.....i love it!</li>
            <li> (Using my hubby&#x27;s account to write my review) I have had my croc iron for 4 months. I loved it until today. I am greatly disappointed in the fact that I had it for less than half a year. I am a cosmetologist and I needed an iron that would get to 450 degrees to do the simply smooth keratin treatment. I loved how the hand grips were b/c it helped apply the right pressure to obtain the tension needed to get the best results. But obviously no one wants a tool to \\&quot;crap out\\&quot; on them that soon! I am sure not every croc iron does this but since I got it through amazon I guess I dont have the 1 yr warranty. I will not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend had told me to purchase these and I did not want to as I assumed they were a waste of money and similar to your standard $20 flat irons. Boy was I wrong!  I make it to the beauty shop rather seldom and at first it was obvious.  The way these irons hit my hair, you cannot tell at all.  It heats and curls really fast also.</li>
            <li> I had this iron for 4 years, but when it finally broke, it fried a chunk of my hair. The spring to open and close the iron stopped working about 6 months ago, but I adapted and kept using it, because I&#x27;m stubborn and wasn&#x27;t ready to fork out the dough unless I had to.&lt;br /&gt;I only used this iron on it&#x27;s lowest setting (275 degrees), and I never above because I have naturally wavy hair with a semi-coarse texture, which is prone to breakage. I also have a double cowlick on the back of my head that likes to make a tight ugly wave around it. One morning, after I had already used the croc, I began putting on makeup, but I left the croc on so I could come back to make any finishing touches before I left the house. While putting on my makeup, I heard the croc make the sound it makes when I turn it on. It was laying on the counter and I wasn&#x27;t touching it, and I knew I hadn&#x27;t turned it off. I didn&#x27;t think much of it, and later I proceeded to put the finishing touches on my hair, ie. my double cowlick. As I did this, I noticed I was getting tons of resistance as I tried to pull the croc down my section of hair. This was only for a second, no more, because I quickly jerked the croc out of my hair, worried it might fry it. Too late. When I looked at the crock, there was a huge chunk of fried hair on it. I was horrified, and stood there holding it, not sure what to do, when a loud pop came from the iron, and the titanium plates of the burst off, only dangling by the cords they were connected to.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had this happen, never really fried my hair like this. My best guess is that earlier, when I heard the beeping sound, it had started getting too warm, and turned itself off, then turning itself back on. I had the iron set at 275 degrees (the lowest setting), no higher, which has never burned my hair. I figure it continued to overheat, and when I put it on my hair, it fried it. I used K-Pack on the fried hair, and followed up with Redken Anti-Snap serum - it&#x27;s not restoredmy hair, but it&#x27;s better than it was.&lt;br /&gt;Note to self- when the spring breaks on this straightening iron, it&#x27;s time for a new one. Don&#x27;t wait, or the croc will come back to bite ya!</li>
            <li> This straightener was a great choice for my hair because it&#x27;s a fine texture.  It&#x27;s not too harsh on my hair and the fact i can control the temperature was also great.  Love that it never burns my hair or leaves it smelling burnt.  the plates still look as if i just purchased it yesterday.</li>
            <li> I saw this in person at the local beauty supply for $150 and found it on Amazon for 1/3 less. It is very lightweight and heats up INSTANTLY. The 1.5 inch plate is perfect for any hair length. The iron has a nice design to it and is very comfortable and lightweight in the hand. I have thick, heavy hair. The iron grips it securely. Another thing I like about it is that it uses a small plug (as opposed to a box) so there is plenty of room to use the other plug above (or below) it. I have used Hot Tools, Kenta, and Hai, and this one beats them all. Gets my heavy waves poker straight. (Also easy to bend a curl with this iron.)</li>
            <li> Our hairdresser recommended this flat iron after our Chi broke.  My daughter loves it and it seems better than previous flat irons she used.</li>
            <li> I am a stylist and this has been by far the best flat iron I have tried!!!&lt;br /&gt;You just have to make sure if you are using it for personal use you set the heat settings accordingly!</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron! I actually bought this one as a gift because people are always wanting to borrow mine because it does such a good job on my hair. It&#x27;s worth the money for sure!</li>
            <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve been using this product now for about a month. Leaves my hair straight  I&#x27;m an African american who haven&#x27;t had a perm in about a year. This makes my hair look soft and silky. Great buy!!</li>
            <li> I had the croc classic straightener recommended to me by a hairdresser. I was strictly a Chi user for well over 10 years before this purchase. When Chi became popular, they started mass producing their products and the quality quickly diminished. I was skeptical of buying a new brand but could not have been more pleased with this choice. My hair stays straight (even when it is pulled back into a ponytail). I don&#x27;t feel like I am frying my hair with the titanium plates. It actually glides through my hair better than traditional ceramic plates. I have very curly hair and live in a high humidity part of the country, and I have notices less frizz than with the Chi. I highly recommend this product. If you&#x27;re only accustomed to ceramic, give titanium a try.</li>
            <li> Best straightener ever!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It took me a while to finally order a new flat iron and much research.  I am really happy with the purchase and the titanium really does make a difference.  I like it much better than the ceramic irons.  I have very thick hair and this iron works fast with what seems to be minimal damage.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product, does everything as advertised. The only down side is the temperature setting is on the hand grip and when styling your fingers can slip over the temp set and change the setting or sometimes turn it off which can be a pain.</li>
            <li> this is a much better flat iron than the one I used before. The old one left my hair dry and frizzy. This one does a pretty good job, but you have to be careful as to how hot you make it. The instruction booklet says for my kind of hair 350 - 400 degrees should be fine, but that is way too hot. It did frizz up my ends. at a cooler setting it does a great job. Also I love how fast it heats up. A few seconds only. I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is the best straightening iron I&#x27;ve ever used.  I absolutely love how fast it heats up and how superior the process.  After taking out a ponytail, my hair is still straight!</li>
            <li> This straightner is ahhhhmaZing...i have curly nappy hair.and this doea wonders ..I would most definitly reccomend it.to.anyone who straightens their hair daily.&amp; anyone.with wild hair....best straightner ever</li>
            <li> I have used many flat irons in my lifetime. This one takes the cake. Hands down the best. Professional used but I have it at home. Wonderful. You don&#x27;t need to spend an extra $30 or so for the other one. This is amazing.</li>
            <li> I did research because I have a Chi however Croc&#x27;s are supposed to be less damaging on the hair.  I gave it as a gift and was told it worked wonderfully.  Your hair doesn&#x27;t have a burnt smell and still remained soft and shiny.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, big handle. It&#x27;s know longer necessary to burn your hair while trying to look presentable. Great product.</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener after it was recommended to me by my stylist. My hair is normally very frizzy and curly and the Croc straightener works better than any other I have ever used!  It heats up very quickly and takes much less time to use than my old straightener.  I love it!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite straighter ever! It was recommended to me by my Bestfriend who works for Aveda (Hair Salon) because this is what they were using at the time. I have very thick and curly hair and I never thought in a million years that I&#x27;d find a straighter that worked for me but I was wrong! I purchased the croc the first time I wanna say 3 years ago? and it has lasted me up until 5 months ago and the only reason why it stopped working was because i broke it by dropping it on the floor a couple of times.. the plate came out, I even at one point glued the plate back in and it still worked!!!! I think it was time for me to let it go.. and so i purchased a new one! I can&#x27;t wait to get it. It really does wonders.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine had a croc and after using once I fell in love. I immediately threw out my old straightener and have used this one exclusively since. Better than a chi by far. :)</li>
            <li> Only flat iron that can really straighten my long think hair.  I turn temp down a little so not to damage my hair. Especially around face.</li>
            <li> So I have weird curly, frizzy hair. I used to get it chemically straightened every 6 months but I just had a baby and am still nursing so I haven&#x27;t had my hair straightened since September 2009. So that means I&#x27;ve been ironing my hair out for quite some time. I have been using the Chi flat iron with blue ceramic plates but saw a friend who&#x27;s hair is exactly like mine and she recommended this exact model. I ordered it and was amazed!!! I WAS AMAZED AGAIN ABOUT 32 DAYS LATER WHEN IT BROKE DOWN. I turned it on and the temperature is set to 350 but then went to 069 and then ERR and then it turned off. WTF right? Well luckily Amazon allowed me to return it even if it was past the 30 day mark. So for the past few days I&#x27;ve been using my old flat iron and there is a huge difference! huge!!!! I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m going to take the chance and buy another croc or go with another company. I&#x27;m not sure what I want to do...But I do know that when this thing worked, it was amazing!  My friend&#x27;s croc is still functioning after a year of getting it but I have read the reviews about how this has happened in the past...arghhhhhh.</li>
            <li> I have previously owned one and found that the cord at the base tends to get a short in it. I had to replace the one I had because of this but I so love this and love doing the smoothing treatment. This is not intended for styling the hair it is only for the straightening/smoothing systems.</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter for xmas. She loved it better than her chi</li>
            <li> All the products I have purchased so far have been great. I have recommended this site to all of my friends and family. It&#x27;s easy to get on the site and delivery is prompt.</li>
            <li> Awesome job straightening my hair and easy to curve ends.  Smooths down my frizzies.</li>
            <li> Had it for 2 years, I have not had problem and heats up fast and turns off automatically</li>
            <li> I have very curly and thick hair this iron does the job. I usally take about 2 hours to straighten my hair but with this iron my done in about 45 minutes. I love it and all my other straighteners were put in the trash.</li>
            <li> A coworker told me how good of a flat iron this was. I had a Babyliss Pro Nano and its good but the Croc I&#x27;m in love. The digital temperature you can watch how quickly it heats up.This flat iron not only leaves your hair bone straight but the shine is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY NEW BESTFRIEND</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this! It heats up really fast and gets my hair done in less then 10 mins! I Completly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> ordered this for my wife before.  it lasted 5 years!  it finally took a dump and so she ordered another one.  great flat iron.</li>
            <li> It worked well at first, but after 6 months it died on my daughter.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a well constructed flat iron this is a great little appliance.  The digital display makes it easy to find the perfect setting for your hair and the design makes it easy to hold and use. The Croc heats up fast but the exterior stays cool.  The only complaint about the Croc is that it does not hold the hair as tight as I would like so curling with this flat iron takes some getting used to.  It would have been great if they put in a better spring but most models in this price range and even to about $150 all have the same problem.  The weight of the Croc and the perfect size is what makes it better than the rest I have tried.  My previous T3 Duality did not work as well.</li>
            <li> Great straighter, after years of looking finally found one for my thick hair. Love the auto shut off. That&#x27;s from now on, a must have. Really happy and worth the money.</li>
            <li> This straightener worked wonders on my and my daughter&#x27;s hair. I have thick silky hair and she has thick curly hair. The only problem is, it just quit after 6 months. Great straightener, just not reliable.</li>
            <li> Looks and works exactly as described...at least my wife thinks so!</li>
            <li> Best straightener ever for people with tones of tick heavy hair!!!</li>
            <li> This is my second croc. I have never had problems with either one. I really enjoy the fact that I can control the temperature. It heats quickly and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> She uses it all the time, and has had no problems with it. Still working great, she has had it for a while now. She stated she would never return to Chi she would use the Croc from here on out!</li>
            <li> THE TUROION CROC CLASSIC TITANIUM HAD A LOUD, BUZZING SOUND WHEN PLUGGED IN.  VERY ANNOYING.  COMPANY QUICK E WHO SENT IT, DOES NOT PAY FOR YOU TO HAVE IT SHIPPED BACK.  THEREFORE, YOU END UP PAYING A LOT MORE FOR THE STRAIGHTNER.</li>
            <li> Had a great flat iron but accidentally left it in a hotel.  This one is just as good or better.  Like the digital display and the automatic shut off.  Fits in my hand and Handles well.</li>
            <li> So I purchased this particular item because I have two daughters who frequently straighten their hair. This is truly a great product but does have a long lifetime. I used this item for six months and it read an error code 69 and would no longer stay on. A waste of money buying these items on Amazon because the actual manufacturer will not honor the year warranty if purchased on amazon. Such a waste of money. Amazon then tried to resolve the issue but ended up charging me a restocking fee for an item that no longer works. Ridiculous!!!! Not a happy camper.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend last Christmas - so this is coming from a different point of view.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend&#x27;s hair is LONG, THICK and RED.  Yes, I realize the color of her hair may be insignificant to you, but if you&#x27;re dating a redhead, then it means everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, she had gone through a handful of straighteners in our first four years of dating.  A couple broke, and others just didn&#x27;t work well enough.  Because of her hair&#x27;s length and volume, it would take her a while to finish the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Croc Classic (I bought this at the recommendation of my stylist, who swears by the brand), with it&#x27;s easy to use temperature setting, has not failed yet.  She loves how quickly it gets done and has cut minutes off straightening her hair.  Some of the people on here have said the item broke down quickly - hers has worked flawlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve got long, thick hair - this is the straightener for you.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast&lt;br /&gt;Cord is super long&lt;br /&gt;Handle is easy to hold&lt;br /&gt;Would buy it again&lt;br /&gt;Best one I have ever had.</li>
            <li> This straightener Stop working after 3 months, worked great until then used it everyday. I thought it was the best flat iron I ever use. I will never buy this straightener again it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> AWFUL They have more reviews on Ulta which I wish I had read. I bought this and didn&#x27;t use right away, because I had a blow-out. When I went to use it -it wouldn&#x27;t stay on the minute it moved off it went. It&#x27; would buzz / ring but not heat. Total waste , I finally contacted Amazon to return it , they did take it back, but charged a restock fee of $16.90. Don&#x27;t buy-save your money!! Wish I did!! :(&lt;br /&gt;Plus the few times it did heat -total frizz!</li>
            <li> best flat iron ever!! this is the first croc we ever owned and our first one broke and here in Hawaii we could not find it anywhere :( finally we looked on here, and there it was!! its still the same price as it was before, wish it was a little cheaper. but it slides easy and heats up fast. be careful though, too high of heat and you will burn your pretty hair :( I have a burnt smell now, lol.</li>
            <li> Great flatiron, better than a chi!</li>
            <li> I tried over a dozen flat irons before I finally got my hands on one of these and once I did, I realized I&#x27;d never use anything else ever again. Nothing better on the market IMHO. The plates glide over your hair without ever pulling and seal the strands rather than scorching them like others have a tendency to do. Every bit worth the money, and this is my second one. My first one lasted me almost four years before it died and so I replaced it with the same model. I have naturally curly hair, and this was the first iron that would actually smooth my hair like it had been done at the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I can&#x27;t imagine ever using anything else, ever again. This is the best!</li>
            <li> comfortable, heating element is great, easy on the hair shape is good. lasted a long time.  would recommend to others</li>
            <li> The manufacturer does not honor warranties from amazon.com (as well as other sites) as the stores selling this product are NOT authorized to do so. I purchased this iron, it did not work and the amazon store I purchased it from (Northeast) would not replace or refund my money, and neither will the Croc manufacturer.</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron out on the market.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Crocs are the best!!!</li>
            <li> Works great on my hair! I bought one for myself 3 years ago and the same for my mom this year.  Never have had any issues with either new or old straightener.</li>
            <li> This thing heats up with superhero-esque speed!&lt;br /&gt;It tames my thick, coarse hair like no iron I&#x27;ve tried before.&lt;br /&gt;It was a splurge for me, but so far it seems to be money well-invested!&lt;br /&gt;Yay for smooth, straight hair!!</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the bad reviews on here. I had an old Cros and it lasted almost 5 years, it was amazing and the best straghtener ever! I had to order a new one less than 6 months ago and it just died this weekend. In the middle of me using it, it just quit and will not restart :( I will attempt to exchange it, I hope this company has good customer service.</li>
