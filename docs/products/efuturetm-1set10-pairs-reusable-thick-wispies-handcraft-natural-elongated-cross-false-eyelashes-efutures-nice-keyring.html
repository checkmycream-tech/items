            <li>Product is cheap plastic lashes theyre not demi whisppies , they look like strippers eyelashes.</li>

            <li>Way better than I expected, not soft at all, very stiff, but they look amazing</li>
            <li>and the lash bands themselves were very straight and long.</li>
            <li>I will probably use to dress up my 9 yr old nieces.</li>
            <li>The lashes are long and pretty and look just like the picture.</li>
            <li>I tried using natural hair lashes, but they are like natural hair - a pain.  </li>
            <li>I love these lashes, but they didn&#x27;t come in the cute heart shape box tho :(.</li>
            <li>They are extremely hard to bend around to make them fit</li>
            <li>The lash band on these lashes are pretty thick, so get ready to use a liquid liner to help hide it....</li>

            <li> I love these lashes, they don&#x27;t have no sticky adhesives on it, the false lashes crisscrosses just how I like it!</li>
            <li> , not too long, not too short&lt;br /&gt;About</li>
            <li> I wear mine everyday and every few days gently pull off the built up adhesive.  </li>
            <li> I really like the look of these on, the criss-cross looks dramatic, but overly so.</li>
            <li> A little long, had to cut but</li>
            <li> Not what was expected AT ALL!</li>
            <li> Very delicate and doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> Not worth the wait for shipping.</li>
            <li> Stiff and not very flexible.</li>
            <li> I only found them hard to form to curve&lt;br /&gt;Other than that they are thick</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste ur money.</li>
            <li> I can wear one pair for, usually, 4-5 weeks.</li>
            <li> They are hard and stiff and pulled out my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Lift and are not very good i wouldn&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li> Lashes are so plastic and hard to bend to put on.</li>
            <li> very thick.</li>
            <li> Worse product ever.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying this, if you&#x27;ve never worn false ashes</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a waste of your money!!!!</li>
            <li> The material is plastic, and very poor quality and design.</li>
            <li> I like the keyring but the eyelashes failed horribly because they were way too stiff to be even usable.</li>
            <li> These lashes look very fake.</li>
            <li> These are horrible.  </li>
            <li> They are awful</li>

            <li> These are horrible.  They are hard and stiff and pulled out my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> These lashes look very fake. The material is plastic, and very poor quality and design. I have not even worn a pair, since I have received. I will probably use to dress up my 9 yr old nieces.</li>
            <li> Worse product ever. They are awful don&#x27;t buy these lashes. Lashes are so plastic and hard to bend to put on. Don&#x27;t buy them it&#x27;s a waste of your money!!!!</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time. They are okay. I personally didn&#x27;t care for the texture of them. They felt more like cheap plastic then soft and feather like. But the price was good for 10 pairs, they are a good buy. As cheap as I am, and the way I go through them, I&#x27;d probably buy them again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste ur money. They wouldn&#x27;t stay. I even tried w hair glue</li>
            <li> very thick. but strip did not have curve to eyelid like most eyelash strips do. Once I applied the glue I had to bend in order to properly apply. Took a few more seconds than typically would but all in all a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I only found them hard to form to curve&lt;br /&gt;Other than that they are thick</li>
            <li> A little long, had to cut but good quality</li>
            <li> Very delicate and doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> Gotta try there. Light weight and beautiful.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly, as described.</li>
            <li> The length of the lashes (the hair) is perfect, not too long, not too short&lt;br /&gt;About how wide they are, they&#x27;re perfect because they cover your eye completely and if they don&#x27;t you can always trim them</li>
            <li> Good value. My daughter used these for winter guard shows and they were just what she needed.</li>
            <li> Love these lashes! :)</li>
            <li> I like the keyring but the eyelashes failed horribly because they were way too stiff to be even usable.</li>
            <li> Love these eyelashes!  Look very natural and easy to use.  I wear mine everyday and every few days gently pull off the built up adhesive.  I can wear one pair for, usually, 4-5 weeks.</li>
            <li> Do not buy these. They are extremely hard to bend around to make them fit</li>
            <li> Great Price, Great Item</li>
            <li> Good quality.  Will repurchase.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product! Easy to use and wear.  The lashes are reusable.  I trim mine to fit my eyes.  Going to purchase some more. The only con is the wait-took about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I love these lashes, but they didn&#x27;t come in the cute heart shape box tho :(. The lashes are long and pretty and look just like the picture. The shipping time was okay. They came sooner than the shipping date  so that&#x27;s always good.  I bought them from school and I can&#x27;t wait to use them! :)</li>
            <li> Even though I never receive a key ring with my order, I&#x27;m still pretty satisfied with my item! I love these lashes, they don&#x27;t have no sticky adhesives on it, the false lashes crisscrosses just how I like it! I just have to trim it before applying glue and I can bend it to adjust how I&#x27;ll like them on my lids. I got my item within 6days of ordering. I will def continue to purchase more and the product is exactly like the picture advertised!</li>
            <li> In my pics I stacked 2 pairs on , but anyways I love them so much they are Beautiful and soft üíïüòç will buy them agenüôå</li>
            <li> These did nothing for me. They look the same as if I just put on some mascara. if you want beautiful lashes that make a difference, buy Ardel wispies. Those are the best ones!!</li>
            <li> These have been my favorite lashes.  Easy to use and realistic looking.  I tried using natural hair lashes, but they are like natural hair - a pain.  These look good and the glue washes off easily so you can use them multiple times.</li>
            <li> I bought three sets thinking that it was a great deal but it doesn&#x27;t stick to my eyes. Not worth the wait for shipping. I haven&#x27;t used it since trying to apply it three times.</li>
            <li> I was not pleased at all, first they don&#x27;t look like that and second they don&#x27;t come with key ring. This a total rip off</li>
            <li> Lift and are not very good i wouldn&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying this, if you&#x27;ve never worn false ashes DON&amp;#34;T BUY THESE. However, if you are like me and use lashes a lot in your makeup routine (about once/twice a week or more) you should be fine. The lash band on these lashes are pretty thick, so get ready to use a liquid liner to help hide it....and the lash bands themselves were very straight and long. I just took my nail and ran it across the lash band (like you would do with scissors and curling ribbon) and they curled up nicely. And I always trim my lases to fit my eye size so this wasn&#x27;t a big deal to me. But if you want lashes you don&#x27;t have to fix to make them work...keep looking. Glue is not included, but again, this was fine with me. All in all if you are willing to take the time to trim and curl them they are well worth it. I really like the look of these on, the criss-cross looks dramatic, but overly so.</li>
            <li> Popped off easily and never had that before with any brand.</li>
            <li> The lashes are way better then the ones I usually order off amazon they make my full make up routine look FLAWSOME</li>
            <li> Not the best quality. Would not purchase again</li>
            <li> Way better than I expected, not soft at all, very stiff, but they look amazing and they&#x27;re super cheap!!</li>
            <li> This eyelashes are great they look so gorgeous  I really like them! They are super easy to apply. Shipping was super quick!</li>
            <li> Product is cheap plastic lashes theyre not demi whisppies , they look like strippers eyelashes.</li>
            <li> They are just fabulous!</li>
            <li> I Love thedr cause i can re use them thanks so much</li>
            <li> Not what was expected AT ALL! Stiff and not very flexible. I will pay a little more $ for a better product.</li>
