            <li>I have a very fair complexion, and the scent, shimmer, and spf withstood the heat, sweat, and pool, and kept me feeling pretty and protected.  </li>
            <li>I have very fair skin and need high spf lotion&#x27;s.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s also not that greasy which is an added bonus, and it smells lovely.</li>
            <li>Be sure to wash your hands unless you want to get it all over the place.</li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>and I liked the sound of the shimmery lotion.</li>
            <li>The scent was okay, nothing to write home about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love how it smells.  </li>
            <li>When you stop sparkling, it&#x27;s time for more....</li>
            <li>love this lotion and wish I could buy it in the stores again because I worry that I&#x27;m buying &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; product online.  </li>
            <li>i love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Love the sparkle this sunscreen leaves on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>My sister loved it so much i had to buy her a bottle as well.</li>
            <li>Wow I LOVE this stuff!!</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t buy again, product downtime out easily.</li>
            <li>than I thought they would be, but it still looks really pretty on my (self-)tanned skin and brings out a nice sheen and glow, as promised.  </li>
            <li>Great protection and remains after a short dip in the ocean.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and the shimmer really makes your skin glow in the sun.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and the shimmer really makes your skin glow in the sun.</li>
            <li>This also has the delicious tropical scent that Hawaian Tropic is known for; it reminds me of the lazy days of summer.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the shimmer, the smell, the feel, the whole kit-and-caboodle!  </li>
            <li>It smells delicious, it&#x27;s not super heavy/greasy, and it makes your skin look sparkly and pretty (</li>
            <li>The pros first: Very pleasant tropical scent that instantly broadcasts Summer in a classic coconut fashion.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it was great.</li>
            <li>It came quick, just in time for the summer</li>
            <li>The smell is good and the shimmer was subtle and nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely fair skinned, so I&#x27;m always anxious to make sure I&#x27;ve adequately covered my arms, face, neck, and shoulders when I&#x27;ll be outdoors.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The shimmer in this is extremely light gold, almost invisible, but it&#x27;s plenty enough to see if I need to reapply or to make sure it&#x27;s spread everywhere.</li>
            <li>I would have preferred a fresh or fruity scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just right.</li>
            <li>It leaves a pretty shimmer that makes your skin look amazing, especially in the sunlight.</li>
            <li>Now for the cons: While the shimmer effect of the iincluded mica particles imparts a pleasant glow to the skin, those very particles will rub off as residue on clothing and other objects ccontacting your skin.</li>
            <li>I used this product for the first time while spending a weekend in 109 degree weather in Palm Springs, California.  </li>
            <li>The shine particles (which come from the mieral mica) are a bit larger and more noticeable</li>
            <li>This is a great long lasting sunscreen.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!</li>
            <li>solution: apply this first, and then carry a travel size lotion for repeated application/spraying throughout the day.</li>
            <li>It gives a nice slight golden glow to the skin.</li>
            <li>This is hands down my favorite sun tan lotion, it&#x27;s shimmery and fun!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s subtle, which makes this great for anyone.</li>
            <li>For especially hot (and dry) summer days, I substitute an Evian spray for lotion.</li>
            <li>Its no big deal, washes off easily.</li>
            <li>It looks like shimmery micah or really really thinned out eye shadow, not glitter.</li>
            <li>This is very glittery.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I were going on a very belated honey moon to Hawaii</li>
            <li>besides, it protects you very well against the sun.  </li>
            <li>Left my skin soft, smooth, and sparkly!</li>
            <li>My white tank top is a sort of yellow...</li>
            <li>And, it isn&#x27;t too much like I&#x27;m a 10 year old girl playing in the glitter.</li>
            <li>, I just made sure to reapply after a few hours.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really shimmer, although for the first ten minutes or so after you put it on, it has a gleam.  </li>
            <li>Love this suntan lotion the shimmer last a long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d seen ads for this recently in magazines, and liked the idea of it having a slight shimmer since during the summer I like to use lotions that have a bit of sheen to them.  </li>
            <li>It does need to be reapplied a few times under big sun and especially in water sports, but it&#x27;s easy to spread on and the white lotion absorbs pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>I read other reviews before making this purchase and am happy to report that the shimmer effect is subtle but still noticeable.</li>
            <li>I only burned once that whole week, which is very rare for me and that was just because I wasn&#x27;t applying the lotion often enough on a day that we spent out on the ocean.</li>
            <li>Prior to swimming, it seemed to offer decent protection from burning.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to wash your hands after application or you might get some sparkles on a few other things.</li>
            <li>Does sunscreen still work if it&#x27;s several years old?</li>

            <li> Does sunscreen still work if it&#x27;s several years old?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not necessarily a sport sunscreen, but you can wear it in water, as long as you re-apply afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> eventually ends up looking kinda dry with glitter specks all over....</li>
            <li> The only reason I took off one of the starts, was because I felt the shimmering could have been knocked down a notch.</li>
            <li> Same for my black watch band.</li>
            <li> I dilute it a little with the Hawaiian Tropic regular 40spf though.  </li>
            <li> it is nothing like advertised definite waste of money.</li>
            <li> and I still look for it when I go to different, random stores out of the normal for me.</li>
            <li> (so if you keep on reapplying the same stuff and it keeps on drying, you&#x27;ll end up looking like a dry glitter ball by late afternoon....</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend it since the shimmer was hard to findin other brands.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind tanning in small spurts, but this spf 40 does the trick under long sun exposure to keep the burn away and let a little bit of tan sneak through.  </li>
            <li> I have a black napsack that now is innundated with gold glitter.</li>
            <li> It gives you just a slight shimmer.</li>
            <li> it has just enough shimmer to give you a subtle glow in the sunlight</li>
            <li> I hate using plain lotion, because I can&#x27;t see it to be sure, or see where it is unless it&#x27;s already started to burn.&lt;br</li>
            <li> try no to put on excessive amounts because the glitter does tend to rub off onto the clothing but its expected.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or heavy, or cause me to break out-- which a lot of sun blocks do.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something that gives your skin a subtle glitter (as opposed to the night club stuff)</li>
            <li> I have nothing negative to say except that they shouldn&#x27;t have discontinued it!  </li>
            <li> Very hard to find product.</li>
            <li> it is very thick and pasty like a sunblock rather than a lotion.</li>
            <li> , just disappointed I bought the little bottle</li>
            <li> Not impressed with the quality either.</li>
            <li> I usually hate things that shimmer on my skin but in the water, under the sun, it&#x27;s insanely flattering.  </li>

            <li> Very hard to find product. Thank You!!</li>
            <li> It smells delicious, it&#x27;s not super heavy/greasy, and it makes your skin look sparkly and pretty (but not overly so) while protecting it from the sun. I&#x27;ll be buying it again!</li>
            <li> I love this product! i&#x27;ve never had any sunblock like this, i like the smell and the sheer touch.it&#x27;s not sticky at all.i used coppertone before,but since i have this i will never go back to coppertone anymore.love it!</li>
            <li> I am a repeat offender of not using sunscreen and burning the hell out of myself. I decided to buy this and put it on in place of lotion when I get out of the shower.It rubbed in well, didn&#x27;t feel greasy afterwards, smelled is great, had good protection and the shimmer was nice too....BUT! The only reason I took off one of the starts, was because I felt the shimmering could have been knocked down a notch. It gets all over everything, (even when only applied during sun exposure) and I felt like my legs looked like gold plated tree trunks. Other than that, it was great.</li>
            <li> I did not buy this product from Amazon but felt compelled to share its pros and cons through my experience. The pros first: Very pleasant tropical scent that instantly broadcasts Summer in a classic coconut fashion. The lotion goes on smoothlyy and is not overly greasy. Prior to swimming, it seemed to offer decent protection from burning. Now for the cons: While the shimmer effect of the iincluded mica particles imparts a pleasant glow to the skin, those very particles will rub off as residue on clothing and other objects ccontacting your skin. I have a black napsack that now is innundated with gold glitter. Same for my black watch band. My white tank top is a sort of yellow...you get the idea. It does wash off the skin but forget the napsack! Also, you must reapply sunscreen after swimming. I am going back to Coppertone Sport.</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time while spending a weekend in 109 degree weather in Palm Springs, California.  I have a very fair complexion, and the scent, shimmer, and spf withstood the heat, sweat, and pool, and kept me feeling pretty and protected.  I will buy this again for my next adventure in Mexico.</li>
            <li> I looked for this shimmer effect spf everywhere and couldn&#x27;t find it. I was extremely happy finding it here on amazon. It came quick, just in time for the summer and I was glowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try no to put on excessive amounts because the glitter does tend to rub off onto the clothing but its expected. It gives a nice slight golden glow to the skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells great, protects you from the sun&#x27;s harmful rays, and makes your skin shimmer - what&#x27;s not to like?!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d seen ads for this recently in magazines, and liked the idea of it having a slight shimmer since during the summer I like to use lotions that have a bit of sheen to them.  The shine particles (which come from the mieral mica) are a bit larger and more noticeable than I thought they would be, but it still looks really pretty on my (self-)tanned skin and brings out a nice sheen and glow, as promised.  This also has the delicious tropical scent that Hawaian Tropic is known for; it reminds me of the lazy days of summer. It&#x27;s a great sunscreen to wear during the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also has UVA/UVB protection, and the SPF 40 that I purchased does a nice job of keeping harmful rays out. It&#x27;s not necessarily a sport sunscreen, but you can wear it in water, as long as you re-apply afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you like the tropical scent of Hawaiian Tropic products, I&#x27;d give this a try!</li>
            <li> Happy with the product and shipping</li>
            <li> Love how this makes my skin glow with sparkles. Use sparingly and concentrate on entire area of the skin, otherwise it will leave gold patches in areas not fully rubbed in.</li>
            <li> I have had mutiple skin cancers on my chest and this hides any scars or bumps I have plus it gives me the protection I need.&lt;br /&gt;Love it, and thank you for asking</li>
            <li> Love love love , just disappointed I bought the little bottle .. I guess I&#x27;m just gonna have to buy another one!!!!!</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t buy again, product downtime out easily. Not impressed with the quality either. I&#x27;ll stick with bath &amp; bodyworks</li>
            <li> Smells good but doesn&#x27;t shimmer at all. It has almost no glow it is nothing like advertised definite waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely fair skinned, so I&#x27;m always anxious to make sure I&#x27;ve adequately covered my arms, face, neck, and shoulders when I&#x27;ll be outdoors. I hate using plain lotion, because I can&#x27;t see it to be sure, or see where it is unless it&#x27;s already started to burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shimmer in this is extremely light gold, almost invisible, but it&#x27;s plenty enough to see if I need to reapply or to make sure it&#x27;s spread everywhere. It looks like shimmery micah or really really thinned out eye shadow, not glitter.</li>
            <li> I love love this sunblock. It protects the skin but gives this amazing twilight like glow. Amazon is the only place I can find it.</li>
            <li> This is very glittery.  Not only does your skin SHINE but so does your swimsuit, your shirt, your hair, your towel... your husband... ANYTHING you touch!  Tons of gold glitter  lol  I threw it away.</li>
            <li> This is a great long lasting sunscreen. Great protection and remains after a short dip in the ocean. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!</li>
            <li> I love this! I took it on vacation and everyone wanted to use it. It gives you just a slight shimmer. It&#x27;s subtle, which makes this great for anyone.</li>
            <li> This smells great, unlike most sunblocks, it</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  The shimmer is perfect.  I dilute it a little with the Hawaiian Tropic regular 40spf though.  Love the smell too.</li>
            <li> This is hands down my favorite sun tan lotion, it&#x27;s shimmery and fun! I read other reviews before making this purchase and am happy to report that the shimmer effect is subtle but still noticeable. It&#x27;s also not that greasy which is an added bonus, and it smells lovely. Be sure to wash your hands unless you want to get it all over the place. I used it at a festival and it provided me with ample sun protection, I just made sure to reapply after a few hours. I hope they keep making this sunblock, it&#x27;s definitely something I will keep buying. Especially at 40spf!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff adds shimmer with out over doing it smells great and SPF coverage!</li>
            <li> Nice shimmer!  It is a gold glitter that looks very nice if you have a tan.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen. It smells nice and the shimmer really makes your skin glow in the sun. The 40spf works great. I missed a spot on my shoulder which got burned but everywhere I used it just tanned nicely.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and need high spf lotion&#x27;s. My husband and I were going on a very belated honey moon to Hawaii and I liked the sound of the shimmery lotion. This lotion was great! I only burned once that whole week, which is very rare for me and that was just because I wasn&#x27;t applying the lotion often enough on a day that we spent out on the ocean. The smell is good and the shimmer was subtle and nice. I would definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really shimmer, although for the first ten minutes or so after you put it on, it has a gleam.  I guess that qualifies as a shimmer?  If you&#x27;re looking for something that gives your skin a subtle glitter (as opposed to the night club stuff) this ain&#x27;t it.  The scent was okay, nothing to write home about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My quest continues!</li>
            <li> My granddaughter wanted shiny or sparkly sunscreen and this filled the bill perfectly.</li>
            <li> Love love love the shimmer in this!!!</li>
            <li> I love how it smells.  I usually hate things that shimmer on my skin but in the water, under the sun, it&#x27;s insanely flattering.  I thought I looked like Cleopatra, goddess of the water.  I don&#x27;t mind tanning in small spurts, but this spf 40 does the trick under long sun exposure to keep the burn away and let a little bit of tan sneak through.  It does need to be reapplied a few times under big sun and especially in water sports, but it&#x27;s easy to spread on and the white lotion absorbs pretty quickly.  If you&#x27;re not into shimmer, stick with another choice.  Otherwise, Cleopatra it up.</li>
            <li> This is just the best sunscreen EVER! Not only does it make me shimmer like a beach goddess, I like that the shimmer helps you to know when to reapply! When you stop sparkling, it&#x27;s time for more.... Smells yummy too!</li>
            <li> Love this suntan lotion the shimmer last a long time.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome for outdoor events/festivals. It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or heavy, or cause me to break out-- which a lot of sun blocks do. I like the shimmer in the lotion. And, it isn&#x27;t too much like I&#x27;m a 10 year old girl playing in the glitter. It&#x27;s just right.</li>
            <li> Why did they stop making this??&lt;br /&gt;I love this lotion and wish I could buy it in the stores again because I worry that I&#x27;m buying &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; product online.  Does sunscreen still work if it&#x27;s several years old? I LOVE the shimmer, the smell, the feel, the whole kit-and-caboodle!  I have nothing negative to say except that they shouldn&#x27;t have discontinued it!  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and I still look for it when I go to different, random stores out of the normal for me. Just hoping...</li>
            <li> Left my skin soft, smooth, and sparkly! Did a great job of blocking the UV rays too! Smells delicious!!!</li>
            <li> i love this stuff. it has just enough shimmer to give you a subtle glow in the sunlight and i need that since i have very light skin</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s a sunblock, but I wanted to use it more for a good smelling shimmer lotion. it is very thick and pasty like a sunblock rather than a lotion. but you will shine like a gem at the beach with this and be protected at the same time</li>
            <li> Wow I LOVE this stuff!! Sparkles are awesome, and I LOVE that I don&#x27;t have to apply a separate SPF when going out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I DON&amp;#34;T like is that I DO have to reapply...usually another lotion... After a while, the moisture dissipates, and I find that my skin (that once looked so shiny-healthy-golden) eventually ends up looking kinda dry with glitter specks all over....hmmm... (so if you keep on reapplying the same stuff and it keeps on drying, you&#x27;ll end up looking like a dry glitter ball by late afternoon....)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My solution: apply this first, and then carry a travel size lotion for repeated application/spraying throughout the day. For especially hot (and dry) summer days, I substitute an Evian spray for lotion. LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product, it shines and makes your skin look great!!... besides, it protects you very well against the sun.  Love it!! :D</li>
            <li> I love sparkles on everything, so this is perfect! My only criticism is the smell. I would have preferred a fresh or fruity scent.</li>
            <li> Why is it being discontinued??? I love this sunscreen. It smells nice and the shimmer really makes your skin glow in the sun. The 40spf works great. I missed a spot on my neck which got burned, but everywhere I used it just tanned nicely.</li>
            <li> Love the sparkle this sunscreen leaves on my skin.  It smells great also.  Would definitely recommend it since the shimmer was hard to findin other brands.</li>
            <li> Great sun protection and a nice golden glimmering effect to boot!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It leaves a pretty shimmer that makes your skin look amazing, especially in the sunlight. It smells good too. My sister loved it so much i had to buy her a bottle as well. Just be sure to wash your hands after application or you might get some sparkles on a few other things. Its no big deal, washes off easily.</li>
