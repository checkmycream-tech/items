            <li>If I use a damp brush, it looks good.  </li>
            <li>Amazing palette for any woman who loves her neutrals.</li>
            <li>amazing pigmentation.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a nice mix between mattes and shimmers.</li>
            <li>Just add your own transition color</li>
            <li>Great colors and very good quality - shadows mix easily, colors are very neutral.  </li>
            <li>beautiful highly pigmented shades that compliment any skin tone.</li>
            <li>I, myself, can never have too many neutral palettes.</li>
            <li>Could not ask for a better product.</li>
            <li>You can do so many looks.</li>
            <li>A few of the darker colours have a surprising amount of glitter  especially warm stone.</li>
            <li>Could do with a couple of more matte colors, but it is what it is.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect it to be like that at all, but it&#x27;s a lovely surprise.</li>
            <li>These go on so smooth and stay without any tricks!</li>
            <li>I glad I found Sigma.</li>
            <li>The warm palette is quite lovely with some rich looking colours.</li>
            <li>Pretty good neutral color selection.</li>
            <li>While more costly than drug store brands, the quality is so much better, it is worth it!</li>
            <li>It was very challenging to find neutral pallet with matt shadows, most of the pallets are very  sparkly.</li>
            <li>Gorgeous palette, love all the colors, good for everyday wear.</li>
            <li>So pretty, very pigmented, great coverage.</li>
            <li>Overall I am SO happy with these shadows.</li>
            <li>That said, the palette allows nice soft looks to be created.</li>
            <li>The shadows are very pigmented, buttery, creamy, smooth &amp; easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Sigma is my new favorite beauty brand...</li>
            <li>Would really recommend this palette and plan to get others by Sigma because I love the formula so much.</li>
            <li>I have highly sensitive skin that doesn&#x27;t tolerate many eye products, and Sigma eye shadow doesn&#x27;t cause any issues at all.</li>
            <li>The shadows are powdery and soft, and they blend nicely with not too much fallout.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth the money</li>
            <li>For the amount of money that I paid for these shadows I expected better!</li>
            <li>Very much recommended.</li>
            <li>if soft, light colour is what you want.</li>
            <li>Dove is one of my favorites and Warm Stone is definitely one of the most unusual colors you&#x27;ll ever find - dark brown with gold and greenish specs.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>these stay put really well.</li>
            <li>Very blend-able and all the colors mix well together.</li>
            <li>Love the shadows just takes a little very concentrated</li>
            <li>Super blendable, doesn&#x27;t crease (if you have oily eyelids try using urban decay primer potion eye primer</li>
            <li>you only need to pick up a tiny amount of color when using this pallet, so it will last for a long time, even with frequent use.</li>

            <li> Returned item only because  I found  a store locally thst gave me  a make over so I bought make up locally from Clinique</li>
            <li> So pretty, very pigmented, great coverage. Highly recommended!</li>

            <li> It isn&#x27;t as pigmented as it looks.  If I use a damp brush, it looks good.  The colors are beautiful though.</li>
            <li> For the amount of money that I paid for these shadows I expected better! The colors were not true to those pictured and the quality was just like any drugstore shadow.</li>
            <li> One of the best palettes ever!!! I am getting a backup! You can do so many looks. Just add your own transition color and you will create the most perfect looks.</li>

            <li> Love the shadows just takes a little very concentrated</li>
            <li> I will not need to buy any other eye shadows! These go on so smooth and stay without any tricks! Beautiful colors! I can even put them on with my finger( i was on vaca and didn&#x27;t pack brushes!) and still looked great! Also, they do not test on animals!</li>
            <li> Great colors and very good quality - shadows mix easily, colors are very neutral.  Color differs a lot when applied on skin but still very nice color. The other thing that I love is that all colors are matt or with very subtle satin shine. I am in my middle 40&#x27;s, so prefer to wear mat/ satin shadows that don&#x27;t make my wrinkles to stand out. It was very challenging to find neutral pallet with matt shadows, most of the pallets are very  sparkly. I glad I found Sigma. Very much recommended.</li>
            <li> Always loved the sigma brushes so when I saw they has eyeshadow palettes, I immediately whipped out my credit card and needed to purchase! These eyeshadows are like butter. Super blendable, doesn&#x27;t crease (if you have oily eyelids try using urban decay primer potion eye primer it helps to mattify your eyelids). Overall I am SO happy with these shadows. So perfect!</li>
            <li> Awesome. it stays on for a long time and you don&#x27;t have to use allot for it to show.</li>
            <li> amazing pigmentation.</li>
