            <li>This body wash is kind and moisturizing .</li>
            <li>the price for the natural product is perfect.</li>
            <li>The consistency was nice, smell was ok.</li>
            <li>The first week or so, I wasn&#x27;t too happy with it...</li>
            <li>I forgot how large the bottle is, so when it came, I was happy to know I wouldn&#x27;t need to worry about body wash for a while.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just ok.  </li>
            <li>Hydrating and smooth!</li>
            <li>I was hoping for more and stronger scent.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used it on my toddler who also reacts to many products, and it didn&#x27;t bother her at all.</li>
            <li>the woman and i both love it.</li>
            <li>will be buying more of this when we run out.</li>
            <li>I love the body wash.</li>
            <li>I love Amazon.</li>
            <li>It does, however, have a pleasant, mild, and clean smell.</li>
            <li>They are very hydrating and pleasantly scented.  </li>
            <li>pump is super handy.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, leaves my skin super hidrated &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>The coconut body wash from the Body Shop is much stronger and more beautifully aromatic but also costs about 4-5x as much!!</li>
            <li>Great natural bodywash</li>
            <li>Smells so good and very moisturizing</li>
            <li>Absolute favorite, makes my skin feel and smell amazing and</li>
            <li>I love the way this soap cleans, its light moisturizing effect, and its mild scent.  </li>
            <li>It has a light beachy scent, which I find calming.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightly scented (</li>
            <li>Great body wash for the entire family.  </li>
            <li>But another plus here is it is sulfate free and non-irritant.</li>
            <li>Coffee berry seems to help smooth skin texture and cellulite.</li>
            <li>It only has a handful of ingredients, which is great.</li>
            <li>Nice body wash at a reasonable price but</li>
            <li>Light suds.  </li>
            <li>The size of the bottle &amp; pump is such a great but for a safer alternative.</li>
            <li>This works great at not drying your skin out but add some essential oil to take the scent away.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It says its Paraben free,</li>
            <li>No animal Testing, No SLS, No Synthetic Fragrance, Gluten Free.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty sudsy and seems to leave my skin feeling pretty good.</li>
            <li>and this was good for it, but it just left me hoping for more.</li>
            <li>Smells clean, rinses easily, natural ingredients you feel good about.</li>
            <li>This Every Day Coconut Super Hydrating Body Wash is gentle yet effective.</li>
            <li>I was excited to search and find it on Amazon and at a savings.</li>
            <li>I like Alaffia products and their ingredients, but I wasn&#x27;t excited about this body wash.</li>
            <li>Amazon was fantastic about a quick refund and resolution.  </li>
            <li>Rinses clean and leaves skin moisturized after shower.</li>
            <li>Ingredients leave my skin clean without drying it out.</li>
            <li>(I realize it&#x27;s fragrance free, but was expecting the coconut oil would give it a mild scent).</li>
            <li>it makes you feel clean after the shower</li>
            <li>Lathers well and gets you clean.</li>
            <li>Leaves you feeling squeaky clean will buy again</li>
            <li>It is very gentle, and has a nice, light coconut smell that doesn&#x27;t linger too much.</li>
            <li>I am super excited to know I won&#x27;t be running out and can order when needed.</li>
            <li>I bought this because it seemed like a good deal and falls in the low toxic range of products.  </li>
            <li>Rarely ever do I get by with just one pump,&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great quality though, it doesn&#x27;t really dry out my skin</li>
            <li>I also use coconut oil to moisturize my body, but during the summer after using the super hydrating body wash no oil is needed.</li>
            <li>Luckily it came in a plastic bag, because about 1/4 of the soap had leaked out.</li>
            <li>Smells good, doesn&#x27;t dry out skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and am allergic to most body washes.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use the body washes with harsher chemicals because their ingredients (primarily \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot;, which could be one of many petrochemicals) makes my eyes go super red and</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant but not overwhelming and the pump makes it easy to use in the shower</li>
            <li>But if your skin is dry, especially in the winter, very nice!  </li>
            <li>This lotion not only smells great, feels amazing and makes my skin look smooth and supple - it and the body wash have almost completely healed my most recent massive acne episode!</li>
            <li>It has a light coconut fragrance and foams very well too.</li>
            <li>particular soap has a mild coconut scent and leaves a light moisturizing coating on your skin that locks in moisture.  </li>
            <li>you get a fresh bottle that hasn&#x27;t turned.  </li>
            <li>Basic ingredients - no harsh chemicals - smell great.  </li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great natural alternative body wash.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin silky soft and the aroma is very clean.  </li>
            <li>Since &amp;#34;coconut&amp;#34; is right in the title, I don&#x27;t think this is unreasonable.  </li>
            <li>It works, smells nice but not too strong, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about any harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>Nice body wash, leaves skin comfortable, non-irritating or heavily perfumed.</li>
            <li>Very gentle on the skin, very gentle smell.</li>
            <li>I would try this brand again if I could smell the wash first.  </li>
            <li>but I really like it!  </li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product before, though this is the first time I chose the coconut one.</li>
            <li>It cleans my skin but leaves it feeling rather normal not \\&quot;super hydrated\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Liked the other ones and like this one,too.</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;m very happy with the overall moisturizing effect over time, directly after using this wash, your skin will feel tacky and tight.</li>
            <li>It has a light barely there scent.  </li>
            <li>So I can&#x27;t compare its moisturizing abilities to many other body washes, but I can say that I felt the difference in my skin right away and did not have an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li>Love that Alaffia&#x27;s products are natural and gluten free, especially with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Was hoping that here in dry Colorado it would do more to moisturize my skin, but saw/felt no appreciable improvement.</li>
            <li>Good enough body wash but not a very intense coconut aroma.</li>
            <li>what seemed like monthly for each of us, so the price may seem high at first glance but it ends up all working out.</li>
            <li>I have now tried several products from this line and enjoy all of them.  </li>
            <li>I got this at Whole Foods for $9.99.</li>
            <li>I was fortunate to find it online for similar price.</li>
            <li>Very happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>- however I really wanted a body wash which smelled like coconut.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Use on the whole family along with the lotion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s SLS-free, so don&#x27;t expect it to lather up much.</li>
            <li>This doesnt have much of a smell</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very foamy</li>
            <li>I really do like</li>
            <li>I really like this body wash.  </li>
            <li>It definitely works, but I would still say O&#x27;lay or Dove is better for super dry skin.</li>
            <li>This is a great body soap with very few ingredients that you actually know what they are and do not have to google them.</li>
            <li>As with most \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; products, it has a harsh, chemical odor.</li>
            <li>I love this body wash and will likely continue using it as long as they make it!</li>
            <li>Usually natural products are way overpriced, but this brand isn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li>This large bottle is very reasonably priced, and it has definitely helped calm down my itchy winter skin.</li>
            <li>This huge bottle will last my son &amp; I a long time!&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and I&#x27;d u don&#x27;t like a coconut scent, no worries here.</li>
            <li>Large bottle and will last a while.</li>
            <li>But, now my skin is so soft, supple and if I miss a day of lotion after my shower</li>
            <li>Natural ingredients with no heavy scent.</li>
            <li>I bought it because it is all natural.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and ever since I found this body wash</li>
            <li>Arrived with plunger popped up and completely detached from the rest of the bottle.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>But my 13-year old son &amp;#34;borrowed&amp;#34; it one evening</li>
            <li>AND SO FAR THIS PRODUCT HAS NOT CAUSED ANY PROBLEMS.  </li>
            <li>All natural.</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way and my skin feels fabulous!</li>
            <li>Two people using it every day, sometimes twice a day, and we&#x27;re only halfway down the huge bottle.</li>
            <li>After going through the entire bottle, Everyday Coconut works as an inexpensive, Sodium Laureth Sulfate free, hydrating wash.</li>
            <li>While most cheap products have a great experience during use, but long term effects are terrible, the initial impression of Everyday Coconut is a bad one, but long term use leads to great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>I went back and bought my old Alba Mint body wash instead.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, allergy prone, skin, but after several months and multiple products, no rashes!  </li>
            <li>It does not smell bad, it does not smell like chemicals, it just smells like a pleasant soap.</li>
            <li>but I tend to need about a pump and a half sometimes two whole pumps while in the shower.</li>
            <li>One of the only soaps I&#x27;ve found that does not dry my skin at all.</li>
            <li>I have very dry sensitive skin</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Rarely ever do I get by with just one pump,&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great quality though, it doesn&#x27;t really dry out my skin</li>
            <li> I also use coconut oil to moisturize my body, but during the summer after using the super hydrating body wash no oil is needed.</li>
            <li> Luckily it came in a plastic bag, because about 1/4 of the soap had leaked out.</li>
            <li> Smells good, doesn&#x27;t dry out skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and am allergic to most body washes.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use the body washes with harsher chemicals because their ingredients (primarily \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot;, which could be one of many petrochemicals) makes my eyes go super red and</li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant but not overwhelming and the pump makes it easy to use in the shower</li>
            <li> But if your skin is dry, especially in the winter, very nice!  </li>
            <li> This lotion not only smells great, feels amazing and makes my skin look smooth and supple - it and the body wash have almost completely healed my most recent massive acne episode!</li>
            <li> It has a light coconut fragrance and foams very well too.</li>
            <li> particular soap has a mild coconut scent and leaves a light moisturizing coating on your skin that locks in moisture.  </li>
            <li> you get a fresh bottle that hasn&#x27;t turned.  </li>
            <li> Basic ingredients - no harsh chemicals - smell great.  </li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great natural alternative body wash.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin silky soft and the aroma is very clean.  </li>
            <li> Since &amp;#34;coconut&amp;#34; is right in the title, I don&#x27;t think this is unreasonable.  </li>
            <li> It works, smells nice but not too strong, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about any harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> Nice body wash, leaves skin comfortable, non-irritating or heavily perfumed.</li>
            <li> Very gentle on the skin, very gentle smell.</li>
            <li> I would try this brand again if I could smell the wash first.  </li>
            <li> but I really like it!  </li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before, though this is the first time I chose the coconut one.</li>
            <li> It cleans my skin but leaves it feeling rather normal not \\&quot;super hydrated\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Liked the other ones and like this one,too.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m very happy with the overall moisturizing effect over time, directly after using this wash, your skin will feel tacky and tight.</li>
            <li> It has a light barely there scent.  </li>
            <li> So I can&#x27;t compare its moisturizing abilities to many other body washes, but I can say that I felt the difference in my skin right away and did not have an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> Love that Alaffia&#x27;s products are natural and gluten free, especially with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Was hoping that here in dry Colorado it would do more to moisturize my skin, but saw/felt no appreciable improvement.</li>
            <li> Good enough body wash but not a very intense coconut aroma.</li>
            <li> what seemed like monthly for each of us, so the price may seem high at first glance but it ends up all working out.</li>
            <li> I have now tried several products from this line and enjoy all of them.  </li>
            <li> I got this at Whole Foods for $9.99.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate to find it online for similar price.</li>
            <li> Very happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> - however I really wanted a body wash which smelled like coconut.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Use on the whole family along with the lotion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s SLS-free, so don&#x27;t expect it to lather up much.</li>
            <li> This doesnt have much of a smell</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very foamy</li>
            <li> I really do like</li>
            <li> I really like this body wash.  </li>
            <li> It definitely works, but I would still say O&#x27;lay or Dove is better for super dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great body soap with very few ingredients that you actually know what they are and do not have to google them.</li>
            <li> As with most \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; products, it has a harsh, chemical odor.</li>
            <li> I love this body wash and will likely continue using it as long as they make it!</li>
            <li> Usually natural products are way overpriced, but this brand isn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> This large bottle is very reasonably priced, and it has definitely helped calm down my itchy winter skin.</li>
            <li> This huge bottle will last my son &amp; I a long time!&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and I&#x27;d u don&#x27;t like a coconut scent, no worries here.</li>
            <li> Large bottle and will last a while.</li>
            <li> But, now my skin is so soft, supple and if I miss a day of lotion after my shower</li>
            <li> Natural ingredients with no heavy scent.</li>
            <li> I bought it because it is all natural.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and ever since I found this body wash</li>
            <li> Arrived with plunger popped up and completely detached from the rest of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> But my 13-year old son &amp;#34;borrowed&amp;#34; it one evening</li>
            <li> AND SO FAR THIS PRODUCT HAS NOT CAUSED ANY PROBLEMS.  </li>
            <li> All natural.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way and my skin feels fabulous!</li>
            <li> Two people using it every day, sometimes twice a day, and we&#x27;re only halfway down the huge bottle.</li>
            <li> After going through the entire bottle, Everyday Coconut works as an inexpensive, Sodium Laureth Sulfate free, hydrating wash.</li>
            <li> While most cheap products have a great experience during use, but long term effects are terrible, the initial impression of Everyday Coconut is a bad one, but long term use leads to great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> I went back and bought my old Alba Mint body wash instead.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, allergy prone, skin, but after several months and multiple products, no rashes!  </li>
            <li> It does not smell bad, it does not smell like chemicals, it just smells like a pleasant soap.</li>
            <li> but I tend to need about a pump and a half sometimes two whole pumps while in the shower.</li>
            <li> One of the only soaps I&#x27;ve found that does not dry my skin at all.</li>
            <li> I have very dry sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Neutral smell, gentle and a little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that small amounts are gentle enough to use on my face.</li>
            <li> My biggest surprise is how long it&#x27;s lasting us!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s possible I received an old bottle, but the body wash that arrived smelled like rancid oil and coffee grounds and a little like truck stop hand soap.  </li>
            <li> I prefer using this over the regular body washes that leave my skin too dry.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long too.</li>
            <li> Also they packaged it wrong and more than half was all over the box when I opened it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after researching soaps that add hydration to dry skin.</li>
            <li> It also does not seem to dry out my skin like a lot of soaps do.</li>
            <li> Cleans without any residue but also doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> Someone recommended I try coconut oil products for my dry itchy skin this winter.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hydrate like it says and leave my skin dry and itching.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and makes it smell</li>
            <li> My first shower was not impressive, I needed just as much lotion as usual and without lotion, my skin would have been dry all day.</li>
            <li> I also use it in a foam pump at my sink, &amp; my hands don&#x27;t feel as dry either!</li>
            <li> Their instant online chat took care of the problem in less than five minutes.  </li>
            <li> Big mess.</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t dry it out like other ones though</li>
            <li> Creamy and lightly scented (no over-powering artificial scent).</li>
            <li> I used the same lotion in their product line (Everyday Shea), and the lotion is like water.</li>
            <li> Not very moisturizing but not drying either.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few days</li>
            <li> My skin has been MUCH less dry (and that in a northeast winter) since I switched to this.</li>
            <li> I cannot imagine using any other brand in the future!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> OTHER THAN THAT</li>
            <li> It has a slight scent and lathers well.</li>
            <li> But anways, after about 4-6 showers, I noticed clarity in my skin and less dryness.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s too bad because the bottle is still almost full</li>
            <li> Besides for having trouble getting it to start pumping, it seems to work well.</li>
            <li> This is my first time having a bad experience with something I have ordered through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Overall disappointed, but not worth the trouble to return.</li>
            <li> They are also much less expensive than the products that I was using previously.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is delicate and causes no problems with my allergies.</li>
            <li> Unpleasant initial feeling on skin</li>
            <li> I like that the smell is subtle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t react at all to this, and the subtle scent takes me to the beach every time I take a shower.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re hard to find!</li>
            <li> the smell of coconut is very subtle and almost indiscernible in this product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t agree with the &amp;#34;super hydrating&amp;#34; claim, but it does cleanse well.</li>
            <li> It feels like you&#x27;ve just used a very poor quality soap.</li>
            <li> the coconut scent is very faint,</li>
            <li> The smell is awful.  </li>
            <li> It also smells terrible, nothing like coconut.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok.  Was hoping that here in dry Colorado it would do more to moisturize my skin, but saw/felt no appreciable improvement.</li>
            <li> I like how this product&#x27;s ingredients have no manmade chemicals in it. And the vendor, VitaCost, delivered it in two (2) days, which is phenomenal !</li>
            <li> I have now tried several products from this line and enjoy all of them.  They are very hydrating and pleasantly scented.  I have very sensitive, allergy prone, skin, but after several months and multiple products, no rashes!  They are also much less expensive than the products that I was using previously.  I cannot imagine using any other brand in the future!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular soap has a mild coconut scent and leaves a light moisturizing coating on your skin that locks in moisture.  It also works well as a shaving soap.  Very satisfied with this product!</li>
            <li> It has a light beachy scent, which I find calming. It does not contain the \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; ingredient, so I won&#x27;t be allergic to myself after I use it. I can&#x27;t use the body washes with harsher chemicals because their ingredients (primarily \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot;, which could be one of many petrochemicals) makes my eyes go super red and my nose runs (even on allergy meds). So I can&#x27;t compare its moisturizing abilities to many other body washes, but I can say that I felt the difference in my skin right away and did not have an allergic reaction. My boyfriend likes it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you have allergies, are asthmatic and/or just want to use a gentler product, this is a good one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another note: I got this at Whole Foods for $9.99.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at a health foods store during the summer and it helped keep my body moist beyond belief. I also use coconut oil to moisturize my body, but during the summer after using the super hydrating body wash no oil is needed. I guess after great reviews this product continues to sell out in stores. I was fortunate to find it online for similar price.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be put off by the brownish color- this is an awesome hydrating body wash! My skin has been MUCH less dry (and that in a northeast winter) since I switched to this. It is very gentle, and has a nice, light coconut smell that doesn&#x27;t linger too much. Love that Alaffia&#x27;s products are natural and gluten free, especially with my sensitive skin. Large bottle and will last a while. Definitely will buy again.</li>
            <li> I tried this body wash because of all the great reviews, but when I used it I ended up breaking out all over my body. That&#x27;s too bad because the bottle is still almost full but I don&#x27;t want to give it to anyone because they might get the same reaction. The label says it&#x27;s organic, but not hypo-allergenic or something. I don&#x27;t recommend this product at all.</li>
            <li> Buy this! What a great product! Very gentle on the skin, very gentle smell. Perfect for all skin</li>
            <li> Switched to this line, with the lotion, about two months ago. The first week or so, I wasn&#x27;t too happy with it... But, now my skin is so soft, supple and if I miss a day of lotion after my shower it&#x27;s barely noticeable. It&#x27;s lightly scented (\\&quot;not girly at all\\&quot; was my husband&#x27;s comment) and there&#x27;s no filmy feeling leftover. My biggest surprise is how long it&#x27;s lasting us!!! Two people using it every day, sometimes twice a day, and we&#x27;re only halfway down the huge bottle. I used to buy body wash what seemed like monthly for each of us, so the price may seem high at first glance but it ends up all working out. Very happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**02/07/2014 Update** I am JUST now back to buy another bottle before the one in the shower runs out. We are in love with this body wash!</li>
            <li> I used this product but cannot purchase locally. I was excited to search and find it on Amazon and at a savings. I no longer need to wait for an out of town visit to purchase it.  This body wash is kind and moisturizing . I have very dry sensitive skin and it does not bother my nasal allergies. The fragrance is delicate and causes no problems with my allergies. it is my favorite body wash!! Presently, my only body wash! I am super excited to know I won&#x27;t be running out and can order when needed.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Great body wash for the entire family.  Neutral smell, gentle and a little goes a long way!  Not a lot of harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> I do like this body wash, a lot, and it may be entirely dependent on what sponge I&#x27;m using when washing myself but I tend to need about a pump and a half sometimes two whole pumps while in the shower. Rarely ever do I get by with just one pump,&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great quality though, it doesn&#x27;t really dry out my skin, it doesn&#x27;t dry it out like other ones though and I have eczema so this is a great find for me.</li>
            <li> Does not smell like coconut to me.  It is a good body wash - however I really wanted a body wash which smelled like coconut.  Since &amp;#34;coconut&amp;#34; is right in the title, I don&#x27;t think this is unreasonable.  It does not smell bad, it does not smell like chemicals, it just smells like a pleasant soap.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after researching soaps that add hydration to dry skin. It has a slight scent and lathers well. My first shower was not impressive, I needed just as much lotion as usual and without lotion, my skin would have been dry all day. I used the same lotion in their product line (Everyday Shea), and the lotion is like water. But anways, after about 4-6 showers, I noticed clarity in my skin and less dryness. This body wash has a medicinal latent effect. It definitely works, but I would still say O&#x27;lay or Dove is better for super dry skin. But another plus here is it is sulfate free and non-irritant. No itching with this stuff.</li>
            <li> One of the only soaps I&#x27;ve found that does not dry my skin at all. Works great. Try it out.</li>
            <li> Seems to be as good as advertised. Besides for having trouble getting it to start pumping, it seems to work well. Use 3-4 pumps and it&#x27;s pretty sudsy and seems to leave my skin feeling pretty good.</li>
            <li> good stuff.  good service.  Thanks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s possible I received an old bottle, but the body wash that arrived smelled like rancid oil and coffee grounds and a little like truck stop hand soap.  No tropical notes, no coconut creaminess.  Either this scent just doesn&#x27;t agree with me or the lack of preservatives makes it essential you get a fresh bottle that hasn&#x27;t turned.  Amazon was fantastic about a quick refund and resolution.  Their instant online chat took care of the problem in less than five minutes.  I would try this brand again if I could smell the wash first.  It lathers beautifully and they don&#x27;t do any animal testing.  Not very moisturizing but not drying either.  I just couldn&#x27;t stand the scent.</li>
            <li> Basic ingredients - no harsh chemicals - smell great.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Perfection! Smells clean, rinses easily, natural ingredients you feel good about. Hydrating and smooth! Use on the whole family along with the lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few days but I really like it!  A little bit goes a long way and my skin feels fabulous!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It makes your skin feel soft and smooth.  The scent is pleasant but not overwhelming and the pump makes it easy to use in the shower</li>
            <li> Creamy and lightly scented (no over-powering artificial scent). Rinses clean and leaves skin moisturized after shower. I just switched from Dr. Bronner&#x27;s and the hydration factor is tenfold. Will definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li> Its not the greatest... but it works well enough for me. I bought it at Sprouts cheaper than this site. Only $8 at Sprouts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years. Ingredients leave my skin clean without drying it out. Natural ingredients with no heavy scent. Fair trade company. Coffee berry seems to help smooth skin texture and cellulite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before, though this is the first time I chose the coconut one. Liked the other ones and like this one,too. I like that the smell is subtle.</li>
            <li> I forgot how large the bottle is, so when it came, I was happy to know I wouldn&#x27;t need to worry about body wash for a while.</li>
            <li> This is a very simple body wash. It only has a handful of ingredients, which is great. It&#x27;s SLS-free, so don&#x27;t expect it to lather up much. I&#x27;ve found that small amounts are gentle enough to use on my face. Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t agree with the &amp;#34;super hydrating&amp;#34; claim, but it does cleanse well. Also, if you&#x27;re looking for a body wash that smells like coconut, this may not be for you as the smell of coconut is very subtle and almost indiscernible in this product. It does, however, have a pleasant, mild, and clean smell. Overall, this is a great natural alternative body wash.</li>
            <li> Creamy and hydrating. I bought it because it is all natural.</li>
            <li> Absolute favorite, makes my skin feel and smell amazing and the price for the natural product is perfect.</li>
            <li> Nice body wash at a reasonable price but the coconut scent is very faint,</li>
            <li> Great natural bodywash</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and ever since I found this body wash I will never use another! It is hydrating without the harshness found in &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; products. Try it and you won&#x27;t regret it!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great body soap with very few ingredients that you actually know what they are and do not have to google them. It does smell like coconut but the scent is not overpowering and does not stay on you or in the bathroom. It also does not seem to dry out my skin like a lot of soaps do.</li>
            <li> Arrived with plunger popped up and completely detached from the rest of the bottle. Luckily it came in a plastic bag, because about 1/4 of the soap had leaked out. Big mess. Product has virtually no coconut scent whatsoever (I realize it&#x27;s fragrance free, but was expecting the coconut oil would give it a mild scent). Overall disappointed, but not worth the trouble to return.</li>
            <li> This doesnt have much of a smell but my daughter has a lot of allergies. This product works well for her.</li>
            <li> Good enough body wash but not a very intense coconut aroma. I was hoping for more and stronger scent. The coconut body wash from the Body Shop is much stronger and more beautifully aromatic but also costs about 4-5x as much!!</li>
            <li> Has no fragrance doesn&#x27;t smell like coconut a lot at all but it does do the job it&#x27;s very foamy it makes you feel clean after the shower</li>
            <li> Cleans without any residue but also doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out. Love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it seemed like a good deal and falls in the low toxic range of products.  It has a light barely there scent.  Light suds.  It cleans my skin but leaves it feeling rather normal not \\&quot;super hydrated\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and am allergic to most body washes. I don&#x27;t react at all to this, and the subtle scent takes me to the beach every time I take a shower. I love this body wash and will likely continue using it as long as they make it! I&#x27;ve also used it on my toddler who also reacts to many products, and it didn&#x27;t bother her at all. I love the pump, and it&#x27;s a great value for the size.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t super impressed by this body wash. I like Alaffia products and their ingredients, but I wasn&#x27;t excited about this body wash. The consistency was nice, smell was ok. It did not smell as fragrant as I hoped. I have sensitive skin and this was good for it, but it just left me hoping for more. I went back and bought my old Alba Mint body wash instead.</li>
            <li> Love it! Smells so good and very moisturizing</li>
            <li> I really do like this body was a lot! The size of the bottle &amp; pump is such a great but for a safer alternative. I have notice my skin doesn&#x27;t feel as stripped when I get out if the shower. I also use it in a foam pump at my sink, &amp; my hands don&#x27;t feel as dry either! Wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to. It again! This huge bottle will last my son &amp; I a long time!&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and I&#x27;d u don&#x27;t like a coconut scent, no worries here. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong coconut smell at all!! ❤️</li>
            <li> Someone recommended I try coconut oil products for my dry itchy skin this winter. This large bottle is very reasonably priced, and it has definitely helped calm down my itchy winter skin.</li>
            <li> This is a very good and hydrating body wash. I prefer using this over the regular body washes that leave my skin too dry.</li>
            <li> This works great at not drying your skin out but add some essential oil to take the scent away.  The scent doesn&#x27;t stay with you BTW but for me it bothers me while bathing.  Recommend an oil that isn&#x27;t too dominating.  But if your skin is dry, especially in the winter, very nice!  Lathers well and gets you clean.</li>
            <li> After going through the entire bottle, Everyday Coconut works as an inexpensive, Sodium Laureth Sulfate free, hydrating wash. There are tons of caveats, though. As with most \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; products, it has a harsh, chemical odor. Almost like bleach. Although I&#x27;m very happy with the overall moisturizing effect over time, directly after using this wash, your skin will feel tacky and tight. It feels like you&#x27;ve just used a very poor quality soap. While most cheap products have a great experience during use, but long term effects are terrible, the initial impression of Everyday Coconut is a bad one, but long term use leads to great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Price&lt;br /&gt;+ FairTrade&lt;br /&gt;+ Moisturizing after extended use&lt;br /&gt;- Chemical smell&lt;br /&gt;- Unpleasant initial feeling on skin</li>
            <li> I love the way this soap cleans, its light moisturizing effect, and its mild scent.  But my 13-year old son &amp;#34;borrowed&amp;#34; it one evening and now it&#x27;s in his shower, so I must order more for myself! That&#x27;s how good this product is!</li>
            <li> The smell is awful.  It smelled like I was taking a shower at a rest stop.  I threw the bottle away as soon as I had used it one time. I learned my lesson on ordering something like this online.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hydrate like it says and leave my skin dry and itching. It also smells terrible, nothing like coconut. Also they packaged it wrong and more than half was all over the box when I opened it.</li>
            <li> the woman and i both love it. smells good and feels good and rinses off nice. pump is super handy. will be buying more of this when we run out.</li>
            <li> This lotion not only smells great, feels amazing and makes my skin look smooth and supple - it and the body wash have almost completely healed my most recent massive acne episode! I&#x27;m a believer!</li>
            <li> I love this product! Usually natural products are way overpriced, but this brand isn&#x27;t! I love the body wash. It works, smells nice but not too strong, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about any harsh chemicals. Plus the company benefits women of developing countries.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, leaves my skin super hidrated &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> THIS IS A WONDERFUL PRODUCT.  I AM GLUTEN INTOLORANT AND SO FAR THIS PRODUCT HAS NOT CAUSED ANY PROBLEMS.  THE ONLY FAULT I CAN FIND IS THE PUMP DIDN&#x27;T/DOESN&#x27;T WORK...COULD NOT  OPEN IT AND I HAD TO GO PURCHASE ANOTHER PUMP FROM A BEAUTY SUPPLY STORE.  OTHER THAN THAT ALL IS WELL.</li>
            <li> I really like this body wash.  It makes your skin silky soft and the aroma is very clean.  I will purchase again.  Also nice size bottle and shipping was great!</li>
            <li> This Every Day Coconut Super Hydrating Body Wash is gentle yet effective. It has a light coconut fragrance and foams very well too. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and makes it smell nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says its Paraben free, No animal Testing, No SLS, No Synthetic Fragrance, Gluten Free. It lasts a long too. I would buy again</li>
            <li> Sooooo moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;Great product&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Leaves you feeling squeaky clean will buy again</li>
            <li> Thought this body wash was organic.  Some of ingredients are not organic.  Ordered it because I have become allergic to different body washes and soaps.  After trying this for a couple of days, I had an allergic reaction to it and could not use it anymore.  This is my first time having a bad experience with something I have ordered through Amazon.  It will not deter me from ordering anything else.  I love Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love these Alaffia coconut products, they&#x27;re the best I&#x27;ve found and they&#x27;re hard to find!</li>
            <li> Nice body wash, leaves skin comfortable, non-irritating or heavily perfumed. All natural. Huge size, extremely good value for money!</li>
            <li> Smells good, doesn&#x27;t dry out skin.</li>
