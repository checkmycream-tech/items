            <li>This fragrance is the best, not too strong or overpowering,</li>
            <li>Good smell</li>
            <li>so I ve&#x27; bought some perfumes, and its incredible how many replicates they sell here including amazon llc</li>
            <li>THE PRICE WAS GOOD, SO</li>
            <li>Every time I wear something else I hear \\&quot;you smell really good, but that Curve</li>
            <li>this smells awesome and is cheap for as good as it is.</li>
            <li>I luv this scent &amp; was happy to find a bottle of this perfume for so cheap!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;VE GOTTEN MANY COMPLIMENTS ON IT!</li>
            <li>but don stay more than an hour&#x27;</li>
            <li>It sure didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>its ok.</li>
            <li>which i like better in a perfume.</li>
            <li>and i love it</li>
            <li>and I still love it.  </li>
            <li>I TOOK A CHANCE AND WAS QUITE SURPRISED THAT IT SMELLS GREAT.</li>
            <li>It is light, clean and easy.</li>
            <li>and she said it was mild and not at all overpowering.  </li>
            <li>after the 1st spray-right away- its strong- a bit too much.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was expecting!</li>
            <li>just right.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing this since it first came out in 2000, just in time for my first date with my husband, and I wore it on our wedding day.</li>
            <li>If they ever stop making this I&#x27;m in a real bind!</li>
            <li>It smells like the real thing and looks exactly Like it</li>
            <li>Not the real thing.</li>
            <li>(Dolce &amp; Gabbana Light Blue is similar but is lacking something, and more than double the price.)</li>
            <li>After it comes down, then i like it better.</li>
            <li>but the smell didn&#x27;t last the whole day like my real one.</li>
            <li>Definitely priced right for frequent use.</li>
            <li>I would return it but was surprised to read that amazon doesn&#x27;t return perfumes.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I luv this scent &amp; was happy to find a bottle of this perfume for so cheap! It was exactly what I was expecting! I def would order this again</li>
            <li> Good smell but don stay more than an hour&#x27; FAKE&lt;br /&gt;I tried to make a product line to sell on my country, (dominican republic) so I ve&#x27; bought some perfumes, and its incredible how many replicates they sell here including amazon llc</li>
            <li> This fragrance is the best, not too strong or overpowering, just right.  I am very happy with this great fragrance.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I wanted to order this because in the reviews people were saying it was fake and the smell didn&#x27;t last long,  well guess what? It sure didn&#x27;t. It smells like the real thing and looks exactly Like it but the smell didn&#x27;t last the whole day like my real one.</li>
            <li> Its not the best ever. After it comes down, then i like it better. after the 1st spray-right away- its strong- a bit too much. then it settles, n its ok. not sweet at all, which i like better in a perfume.</li>
            <li> Excellent perfume, I loved it.</li>
            <li> Not the real thing. I have a vial sample of this which smells wonderful and lasts.  This does not. I would return it but was surprised to read that amazon doesn&#x27;t return perfumes. Too bad. Guess I&#x27;ll give it to the thrift shop.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT, GOOD CARE OF SELLER. I RECOMMEND 100%</li>
            <li> I ORDER THIS NOT KNOWING WHAT TO EXPECT. THE PRICE WAS GOOD, SO WHAT THE HECK. I TOOK A CHANCE AND WAS QUITE SURPRISED THAT IT SMELLS GREAT. I&#x27;VE GOTTEN MANY COMPLIMENTS ON IT! I RECOMMEND IT!</li>
            <li> use it for daily&lt;br /&gt;good as explained&lt;br /&gt;quality is good&lt;br /&gt;i bought it for my self and i love it</li>
            <li> very good quality, excellent fragrance. I recommend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this since it first came out in 2000, just in time for my first date with my husband, and I wore it on our wedding day. It&#x27;s become my signature scent and I&#x27;m still getting compliments on it. Every time I wear something else I hear \\&quot;you smell really good, but that Curve...\\&quot; I&#x27;ve been on a hunt for a newer (updated) scent but nothing compares. (Dolce &amp; Gabbana Light Blue is similar but is lacking something, and more than double the price.) If they ever stop making this I&#x27;m in a real bind!</li>
            <li> this smells awesome and is cheap for as good as it is. i recommend this to anyone! great buy folks</li>
            <li> I really like this sent for everyday use. It is light, clean and easy. Definitely priced right for frequent use.</li>
            <li> I received Curve as a gift years ago and I still love it.  I get compliments all the time wearing it.</li>
            <li> OK...I was born with no sense of smell.  I have to be careful when I choose this type of cologne.  I read the reviews and decided to try it.  I asked a friend to smell it for me and she said it was mild and not at all overpowering.  This is all I can say. I use it every day and I like it.</li>
