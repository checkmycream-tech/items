            <li>Love love love the smell.</li>
            <li>I really love this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the Orange by Hugo Boss for my husband after enjoying a sample.</li>
            <li>I freakin love this stuff</li>
            <li>Excellent product, very high quality, really recommend it, product purchased and imported into Venezuela</li>
            <li>He loved it so much .....</li>
            <li>Love the sweet, but not overpowering orange smell that makes me feel like a boss.</li>
            <li>It is a light fragrant cologne.</li>
            <li>I was lucky to sample this before it was on the market and could not wait to buy it.</li>
            <li>so fresh buy is not perfum for all dfay</li>
            <li>Replaced a smaller sized bottle that I bought at duty free shop in airport but paid more at airport.</li>
            <li>It was worth the buy</li>

            <li>/&gt;The smell is ok but it doesnt last</li>
            <li>i think you will get more compliments from the original boss (green cap) bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>really even when some nozzle gets defective...</li>
            <li>However it&#x27;s will be fast faded, you will need to apply it gradually throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Customers should contact their local government or local waste company for directions on how to dispose of Household Hazardous Waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I got exactly what I expected from the add in your store.</li>
