            <li>Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this the shipping was incredibly fast.</li>
            <li>I am afraid of washing it though because of the blush being so dainty and being able to fade quickly with one wash (I observe), but other it soon becoming a different color in the future, I wish to cherish it for the time being.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still debating on what to use it for, because if I put make up inside, I&#x27;m scared somehow it will leak and ruin this adorable little</li>

            <li>It arrived super eariler than expected, like 2-3 weeks early.</li>
            <li>and she loves how soft it is.</li>
            <li>Yes it&#x27;s very cute, but in only 2 days the zipper broke and it collects dust, dirt and any other small particle on the planet.</li>
            <li>but also it&#x27;s small enough to fit your purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>came in a plastic package, way earlier than expected I may add, and looks exactly like the picture</li>
            <li>(By the way, the deodorant stick looks small in this photo, but it is full sized)</li>

            <li> So soft and cute! I use this as a pencil bag and can stuff it pretty full.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really cute had it for a while but the zipper broke and I couldn&#x27;t fix it bummer. It&#x27;s kinda big I thought it was going to be smaller.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely everything I had hoped it would be. It is so soft, and oh my goodness, the blush on it is too cute! My makeup fits into it also. I ordered this item on February 6, and it arrived March 2.</li>
            <li> I love this item! It is soft and plush and even roomier than I expected, which is great! The quality seems to be very good, so I will try to update after I use it for awhile. My estimated shipping date was about a month after I bought the product, but it actually arrived within about a week. I think this product is exceptional for the price that it is. I highly recommend it! I included a few items in my photo to give people an idea of how big the bag is. (By the way, the deodorant stick looks small in this photo, but it is full sized)</li>
            <li> OK product just took 2 long mths to receive.</li>
            <li> Great price! Adorable! Shipped quickly and definitely worth the price! This Cat Lady was super happy! Meow....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so fluffy and soft!  I know I may sound like a crazy cat fanatic.. but the product really is pretty nice.&lt;br /&gt;It came in a plastic package, way earlier than expected I may add, and looks exactly like the picture shows.&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit though, was bigger than expected, the lotion in the picture looks like travel size (mini) but it must be average size.</li>
            <li> I really love this product!&lt;br /&gt;it came before time, the bag is really beautiful and good quality. Everything fits in it, from make up to lotion.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s big enough to carry what you need but also it&#x27;s small enough to fit your purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE IT!! plus it&#x27;s really cute.</li>
            <li> This arived yesterday, and I can&#x27;t believe how cute and fluffy this is, the kitty&#x27;s cheek&#x27;s aren&#x27;t as blushed as it is in the picture, but that&#x27;s okay! It is super soft and you can fit a lot of things in it! I put my cosmetic things and my utensils for school, the bow seems to be... Okay, I mean it&#x27;salittle bent, kinda like the picture, but again, it&#x27;s okay! Worth the price! :D And it came 1 week earlier.</li>
            <li> I used it when I went overnight at a friends house and it held a lot of my stuff; toothbrush, paste, makeup, deodorant. Very cute and soft came early and was a bit bigger than I thought which was awesome! Thank you so much and I will definitely recommend.:)</li>
            <li> I adore this little bag! I wanted this makeup bag to store my nail polishes in because I didn&#x27;t have proper storage for them, and it&#x27;s perfect! The product comes just as described and arrived to me within 1 month of ordering it (expected for deliveries from China). I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars right now because I don&#x27;t know how durable it is, but I&#x27;m sure with minimal wear it will be fine!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so utterly adorable and very kawaii. My friends can&#x27;t take their paws off it! I am afraid of washing it though because of the blush being so dainty and being able to fade quickly with one wash (I observe), but other it soon becoming a different color in the future, I wish to cherish it for the time being. I recommend buying this product!</li>
            <li> It arrived super eariler than expected, like 2-3 weeks early. The quality is amazing, no problems yet. It&#x27;s exactly as the picture, and it is super soft. A good size too. My new favorite buy, worth all of the money, thank you so much for this:DDDDD</li>
            <li> l&#x27;ve kept this on my wishlist because i thought it was cute and one day when i went to check, it was a penny! I got two of course and got them earlier than expected! They&#x27;re super cute and i totally got them for a steal ^^</li>
            <li> This thing is sooo soft! I love it. I had ordered to keep stuff in it like medicine and such and it has plenty of room for all that:)</li>
            <li> It was bigger than I thought it would be and I love my new kitty make up bag! Plus it came way earlier than the estimated shipping date!</li>
            <li> This is the BEST makeup bag out there. It&#x27;s huge and I don&#x27;t mind because I carry large handbags and this makeup bag is perfect because it fits everything I need! I am so glad I purchased this. I will continue to purchase this item again and again.</li>
            <li> Nice size for a small/medium makeup bag. Very soft &amp; cute.</li>
            <li> This bag is super adorable and exactly as shown on the picture. It came nicely sealed, clean, and sooner than the expected shipping date. I am very pleased with the cute bag, and can&#x27;t wait to use it. I&#x27;m still debating on what to use it for, because if I put make up inside, I&#x27;m scared somehow it will leak and ruin this adorable little case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again, and think it was nicely priced and well worth every penny. If you&#x27;re into cute things like me, I highly suggest this. :)</li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s very cute, but in only 2 days the zipper broke and it collects dust, dirt and any other small particle on the planet. I guess in the two days it was still in working order it was a great purchase.</li>
            <li> This little bag is super cute. I&#x27;ve been using it as a makeup bag, and have been receiving so many compliments :-)</li>
            <li> Came much earlier than expected, very good quality, would buy again!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and I thought the picture made it seem like the actual product would be a let down, but no. It&#x27;s equally as cute and big as some other reviewers mentioned.</li>
