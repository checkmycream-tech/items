            <li>This would be a good choice if you&#x27;re one of them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wonderfully smooth, soothing and smells great!  </li>
            <li>They all work well and smell good.</li>
            <li>Regardless of the smell, the cream is great on my skin and among the most protective of anything out there.</li>
            <li>Love this shaving cream, great price and lasts for months.</li>

            <li>everything totally ok!</li>
            <li>And enjoyed it to boot!</li>
            <li>Lathered very nicely and very quickly, without a lot of work.</li>
            <li>My brother discovered how amazing this stuff is after I had some with me while visiting him.</li>
            <li>This is my sixth TOBS cream - I really think that they&#x27;re awesome.</li>
            <li>Smells nice and the scent doesn&#x27;t seem to linger.</li>
            <li>so I bought one to try out and liked it</li>
            <li>Have tried many fragrances and loved them</li>
            <li>nice aroma&lt;br</li>
            <li>, the cream provides a nice, moist shave.</li>
            <li>but to each his own.</li>
            <li>The texture of the cream is really nice.</li>
            <li>I make my own shaving cream and pre shave oils.</li>
            <li>Not too strong a scent, just very pleasant and soothing, yet a good scent that combines a number of scents that I really like.</li>
            <li>What I didn&#x27;t care for though (and most of the shave creams I have are TOBS was the scent (I also own TOBS Avocado, St Jermyn, Shaving Shop, Lavender, Eton College, Proraso, DR Harris Windsor and Arlington, Cyril R. Salter Rose).</li>
            <li>As with all the ToOBS shaving cream, it is super creamy and creates a great lather.</li>
            <li>As with all variations, this Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Taylor of Old Bond Street makes the best shaving cream out there - and this one is no exception.</li>
            <li>If you enjoy a good quality shaving cream this brand should be in your rotation.</li>
            <li>When figured that way it makes the price difference between TOBS and aerosols almost negligible, not to mention that all these TOBS creams are made with noticeably better ingredients.</li>
            <li>, this one certainly isn&#x27;t my favorite.  </li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t say that I love it.  </li>
            <li>i love the scent.</li>
            <li>Let me start with the fact that I love TOBS products.  </li>
            <li>The cream just seemed oily and not of the top quality I have come to expect from this company.  </li>
            <li>You may find that wherever it starts out, it may work its way to the top of your list.</li>
            <li>I plan on purchasing more of this shaving cream when the time comes.</li>
            <li>As a result the container is slippery and the content inside the container are mashed against the top.  </li>
            <li>It either needs better packaging or the screw-on lid needs to be tightened more at the point of manufacturing.  </li>
            <li>That said, I love the Sandalwood version.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite shave soaps.  </li>
            <li>I do have to use a pre-shave oil before I lather for better prevention of razor burn.  </li>
            <li>I love taylors shaving cream</li>
            <li>This one is more of a soapy smell-</li>
            <li>bowl of shaving cream lasts longer than I got out of 6 or more metal cans of shaving gel or cream.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!</li>
            <li>But, if you enjoy classic barbershop/powder/lightly floral and musky scents, you are gonna be happy</li>
            <li>Shaves are comfortable, regal smelling and enjoyable (when time permits).</li>
            <li>The cream provides excellent lubrication, and I have absolutely no irritation after I shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shaving Shop is one of my favorite scents from Taylor, though their lavender is also fantastic.</li>
            <li>Short and sweet, this is some of the best shaving cream money can buy.</li>
            <li>You can whip this cream into a good lather without much effort at all after loading just the tips of your brush.</li>
            <li>Well, I can indeed detect that, but to me it&#x27;s more &amp;#34;powdery&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;floral;&amp;#34; not what I conjure up as a barber shop at all (and I&#x27;m of an age where I know real barber shops, the kind depicted by &amp;#34;Floyd&#x27;s&amp;#34; in Mayberry).  </li>
            <li>There are plenty of folks who thought Sandalwood was too strong.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many of the Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving creams and I have loved them all... except this one.  </li>
            <li>Using the assorted creams that are out there is fine.  </li>
            <li>This one is no different from the rest in that it lathers well, lubricates my face and makes for a more pleasant shave.  </li>
            <li>Had to learn with practice how little to use, but a great product!</li>
            <li>This shaving cream is rich with a very mild fragrance.</li>
            <li>Smells great and leaves the skin feeling better than any other cream I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Rich, creamy, and smooth.</li>
            <li>Found the scent a bit old fashioned (brings back memories as a kid messing with my Dad&#x27;s shaving stuff) but very light; any aftershave/cologne can mask the scent so good for those who have their own scent</li>
            <li>This creme builds a nice cushy and slick lather with minimal effort and it has a nice clean refreshing scent too.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I really do love the fact that all the other Taylor shaving creams have a nice light scent that makes shaving pleasant and disappears after the final rinse, but this stuff just clings and goes on and never dies.  </li>
            <li>Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream is simply an amazing product.</li>
            <li>Gives him a nice close shave and keep his skin soft and non-irritated.</li>
            <li>The scent is very manly and not at all overpowering like most shaving creams can be.</li>
            <li>This is especially true with my double edge razor and boar bristle brush.</li>
            <li>Good protective and slick lather and nice scent that is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>It smells a bit strong at first when shaving and softens throughout the day.</li>
            <li>It has a classic, muted scent that isn&#x27;t over the top at all.</li>
            <li>For me that happened quickly.</li>
            <li>This particular plain one is not my favorite from the brand, but is nice in its own way.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t recommend anything more highly.</li>
            <li>It provides a nice slick surface that allows whatever razor you choose to track nicely and cut the hair clean without irritation.  </li>
            <li>He liked it so much he bought 5 more in different fragrances.</li>
            <li>It smells exactly like the cheap overpowering \\&quot;sandalwood\\&quot; after shave colognes some men used to drench themselves with - that&#x27;s what Taylor&#x27;s Shaving Shop shaving cream smells</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
            <li>This product is very good but expensive, and I feel that the leaking and mashing to the top ends up wasting some of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I personally don&#x27;t find it offensive, but it&#x27;s more powerful than Mr. Taylor&#x27;s, St. James or Eton, so you really get a nose-full, and it also seems to endure longer, much more like a perfume than a shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>but when i opened it the lid was partially opened and a good portion of it had spilled out.</li>
            <li>Worth the cost in my view.</li>
            <li>but it is worth the money</li>
            <li>My wife loves Shaving Shop on me, and I&#x27;ve gotten consistently excellent shaves since I started wet shaving back in 2005.</li>
            <li>If that is your speed, Shaving Shop will be right up your alley.</li>
            <li>This cream comes in a reusable bowl if you need it.&lt;br /&gt;The lather generated is a pleasure if done right.  </li>
            <li>with the right tools.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve purchased Mr. Taylor&#x27;s (my favorite scent), the relatively new Natural (no scent; perhaps my favorite CREAM), St. James, Eton College, Avocado (won&#x27;t do that again -</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit more than a soap or the canned stuff, but it&#x27;s a relatively affordable luxury that I find well worth it.</li>
            <li>Growing up, my local barber used a straight razor and warm shaving cream to finish off my neck line.</li>
            <li>product makes an excellent lather to shave with and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Since I swapped from canned cream to Taylor&#x27;s I have been able to stop using facial moisturizer after shaving.</li>
            <li>first time user of shaving cream instead of soap.  </li>
            <li>This is my first shaving cream for DE shaving.</li>
            <li>He is now an avid buyer as well.</li>
            <li>far, Taylor of Old Bond Street &amp;#34;Shaving Shop&amp;#34; cream is my favorite.</li>
            <li>It loads on all my brushes with ease and helps my DE razor slice easily through my whiskers - even after several days of beard growth.</li>
            <li>While this scent is probably my least favorite of the TOBS creams (or favourite since we are discussing a proper British cream), performance is as great as the others.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>thanks to the seller</li>
            <li>My wife really likes when I shave with this scent.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>This particular scent has a very classic men&#x27;s smell too it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll certainly use my jar, but because of this I won&#x27;t be buying this particular &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; again.  </li>
            <li>The quality of the lather and soap is great as usual, but the scent is pretty strong and not very pleasant (to me).  </li>
            <li>The other two creams I&#x27;ve used have a better scent.</li>
            <li>Be careful, it creates so much lather, it&#x27;s easy to put too much on your brush than you really need.</li>
            <li>Performance aside - what I really like about Shaving Shop is that classic Barber Shop scent that I remember as a kid.</li>
            <li>I am so happy that I switched back to &amp;#34;wet shaving.&amp;#34; And Taylor of Old Bond Street products, especially shaving cream, are one of the big reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t like the scent (YMMV) - HEAVY grandma&#x27;s rose, essence of new mown grass and, it took me a while to come up with the memory, the inside of a pumpkin being carved for Halloween - the avocado comes from the avocado oil it contains, not from any smell of an avocado that I can detect)</li>
            <li>I had a new canister with me on a business trip, only to have had it opened by TSA and a huge handful scooped out of it for &#x27;testing&#x27;.</li>
            <li>During the shave the cream continues to impress with the lather maintaining its body nicely, having no tendency to dry down to quickly or become runny in texture.  </li>
            <li>First time user of Taylor of Old Bond Street products.</li>
            <li>The scent is more like average hand soap.</li>
            <li>(parabens live here, for real) and the subjective (smell, power and duration of smell).  </li>
            <li>If not and thick lather/lubrication is your priority, this is definitely a outstanding!</li>
            <li>It is very easy to build a lather in about 10 seconds with a small amount of cream.  </li>
            <li>I suggest before you buy this and other samples if scent is important to you.  </li>
            <li>The cartridge razors actually pulled whiskers more than they cut them, and they were terribly rough on skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In terms of function, the texture of the shaving cream is very soft, but not slimy.  </li>
            <li>Not sure what ingredient it is that gives it that unique smell, but I am absolutely hooked.</li>
            <li>Taylor of Old Bond Street never disappoints.</li>
            <li>that yes, was there when I bought, was an OLD product photo.  </li>
            <li>smells like an old fashioned barber shop</li>
            <li>I find that other shave creams that are solid, instead of goopy, like this cream, work better - and last longer.  </li>
            <li>The cream has a consistency that is easy to work with when scooping out a small amount to lather up for a shave.  </li>
            <li>However, it isn&#x27;t as thick and rich as the Sandalwood or the Mr. Taylors creams - but it does lather very well.</li>
            <li>The aroma is vaguely reminiscent of a barber shop, not sure how to describe it any better.</li>
            <li>I use a small bowel with a simple brush and just a dab of the cream makes an sufficient lather for 3 applications, possibly more.</li>
            <li>Will never buy this particular product again but will go back to the trusted containers of TOBS.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the same high quality as the last</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t recommend Taylor of Old Bond Street enough as a brand.</li>
            <li>In the four months since I switched back, I have already saved considerable money.</li>
            <li>The water where I live is very hard, and getting good lather when you&#x27;re groggy and running late in the morning can be chancy, but Taylor creams have never let me down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shaving Shop is a hard scent to describe but it&#x27;s a clean, manly smell</li>
            <li>It took almost nothing for an and exploding lather that was thick, rich, and lubricating.</li>
            <li>After two shaves the lid went back on the jar and it went to the back of the shelf and will be used as a backup in case I ever run out of my regular Taylor of Old Bond Street - which I hope never, ever happens.</li>
            <li>I previously used the Sandalwood variety and much prefer its manly scent that this.</li>
            <li>The tub lasts a really long time; daily use should get you a few months worth of shaves.</li>
            <li>Just like all their creams, the Shaving Shop version is high quality, high performance and produces a thick, creamy lather.</li>

            <li> I do have to use a pre-shave oil before I lather for better prevention of razor burn.  </li>
            <li> I love taylors shaving cream</li>
            <li> This one is more of a soapy smell-</li>
            <li> bowl of shaving cream lasts longer than I got out of 6 or more metal cans of shaving gel or cream.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!</li>
            <li> But, if you enjoy classic barbershop/powder/lightly floral and musky scents, you are gonna be happy</li>
            <li> Shaves are comfortable, regal smelling and enjoyable (when time permits).</li>
            <li> The cream provides excellent lubrication, and I have absolutely no irritation after I shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shaving Shop is one of my favorite scents from Taylor, though their lavender is also fantastic.</li>
            <li> Short and sweet, this is some of the best shaving cream money can buy.</li>
            <li> You can whip this cream into a good lather without much effort at all after loading just the tips of your brush.</li>
            <li> Well, I can indeed detect that, but to me it&#x27;s more &amp;#34;powdery&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;floral;&amp;#34; not what I conjure up as a barber shop at all (and I&#x27;m of an age where I know real barber shops, the kind depicted by &amp;#34;Floyd&#x27;s&amp;#34; in Mayberry).  </li>
            <li> There are plenty of folks who thought Sandalwood was too strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many of the Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving creams and I have loved them all... except this one.  </li>
            <li> Using the assorted creams that are out there is fine.  </li>
            <li> This one is no different from the rest in that it lathers well, lubricates my face and makes for a more pleasant shave.  </li>
            <li> Had to learn with practice how little to use, but a great product!</li>
            <li> This shaving cream is rich with a very mild fragrance.</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves the skin feeling better than any other cream I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Rich, creamy, and smooth.</li>
            <li> Found the scent a bit old fashioned (brings back memories as a kid messing with my Dad&#x27;s shaving stuff) but very light; any aftershave/cologne can mask the scent so good for those who have their own scent</li>
            <li> This creme builds a nice cushy and slick lather with minimal effort and it has a nice clean refreshing scent too.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I really do love the fact that all the other Taylor shaving creams have a nice light scent that makes shaving pleasant and disappears after the final rinse, but this stuff just clings and goes on and never dies.  </li>
            <li> Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream is simply an amazing product.</li>
            <li> Gives him a nice close shave and keep his skin soft and non-irritated.</li>
            <li> The scent is very manly and not at all overpowering like most shaving creams can be.</li>
            <li> This is especially true with my double edge razor and boar bristle brush.</li>
            <li> Good protective and slick lather and nice scent that is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> It smells a bit strong at first when shaving and softens throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It has a classic, muted scent that isn&#x27;t over the top at all.</li>
            <li> For me that happened quickly.</li>
            <li> This particular plain one is not my favorite from the brand, but is nice in its own way.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t recommend anything more highly.</li>
            <li> It provides a nice slick surface that allows whatever razor you choose to track nicely and cut the hair clean without irritation.  </li>
            <li> He liked it so much he bought 5 more in different fragrances.</li>
            <li> It smells exactly like the cheap overpowering \\&quot;sandalwood\\&quot; after shave colognes some men used to drench themselves with - that&#x27;s what Taylor&#x27;s Shaving Shop shaving cream smells</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
            <li> This product is very good but expensive, and I feel that the leaking and mashing to the top ends up wasting some of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t find it offensive, but it&#x27;s more powerful than Mr. Taylor&#x27;s, St. James or Eton, so you really get a nose-full, and it also seems to endure longer, much more like a perfume than a shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> but when i opened it the lid was partially opened and a good portion of it had spilled out.</li>
            <li> Worth the cost in my view.</li>
            <li> but it is worth the money</li>
            <li> My wife loves Shaving Shop on me, and I&#x27;ve gotten consistently excellent shaves since I started wet shaving back in 2005.</li>
            <li> If that is your speed, Shaving Shop will be right up your alley.</li>
            <li> This cream comes in a reusable bowl if you need it.&lt;br /&gt;The lather generated is a pleasure if done right.  </li>
            <li> with the right tools.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve purchased Mr. Taylor&#x27;s (my favorite scent), the relatively new Natural (no scent; perhaps my favorite CREAM), St. James, Eton College, Avocado (won&#x27;t do that again -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit more than a soap or the canned stuff, but it&#x27;s a relatively affordable luxury that I find well worth it.</li>
            <li> Growing up, my local barber used a straight razor and warm shaving cream to finish off my neck line.</li>
            <li> product makes an excellent lather to shave with and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Since I swapped from canned cream to Taylor&#x27;s I have been able to stop using facial moisturizer after shaving.</li>
            <li> first time user of shaving cream instead of soap.  </li>
            <li> This is my first shaving cream for DE shaving.</li>
            <li> He is now an avid buyer as well.</li>
            <li> far, Taylor of Old Bond Street &amp;#34;Shaving Shop&amp;#34; cream is my favorite.</li>
            <li> It loads on all my brushes with ease and helps my DE razor slice easily through my whiskers - even after several days of beard growth.</li>
            <li> While this scent is probably my least favorite of the TOBS creams (or favourite since we are discussing a proper British cream), performance is as great as the others.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> thanks to the seller</li>
            <li> My wife really likes when I shave with this scent.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> This particular scent has a very classic men&#x27;s smell too it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll certainly use my jar, but because of this I won&#x27;t be buying this particular &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; again.  </li>
            <li> The quality of the lather and soap is great as usual, but the scent is pretty strong and not very pleasant (to me).  </li>
            <li> The other two creams I&#x27;ve used have a better scent.</li>
            <li> Be careful, it creates so much lather, it&#x27;s easy to put too much on your brush than you really need.</li>
            <li> Performance aside - what I really like about Shaving Shop is that classic Barber Shop scent that I remember as a kid.</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I switched back to &amp;#34;wet shaving.&amp;#34; And Taylor of Old Bond Street products, especially shaving cream, are one of the big reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like the scent (YMMV) - HEAVY grandma&#x27;s rose, essence of new mown grass and, it took me a while to come up with the memory, the inside of a pumpkin being carved for Halloween - the avocado comes from the avocado oil it contains, not from any smell of an avocado that I can detect)</li>
            <li> I had a new canister with me on a business trip, only to have had it opened by TSA and a huge handful scooped out of it for &#x27;testing&#x27;.</li>
            <li> During the shave the cream continues to impress with the lather maintaining its body nicely, having no tendency to dry down to quickly or become runny in texture.  </li>
            <li> First time user of Taylor of Old Bond Street products.</li>
            <li> The scent is more like average hand soap.</li>
            <li> (parabens live here, for real) and the subjective (smell, power and duration of smell).  </li>
            <li> If not and thick lather/lubrication is your priority, this is definitely a outstanding!</li>
            <li> It is very easy to build a lather in about 10 seconds with a small amount of cream.  </li>
            <li> I suggest before you buy this and other samples if scent is important to you.  </li>
            <li> The cartridge razors actually pulled whiskers more than they cut them, and they were terribly rough on skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In terms of function, the texture of the shaving cream is very soft, but not slimy.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what ingredient it is that gives it that unique smell, but I am absolutely hooked.</li>
            <li> Taylor of Old Bond Street never disappoints.</li>
            <li> that yes, was there when I bought, was an OLD product photo.  </li>
            <li> smells like an old fashioned barber shop</li>
            <li> I find that other shave creams that are solid, instead of goopy, like this cream, work better - and last longer.  </li>
            <li> The cream has a consistency that is easy to work with when scooping out a small amount to lather up for a shave.  </li>
            <li> However, it isn&#x27;t as thick and rich as the Sandalwood or the Mr. Taylors creams - but it does lather very well.</li>
            <li> The aroma is vaguely reminiscent of a barber shop, not sure how to describe it any better.</li>
            <li> I use a small bowel with a simple brush and just a dab of the cream makes an sufficient lather for 3 applications, possibly more.</li>
            <li> Will never buy this particular product again but will go back to the trusted containers of TOBS.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the same high quality as the last</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t recommend Taylor of Old Bond Street enough as a brand.</li>
            <li> In the four months since I switched back, I have already saved considerable money.</li>
            <li> The water where I live is very hard, and getting good lather when you&#x27;re groggy and running late in the morning can be chancy, but Taylor creams have never let me down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shaving Shop is a hard scent to describe but it&#x27;s a clean, manly smell</li>
            <li> It took almost nothing for an and exploding lather that was thick, rich, and lubricating.</li>
            <li> After two shaves the lid went back on the jar and it went to the back of the shelf and will be used as a backup in case I ever run out of my regular Taylor of Old Bond Street - which I hope never, ever happens.</li>
            <li> I previously used the Sandalwood variety and much prefer its manly scent that this.</li>
            <li> The tub lasts a really long time; daily use should get you a few months worth of shaves.</li>
            <li> Just like all their creams, the Shaving Shop version is high quality, high performance and produces a thick, creamy lather.</li>
            <li> Of the other five, NONE of them contain parabens (even though some old photos of the ingredients labels that I&#x27;ve seen show them).</li>
            <li> I used shaving foams and gels for sooooo long and I will never ever go back.  </li>
            <li> /&gt; lasts a long time&lt;br /&gt;easy to apply and lathers well.</li>
            <li> It lathers extremely well and a single tub can last a very long time once you learn how to judge the amount of creme you need to work up a hearty lather.  </li>
            <li> The smell is a little sharper and stronger - I found it to be more irritating to my skin than the Sandalwood version, and also gets me a little sneezy.</li>
            <li> I am not positive that the product wasn&#x27;t adulterated from the shipping company for whatever reason.  </li>
            <li> Just a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> If you have used other TOBS cremes before, this one will not disappoint you at all.  </li>
            <li> Not as slick/lubricating as some of the other shaving creams/soaps that I have used.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not knocking other creams as this one serves it</li>
            <li> I always keep the shave shop cream on hand, I also have tubs of other scents laying around</li>
            <li> Postshave is a little dry</li>
            <li> A small amount in a shave bowl or whisked across a brush generates enough thick lather for a multiple pass shave.</li>
            <li> The only negative comment which is why i did not give it 5 stars was on the shipping.</li>
            <li> to produce lather with just a half soaked brush in a bowl.</li>
            <li> I wish it was a little cheaper</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the scent of this one.</li>
            <li> I would like to order this product again but worry to have the same unfortunate experience.</li>
            <li> Scent was a complete disappointment.  </li>
            <li> Other people complained of the smell, but it is very subtle and after rinsing your face you can&#x27;t even smell it.  </li>
            <li> SO (buyer beware, which is why I&#x27;m doing this review), I&#x27;d at least HOPED that the Amazon photo</li>
            <li> Now for some, that may not matter in the least, and I respect that.  </li>
            <li> The scent is very subtle, and has a somewhat sterile, slightly flowery smell.</li>
            <li> It seemed artificial and took several passes to sort of get used to it.  </li>
            <li> The Shaving Shop scent is floral, with maybe a subtle bit of musk.</li>
            <li> And the blades (I use Persona Israeli Reds) are sooooo much less expensive than cartridges.</li>
            <li> Lather works well and have not experienced irritation.</li>
            <li> Yet to have had a single bad or even mediocre product from them.</li>
            <li> After having a dirty glove go through something, I didn&#x27;t want it on my face.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t unpleasant -</li>
            <li> Also, while it&#x27;s hard to convey a smell (just like taste - ever see the description of wines??!!!!)</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Smells great without being overpowering, gives a nice lather with a badger hair brush, and facilitates a nice smooth shave that leaves the skin feeling great.</li>
            <li> Taylor of Old Bond Street never disappoints. Yet to have had a single bad or even mediocre product from them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a devoted Taylor&#x27;s fan. This shaving cream is rich with a very mild fragrance. Since I swapped from canned cream to Taylor&#x27;s I have been able to stop using facial moisturizer after shaving.</li>
            <li> As with all variations, this Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream works wonderfully. A small amount in a shave bowl or whisked across a brush generates enough thick lather for a multiple pass shave. The tub lasts a really long time; daily use should get you a few months worth of shaves. When figured that way it makes the price difference between TOBS and aerosols almost negligible, not to mention that all these TOBS creams are made with noticeably better ingredients. Shaves are comfortable, regal smelling and enjoyable (when time permits). The Shaving Shop scent is floral, with maybe a subtle bit of musk. If that is your speed, Shaving Shop will be right up your alley. While this scent is probably my least favorite of the TOBS creams (or favourite since we are discussing a proper British cream), performance is as great as the others.&lt;br /&gt;I give an objective five stars for quality, a subjective two for scent. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big TOBS fan and have collected almost all of their shaving creams.  This one is no different from the rest in that it lathers well, lubricates my face and makes for a more pleasant shave.  The aroma is vaguely reminiscent of a barber shop, not sure how to describe it any better.</li>
            <li> This is my sixth TOBS cream - I really think that they&#x27;re awesome. So far, I&#x27;ve purchased Mr. Taylor&#x27;s (my favorite scent), the relatively new Natural (no scent; perhaps my favorite CREAM), St. James, Eton College, Avocado (won&#x27;t do that again - didn&#x27;t like the scent (YMMV) - HEAVY grandma&#x27;s rose, essence of new mown grass and, it took me a while to come up with the memory, the inside of a pumpkin being carved for Halloween - the avocado comes from the avocado oil it contains, not from any smell of an avocado that I can detect) and I recently received this, the Shaving Shop.  Of the other five, NONE of them contain parabens (even though some old photos of the ingredients labels that I&#x27;ve seen show them). I think that TOBS has been working on removing them from their products.  SO (buyer beware, which is why I&#x27;m doing this review), I&#x27;d at least HOPED that the Amazon photo that yes, was there when I bought, was an OLD product photo.  However, it&#x27;s NOT.  I&#x27;ll post a photo that was taken 3/17/15 from the jar I received - it does indeed contain parabens.  Now for some, that may not matter in the least, and I respect that.  But I know that a lot of consumers these days are looking to avoid them, as I am.  I&#x27;ll certainly use my jar, but because of this I won&#x27;t be buying this particular &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; again.  Also, while it&#x27;s hard to convey a smell (just like taste - ever see the description of wines??!!!!), this one certainly isn&#x27;t my favorite.  I saw someone else had indicated that it smelled like a cleaning product.  Well, I can indeed detect that, but to me it&#x27;s more &amp;#34;powdery&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;floral;&amp;#34; not what I conjure up as a barber shop at all (and I&#x27;m of an age where I know real barber shops, the kind depicted by &amp;#34;Floyd&#x27;s&amp;#34; in Mayberry).  I personally don&#x27;t find it offensive, but it&#x27;s more powerful than Mr. Taylor&#x27;s, St. James or Eton, so you really get a nose-full, and it also seems to endure longer, much more like a perfume than a shaving cream.  Sothere you have it - the objective (parabens live here, for real) and the subjective (smell, power and duration of smell).  Again, YMMV, but I just wanted those who care to know that as of March, 2015, the product you might get does have parabens in it.  Happy shaving!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this cream! Gives him a nice close shave and keep his skin soft and non-irritated. Smells wonderful, too!  He liked it so much he bought 5 more in different fragrances.</li>
            <li> Taylor of Old Bond Street is the best lathering, best smelling cream out there. It&#x27;s basically a premium English cream at a less-than premium price. Shaving Shop is a hard scent to describe but it&#x27;s a clean, manly smell - maybe it reminds me of a high-end old-fashioned barber shop. Regardless of the smell, the cream is great on my skin and among the most protective of anything out there.</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves the skin feeling better than any other cream I&#x27;ve tried. The scent is very manly and not at all overpowering like most shaving creams can be.</li>
            <li> Taylor of Old Bond Street makes the best shaving cream out there - and this one is no exception. I have used their Sandalwood, and Mr. Taylor&#x27;s Shaving Cream - and ordered this Shaving Shop Cream after having used those two. You can whip this cream into a good lather without much effort at all after loading just the tips of your brush. However, it isn&#x27;t as thick and rich as the Sandalwood or the Mr. Taylors creams - but it does lather very well. The cream provides excellent lubrication, and I have absolutely no irritation after I shave. The scent is very subtle, and has a somewhat sterile, slightly flowery smell. It isn&#x27;t unpleasant - but I wouldn&#x27;t say that I love it.  The other two creams I&#x27;ve used have a better scent. However, the cream makes for a great shave. I look forward to shaving with this cream.</li>
            <li> As with all the ToOBS shaving cream, it is super creamy and creates a great lather. Be careful, it creates so much lather, it&#x27;s easy to put too much on your brush than you really need. Just a little goes a long way. This particular scent has a very classic men&#x27;s smell too it. Smells nice and the scent doesn&#x27;t seem to linger.</li>
            <li> This shaving cream is wonderful  i love the scent. It smells a bit strong at first when shaving and softens throughout the day. I use a small bowel with a simple brush and just a dab of the cream makes an sufficient lather for 3 applications, possibly more. The only negative comment which is why i did not give it 5 stars was on the shipping. The box itself did not appear damage but when i opened it the lid was partially opened and a good portion of it had spilled out. I would like to order this product again but worry to have the same unfortunate experience.</li>
            <li> It took almost nothing for an and exploding lather that was thick, rich, and lubricating. What I didn&#x27;t care for though (and most of the shave creams I have are TOBS was the scent (I also own TOBS Avocado, St Jermyn, Shaving Shop, Lavender, Eton College, Proraso, DR Harris Windsor and Arlington, Cyril R. Salter Rose). It seemed artificial and took several passes to sort of get used to it.  If it wasn&#x27;t for the lathe, i would likely not use it..  In terms of function, the texture of the shaving cream is very soft, but not slimy.  The cream has a consistency that is easy to work with when scooping out a small amount to lather up for a shave.  During the shave the cream continues to impress with the lather maintaining its body nicely, having no tendency to dry down to quickly or become runny in texture.  It provides a nice slick surface that allows whatever razor you choose to track nicely and cut the hair clean without irritation.  I suggest before you buy this and other samples if scent is important to you.  If not and thick lather/lubrication is your priority, this is definitely a outstanding!</li>
            <li> If you have used other TOBS cremes before, this one will not disappoint you at all.  This creme builds a nice cushy and slick lather with minimal effort and it has a nice clean refreshing scent too.  I bought this when heard they were going to discontinue this scent so I bought one to try out and liked it so now I have an extra tub and the Aftershave.  I have now found out that they are just going to quit making the cologne and maybe the AS.  It has a classic, muted scent that isn&#x27;t over the top at all.</li>
            <li> Great soap....I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
            <li> Let me start with the fact that I love TOBS products.  Have tried many fragrances and loved them but this one was just off.  The cream just seemed oily and not of the top quality I have come to expect from this company.  I am not positive that the product wasn&#x27;t adulterated from the shipping company for whatever reason.  Will never buy this particular product again but will go back to the trusted containers of TOBS.</li>
            <li> This brand of shaving cream is superb. Worth the cost in my view. This particular plain one is not my favorite from the brand, but is nice in its own way. If you enjoy a good quality shaving cream this brand should be in your rotation. You may find that wherever it starts out, it may work its way to the top of your list. For me that happened quickly.</li>
            <li> first time user of shaving cream instead of soap.  Had to learn with practice how little to use, but a great product!</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Good protective and slick lather and nice scent that is not overpowering. Postshave is a little dry our else it would have been five stars.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving cream for DE shaving. Gives a great lather and smells great. I wish it was a little cheaper and they actually had a place that sells this around my area but it is worth the money</li>
            <li> The scent is a bit too powdery for me, but, its lathers well, and I get a good shave with it.</li>
            <li> Other people complained of the smell, but it is very subtle and after rinsing your face you can&#x27;t even smell it.  It is very easy to build a lather in about 10 seconds with a small amount of cream.  I plan on purchasing more of this shaving cream when the time comes.</li>
            <li> First time user of Taylor of Old Bond Street products. Found the scent a bit old fashioned (brings back memories as a kid messing with my Dad&#x27;s shaving stuff) but very light; any aftershave/cologne can mask the scent so good for those who have their own scent preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to produce lather with just a half soaked brush in a bowl. Lather works well and have not experienced irritation.</li>
            <li> everything totally ok! thanks to the seller</li>
            <li> I like the product, do not like the packaging/shipping.  On my last 2 orders of this product the product has leaked out.  As a result the container is slippery and the content inside the container are mashed against the top.  It either needs better packaging or the screw-on lid needs to be tightened more at the point of manufacturing.  This product is very good but expensive, and I feel that the leaking and mashing to the top ends up wasting some of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product - 5 Star.  Packaging/shipping - 1 Star.</li>
            <li> Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream is simply an amazing product. I use multiple different scents, and always get compliments. My brother discovered how amazing this stuff is after I had some with me while visiting him. He is now an avid buyer as well. The only drawback: the canister looks like pipe bomb in your luggage when it goes through the airport (checked bag). I had a new canister with me on a business trip, only to have had it opened by TSA and a huge handful scooped out of it for &#x27;testing&#x27;. After having a dirty glove go through something, I didn&#x27;t want it on my face. Now, it travels with me in a smaller refillable container dedicated for shaving cream because I don&#x27;t want to leave home with out it - or sacrifice an entire container to the TSA.</li>
            <li> I ordered this by mistake - this is different from the Sandalwood variety. That said, I tried it out. The smell is a little sharper and stronger - I found it to be more irritating to my skin than the Sandalwood version, and also gets me a little sneezy. I won&#x27;t try it again. That said, I love the Sandalwood version.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t recommend Taylor of Old Bond Street enough as a brand. Theirs is the best and most reliable lathering cream I&#x27;ve run across (and I&#x27;ve tried dozens of brands). The water where I live is very hard, and getting good lather when you&#x27;re groggy and running late in the morning can be chancy, but Taylor creams have never let me down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving Shop is one of my favorite scents from Taylor, though their lavender is also fantastic. My wife loves Shaving Shop on me, and I&#x27;ve gotten consistently excellent shaves since I started wet shaving back in 2005. Can&#x27;t recommend anything more highly.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite shave soaps.  I do have to use a pre-shave oil before I lather for better prevention of razor burn.  My wife really likes when I shave with this scent.</li>
            <li> Lathered very nicely and very quickly, without a lot of work. Not as slick/lubricating as some of the other shaving creams/soaps that I have used. Scent was a complete disappointment.  It&#x27;s not an offensive scent, but not what I would associate with a shave shop. The scent is more like average hand soap. I will continue to use it, but would not buy this scent again.</li>
            <li> Love this shaving cream, great price and lasts for months.</li>
            <li> nice aroma&lt;br /&gt; lasts a long time&lt;br /&gt;easy to apply and lathers well. this is definately a product I will continually use and purchase</li>
            <li> I love taylors shaving cream it is the best. But the shaving shop scent smells like bathroom cleaner. I will get eaton again. that was the best.</li>
            <li> Great Scent! Great quality product. smells like an old fashioned barber shop</li>
            <li> I find that other shave creams that are solid, instead of goopy, like this cream, work better - and last longer.  Other than that, the cream provides a nice, moist shave.</li>
            <li> This is my second tub of Taylor&#x27;s shaving cream and it&#x27;s the same high quality as the last but I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the scent of this one. I previously used the Sandalwood variety and much prefer its manly scent that this. This one is more of a soapy smell- but to each his own. There are plenty of folks who thought Sandalwood was too strong. This would be a good choice if you&#x27;re one of them.&lt;br /&gt;The product makes an excellent lather to shave with and a little goes a long way. I&#x27;m getting about 3 months out of a tub.</li>
            <li> Using the assorted creams that are out there is fine.  This cream comes in a reusable bowl if you need it.&lt;br /&gt;The lather generated is a pleasure if done right.  I&#x27;m not knocking other creams as this one serves it pur-&lt;br /&gt;pose with the right tools.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different shaving creams, but I&#x27;m not even tempted anymore. I really like this product. The texture of the cream is really nice. Rich, creamy, and smooth. It&#x27;s cooling on the skin and especially nice over a nice pre-shave cream (I use &#x27;Proraso Anti-Irritation&#x27;). It&#x27;s a bit more than a soap or the canned stuff, but it&#x27;s a relatively affordable luxury that I find well worth it.</li>
            <li> I make my own shaving cream and pre shave oils. This is one of the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I switched back to &amp;#34;wet shaving.&amp;#34; And Taylor of Old Bond Street products, especially shaving cream, are one of the big reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, Taylor of Old Bond Street &amp;#34;Shaving Shop&amp;#34; cream is my favorite. Not too strong a scent, just very pleasant and soothing, yet a good scent that combines a number of scents that I really like. And shaves are the best, with razor just gliding over the face with the nice sound of effective shaving. This is especially true with my double edge razor and boar bristle brush. It takes no longer than the cartridge razor routine, and it gives an incredibly close shave with almost no skin breakouts. The cartridge razors actually pulled whiskers more than they cut them, and they were terribly rough on skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bowl of shaving cream lasts longer than I got out of 6 or more metal cans of shaving gel or cream. And the blades (I use Persona Israeli Reds) are sooooo much less expensive than cartridges. I add an alum bar and Thayer&#x27;s witch hazel skin conditioner and I still look shaved at the end of the day. In the four months since I switched back, I have already saved considerable money. And enjoyed it to boot!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about TOBS products. Their performance is second to none. Just like all their creams, the Shaving Shop version is high quality, high performance and produces a thick, creamy lather. It loads on all my brushes with ease and helps my DE razor slice easily through my whiskers - even after several days of beard growth. Performance aside - what I really like about Shaving Shop is that classic Barber Shop scent that I remember as a kid. Growing up, my local barber used a straight razor and warm shaving cream to finish off my neck line. Although I don&#x27;t remember what shaving cream he used, I&#x27;ll never forget that smell. Not sure what ingredient it is that gives it that unique smell, but I am absolutely hooked. Given the cost vs performance ratio, I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Short and sweet, this is some of the best shaving cream money can buy. Supple, luxurious, lasts forever (only a quarter size needed), lathers well, smells heavenly, and finally completes the gentleman with a moisturized face. Yes, it&#x27;s 15 USD a pot. But, if you enjoy classic barbershop/powder/lightly floral and musky scents, you are gonna be happy you got this over that Gillette. The phrase &amp;#34;treat yourself&amp;#34; is so overused, but in this case, it applies. Excellent value, superb smell and it will make you want to explore this British makers entire range of shaving products. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many of the Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving creams and I have loved them all... except this one.  The quality of the lather and soap is great as usual, but the scent is pretty strong and not very pleasant (to me).  It smells exactly like the cheap overpowering \\&quot;sandalwood\\&quot; after shave colognes some men used to drench themselves with - that&#x27;s what Taylor&#x27;s Shaving Shop shaving cream smells like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really do love the fact that all the other Taylor shaving creams have a nice light scent that makes shaving pleasant and disappears after the final rinse, but this stuff just clings and goes on and never dies.  After two shaves the lid went back on the jar and it went to the back of the shelf and will be used as a backup in case I ever run out of my regular Taylor of Old Bond Street - which I hope never, ever happens.</li>
            <li> Wonderfully smooth, soothing and smells great!  I used shaving foams and gels for sooooo long and I will never ever go back.  I always keep the shave shop cream on hand, I also have tubs of other scents laying around but this is my goto cream.  It lathers extremely well and a single tub can last a very long time once you learn how to judge the amount of creme you need to work up a hearty lather.  Go on and buy this you will not regret it.</li>
            <li> I have brought all sorts of different flavor from the same brand.  They all work well and smell good.</li>
