            <li>They&#x27;re easy to open and close.  </li>
            <li>I find out now that I am about to return them, that I need to ship them back to china, which apparently takes 25-30 days for return, at my own cost.  </li>
            <li>fast shipping product as described</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Made our DIY body butter so much easier to put into containers</li>

            <li>They are nothing fancy but very practical and inexpensive.</li>
            <li>These jars work very well for body butters, a fovorite DIY gift in my family.</li>
            <li>These jars were more than I expected them to be for the price.</li>
            <li>These jars would be great, except they do not seal completely, so they are not a good choice for paint, which is what I wanted to store in them.</li>
            <li>Just the right size, easy to open and had an inner lid to place over the contents.</li>
            <li>The reason I took away a star is because the lids get loose easily</li>
            <li>I tried to do a reorder for 12 more jars but Amazon won&#x27;t  let me order because they are now subject to Add-On.</li>
            <li>Half of them had the top piece of plastic shoved into the bottom of them</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like being forced to purchase more items l don&#x27;t  want just to make a $25 quota to get my $10 product!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend them.</li>

            <li>, I wish they had the jars in a clear plastic.</li>
            <li>They are very durable; I can attest to this, as my daughter has dropped them on numerous occasions.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering form this seller again very soon and definitely recommend them to others.</li>
            <li>They look professional.  </li>
            <li>Looked professional coming from a novice.</li>
            <li>makes my project look professional</li>

            <li>They&#x27;re easy to open, get sealed tight, don&#x27;t crack when you drop them</li>
            <li>These are exactly what I expected them to be.</li>
            <li>they arrived on time but the pastic lid didnt fit tightly and left a gap</li>
            <li>I purchased these containers because I make and sell whipped shea butter and wanted something professional looking to present to my customers.</li>

            <li> These jars were more than I expected them to be for the price.</li>
            <li> These jars would be great, except they do not seal completely, so they are not a good choice for paint, which is what I wanted to store in them.</li>
            <li> Just the right size, easy to open and had an inner lid to place over the contents.</li>
            <li> The reason I took away a star is because the lids get loose easily</li>
            <li> I tried to do a reorder for 12 more jars but Amazon won&#x27;t  let me order because they are now subject to Add-On.</li>
            <li> Half of them had the top piece of plastic shoved into the bottom of them</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like being forced to purchase more items l don&#x27;t  want just to make a $25 quota to get my $10 product!</li>

            <li> , I wish they had the jars in a clear plastic.</li>
            <li> They are very durable; I can attest to this, as my daughter has dropped them on numerous occasions.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering form this seller again very soon and definitely recommend them to others.</li>
            <li> They look professional.  </li>
            <li> Looked professional coming from a novice.</li>
            <li> makes my project look professional</li>
            <li> They give my homemade products a professional classy look and feel.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re easy to open, get sealed tight, don&#x27;t crack when you drop them</li>
            <li> These are exactly what I expected them to be.</li>
            <li> they arrived on time but the pastic lid didnt fit tightly and left a gap</li>
            <li> I purchased these containers because I make and sell whipped shea butter and wanted something professional looking to present to my customers.</li>
            <li> The jars are leveled, not tilting when placed on a flat surface.</li>
            <li> These jars are as expected.</li>
            <li> They were exactly as expected when I ordered them.  </li>
            <li> As expected .</li>
            <li> The biggest issues, and show stoppers are the lids do not fit properly.  </li>
            <li> They are what I expected.</li>
            <li> So I do wash and reuse once they are empty.</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected.  </li>
            <li> Small enough to keep use and keep in the shower.</li>
            <li> I should have purchased small, which I did, but I will keep these for larger quantities of salves.  </li>
            <li> but get&#x27;s dirty too quickly...</li>
            <li> Like other people warned, they do leak a little.</li>
            <li> lids are tight and no leaking.</li>
            <li> They even include the fancy little cover that goes between the product and the lid.</li>
            <li> The glass ones were more expensive and I was afraid they would break.  </li>
            <li> I needed small jars for homemade body butter variations.  </li>
            <li> much small than 4 ounces.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually like things shipped from China, but didn&#x27;t realize that before ordering.  </li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;m going to do with 12 leaky</li>
            <li> The 4oz size works well for small containers of body butter or salve.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after a month of ordering, the products finally arrived from China with every lid having decorative silver line on the rim, which did not work for my intended use.  </li>
            <li> Bought to sell my homemade body scrub in, leaked like crazy, works for body butter but NOT anything liquid.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite annoying.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite annoying.</li>

            <li> I used these for homemade playdoh containers. They seem to seal well and are a great size!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.  I needed small jars for homemade body butter variations.  The lids seal perfect, tight seal.  The glass ones were more expensive and I was afraid they would break.  Plus, I don&#x27;t plan on storing homemade body butter for any length of time that justifies using glass.  Plastic is fine for what I&#x27;m doing.  Great purchase.  They come in a sealed plastic bag, lids off.  I will probably clean each one out with alcohol before putting product in it, but they are fine the way they are.</li>
            <li> I should have purchased small, which I did, but I will keep these for larger quantities of salves.  All jar caps fit and mate well.  Thank you!</li>

            <li> Good quality containers for self-made lotion etc. products.  Looks just like products I&#x27;ve bought in stores from cosmetic companies.  Would purchase these again!</li>
            <li> These are small plastic jars with nice fitting lids.  I bought them before and the quality is still good.  I use it for home made lotions and they seal well.  They are a good price, but ship from China.  I don&#x27;t usually like things shipped from China, but didn&#x27;t realize that before ordering.  They are a  small size and good for fitting in a purse or cosmetic bag.</li>
            <li> Worked fine for my purpose</li>
            <li> Nice wide mouth opening for ease of scooping out substances with your hands. Shape easy and feels natural in your hands. Securely closes without leaks.</li>
            <li> Just the perfect size I was looking for! Use for holding my creations and giving them to friends as a gift. Highly recommended. Thank you â™¥</li>
            <li> These containers only hold 2oz, not 4oz as advertised both on Amazon and on the packaging. Otherwise they are very nice containers.</li>
            <li> I needed a smaller container for home made night time facial moisterizer &amp; this was perfect; just the right size &amp; no leaks.  Thank you for a great product.</li>
            <li> Jars good quality but lids not so good. They don&#x27;t all screw on right.</li>
            <li> Perfect size..Love them!</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast, and the package arrived in god condition.  I love the size and price, since I make my own products.  The biggest issues, and show stoppers are the lids do not fit properly.  Now, I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;m going to do with 12 leaky jars.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend these jars to anyone.</li>
            <li> these are great little jars for incense. lids are tight and no leaking. i will order more of these when i need them</li>
            <li> These are exactly what I expected them to be. Perfect for what I planned to use them for.</li>
            <li> Cute, professional-looking and plastic (wary of shattered glass). Got these for my homemade moisturizer to give as gifts for Mother&#x27;s Day. They&#x27;re easy to open, get sealed tight, don&#x27;t crack when you drop them (whoops!) and keep the smell of whatever is IN the container...well, IN the container :)</li>
            <li> I make my own face and body cream and finding jars that were light for shipping was such a problem.  With these super light but sturdy jars problem solved.</li>
            <li> I love this jar, the size is perfect for creams and loations.  Great gift size.</li>
            <li> This is a good all purpose little jar.  The 4oz size works well for small containers of body butter or salve.  The lids fit well and its  easy to label each jar with the contents.  I have purchased this is in a larger size as well.  They are nothing fancy but very practical and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a good size and they came quickly. What I DON&#x27;T like is that they leak pretty easily. It&#x27;s quite annoying. These should come with liners, or liners should be suggested when buying it (I didn&#x27;t see anything suggested, but that may have changed). It works for storage, but if you have something that contains oil or that can melt, be prepared for them to leak everywhere. It&#x27;s quite annoying.</li>
            <li> These jars would be great, except they do not seal completely, so they are not a good choice for paint, which is what I wanted to store in them.</li>
            <li> These jars were perfect for my homemade cream and the price was very reasonable.  I would purchase them again.  Thanks!  8-29-15 1 I tried to do a reorder for 12 more jars but Amazon won&#x27;t  let me order because they are now subject to Add-On. I don&#x27;t like being forced to purchase more items l don&#x27;t  want just to make a $25 quota to get my $10 product! I have changed my review to 3 because of this. Otherwise it would be 5.</li>
            <li> Great jar for homemade creams.  The lid has a great fit.  The product arrived on time, I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Hi it&#x27;s great but my labels don&#x27;t for would you have 6 ounces</li>
            <li> they arrived on time but the pastic lid didnt fit tightly and left a gap but nothing seems to be spilling out.</li>
            <li> Great but get&#x27;s dirty too quickly...</li>
            <li> Perfect size containers to store my personal mixture of shea butters and coconut oils.</li>
            <li> jars arrived on time. Packaging was accurate, all jars have lids but those were purchased separately.</li>
            <li> They are perfect for my homemade body butters and are perfect size for gifts. I will definitely order more when I run out!</li>
            <li> good quality. good seal</li>
            <li> These are a perfect size for my homemade lotions and potions. They were a great price and shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> I bought these jars for my home made salves and they are the perfect size. No leaks and the lids fit nice and tight. I love that they are not glass so if I do drop it doesn&#x27;t break. They are just the right size so that you can dip your fingers in and reach to the bottom with out any problems. Definitely would order again.</li>
            <li> I read all of the questions, answers and a lot of the comments and am pleased that I got exactly what was expected. Mine did not leak at all and I would most definelty purchase this product again. Very happy with this item.</li>
            <li> The jars are very nice and the right size for making sugar scrub or other health potions.  Because they may be used around water or with wet hands, the rounded top is excellent for that purpose.  They&#x27;re easy to open and close.  They are what I expected.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my homemade hair pomade.  They are durable and the perfect size. I will purchase them again.</li>
            <li> Perfect size and easy to open and close</li>
            <li> makes my project look professional</li>
            <li> Nice tight fitting screw lids and the plastic is a good grade.  I have been looking around and saw some nice containers at IKEA</li>
            <li> Just as described, just as I ordered.  A more convenient size.  I use this for homemade creams.  Jar is reusable.</li>
            <li> I had ordered these jars based on the photo, the product description and reviews on this site.  Unfortunately, after a month of ordering, the products finally arrived from China with every lid having decorative silver line on the rim, which did not work for my intended use.  I find out now that I am about to return them, that I need to ship them back to china, which apparently takes 25-30 days for return, at my own cost.  Not at all what I expect from convenient online shopping today, especially from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Half of them had the top piece of plastic shoved into the bottom of them</li>
            <li> I love these. I make my own body butters from organic oils and natural butters. I melt it and whip it and then package it in these jars. They give my homemade products a professional classy look and feel. Great buy.</li>
            <li> These jars are perfect for my whipped body butters. They look more professional than the ones I had. I will be ordering more. Hopefully you&#x27;ll have them in a 8oz as well.</li>
            <li> These were great for making body butters to hand out at Christmas. Nice product!</li>

            <li> Prefer thise that have a seal in it.</li>
            <li> They arrived just like I expected and great quality.  I use them to store my homemade body butter and body balm. So I do wash and reuse once they are empty. They also are the perfect size for gifting homemade butters and other beauty goods.</li>
            <li> I use these to make a mixture of lotions and oils for my family and they are great for the job!!!!!!!</li>

            <li> I received 10 jars and 10th jar didn&#x27;t have lid. It was supposed to be the 12</li>
            <li> Were the perfect size for my lotion Christmas gifts!</li>

            <li> Better and bigger than I expected.</li>

            <li> These jars were more than I expected them to be for the price. Perfect size and very sturdy. They worked perfect for my homemade body butter and I would highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> they are nice, and lid screw on tight and fit well.. but i think it is a bit pricey for that kind of jar</li>
