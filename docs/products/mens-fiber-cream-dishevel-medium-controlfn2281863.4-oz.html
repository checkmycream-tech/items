    <ol>
            <li>Best hair product I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what it is about this stuff, but it makes my hair look awesome.</li>
            <li>Good price too!</li>
            <li>Great product for men&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and gives a bit of hold without being crunchy or slick-looking.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a good cream for a while.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a win-win for me because I can look good and have my gf comb through my hair without compromising anything.</li>
            <li>I have shorter hair (think 3-6 inches) and this product works famously!</li>
            <li>It is also easy to wash off my hands when I am done and the pump nozzle is easy to get the perfect amount every time.</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use and does a great job of grooming the hair.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and has light hold, non-sticky texture.</li>
            <li>It will take care of your hair and will give you an intermediate fixation, I enjoy it&#x27;s use, also the dossificator is great, you don&#x27;t over use.</li>
            <li>Has a nice smell.  </li>
            <li>Many hair products out there makes your hair all sticky.</li>
            <li>this works better- has a nice hold, but is light.</li>
            <li>This stuff is all I use now, and it makes your hair glimmer just the perfect amount and allows you to style it however you want without having to worry about it later.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: guys, look no further for the perfect hair styling product.</li>
            <li>Glad to get it online.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy it!  </li>
            <li>This product would probably be ideal for someone with really short locks.</li>
            <li>It works, it&#x27;s easy for him to use, and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried cheap products from Target and Walmart (like $5 range), but</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also found that this product helps keep my hair feeling and smelling clean because I do not wash my hair every day.  </li>
            <li>This is the perfect solution - great hold, little shine, little amount needed.</li>
            <li>Unlike most hair products, this one is very natural.</li>
            <li>Specifically the \\&quot;work hard\\&quot; molding paste had a strong athletic deodorant smell that didn&#x27;t particularly bother me.</li>
            <li>By far the most generous was that it smelled like cucumbers, but that is a stretch.    </li>
            <li>Well if you don&#x27;t like those, this is one great product that holds your hair very well, and at the same time maintains a natural look, as if you haven&#x27;t applied anything to your hair.</li>
            <li>I was self-conscious about it, and sure enough, I started getting comments about what that smell was.</li>
            <li>For the first 26 years of my life, I didn&#x27;t even use hair gel, but I&#x27;ve since joined the tribe and given it a try.</li>
            <li>Gives your hair a healthy smooth look without weighing your hair down, or looking too greasy.  </li>
            <li>Great hair product with a slight hold and natural finish.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast and price was right.</li>
            <li>the best part I found it here for less cost then any of the other retailers and hair salons I searched.</li>
            <li>it lasts pretty much all day.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product because it&#x27;s worked for me from day one!</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t really feel it on your hair, and it also lasts very well.</li>
            <li>My husband absolutely loves this product and won&#x27;t use anything else.  </li>
            <li>It used to be available only at salons.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this to anyone.  </li>
            <li>I have used other redken for men products, and although they had a strong odor, they didn&#x27;t smell like this.</li>
            <li>I wish the bottle were a bit bigger because I run out so fast.</li>
            <li>IT is not a heavy gel and you hair looks natural after using it...</li>
            <li>A bit of research led me to this product and so far I&#x27;m liking it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy, in my thirties, and this product just makes my hair look like I&#x27;ve just been to a professional stylist.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the weakest \\&quot;medium hold\\&quot; product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Go for American Crew Forming Cream instead, green packaging, you&#x27;ll achieve Peter Parker&#x27;s glorious mane with it my friendly neighborhood shoppers.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really do a whole lot with my hair, and in no way resembles any other type of fiber cream out there, in terms of hold.</li>
            <li>it is a totally unpleasant and very prominent chemical smell that will stick with you all day.</li>

            <li> and I don&#x27;t like anything that is too stiff.</li>
            <li> It holds my hair in place without being greasy or stiff.</li>
            <li> Way too expensive when other products compare to what this does.</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone with thin or thick hair.</li>
            <li> Weak hold product.</li>
            <li> Alas, I was wrong-</li>
            <li> - it tames my unruly hair without being too noticeable and over-the-top.</li>

            <li> I wish the bottle were a bit bigger because I run out so fast. I would highly recommend this product because it&#x27;s worked for me from day one!</li>
            <li> I like this stuff.  It keeps the hair in place throughout the day and lasts about a month in the bottle.  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Weak hold product. This product would probably be ideal for someone with really short locks.</li>
            <li> Great product for men&#x27;s hair.  This product is easy to use and does a great job of grooming the hair.  Would highly recommend this to anyone.  Shipped fast and price was right.</li>

            <li> I have been using Dishevel Cream for 3 years now and I just like it . IT is not a heavy gel and you hair looks natural after using it...if it gets messed in the wind, simply wet a comb and comb through it.</li>

            <li> Manly smell and does the job without turning your hair into a helmet.&lt;br /&gt;The only issue is the quantity to cost ratio.</li>
            <li> Smells great and gives a bit of hold without being crunchy or slick-looking. I have hair that poofs up and is somewhat curly. I don&#x27;t like the slicked-back/greasy look and I don&#x27;t like anything that is too stiff. A bit of research led me to this product and so far I&#x27;m liking it - it tames my unruly hair without being too noticeable and over-the-top.</li>
            <li> Great hair product with a slight hold and natural finish.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the hold one feeling of tis stuff in my hair. Highly recommend work hard paste from redken.</li>
            <li> I have used other redken for men products, and although they had a strong odor, they didn&#x27;t smell like this. Specifically the \\&quot;work hard\\&quot; molding paste had a strong athletic deodorant smell that didn&#x27;t particularly bother me. I assumed the other negative reviews here were regarding this.

I was self-conscious about it, and sure enough, I started getting comments about what that smell was. By far the most generous was that it smelled like cucumbers, but that is a stretch.    Pros:  doesn&#x27;t feel greasy    Cons:  Hold doesn&#x27;t last more than an hour  Terrible Smell</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good cream for a while. I like the drier look that this cream gives my hair. I am not a fan of overly greasy hair and I get the look and hold that I want with this cream. It is also easy to wash off my hands when I am done and the pump nozzle is easy to get the perfect amount every time. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Gives your hair a healthy smooth look without weighing your hair down, or looking too greasy.  I&#x27;m a guy, in my thirties, and this product just makes my hair look like I&#x27;ve just been to a professional stylist.  Best hair product I have ever tried.  I&#x27;ve also found that this product helps keep my hair feeling and smelling clean because I do not wash my hair every day.

            <li> Everything came as expected and was packaged with a lot of care for temperature conditions.</li>
            <li> Smells great and has light hold, non-sticky texture.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son. It works, it&#x27;s easy for him to use, and the best part I found it here for less cost then any of the other retailers and hair salons I searched.</li>
            <li> My husband absolutely loves this product and won&#x27;t use anything else.  Would recommend to anyone with thin or thick hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years. It holds my hair in place without being greasy or stiff. It used to be available only at salons. Glad to get it online.</li>
            <li> This item serves its purpose i like it because it doesn&#x27;t give me that gel greasy look. Good price too! i will keep using it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is about this stuff, but it makes my hair look awesome. Every other gel ends up looking too stiff, shiny, and I can&#x27;t get the consistency right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve said it before, I&#x27;m not really a hair guy, but the lay flat on my head thing is not really my scene, so I tried this \\&quot;Dishevel\\&quot; look.  I really enjoy it!  My girlfriend likes it and so do some of my kids (I&#x27;m a middle school teacher).  It takes all of 10 seconds to \\&quot;do\\&quot; my hair and it lasts pretty much all day.</li>
            <li> I have shorter hair (think 3-6 inches) and this product works famously! It is low profile enough that my GF can comb through my hair without having her hands get sticky and slimy with gel. It&#x27;s a win-win for me because I can look good and have my gf comb through my hair without compromising anything. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> It will take care of your hair and will give you an intermediate fixation, I enjoy it&#x27;s use, also the dossificator is great, you don&#x27;t over use.</li>
            <li> This is the hair cream that guys have been waiting for! For the first 26 years of my life, I didn&#x27;t even use hair gel, but I&#x27;ve since joined the tribe and given it a try. I wanted a  product that wouldn&#x27;t leave a trace, as I&#x27;m not trying to look greased down or anything. This is the perfect solution - great hold, little shine, little amount needed.</li>
