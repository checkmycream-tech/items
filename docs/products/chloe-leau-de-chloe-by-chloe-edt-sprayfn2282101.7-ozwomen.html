            <li>Very nice fragrance ...</li>
            <li>Absolutely delicious scent -- light, with both floral and citrus notes.  </li>
            <li>I had one of those paper samples that came in a magazine, and just loved it.  </li>
            <li>I tried this on at the store and loved it.</li>
            <li>Parfume Gucci #3, I have gotten a bunch of good comments about this product.</li>
            <li>Excellent all-around perfume!</li>
            <li>JUST LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li>Really amazing</li>
            <li>They smell nice, but they all tend to smell alike.  </li>
            <li>Thought I liked it</li>
            <li>A light, crisp citrus scent that is perfect for warm days.  </li>
            <li>It is a gift that my daughter asked for on her Christmas list that she had smelled and liked  :  )</li>
            <li>Everyone around me wants to know what smells so good!  </li>
            <li>this perfume is one of the most elegant perfumes i own.  </li>
            <li>Authentic Perfume.</li>
            <li>Love It.</li>
            <li>I am not one to purchase many perfumes.  </li>
            <li>I am fan of Chloe fragrances and this is one of my favorite.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s her favorite.</li>
            <li>like to buy perfumes based on others that I like, because similar ones tend to smell the best on me.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this perfume.  </li>
            <li>I love all of the Chloe fragrances - except this one.  </li>
            <li>What came to fruition was a creamy, clean sexy rose.</li>
            <li>This fragrance smells light and very clean.</li>
            <li>but after about 15 minutes it is really strong.</li>
            <li>After smelling both samples I found the Chloe to be much more appealing than at first, so spritzed myself and gave it some time.</li>
            <li>Absolutely fantastic on my skin.</li>
            <li>strong sweet overpowering fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love the dark, almost woodsy smell of this wonderful new perfume!</li>
            <li>It arrived in perfect condition, smells wonderful and the price is right; at least half price than advertised in magazines.</li>
            <li>Fresh, clean, light without being too citrus-y.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price in the end though because you will smell so clean and fresh!</li>
            <li>Clean, crisp fragrance!</li>
            <li>One spray (and maybe two if you really like to wear strong perfume) will suffice.</li>
            <li>The first smell was a bit odd to me, but overall the key note is great, very pleasant flora scent.</li>
            <li>So worth the $$$.  </li>
            <li>Just fresh and youthful.</li>
            <li>100% Real deal.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is so fresh and lovely, in a different way comparing with other fragrances.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>What It boils down to is chemistry, for me this is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of the old</li>
            <li>I was worried this is fake and then find out that it smells exactly the same as the ones in Sephora, and the packaging is nice, too.</li>
            <li>I think older women can wear this as well as younger women.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Eau de Chloe was exactly what I expected...</li>
            <li>I would not buy it for a young teen.</li>
            <li>Please note that when you first spray it on, it seems like it&#x27;s not very strong</li>

    <ol>
            <li> It smells a little old...</li>
            <li> When I tested this by smelling the cap I encountered a bitter, citrusy, musk. I made a sample strip and moved on to Miss Dior Cherie. After smelling both samples I found the Chloe to be much more appealing than at first, so spritzed myself and gave it some time. What came to fruition was a creamy, clean sexy rose. Absolutely fantastic on my skin. What It boils down to is chemistry, for me this is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Absolutely delicious scent -- light, with both floral and citrus notes.  I was hooked by a fragrance card in a magazine and had to try it.  So worth the $$$.  Everyone around me wants to know what smells so good!  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s great! Really amazing</li>
            <li> Great smell. Authentic Perfume. 100% Real deal. Love It.</li>
            <li> I love the dark, almost woodsy smell of this wonderful new perfume! The only complaint I have is that it is quite expensive compared to other nice smelling perfumes on the market. It&#x27;s worth the price in the end though because you will smell so clean and fresh! Excellent all-around perfume!</li>
            <li> I am not one to purchase many perfumes.  They smell nice, but they all tend to smell alike.  I had one of those paper samples that came in a magazine, and just loved it.  Purchased the bottle, and it is everything I wanted.  A light, crisp citrus scent that is perfect for warm days.  Never overpowering, Not flowery.  Just fresh and youthful.</li>
            <li> I am fan of Chloe fragrances and this is one of my favorite. Shipment came fast and I am wearing it everyday.</li>
            <li> this perfume is one of the most elegant perfumes i own.  the EDT lasts all day even though it is not eau de perfume.  Great stuff</li>
            <li> Thought I liked it but I changed my mind after one or two uses. So I have it to my Stepmother. It&#x27;s her favorite.</li>
            <li> It is a gift that my daughter asked for on her Christmas list that she had smelled and liked  :  )</li>
            <li> This fragrance is so fresh and lovely, in a different way comparing with other fragrances. The first smell was a bit odd to me, but overall the key note is great, very pleasant flora scent. I was worried this is fake and then find out that it smells exactly the same as the ones in Sephora, and the packaging is nice, too.</li>
            <li> is not the original one :(  strong sweet overpowering fragrance.</li>
            <li> I tried this on at the store and loved it. Fresh, clean, light without being too citrus-y. The lotion version lasts a little longer but is also a tad bit stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to buy perfumes based on others that I like, because similar ones tend to smell the best on me. So, you will probably like this if you like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lovely, by Sarah Jessica Parker&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Omnia Crystalline, by Bvlgari&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inner Grace, by Philosophy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perry Ellis Reserve for Women</li>
            <li> This fragrance smells light and very clean. Please note that when you first spray it on, it seems like it&#x27;s not very strong but after about 15 minutes it is really strong. The longer you wear it, the stronger it becomes. One spray (and maybe two if you really like to wear strong perfume) will suffice. I think older women can wear this as well as younger women. I would not buy it for a young teen.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this perfume.  It&#x27;s a great summer scent. The only issue is that the scent doesn&#x27;t last.  Also, it seems the L&#x27;eau de Chloe is being discontinued or already has been.  None of the department stores carry it anymore.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Eau de Chloe was exactly what I expected...Clean, crisp fragrance! Use sparingly, or it could be overpowering. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> JUST LOVE IT!  It reminds me of the old Parfume Gucci #3, I have gotten a bunch of good comments about this product.</li>
            <li> I love all of the Chloe fragrances - except this one.  It smells like bug spray, sorry!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this item before from Amazon. It arrived in perfect condition, smells wonderful and the price is right; at least half price than advertised in magazines.</li>
            <li> Very nice fragrance ...</li>
    </ol>
