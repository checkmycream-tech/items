            <li>price is good, liked the soap.</li>

            <li>Just like warm milk and honey.</li>
            <li>Smells like warm honey.</li>
            <li>It keeps our hands smelling good, and keeps them silky and smooth after use.</li>
            <li>I bought many soaps from Softsoap brand and by far this is the best one of them</li>
            <li>I love the smell and feel of this soap.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t beat Softsoap; have had Wal-Mart&#x27;s generic version, this is the best; love the scent also</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure if my hands would feel &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; using this.  </li>
            <li>This is my all time favorite scent for liquid hand soap.</li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hand and body soap.</li>
            <li>This is our favorite hand soap to use around the house.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Much better than the floral or antiseptic smell of some hand soaps.</li>
            <li>wish I could find more</li>
            <li>We really love like this product.</li>
            <li>Purchased this item because I absolutely love the scent.</li>
            <li>I like the liquid soaps much better than a bar of soap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to find it on Amazon</li>
            <li>The soap has a nice clean smell.</li>
            <li>how smooth it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>Bottles came securely packed so no leakage or anything like that.</li>
            <li>get clean without the burn</li>
            <li>It smells mildly sweet but not overpowering and the scent does not linger.</li>
            <li>Softsoap Milk Protein and Honey is very soothing to my hands and has a lovely aroma.</li>
            <li>However when the product arrived and I opened it, it was to find that the top hadn&#x27;t been on all the way and much of the soap had leaked out.</li>
            <li>I might be cheap, but I think $14 for this is a bit too much.</li>
            <li>Not a big discount, but kind of what I expect when I buy online.</li>
            <li>The sink area looks much better and less messy and the liquids do an excellent job.</li>
            <li>This soap has a very sweet and enticing scent, but it also keeps your hands soft and isn&#x27;t drying at all.</li>
            <li>The bulk container of softsoap was exactly what I requested.</li>
            <li>We use it next to the bathroom sink - it&#x27;s mild enough to use as a face wash and leaves a nice scent.  </li>
            <li>I  highly  recommend it and plan on purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li>The large container was generously price.</li>
            <li>They do, and it&#x27;s very non abrasive.</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing to the hands.</li>
            <li>This provided a refill option for my needs very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the prompt shipment.</li>
            <li>I wash my hands frequently and this is the first hand soap that I have found to be so gentle on my hands.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin especially on my hands, this doesn&#x27;t dry my hands out at all, foams well and rinses clean.</li>
            <li>I have used this refill previously and really like it.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I wish it was less expensive because it really has everything I love for in hand soap.</li>

            <li> I usually only purchase my hand soaps  from Bath and Body Works, but I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality and non irritating formula in this inexpensive soft soap.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used numerous other brands of hand soap, but the search is over.</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry, and this cleanses and keeps my skin hydrated.  </li>
            <li> I bought the little one once in my grocery store and that is why I got this big one!</li>
            <li> Does not leave them feeling dry like some other hand soaps do.</li>
            <li> This product was what I expected.</li>
            <li> I simply refill the small dispenser when needed.  </li>
            <li> The little 7 oz ones cost around $2.00 and you would think that getting a bulk item would make it cost less.</li>
            <li> no more chapped hands.</li>
            <li> I try not to be a snob about such  a silly thing like hand soap, but I have to admit I really HATE the brands that dry your skin out to the point of feeling like they could crack and bleed.  </li>
            <li> Other soaps seem to dry my hands out horribly but this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It has become difficult to find the refills in stores in our area</li>
            <li> This Milk and Honey refill is expensive for what it is.  </li>
            <li> Those dry my hands out terribly.</li>
            <li> and my hands don&#x27;t feel so horrible after washing anymore.</li>

            <li> great to be able to refill dispensers that are kept sink-side</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite scent for liquid hand soap. It is a bit pricey and I&#x27;m on a budget so I didn&#x27;t buy it often. This soap has a very sweet and enticing scent, but it also keeps your hands soft and isn&#x27;t drying at all. The honey and milk protein definitely plays it part. The only thing I wish it was less expensive because it really has everything I love for in hand soap. I might be cheap, but I think $14 for this is a bit too much. The little 7 oz ones cost around $2.00 and you would think that getting a bulk item would make it cost less. When I bought this I only saved about $2.00. Not a big discount, but kind of what I expect when I buy online.</li>
            <li> Good price. Great packaging to make sure nothing leaked. Happy to find this product!</li>
            <li> Great service.  I have used this refill previously and really like it.  I simply refill the small dispenser when needed.  The soap has a nice clean smell.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this scent for a while.  I used to get it so I stocked up on it</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how good this soap was until I was using a popular bath and body line of soaps. Those dry my hands out terribly. So I switched back to using this again and my hands don&#x27;t feel so horrible after washing anymore. This is a great soap for all areas of the house!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin especially on my hands, this doesn&#x27;t dry my hands out at all, foams well and rinses clean. It smells mildly sweet but not overpowering and the scent does not linger. Other soaps seem to dry my hands out horribly but this one doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s the only hand soap I will use.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. It is very moisturizing to the hands. Does not leave them feeling dry like some other hand soaps do.</li>
            <li> It smells so good. Just like warm milk and honey. It&#x27;s great for winter skin and leaves hands smelling great and feeling softer.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hand and body soap. I like the smell and how smooth it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> This is our favorite hand soap to use around the house. It has become difficult to find the refills in stores in our area so we were happy to see it still available through Amazon. Bottles came securely packed so no leakage or anything like that.</li>

            <li> price is good, liked the soap.</li>
            <li> My husband is so picky about soap and this one he loves!</li>
            <li> no more chapped hands. get clean without the burn</li>
            <li> I bought many soaps from Softsoap brand and by far this is the best one of them all here  .</li>

Hopefully this was a freak occurrence in the company&#x27;s packing department.</li>
            <li> I like the liquid soaps much better than a bar of soap. The sink area looks much better and less messy and the liquids do an excellent job.</li>
            <li> This Milk and Honey refill is expensive for what it is.  Hand soap.  I&#x27;m glad to find it on Amazon but I doubt I&#x27;ll spend the money again purchasing.</li>
