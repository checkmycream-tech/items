            <li> However, I do not particularly like burberry, but Jessica &#x27; s genius in fragrance and clothes</li>
            <li> The size of the bottle is what I expected and I sprayed this on myself this morning</li>
            <li> so was diappointed with the small size.</li>
            <li> My only disappointment was that I thought this was the  3.4 oz bottle</li>
            <li> He said it made me smell like a jelly doughnut which I thought was weird, but hey, I&#x27;ll take it! (:</li>
            <li> Thought it was bad chemistry, then spritzed it in the air and still did not like it.</li>

            <li> overall, V. good, specially for the price</li>
            <li> I love the way this smells</li>
            <li> Jessica seems to have good taste and a good sense for the best cut in clothes and fragrances. This fragrance is reminiscent  of burberry. However, I do not particularly like burberry, but Jessica &#x27; s genius in fragrance and clothes somehow does it in a way that is ultra feminine, subtle but lasting and mellows into a cozy fragrance of a beautiful afternoon. Burberry blows you away and makes you wonder did they intend it for men, but this gives you just the right hint of every note perfectly,  in perfect balance.</li>
            <li> Thought it was bad chemistry, then spritzed it in the air and still did not like it. A bit musky and spicy for my taste. I prefer sweeter perfumes</li>
            <li> This smells beautiful. The size of the bottle is what I expected and I sprayed this on myself this morning and I can still smell it, it lasted the whole day! Boyfriend loves the scent. He said it made me smell like a jelly doughnut which I thought was weird, but hey, I&#x27;ll take it! (:</li>
