            <li>This product has changed the integrity of my hail, love it.</li>
            <li>I wish I had known then, for sure.</li>
            <li>I added more color after I finished with Olaplex.</li>
            <li>I can imagine that a permanent dye would be even better</li>
            <li>This was just ok.  </li>
            <li>My hair is in better condition than it was but to say that it improved and is healthy again, no.  </li>

            <li>love this on my bleached hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a magical miracle cure.</li>
            <li>I lightened prelightened hair and it came out in better condition than it went in.</li>
            <li>Been dyeing for many years.</li>
            <li>It feels pretty good, and it does feel fuller.</li>
            <li>and after I washed it out my hair felt amazing, and a month later, my hair still feels greAt.</li>
            <li>So glad I found it available here, and it was easy for me to do an application at home when touching up my color</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who wants to take good</li>
            <li>My hair is straight and fine, with some split end damage on the ends, but in generally good shape.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use at home no need to pay for this at the salon.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping and really amazing product!</li>
            <li>I heard about Olaplex, at first I thought &#x27;yea right&#x27; and it looked like all the before and after pictures were too good to be true or the girls had extensions in to make the hair look better -</li>
            <li>I noticed a huge difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>and I had the same great results.</li>
            <li>It is good both on natural, and color treated hair.</li>
            <li>ends in first, then pour the rest over crown area you get the most use of the product (If you DIY).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say its pretty healthy.</li>
            <li>I was worried at first as you should be when ever trying something on your precious hair but ladies</li>
            <li>(if only they made them in these bright colors).</li>
            <li>I dye my hair bright copper red.</li>
            <li>I will be buying the full size of this treatment from this seller.</li>
            <li>Despite the fact that I bleached twice, my hair was in pretty good shape, but I still couldn&#x27;t get it light enough.</li>
            <li>This time I added the Olaplex following the instructions on their website and love the results!</li>
            <li>this is worth it</li>
            <li>not a dupe.&lt;br /&gt;-The title says &amp;#34;Single Use&amp;#34; but I was able to get two uses out of the No. 1 formula (How much of the formula you use is dependent on how much bleach you are using.</li>
            <li>Boy were they right.</li>
            <li>I feel like it was almost a trade off, where healthier parts of my hair now feel less healthy, but the compromised parts are slightly better.</li>
            <li>I used it and my hair was amazing, before it was fried and dry</li>
            <li>My hair lifted to pale yellow and my pastel color melt came out wonderful.</li>
            <li>I received the product very fast</li>
            <li>I am in love and will be buying this again for the next time.</li>
            <li>I already ordered another one of these trial sets with 1,2, &amp; 3 so that, in a month or two, I can bleach one more time, this time with Olaplex mixed into the bleach.</li>
            <li>I probably should just buy a bigger batch of this stuff because I really do love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that there is this small size available for people to try out.</li>
            <li>I think this is better used when bleaching for blocking any further damage.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be getting it again for future coloring for sure.</li>
            <li>Be sure to select a developer that is the next level higher than what you want, as Olaplex will make your developer weaker.</li>
            <li>I was a unsure at first</li>
            <li>(mixed with water, used a strong sulfate shampoo to strip hair first, and applied to damp hair)</li>
            <li>/&gt;NOTE: With Olaplex, you should be able to bleach your hair to your desired blond color with 1-2 (instead of 3) as long as you are patient and understand that with Olaplex, bleach takes longer to process.</li>
            <li>Definitely buying the full size!</li>
            <li>I let my hair air dry after that for the most part and then styled.</li>
            <li>That is a huge bonus for me, as colors like purple, red, etc.</li>
            <li>so things are looking promising for the long-term</li>
            <li>Olaplex really is a miracle product.</li>
            <li>I am still using quite a bit, and my hair now again feels very damaged/dry after one toner application since using this kit once.</li>
            <li>Highly reccommend!</li>
            <li>Works really well for damaged hair</li>
            <li>Absolute miracle for relaxed hair</li>
            <li>Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s the real product and</li>
            <li>it soooo fast, new and my hair is amazingly super soft</li>
            <li>Directions are limited but easy to google.</li>
            <li>I just wish this was available when I first started relaxing my hair , I would recommend leaving the treatment in longer than the stated times for first time use as I was a little scared to do so</li>
            <li>I have been doing a single process red on my hair for a LONG time, and I&#x27;ve always been pretty good about doing a treatment of some sort after every color, so again, my hair wasn&#x27;t really very damaged, but 20 plus years of  coloring your hair every 5 to 6 weeks...</li>
            <li>My hair is damaged and after using olaplex, my hair looked about 50% better and less frizzy and seemed stronger.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to think my hair is in decent shape.</li>
            <li>I plan to purchase more and use regular to maintain hair helath, and will be adding to my next color service as well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended if bleaching your hair.</li>
            <li>I plan on using No. 3 once or twice a week for a few more weeks.</li>
            <li>washed my hair and did my normal post color conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li>I usually keep my hair is good shape, with trimes every 3 months, deep conditioner weekly, and protein treatments as needed.  </li>
            <li>(it normally always does in every shower and shampoo) nor was the color altered.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s actually an iPhone app for Olaplex which is very informative!</li>
            <li>Did nothing much willing to give it a next chance</li>
            <li>My relaxed, TWICE bleached, African American hair feels like sweet silk.</li>
            <li>It was alright, I didn&#x27;t notice any shocking results, the company even states that,&amp;#34;it&#x27;s not like a magic wand that will automatically transform your hair&amp;#34; i think it would be great for those of you looking to bleach/lighten your hair even further or for your first time to minimize damage.</li>
            <li>The first two times I used Olaplex and saw no difference in my hair&#x27;s health which was amazing because I have naturally dark brown hair and have dyed it black multiple times.</li>
            <li>I have black hair naturally and have bleached my hair a number of times before and end up having to cut off a significant amount of hair because i end up frying it.</li>
            <li>Total revival of the damaged strands near my ears and really silkened the ends until I processed it again.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what complete miracles people expect.</li>
            <li>and this really helped it bounce back to life.</li>
            <li>Very easy to brush through, with little drag, compared to before treating.   </li>
            <li>Make sure you visit the Olaplex site and read it, follow directions thoroughly and remember, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>yeah.. a little rough. :-)</li>
            <li>I would suggest just getting this treatment done at a local salon that offers this treatment.</li>
            <li>used it today, it makes your hair so soft and shiny that it doesn&#x27;t look like it been through bleach or anything, only problem i see is the ends a bit burnt but works like a charm.</li>
            <li>usually fade quickly.</li>
            <li>She noted her hair did NOT loose any color in the shower</li>
            <li>Went from DRY damaged color processed hair to soft, thick, smooth, shiny in ONE application.</li>
            <li>Good product but very expensive shipping</li>
            <li>Its been a few days and hair is still very soft, easy to finger comb, and very few tangles even when waking from sleeping in loose hair over night.</li>
            <li>My hair has been bleached from dark brown to blonde, is straight, medium texture - long bob just FYI.</li>

            <li> The first two times I used Olaplex and saw no difference in my hair&#x27;s health which was amazing because I have naturally dark brown hair and have dyed it black multiple times.</li>
            <li> I have black hair naturally and have bleached my hair a number of times before and end up having to cut off a significant amount of hair because i end up frying it.</li>
            <li> Total revival of the damaged strands near my ears and really silkened the ends until I processed it again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what complete miracles people expect.</li>
            <li> and this really helped it bounce back to life.</li>
            <li> Very easy to brush through, with little drag, compared to before treating.   </li>
            <li> Make sure you visit the Olaplex site and read it, follow directions thoroughly and remember, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> yeah.. a little rough. :-)</li>
            <li> I would suggest just getting this treatment done at a local salon that offers this treatment.</li>
            <li> used it today, it makes your hair so soft and shiny that it doesn&#x27;t look like it been through bleach or anything, only problem i see is the ends a bit burnt but works like a charm.</li>
            <li> usually fade quickly.</li>
            <li> She noted her hair did NOT loose any color in the shower</li>
            <li> Went from DRY damaged color processed hair to soft, thick, smooth, shiny in ONE application.</li>
            <li> Good product but very expensive shipping</li>
            <li> Its been a few days and hair is still very soft, easy to finger comb, and very few tangles even when waking from sleeping in loose hair over night.</li>
            <li> My hair has been bleached from dark brown to blonde, is straight, medium texture - long bob just FYI.</li>
            <li> So I have very black, very relaxed hair, and almost every time I bleach my hair, I have to cut it off in a month.</li>
            <li> While it did slightly help the texture of my hair, it was far from a miracle worker.</li>
            <li> I have relaxed hair and no matter how hard I try I constantly see breakage while I know it&#x27;s normal to some extent</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be using this stuff for as long as they manufacture it.</li>
            <li> (from med brown and grey)</li>
            <li> if you have long hair , like I do 🚨</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because I was expecting it to be a little bit better especially because of how expensive this was for such little product.</li>
            <li> The only other products I&#x27;ve used that have helped damaged hair are Aphogee&#x27;s Two-Step Treatment and Liquid Keratin 60-Day.</li>
            <li> My hair was extremely damaged, and after using this it is now just simply damaged.</li>
            <li> I was very impatient and only left the bleach in for about 45 minutes each time which is why I was going back and forth with harassing my hair.</li>
            <li> Once my hair was dry</li>
            <li> I ordered an additional bottle of No. 3 from a different seller for use over the next few weeks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;a week later I washed and used step 3, typically when I wash my hair</li>
            <li> Dried my hair and brought it back to life.  </li>
            <li> After using step 1 and 2, shampoo and conditioner,  my wet hair felt stronger.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair about five inches past my shoulders.</li>
            <li> I bought the stand alone treatment after watching a number of youtube videos that featured this product as a way to prevent damage when lightening dark hair.</li>
            <li> I followed the single color process directions from their website, and put a super tiny amount of the no. 1 (.125 oz) into my base color and processed as usual.</li>
            <li> seriously, you only need 1/4 ounce of this stuff.</li>
            <li> When it was time to rinse out my hair, I noticed that way less dye was rinsing out.</li>
            <li> black hair did not break AT ALL after bleaching it when using Olaplex&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have thick coarse hair and the fact that my hair felt softer, even after a major color session at the salon (dark hair lightened to hold Pravana violet) is crazy.  </li>
            <li> Shipping cost as much as product.&lt;br /&gt;which made the experience disappointing.</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago, I bleached it twice in one day with a 20 volume developer.</li>
            <li> but it felt like the strands of my hair were firmly in my head.  </li>
            <li> claim that Olaplex will actually repair your existing broken bonds</li>
            <li> (all three steps are the same active ingredient, but different strengths, and 2 and 3 have added ingredients to created a cream base)  </li>
            <li> I have see a drastic reduction since using this product a few day ago !</li>
            <li> bleached my hair three times this past weekend.</li>
            <li> My hair was actually not very damaged, so the result wasn&#x27;t as dramatic as it might have been, but I do see a difference.</li>
            <li> It may just be that because I am not a professional and  I may have done something wrong?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard describe</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product and was somewhat disappointed.</li>
            <li> which sucks because i didnt want to ruin the color i had at the time.</li>
            <li> this mean I&#x27;ll never go to a hair salon ever again?</li>
            <li> But Olaplex is seriously a miracle worker.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel squeaky and thin-</li>
            <li> treatment is false.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve also the bad habit of colouring my hair then lightening again, so my tresses were troubled....</li>
            <li> I had really bad split ends</li>

            <li> Holy Guacamole, Batman!!! I&#x27;ve been platinum blonde for years but I&#x27;ve also the bad habit of colouring my hair then lightening again, so my tresses were troubled.... I heard about Olaplex, at first I thought &#x27;yea right&#x27; and it looked like all the before and after pictures were too good to be true or the girls had extensions in to make the hair look better - well, I tried this trial size and immediately my hair was feeling 100% better. It&#x27;s like a magic eraser for damaged hair. I&#x27;m in love and ordering more, the more you use, the better your hair becomes. Make sure you visit the Olaplex site and read it, follow directions thoroughly and remember, a little goes a long way! seriously, you only need 1/4 ounce of this stuff. Thank you, creators of Olaplex! I only wish I had found this when my hair was longer before I cut it off out of desperation.</li>
            <li> So I have very black, very relaxed hair, and almost every time I bleach my hair, I have to cut it off in a month. But Olaplex is seriously a miracle worker. I left bleach in my hair that was mixed with Olaplex for about 4 hours and after I washed it out my hair felt amazing, and a month later, my hair still feels greAt. I am in love and will be buying this again for the next time.</li>
            <li> Wonderful&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Send it soooo fast, new and my hair is amazingly super soft&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> I wish it was a bit clearer in the instructions</li>
            <li> hello peeps made my hair feel alive...need to know how often do I need a treatment again?</li>
            <li> Pricey items, I guess the only way to compare is to have the service done in a salon. Not a drastic difference in hair health, but it did add shine. Next time I want to try this when dyeing my hair...Directions are limited but easy to google. I only used this as a treatment, not coloring. Says to put No1 into a squirt bottle but i find if you put into a mixing bowl and &amp;#34;dip&amp;#34; ends in first, then pour the rest over crown area you get the most use of the product (If you DIY).</li>
            <li> Went from DRY damaged color processed hair to soft, thick, smooth, shiny in ONE application. (this was mixed with color for Ombre hairstyle). Tip have your stylist do it!</li>
            <li> My relaxed, TWICE bleached, African American hair feels like sweet silk. Need I say more?</li>
            <li> The product is good, the amount of the product is the issue. If youre using this is bleach buy more than you think you&#x27;ll need.</li>
            <li> This product has changed the integrity of my hail, love it.</li>
            <li> It was alright, I didn&#x27;t notice any shocking results, the company even states that,&amp;#34;it&#x27;s not like a magic wand that will automatically transform your hair&amp;#34; i think it would be great for those of you looking to bleach/lighten your hair even further or for your first time to minimize damage. I&#x27;d like to think my hair is in decent shape. I color it but it isn&#x27;t extra crispy. I&#x27;d say its pretty healthy. I bought the one time use and I bought a 3 oz bottle of step 3.  I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because I was expecting it to be a little bit better especially because of how expensive this was for such little product. It may just be that because I am not a professional and  I may have done something wrong? I followed the directions to a tee though. I would suggest just getting this treatment done at a local salon that offers this treatment. I&#x27;m still continuing the step 3 leave in treatment. Youre supposed to use it once or twice a week until the bottle is gone so we shall see how this goes.</li>
            <li> Great product,fast shipping,it was perfect!i will buy this again</li>
            <li> I have long hair about five inches past my shoulders. A few weeks ago, I bleached it twice in one day with a 20 volume developer. Despite the fact that I bleached twice, my hair was in pretty good shape, but I still couldn&#x27;t get it light enough. I didn&#x27;t use Olaplex at that time because I was unaware of the product. I wish I had known then, for sure. I bought Olaplex last week to use as a treatment alone, without bleach or color. I used No. 1 per the directions with 3 oz. of water and saturated my hair. That was just barely enough for my length of hair, so if you have longer hair, you may need two of these trial size kits. I left it in for five minutes and added No. 2 without rinsing out No.1. I left it in for an additional 30 minutes, even though you only need it in for 10 minutes. Then I shampooed and used a deep conditioner with keratin (Aphogee 2 Minute). I let my hair air dry after that for the most part and then styled. I noticed a huge difference in my hair. It&#x27;s like I never bleached it. I will use No. 3 the next time I shampoo, etc. I ordered an additional bottle of No. 3 from a different seller for use over the next few weeks. I plan on using No. 3 once or twice a week for a few more weeks. I already ordered another one of these trial sets with 1,2, &amp; 3 so that, in a month or two, I can bleach one more time, this time with Olaplex mixed into the bleach. I feel like this will allow me to get to a lighter color this time. I probably should just buy a bigger batch of this stuff because I really do love it. It worked great for me, unlike any hair product I&#x27;ve used before. The only other products I&#x27;ve used that have helped damaged hair are Aphogee&#x27;s Two-Step Treatment and Liquid Keratin 60-Day. They say that using Olaplex and then doing a keratin treatment is really great, so I plan on doing another keratin treatment soon. It&#x27;s nice that there is this small size available for people to try out. I know it might seem pricey for one go, but read the reviews and watch some of the YouTube videos and you&#x27;ll see why there&#x27;s such a buzz. I&#x27;ll be using this stuff for as long as they manufacture it. I also wanted to mention..... I use semi-permanent plum dye in my hair (Jerome Russell). I added more color after I finished with Olaplex. When it was time to rinse out my hair, I noticed that way less dye was rinsing out. It was like Olaplex made the color stick to my hair. That is a huge bonus for me, as colors like purple, red, etc. usually fade quickly. I can imagine that a permanent dye would be even better (if only they made them in these bright colors).</li>
            <li> Good product.  Easy to use.  The first step was great.  Dried my hair and brought it back to life.  Waited 4 days and used the next tube and final step.  This was just ok.  My hair is in better condition than it was but to say that it improved and is healthy again, no.  I think this is better used when bleaching for blocking any further damage.  Don&#x27;t pay to this done if you aren&#x27;t having your hair bleached. It&#x27;s so easy to use at home no need to pay for this at the salon.  My hair has been bleached from dark brown to blonde, is straight, medium texture - long bob just FYI.</li>
            <li> Good product but very expensive shipping</li>
            <li> Tried and loved! Even though it&#x27;s a one time use,  I instantly felt a difference in the texture of my hair. I had really bad split ends and this helped the breakage I was dealing with. Definitely buying the full size!</li>
            <li> Amazing products!  Great for fried and distressed hair. Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Shipping cost as much as product.&lt;br /&gt;which made the experience disappointing.</li>
            <li> So I purchased this and followed the directions.  Very easy.  After using step 1 and 2, shampoo and conditioner,  my wet hair felt stronger.  It&#x27;s hard describe but it felt like the strands of my hair were firmly in my head.  Once my hair was dry I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in the appearance though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a week later I washed and used step 3, typically when I wash my hair I shed tons of hair, (like gobs) and only noticed like 4 or 5 hairs come out.  My hair appeared a bit shinier this go around so things are looking promising for the long-term</li>
            <li> Olaplex is amazing...I have thick coarse hair and the fact that my hair felt softer, even after a major color session at the salon (dark hair lightened to hold Pravana violet) is crazy.  So glad I found it available here, and it was easy for me to do an application at home when touching up my color and I had the same great results.</li>
            <li> used it today, it makes your hair so soft and shiny that it doesn&#x27;t look like it been through bleach or anything, only problem i see is the ends a bit burnt but works like a charm.</li>
            <li> definitely an excellent product. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to take good&lt;br /&gt;care of her/his hair. It is good both on natural, and color treated hair.</li>
            <li> Awesome product.I had my friend whos in beauty school apply it after highlights. I like it</li>
            <li> Love it! Anyone who dyes their hair should do this treatment!</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping and really amazing product! My blond hair was damaged from a horrible bleaching treatment at the salon and this restored my hair to 80% of its strength after just one treatment! Olaplex really is a miracle product. Just make sure you follow directions. There&#x27;s actually an iPhone app for Olaplex which is very informative! I mixed my step 1 with water according to directions but it can also be mixed with your lightening solution.</li>
            <li> love this on my bleached hair</li>
            <li> Did nothing much willing to give it a next chance</li>
            <li> Not the holy grail. I don&#x27;t know what complete miracles people expect. Definitely reverses a lot of damage. My hair was too bleached and dyed last year, and I wish I had known about these products then. Total revival of the damaged strands near my ears and really silkened the ends until I processed it again. The only thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that it doesn&#x27;t replace the need to keep using a lot of conditioner. I am still using quite a bit, and my hair now again feels very damaged/dry after one toner application since using this kit once. Also the price went up the day after I bought it from $21 to $37 otherwise I would have bought it again. I&#x27;ll be getting it again for future coloring for sure.</li>
            <li> i have heard nothing but amazing things about this product so i figured i would get a test kit and try it! Boy were they right. I have a lot of clients who have &amp;#34;damaged&amp;#34; hair and this makes it possible for them to still have the summer highlights or that &amp;#34;in&amp;#34; style they carve without their hair falling out. I will be buying the full size of this treatment from this seller. Highly reccommend!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product and was somewhat disappointed. While it did slightly help the texture of my hair, it was far from a miracle worker. I&#x27;ve been told that sometimes it takes 2-3 treatments so maybe I just need to do it another time or 2.</li>
            <li> For my daughter and her friend.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with the products results</li>
            <li> Works really well for damaged hair</li>
            <li> Totally amazing. Use it. Seriously. Buy it use it in chemical processes. It&#x27;s like a magical miracle cure. I lightened prelightened hair and it came out in better condition than it went in. My hair lifted to pale yellow and my pastel color melt came out wonderful. Thank you olaplex.</li>
            <li> My hair was extremely damaged, and after using this it is now just simply damaged. I was hoping for a complete overhaul like reviews and hair gurus have raved, but I&#x27;m just not that impressed. It made my hair feel squeaky and thin- and although it did repair some damage it wasn&#x27;t near the amount that I expected it would. I feel like it was almost a trade off, where healthier parts of my hair now feel less healthy, but the compromised parts are slightly better. That is just my experience though. Also, this kit barely covers it if you have long and medium thickness hair. I haven&#x27;t decided if I would try this again.</li>
            <li> I have relaxed hair and no matter how hard I try I constantly see breakage while I know it&#x27;s normal to some extent I have see a drastic reduction since using this product a few day ago ! I was worried at first as you should be when ever trying something on your precious hair but ladies this is worth it and then some I am already reordering back ups I just wish this was available when I first started relaxing my hair , I would recommend leaving the treatment in longer than the stated times for first time use as I was a little scared to do so but do I regret it now ! Absolute miracle for relaxed hair</li>
            <li> My hair was actually not very damaged, so the result wasn&#x27;t as dramatic as it might have been, but I do see a difference. I have been doing a single process red on my hair for a LONG time, and I&#x27;ve always been pretty good about doing a treatment of some sort after every color, so again, my hair wasn&#x27;t really very damaged, but 20 plus years of  coloring your hair every 5 to 6 weeks... it wasn&#x27;t perfect either. I followed the single color process directions from their website, and put a super tiny amount of the no. 1 (.125 oz) into my base color and processed as usual. Rinsed that out, and put on the no. 2 for 20 minutes. washed my hair and did my normal post color conditioning treatment. It feels pretty good, and it does feel fuller. Pardon the crummy selfie before and after - I&#x27;d been up about 5 minutes in the before, so yeah.. a little rough. :-)</li>
            <li> My hair is damaged and after using olaplex, my hair looked about 50% better and less frizzy and seemed stronger.</li>
            <li> Works as described. My hair is severely damaged from over processing, the Olaplex system is brilliant for truly repairing some of the damage.</li>
            <li> I bought the stand alone treatment after watching a number of youtube videos that featured this product as a way to prevent damage when lightening dark hair. I have black hair naturally and have bleached my hair a number of times before and end up having to cut off a significant amount of hair because i end up frying it. This time I added the Olaplex following the instructions on their website and love the results! It didnt prevent ALL damage, like some of the youtube videos and Pinterest pins make it seem, but it did reduce the amount of damage quite a bit. Be sure to select a developer that is the next level higher than what you want, as Olaplex will make your developer weaker. (If you were going to use a 20v developer, now use a 30v developer to get 20v results)</li>
            <li> I received the product very fast I was a unsure at first but when I received it was in seal box and seal contdiner each. I used it and my hair was amazing, before it was fried and dry I thought I was going to have to cut it. I will def order again!</li>
            <li> Great product, saved my hair!</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s the real product and not a dupe.&lt;br /&gt;-The title says &amp;#34;Single Use&amp;#34; but I was able to get two uses out of the No. 1 formula (How much of the formula you use is dependent on how much bleach you are using. Refer to Olaplex&#x27;s website for instructions on proper usage)&lt;br /&gt;-My black hair did not break AT ALL after bleaching it when using Olaplex&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Some claim that Olaplex will actually repair your existing broken bonds but I have not noticed that; HOWEVER, I have yet to use formula&#x27;s No. 2 and 3. I&#x27;ve only used No. 1 in my bleaching mixture therefore I cannot give a proper response to that claim because I did not follow the recommended instructions. I can, however, claim that I saw no damage to my hair after using No. 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story:&lt;br /&gt;I bleached my hair three times this past weekend. The first two times I used Olaplex and saw no difference in my hair&#x27;s health which was amazing because I have naturally dark brown hair and have dyed it black multiple times. The third time I ran out of Olaplex but decided to bleach anyway and my hair did get fried at the ends! I probably won&#x27;t ever bleach without Olaplex again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: With Olaplex, you should be able to bleach your hair to your desired blond color with 1-2 (instead of 3) as long as you are patient and understand that with Olaplex, bleach takes longer to process. I was very impatient and only left the bleach in for about 45 minutes each time which is why I was going back and forth with harassing my hair. (Learn from my mistakes)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this product? Definitely, without a doubt. (But I would always buy from Olaplex and not another seller)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does this mean I&#x27;ll never go to a hair salon ever again? Nope. I can&#x27;t get the same luxuries at home as I do in a salon. I also don&#x27;t want to be the one to do my hair all the time so I would still happily outsource. Stylists need not worry; we still need you. This only means that I can give my bank account a break and do some treatments at home from time to time.y bank account a break and do some treatments at home from time to time.</li>
            <li> Helped my hair a ton!</li>
            <li> I dye my hair bright copper red. (from med brown and grey) My hair is straight and fine, with some split end damage on the ends, but in generally good shape. Been dyeing for many years. Below bra strap length. I usually keep my hair is good shape, with trimes every 3 months, deep conditioner weekly, and protein treatments as needed.  I used this as a &amp;#34;between color services&amp;#34; treatment. (mixed with water, used a strong sulfate shampoo to strip hair first, and applied to damp hair) It did not alter or lighten my color in any way. My daughter also used it on her platinum blond hair, sides shaved (bleached from med brown) dyed a temporary, but faded, Manic Panic Purple. (just below shoulder length and courser hair) She noted her hair did NOT loose any color in the shower (it normally always does in every shower and shampoo) nor was the color altered.  Both of us noticed our hair felt softer, silkier, and the ends defiantly felt smoother and nicer before treatment.  Its been a few days and hair is still very soft, easy to finger comb, and very few tangles even when waking from sleeping in loose hair over night. Very easy to brush through, with little drag, compared to before treating.   I left level 2 on hair for one hour, daughter left level three on for 1 hour. Shampooed and used reg conditioner after.  (all three steps are the same active ingredient, but different strengths, and 2 and 3 have added ingredients to created a cream base)  I plan to purchase more and use regular to maintain hair helath, and will be adding to my next color service as well.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Highly recommended if bleaching your hair. I have very fine hair and this really helped it bounce back to life.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a difference .... Guess it takes more than one treatment!! if you have long hair , like I do 🚨 this kit won&#x27;t be sufficient to saturated hair from root to end.</li>
            <li> everyone forgets to say this wont work unless theres some heated chemical reaction. only works with bleaching and hair coloring the stand alone treatment is false. doesnt work at all.. ive tried it twice. only worked when i added this to bleach. which sucks because i didnt want to ruin the color i had at the time.</li>
