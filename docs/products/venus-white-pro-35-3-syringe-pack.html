            <li>The price is perfect for what you get and I will reorder it.</li>
            <li>Also stay away from anything you think would stain your teeth for the duration of bleaching and then 24-48 hours after stopping (ex: bleach for 3-10 nights in a row) for best results.</li>
            <li>It is one of the best buys on Amazon!</li>
            <li>Very Happy with product and price</li>
            <li>The price was phenomenal ! ! !  </li>
            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>Great product and killer price</li>

            <li>I was so happy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite happy</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>

            <li>When I need more, I know where I&#x27;m going!!</li>
            <li>With ditching the retail packing, cost wise it&#x27;s almost 2 for the price of one.</li>
            <li>Good  </li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>These are the most powerful and effective whitening treatments I&#x27;ve used in my years of use!</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the speed of the shipping.</li>
            <li>I am going to use it a while longer, and if I see even more results, I will update this review.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>GREAT for keeping a bright white shine!</li>
            <li>I love my results.</li>
            <li>most of our patients teeth.</li>
            <li>This product can cause sensitivity, more for some than others.</li>
            <li>I recommend consulting your dentist on how to use this product appropriately.</li>
            <li>even more so</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li>Easy to use - did not create sensitivity in my teeth.  </li>
            <li>This product is too strong for home use.  </li>
            <li>After paying $400+ for the whitening package from the orthodontist, it&#x27;s a huge relief to be able to purchase the replacement syringes (at a more powerful percentage) for a fraction of the cost that you would pay from a retailer.</li>
            <li>Teeth are very poress during the bleaching process and more open to stain. :D</li>
            <li>This venus gel is great and doesn&#x27;t irritate the gum unlike whitening strips sole in the store.</li>
            <li>So I was being cheap and ordered this product.  </li>
            <li>Venus is my favorite product out right now.</li>
            <li>My first surprise was that i didn&#x27;t get seepage!!</li>
            <li>QUICK AND SO EASY TO USE.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a cost effective alternative to in office whitening procedures.</li>
            <li>The product did not show up in its original packaging.  </li>
            <li>I first learned about this from my dentist and am pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>(I keep the bleach in for 30 minutes) but this quickly fades and I do not experience any longer term sensitivity at all.</li>
            <li>Just better overall results for more people.</li>
            <li>I had pretty light teeth before this product, shade B1 for you dental pros out there, but I used to have M1.</li>
            <li>It whitens my teeth very bright white in only three applications.</li>
            <li>Many thanks to the providers for making this readily available and seamless.</li>
            <li>think if, like me, you notice some discoloration due to age, food, etc, this gel is a good bet.  </li>
            <li>It makes my teeth super white, is easy to use and I recommend it.</li>
            <li>I got my first pack from the dentist, but they were going to charge about $25/syringe for refills.</li>
            <li>Works so fast!</li>
            <li>B1 is lightest on most shade guides in a dental practice, where as M1 is closer to a hollywood white ;)</li>
            <li>My wife paid dentist $ 200 for fitting and bleach syringes and my Venus system came with enough syringes for two persons and self- fitted holders with blue light activation.  </li>
            <li>I experienced slight sensitivity for about an hour, only because I was using 22% before.</li>
            <li>This product came in the mail extremely fast.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need that much in the mouth trays.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>That alone was fantastic, but after just one time of use I could see a visual, noticeable shade change in my teeth!!</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>I will buy again, much cheaper than buying from my dentist office.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipment</li>
            <li>The products are original Venus White Pro products.</li>
            <li>Product was delivered early and is exactly as described</li>
            <li>I have used both the 35% and the 22% and have gotten similar results, Its just that the weaker concentration requires more applications for the same results.</li>
            <li>Bleaches extensively and quickly.</li>
            <li>Needless to say after my great results my entire office switched to Venus and our patient&#x27;s feel like they are getting their money&#x27;s worth with this product.</li>
            <li>Usually you have to keep a spit/drool rag around the whole time, and most the product foams up over the trays on your gums and burns.</li>
            <li>These are the exact same Syringe Packs sold at my dentist&#x27;s office for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>the first time (the second time for over an hour).</li>
            <li>If you want ultra white teeth, ZOOM might be your thing, but I paid my dentist 250 bucks for a custom mouth tray that lasts my whole life</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used this about 7 days so far.  </li>
            <li>My teeth get slightly sensitive immediately after the treatment</li>
            <li>I suggest if you&#x27;re sensitive to take an Advil and put clean dry trays back in mouth to help keep air from hitting your teeth until sensitivity subsides.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t to use much per application and you can definitely see results!</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than same product from dentist.</li>
            <li>We got a sample of this from a sales rep. I had been looking for a new bleach that actually produces great results, not just mediocre, for the last 10 years.</li>
            <li>I am only on day 4 of whitening, but they are already getting pretty white.</li>
            <li>This product got my teeth back to this shade, which is pretty darn white!!</li>
            <li>No instructions,  but looks exactly like the kit I bought from the Dentist for $50.00 minus the box and instructions.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t smoke or drink much wine, so if your teeth are \\&quot;super-stained\\&quot; or very \\&quot;tobacco\\&quot; yellow, I am not sure how it might work for you.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if the money was worth it or not.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the money was worth it or not.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, back to Venus.... I use custom trays, I use just a drop in the center of the facial side of each tooth in my tray then smear it around with tip of syringe to cover the entire facial surface.</li>
            <li> (Just as long as you already have custom made whitening trays or essex style retainers)</li>
            <li> Along the way I&#x27;ve tried Opalescence, Day/Night White, Zoom, and a few others.</li>
            <li> was not very effective and the supply did not last as long as my previous whitener, &amp;#34;night bright&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical when I saw this on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have worked in a dental office for a 17 yrs, half my life</li>
            <li> If you bleach the mess out of your teeth you can get some results from those.</li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> Way less expensive than the dentist office treatment, but with similar results.</li>
            <li> They became white and when that wore off, they were extremely red and painful.</li>
            <li> I saw very little improvement.  </li>
            <li> It was in a plastic bag and two of the tips were broken off.  </li>
            <li> it was not that bad, but at least I can tell you what to expect.</li>
            <li> It was awful it burned my gums can&#x27;t even use it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product came in the mail extremely fast. I was pleased with the speed of the shipping. The products are original Venus White Pro products. After paying $400+ for the whitening package from the orthodontist, it&#x27;s a huge relief to be able to purchase the replacement syringes (at a more powerful percentage) for a fraction of the cost that you would pay from a retailer. These are the most powerful and effective whitening treatments I&#x27;ve used in my years of use! I would highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a cost effective alternative to in office whitening procedures. (Just as long as you already have custom made whitening trays or essex style retainers)</li>
            <li> This stuff seems to have made my teeth a couple shades brighter. I have been using bleaching trays for a couple years, but this solution is the strongest I used.  If you want ultra white teeth, ZOOM might be your thing, but I paid my dentist 250 bucks for a custom mouth tray that lasts my whole life and I buy the bleaching gels online since it is cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if, like me, you notice some discoloration due to age, food, etc, this gel is a good bet.  I don&#x27;t smoke or drink much wine, so if your teeth are \\&quot;super-stained\\&quot; or very \\&quot;tobacco\\&quot; yellow, I am not sure how it might work for you.  You might need the dentist to haul in the lasers for that job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this about 7 days so far.  I am going to use it a while longer, and if I see even more results, I will update this review.</li>
            <li> Product was delivered early and is exactly as described</li>
            <li> The product when it arrived was in a cardboard tube, NOT retail packaging! It IS the same product, just not the fancy packaging. The actual product packaging is the same and works the same. With ditching the retail packing, cost wise it&#x27;s almost 2 for the price of one. Keep your retail and markup! When I need more, I know where I&#x27;m going!!</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical when I saw this on Amazon. I got my first pack from the dentist, but they were going to charge about $25/syringe for refills. To my relief the Amazon product came in sealed packaging, looked and worked the same as the product from my dentist. I am only on day 4 of whitening, but they are already getting pretty white.</li>
            <li> I saw very little improvement.  I&#x27;m not sure if the money was worth it or not.  I think I will look around at the competition next time.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It makes my teeth super white, is easy to use and I recommend it. The price is perfect for what you get and I will reorder it.</li>
            <li> The product did not show up in its original packaging.  It was in a plastic bag and two of the tips were broken off.  The lack of packaging raises concerns that the product might be counterfeit.  I like the VenusWhite product, but this pruchase/vendor are suspect.</li>
            <li> Love it. I get a lower percent from my dentist. So i know it works . &amp; whoever said it burns their gums shouldn&#x27;t apply it to their gums. There is a process. It&#x27;s easy. You don&#x27;t need that much in the mouth trays. It works great.</li>
            <li> It was awful it burned my gums can&#x27;t even use it. A waste of money. And I have had this strength before</li>
            <li> Great product and killer price</li>
            <li> Used this product and it burned my gums. They became white and when that wore off, they were extremely red and painful. It took 4 days before the pain went away, and a week for the redness to fade. Although my teeth are whitened, along my gum line they are still slightly yellow. Cannot bear to repeat use of this product.</li>
            <li> 35% is a great way to show results faster. This venus gel is great and doesn&#x27;t irritate the gum unlike whitening strips sole in the store.</li>
            <li> These are the exact same Syringe Packs sold at my dentist&#x27;s office for a fraction of the price. GREAT for keeping a bright white shine!</li>
            <li> even though it mentions that does not give you any teeth sensitivity after using it, I did get it. it was not that bad, but at least I can tell you what to expect.</li>
            <li> Great product, will use again.</li>
            <li> Have been using this brand for about two years.  I first learned about this from my dentist and am pleased with the results.  Found this on Amazon and the price is great.  Have saved a lot of money ordering from Amazon!!!!</li>
            <li> Works so fast! I love my results. I experienced slight sensitivity for about an hour, only because I was using 22% before.</li>
            <li> ITEMS  ARRIVED ON TIME AND UNDAMAGED. WORKS GREAT. THANKS</li>
            <li> This stuff works great. It whitens my teeth very bright white in only three applications. Way less expensive than the dentist office treatment, but with similar results. I have used both the 35% and the 22% and have gotten similar results, Its just that the weaker concentration requires more applications for the same results. My teeth get slightly sensitive immediately after the treatment (I keep the bleach in for 30 minutes) but this quickly fades and I do not experience any longer term sensitivity at all.</li>
            <li> Good  this is what my dentist uses.</li>
            <li> I have worked in a dental office for a 17 yrs, half my life O.O. I have been bleaching my teeth ever since. Venus is my favorite product out right now. We got a sample of this from a sales rep. I had been looking for a new bleach that actually produces great results, not just mediocre, for the last 10 years. Along the way I&#x27;ve tried Opalescence, Day/Night White, Zoom, and a few others. If you bleach the mess out of your teeth you can get some results from those. But I couldn&#x27;t see that great of a change in shade in my teeth or most of our patients teeth. Anyway, back to Venus.... I use custom trays, I use just a drop in the center of the facial side of each tooth in my tray then smear it around with tip of syringe to cover the entire facial surface. I wore my trays for only 15 mins. the first time (the second time for over an hour). My first surprise was that i didn&#x27;t get seepage!! If you&#x27;ve bleached before, you know what I&#x27;m talking about. Usually you have to keep a spit/drool rag around the whole time, and most the product foams up over the trays on your gums and burns. Not with this product, it stays in the trays!!!! That alone was fantastic, but after just one time of use I could see a visual, noticeable shade change in my teeth!! I was so happy. I had pretty light teeth before this product, shade B1 for you dental pros out there, but I used to have M1. This product got my teeth back to this shade, which is pretty darn white!! B1 is lightest on most shade guides in a dental practice, where as M1 is closer to a hollywood white ;) after my sample I ordered this for only $18.00 for 3 tubes here. Needless to say after my great results my entire office switched to Venus and our patient&#x27;s feel like they are getting their money&#x27;s worth with this product. Just better overall results for more people. This product can cause sensitivity, more for some than others. No pain, no gain!! I suggest if you&#x27;re sensitive to take an Advil and put clean dry trays back in mouth to help keep air from hitting your teeth until sensitivity subsides. Don&#x27;t eat with them in! Also stay away from anything you think would stain your teeth for the duration of bleaching and then 24-48 hours after stopping (ex: bleach for 3-10 nights in a row) for best results. Teeth are very poress during the bleaching process and more open to stain. :D</li>
            <li> i HAVE BEEN USING ITFORYEARS iT WORKS WELL.</li>
            <li> This product is too strong for home use.  I had been using another product that I purchased from the dentist office (15%) and had no problem with it.  So I was being cheap and ordered this product.  Within minutes of putting the bleaching trays in my gums were burning, so I checked them and my gums were WHITE!</li>
            <li> Burned my gums. They got white and puffy. Stopped after 2 mins</li>
            <li> Love this product! You don&#x27;t to use much per application and you can definitely see results! I recommend consulting your dentist on how to use this product appropriately.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  No instructions,  but looks exactly like the kit I bought from the Dentist for $50.00 minus the box and instructions.</li>
            <li> I only had to apply this gel for 3 hrs at a time to get the same results I got with others in twice that amount of time.  Easy to use - did not create sensitivity in my teeth.  The price was phenomenal ! ! !  Will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> was not very effective and the supply did not last as long as my previous whitener, &amp;#34;night bright&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My wife paid dentist $ 200 for fitting and bleach syringes and my Venus system came with enough syringes for two persons and self- fitted holders with blue light activation.  It is one of the best buys on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Worked as advertised. Much cheaper than same product from dentist.</li>
            <li> Works for me. Can recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite happy w/the product that I received...and even more so w/the compliments that I&#x27;ve gotten from using it!  I&#x27;ll definitely be doing this on a regular basis. Many thanks to the providers for making this readily available and seamless.</li>
            <li> This my shade up 3x&#x27;s the whiteness.  I will buy again, much cheaper than buying from my dentist office.  Very Happy with product and price</li>
            <li> The syringes kept coming apart as I was using them, which has not happened with the ones I have bought at my dental office. I think they were defective.</li>
            <li> Great product. Bleaches extensively and quickly.</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast shipment</li>
            <li> HAVE NOT USED ALL THE SYRINGES, BUT HAVE GREAT RESULTS SO FOR.&lt;br /&gt;WORKS QUICK AND SO EASY TO USE. LIKE THIS PRODUCT</li>
