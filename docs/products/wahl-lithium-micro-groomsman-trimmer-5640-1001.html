            <li>Not as good as one I had before.  </li>
            <li>so I replaced the Lithium battery which did not seem to do much good.  </li>
            <li>but it works good on the hairs that grow along my cheek bones too.  </li>
            <li>Suprisinglly good battery life.  </li>
            <li>Does what a good portable trimmer should.</li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>I tried another brand - wish I remembered the name so that I could trash it - and that broke after being used just two times, so it is obviously superior to something like that.  </li>
            <li>I got it and have loved using it.</li>
            <li>Good compact trimmer, Wish the attachments were somehow incorporated or self contained into the unit.</li>
            <li>It is a good value in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>engineering wise</li>
            <li>This seems like a good trimmer it cuts with no problems.</li>
            <li>But works good</li>
            <li>had one of these years ago and loved it.  </li>
            <li>Good battery life.</li>
            <li>Good trimmer for around $10 or so</li>

            <li>Still a good looking product just wish it was more functional.</li>
            <li>Battery power is nice too.</li>
            <li>HAS NICE ATTACHMENTS</li>
            <li>This model works perfectly, the nose trimmer lets you cut very close and has plenty of power.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use any of the attachments, but  being waterproof is a nice feature.  </li>
            <li>It has nice &#x27;balance&#x27; as it were, so you feel you have a grip on it</li>
            <li>has a nice feel</li>

            <li>This is the best personal trimmer I have found, it cuts great.</li>
            <li>Nice product.  </li>
            <li>Nice, you get what you see...</li>
            <li>It would have been nice if you could recharge it like the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Compact design and effective to use.</li>
            <li>It cuts the hairs so nicely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice tool, but a woman should not try this on her nose...</li>
            <li>Would be nice if container were included.</li>
            <li>Its compact and the fit and finish for this cheap trimmer are the best Ive seen for any of these micro trimmers including Panasonic</li>
            <li>Excellent price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>AMAZON HAS THE &amp;#34;TV&amp;#34; KIND ALSO.  </li>

            <li>very easy to switch attachments.</li>
            <li>Works like a dream, though the attachment just a a bit too large to allow me to use this as a very good ear trimmer.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what I got them for, so they are definitely suitable.</li>
            <li>Best trimmer I&#x27;ve used so far and can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>So far the best one I have purchased</li>
            <li>far this is the best nose trimmer I have had to date.</li>
            <li>By far the best one of these I&#x27;ve had in terms of strength.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think there is anything perfect for maintaining these sensitive areas of the body...</li>
            <li>Nice and cheap!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of trimmers like this, and so far this is the best.</li>
            <li>The trimmer worked great right out of the box.</li>
            <li>two included bayonet mount trimming tools are nice and would be suitable for all grooming jobs if this trimmer were more appropriately</li>
            <li>Awesome little trimmer, I am happy with how durable this is.</li>
            <li>I been using this trimmer for about 3 weeks now, i have tried many others and this one is far the best for the price.</li>
            <li>does a nice clean job!</li>
            <li>Works great and does exactly what its made for.</li>
            <li>It worked great at first, and still works, but it stalls when I turn it on.</li>
            <li>Works good, not painful, like some.</li>
            <li>Works fine!</li>
            <li>VERY cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>Very cheaply made, and doesn&#x27;t cut hair, as advertised.</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>Works extremely good, super light,and it has a cap</li>
            <li>When you insert the attachment for the trimmer PROPERLY it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>LOVE them.</li>
            <li>kinda flimsy but does the job the top keeps falling off but for the price it works</li>
            <li>You have to turn it off and take the top off and reset it and than do it over and over again to get it to work.</li>
            <li>MORE THAN COINCIDENCE, NSA?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This trimmer is way better than I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Performs better than any others used.</li>
            <li>I find that this shaver is great for intimate areas.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used better trimmers for the nasal hairs.</li>
            <li>This is a compact battery powered trimmer that will be ok</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned several micro trimmers over the years, but this one is the best I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>There has to be something better then this.  </li>
            <li>It is fast and efficient and came in at a great price.  </li>
            <li>Hope it works better.  </li>
            <li>Avoid this one and get a sturdier model even if you have to pay more.</li>
            <li>it probably work ok for that, between eyebrows, outer ear and lobes and for stray beard</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Perfect for facial hair</li>
            <li>but I mostly got this for eyebrow trimming.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Is much more efficient than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s safe and has never cut me.</li>
            <li>This one is holding up well- alot more power than the others</li>
            <li>Works ok as a trimmer but the nose hair trimmer attachment doesn&#x27;t work on the unit anymore</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I returned it and got 2 more...</li>
            <li>Otherwise, there are much better products to choose from.</li>
            <li>I have tried to fix, but was better off throwing away.</li>
            <li>My son says he looks and feels better with nose hair groomed.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this item.</li>
            <li>Works O.K., could use a better &#x27;rake&#x27; for doing eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works O.K., could use a better &#x27;rake for doing eyebrows.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still , glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>Best out of the last 4 trimmers I have gotten.  </li>
            <li>I love the options of trimmer head.</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>I used a screw driver to pop out most of the items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
            <li>Not what I was expecting, it more pulls hair than cuts.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it seem ok for $10.</li>
            <li>I have tried many brandsof trimmers</li>
            <li>but it seems ok quality</li>
            <li>sure if it makes sense...</li>
            <li>It was much more finicky when used by a 90 yr.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite ear/nose/eyebrow trimmer that I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>Provides many helpful trimming functions.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay trimmer that could be made better.</li>
            <li>This product trims better than any I&#x27;ve found for nose, ear, eyebrow, etc.</li>
            <li>the phillips works much better.</li>
            <li>Pleased with it?</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I have been using this for over a month now on my sideburns and to just trim off the top of my chest hair so it wouldn&#x27;t stick out of my shirt</li>
            <li>It needed many passes to trim my not-thick brows, so I feel that if you have hair thicker than I do, you would find it not too satisfying.</li>
            <li>Have used a &amp;#34;as seen on TV&amp;#34; version of this product before but wanted something a bit more robust in construction.  </li>
            <li>If you mostly shave and hygienate at night like I do</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>I ordered this I would be pleased</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It does seem to be more powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the attachments.</li>
            <li>overall size is awesome as well.</li>
            <li>best thing about this Wahl Groomsman is it gives me both the blade and rotary head in the same compact trimmer.  </li>
            <li>safe to use everywhere</li>
            <li>AND HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY SATISFIED.  </li>
            <li>THOUGHT WAHL WOULD BE EVEN BETTER.  </li>
            <li>Just be sure you charge the battery appropriately</li>
            <li>and It was safe.</li>
            <li>A keeper for sure.</li>
            <li>This is an outstanding trimmer.</li>
            <li>To me this is a thousand times better than the Micro Touch Trimmer.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll be okay.  </li>
            <li>Works ok but it pulls hair once in a while.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it till I find something better.</li>
            <li>Seems ok.</li>
            <li>High quality and great service.  </li>
            <li>Started out pretty good...</li>
            <li>For the price-point one shouldn&#x27;t expect high-end performance, but it works perfectly for minor grooming needs.</li>
            <li>Cheaply priced, cheaply made, yet still effective.</li>
            <li>Excellent power, excellent cutting.</li>
            <li>Works so great, I was very surprised.</li>
            <li>I would give it 5 stars but the first one showed up DOA, quick replacement and happy with it.</li>
            <li>This is much more sturdy than the cheap as-seen-on-TV trimmer.</li>
            <li>Works great to shave your hands and feet if you suffer from being a werewolf or if you masturbate frequently and have to deal with hairy palms..</li>
            <li>I was able to jerk and rock the cheap plastic head that doesn&#x27;t turn...</li>
            <li>To me, this makes this a perfect candidate for a NiMH rechargeable battery that will provide full power and then just stop: no hair pulls, more energy efficient and cheaper to use in the long run.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the 9-bucks I spent on this item, I am very happy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very slim and does a good job.</li>
            <li>The nose hair trimmer could be a little better, but it&#x27;s an excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li>battery is easy to replace - and the trimmer is more powerful than most I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>where I&#x27;ve never had it.&lt;br /&gt;Now easily managed.</li>
            <li>Easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li>IT WILL GET STUCK AND NOT LOOSEN EASILY</li>
            <li>Easy to stick in your travel bag, works with a battery.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if they have changed it or not, but it was easy to clip on the two attachments.  </li>
            <li>I can trip my beard and ears and noise easily.</li>
            <li>It easily fits in travel bags.</li>
            <li>Compact, easy to change trim heads, and to operate.  </li>
            <li>The motor seems strong and the trimmer has a quality feel to it.</li>
            <li>These personal trimmers have become very popular - and some work better than others.  </li>
            <li>perfect, for areas you don&#x27;t want hair but are not worth pulling or lasering, the shave is close and painless</li>
            <li>Cheap, easy to use, safe and quick to use.  </li>
            <li>But the nose trimmer still works fine.</li>
            <li>At this point, I would recommend this for anyone looking for a nose hair or fine tuning type of trimmer.</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>Instrument works fine.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it yet-its a backup-should be fine by its looks</li>
            <li>When I got that home, everything was fine except that the product didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>anywhere you have fine hair to be trimed.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and easy to use.</li>
            <li>High powered and sturdy, I am very pleased with the purchase.  </li>
            <li>This won&#x27;t likely be your primary trimmer, but it&#x27;s great for travel --</li>
            <li>Might have to get a cheap eyeglass case to hold them.</li>
            <li>Extra heads are great to have.</li>
            <li>The product is great for trimming neckline, facial, underarm hair and bikini area.  </li>
            <li>Cheaply made.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t knick and that is really important.</li>
            <li>Although it does the job, it feels cheap and flimsy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is no LED light here.</li>
            <li>cheap, broke within 3 months</li>
            <li>Cheaply made and falls apart.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and nice packaging.</li>
            <li>Works great with several attachments.  </li>
            <li>Cheap piece of junk.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But this thing was dirt cheap.</li>
            <li>I bought this Wahl trimmer primarily to trim my mustache, something that needs doing every week or two to stay looking neat.</li>
            <li>I would recommend the Wahl to those who may need a slim, light weight trimmer that hopefully will stand the test of time.</li>
            <li>Easy clean with water.</li>
            <li>I have tried many trimmers, but this one clearly wins out.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer works great for mustache, sideburns, neck, and back hair trimming.</li>
            <li>It comes with a lithium battery (not rechargeable) and feels so much more powerful then all the others.</li>
            <li>Expect it to work on light trimming, and it will do what you want it to.</li>
            <li>This product is comfortable, but locks up on nose and eye brow hair.</li>
            <li>So if I lightly tapped it against the counter, sometimes it would kick on.</li>
            <li>That might sound like a pain... and why still give it 5 stars?  </li>
            <li>Cheaply made product.</li>
            <li>In fact, the packaging is more worth than the content.</li>
            <li>that why its so cheap.</li>
            <li>battery life is great, but i only use this as needed  </li>
            <li>This is not like the cheap ones at walmart.</li>
            <li>It kind of snagged but didn&#x27;t trim much.</li>
            <li>; product with the LED light beat them all, even Remington.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t cut hair comfortably but pulls the hair, pain to use.</li>
            <li>This item is so cheaply made.</li>
            <li>It works, but seems cheap.  </li>
            <li>Cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>Everything just seems like the fit is off.</li>
            <li>Attachments fit well.</li>
            <li>enough said, It cuts great</li>
            <li>Fantastic trimmer</li>
            <li>Sometimes it would turn on and sound like it was running at 1/2 power.</li>
            <li>AND the bedroom door so that my son wouldn&#x27;t wake up by its horrendous sound.</li>
            <li>The battery isn&#x27;t rechargeable, but will probably outlast the cheap plastic trimmer parts anyway.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean up.</li>
            <li>It is powerful and feels substantial and is much better than those advertised on TV and elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>This one is far superior in speed, power, and in time we&#x27;ll see if longevity also prevails.</li>
            <li>but so far so good.</li>
            <li>Great item, Better than expected</li>
            <li>The nose hair trimmer could do a better job, but good enough.  </li>
            <li>and so far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>worked pretty good the first time.&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
            <li>Very powerful, too.  </li>
            <li>It is simple to use and very effective for ear and nose trimming.</li>
            <li>Very powerful and doesn&#x27;t catch on the thicker hairs.</li>
            <li>this trimmer cuts my beard trimming time in half , very smooth and whal is a great company and make quality products ..</li>
            <li>It cut smoothly and quickly (again - I have relatively fine hair).</li>
            <li>The review said it was powerful !</li>
            <li>I had one of these, and was pretty satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>This Wahl micro trimmer is the best of all these small type trimmers on the market.</li>
            <li>Well, it&#x27;s not expensive, but it&#x27;s also cheap!  </li>
            <li>Not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li>Compared to others that I have seen it is significantly louder, about 86 decibels.</li>
            <li>The original battery has lasted for quite some time as well.</li>
            <li>Very much worth the cost!</li>
            <li>As long as it lasts for a year or two, I&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
            <li>Best I&#x27;ve tried in the past 10 years.</li>
            <li>Nice clean edges, good speed and the price was $3 less than when I happened to see it in the store after I got this one.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good in not being to rough on skin, but not too impressive on performance vs. other power groomers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I have owned several of these micro trimmers and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>It stays clean.</li>
            <li>The fact that the trimmer is on the side is really nice because you&#x27;re able to see what you&#x27;re doing if you need to trim the hairline on the back of your head with two mirrors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can take it in the shower then put it under running water to clean effortlessly.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I have purchased several clippers of this type over the years, but this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>It was great for the price considering the strength of the blade, but I&#x27;ve seen other trimmers fall and continue to work fine (even if it needed assembly).</li>
            <li>Obviously, his favorite for a long time- great product!</li>
            <li>I was right!</li>
            <li>It trims nearly as close as a razor i highly recommend this trimmer for its great value</li>
            <li>This is not professional quality, but it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>Battery seems to last a good while.  </li>
            <li>Many uses and trims hair very well.  </li>
            <li>yet I have only owned it for a month and battery is still good</li>
            <li>This works very well, much better than others I had tried and disgarded.  </li>
            <li>The Rotary Cutter works well for nose hairs and the Eye Brow Comb is PERFECT for maintaining my thick bushy eyebrows.</li>
            <li>good value overall.</li>
            <li>and then I pulled the attachment off and the the whole top part popped apart.</li>
            <li>I love that this is waterproof and it works very well.</li>
            <li>product is good if you have some extra room in your trash bag that needs filling up.</li>
            <li>I found this product on some guide for how to shave my danglybits and ended up buying it since it was so cheap and looked damn useful.  </li>
            <li>Works well but is kind of loud.</li>
            <li>Not bad, used here and there.  </li>
            <li>Unlike the previous two trimmers I have purchased, this is trimmer is very good and worth the money.  </li>
            <li>This is good for a quick personal groomer.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made extension attachment, it broke right after the Amazon warranty was up.</li>
            <li>The other attachment works great for trimming neckline, sideburns, and cleaning up eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>I gave this One Star to make it more likely that people will see this and be able to repair their trimmers if they break.</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and spend $5 more for a better trimmer that will actually last.</li>
            <li>Seems much more powerful that others and really works well.  </li>
            <li>It seems to have an adequate amount of power and trims well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The straight-edged trimmer was excellent for tidying up the area above my moustache and along the sides of my beard on my upper face.</li>
            <li>If you are a hairy guy and will use this for more than an occasional touch up, but a better quality trimmer.</li>
            <li>just as advertised and arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>~ I am very satisfied, overall.</li>
            <li>This is the second one we&#x27;ve purchased - we are very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They say that the included battery should last for 3 or more years, so I am excited about that!</li>
            <li>so I shoved it into the guide attachment from my old one (didn&#x27;t fit quite right, of course, but you do what you can) and that was actually more</li>
            <li>Four months so far on the original battery-they are smart using a lithium battery rather that the cheap ones others ship, assuming that you get a better at all.</li>
            <li>Very light and easy to use, but only one AAA battery leaves it underpowered.  </li>
            <li>Works great and clogs less-often than my previous trimmer (</li>
            <li>Previously purchased this item and it was great.</li>
            <li>fast and easy.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and very compact.  </li>
            <li>It works really well and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Even if this were to stop working on me once a year, I&#x27;d be happy buying it annually because far too many similar products cost more and never work properly.  </li>
            <li>wish I would have used such a thing years ago, but I am so glad I have it now!</li>
            <li>The motor still sounds powerful just like the very first day</li>
            <li>It was much heavier, used one AA battery and provided a quick, comfortable trim.  </li>
            <li>, the caveat is that this is a great trimmer, but it is very cheaply made, and quality control is poor.</li>
            <li>Great little trimmer, works well, comes with the battery, is lightweight.</li>
            <li>A great little trimmer, powered by a AAA battery.</li>
            <li>Great little trimmer.</li>
            <li>If you need de-thatching, this is a great little device.  </li>
            <li>Better price than my old one from a different company and works better!  </li>
            <li>This is a great little tool.  </li>
            <li>Some trimmers include an LED bulb, but I&#x27;ve found that those don&#x27;t really aim where I need the light</li>
            <li>Was looking for a replacement and this fit the bill very well.</li>
            <li>Not too much else to say, it was cheap</li>
            <li>I bought this personal trimmer for myself (lady) to use for light downy facial hair, and it works great for that purpose.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a few of these devices and this is the best one I&#x27;ve had so far.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>the speed of the rotating blades is not so powerful.  </li>
            <li>of caution, the hair trimmer attachment is kind of fragile, it broke apart once when I was removing the guard...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had two others but this is far better.</li>
            <li>Still, well worth the $9.</li>
            <li>I could not give it a 5 as it is not as powerful as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>Works as expected, but it is fairly flimsy.  </li>
            <li>, it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>Not even worth returning.</li>
            <li>Useful addition to the home or for traveling.</li>
            <li>I have an old Remington groomer that started falling apart after using for many years.</li>
            <li>Looked pretty cool still trying to figure out how to use it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame that what could have been such a nice design doesn&#x27;t have any quality or longevity to it.</li>
            <li>Too loud for for me for the inner ear hairs, but works great on the nose, eyebrows, outer ears.</li>
            <li>it is truly worth the money.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve never had it cut or scrape me even in the most sensitive places.</li>
            <li>I have a Wahl beard trimmer, but I bought this for two main purposes: to provide me with a rotary ear/nose hair trim and to neatly &amp; easily trim the &amp;#34;below-the-nose&amp;#34; area of my moustache.</li>
            <li>When I finally put my own battery in it, it worked.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion, it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>Has useful and well made attachments.</li>
            <li>but for my own personal needs...notta.&lt;br /&gt;*****************&lt;br</li>
            <li>He loved it so much that he insisted that I get the same one.</li>
            <li>Doesnt cut quite as well as some, but is FAR more reliable and well made.</li>
            <li>properly trimmed nose is more important than my ego.&lt;br /&gt;10/10</li>
            <li>A superb personal grooming product that simply works and is absolutely pain-free.  </li>
            <li>im not afraid to be embarrassed by a nose hair that is pocking out</li>
            <li>Only problem with these are you have to keep the shaving head very clean!</li>
            <li>Very handy little groomer to have.</li>
            <li>In fact, the first few times I used this I trimmed far more than I&#x27;d intended because this trimmer was so much more effective than ones I&#x27;d owned</li>
            <li>When we first tried to assemble it, we had a great deal of difficulty with the little plastic head.  </li>
            <li>Never worked right out of the package.</li>
            <li>This never worked even right out of the box.</li>
            <li>The trimmer has the right heads for all of my needs.</li>
            <li>Plus, priced right.</li>
            <li>Right for the price.</li>
            <li>You just gotta get the right grab and pull its guts out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are handy, you can make the repair easily and with no special tools.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is nice though we have only used it once, it seems solid and functional for many uses.</li>
            <li>Better quality than most of these little groomers I have bought.</li>
            <li>When I ordered this, I was confident that I would get a good product for the same amount of money that other brands were selling.</li>
            <li>I hope they&#x27;ll send me a new one free</li>
            <li>The first time I turned it on with the attachment, the attachment just fell apart; screws and pieces just fell right out.</li>
            <li>The trim head sits at a good angle so the handle is slightly lifted from your &amp;#34;work area&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>This is a great personal trimmer if you have coarse hair like me</li>
            <li>I will update if it doesn&#x27;t last or something, but so far, so good.</li>
            <li>Works great, especially like the attachments that come with it, especially the eyebrow trimming attachment.</li>
            <li>It is much more powerful than the female verison you buy at Sally beauty supply.</li>
            <li>The nose hair and straight trimmer does adequately function.  </li>
            <li>I use it to mostly trim facial area, very handle and reliable and not a bad pricing too.</li>
            <li>I waited to long to send it back though, so it is a good thing it was cheap.</li>
            <li>Nice, small, and strong</li>
            <li>I like these trimmers very much, and they handle ALL of the extraneous hairs on my bod.  </li>
            <li>thought the price was very reasonable too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Good little tool for touch up trimming...</li>
            <li>This little trimmer is good for lots of grooming tasks.  </li>
            <li>The extra power makes a huge difference!</li>
            <li>Returned first one for replacement as it didn&#x27;t work and will re-rate after getting a replacement.</li>
            <li>they spent all of their time making it look nice</li>
            <li>(so I had a backup in case something happened to the first one).</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Looks to be able to do the job for why I ordered for the grandson that like to keep properly groomed.</li>
            <li>i fiddled with it for 15 minutes switching it on and off trying the batteries many different ways.</li>
            <li>Not necessarily the most comfortable thing to use either, think of gripping a thin pencil, instead of something more ergonomic.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not too sure that this product will stand up with daily use.</li>
            <li>I was able to piece it back together and haven&#x27;t had any problems since.</li>
            <li>Got it great made me feel like a real man after using this product and made my chest hair small.</li>
            <li>Will buy a better brand next time.</li>
            <li>This is also the most well made personal trimmer in it&#x27;s category--very durable.</li>
            <li>Next time, I&#x27;d like to try something with a bit better reputation, like the Philips line of trimmers.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Was able to snap it back together.</li>
            <li>Cleaning out he trimmer worked at first</li>
            <li>and this is this first trimmer I have found that I like and continue to use.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to return them even though they weren&#x27;t open???  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s supposed to be wet/dry, the first thing I did was immerse it in water w/o the battery.  </li>
            <li>It works well at first.</li>
            <li>the key is to remember not to make the &amp;#34;shaving&amp;#34; motion, but more like &amp;#34;placing the trimmer to the hair and let it cut the hair&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not</li>
            <li>Broke the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I bought this hair trimmer 4 days ago and wanted to use it yesterday the first time.</li>
            <li>Had hoped Wahl would be better but still doesn&#x27;t cut close enough.</li>
            <li>It serves it&#x27;s purpose pretty well.</li>
            <li>to say that for the price point, it&#x27;s a relative bargain — more like 3.25 star review.</li>
            <li>Plus it fell apart in the first two minutes out of the box.  </li>
            <li>It works pretty well also and it came with a battery</li>
            <li>It also comes with an attachment for eyebrow trimming, but it you have a regular beard trimmer (hopefully a Wahl), it will do a better job.</li>
            <li>This one is so much better and was shipped the next day.  </li>
            <li>Was able to snap back together.  </li>
            <li>for me, it does exactly what it&#x27;s made to do.  </li>
            <li>Much higher quality than competitor models.  </li>
            <li>If Wahl made a higher end version of this product I would buy that too.</li>
            <li>Real metal!  </li>
            <li>I could only snip off a couple of nose hairs then sneeze 4x; snip a couple more and sneeze again 4x...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first micro groomer that I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t ask for anything more from a personal trimmer.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>But, for eyebrows, nose &amp; ears, this is a quick &amp; effective little trimmer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s loud and burns batteries pretty fast but gives a close trim and cleans up easily.</li>
            <li>Breaks quickly  within only 2 light uses.</li>
            <li>This may be the best inexpensive (around or less than $ low double digits) basic trimmer of its kind on the market.</li>
            <li>I like it has a light to see better, and comes with a stand for your counter and a little cleaning brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely nice and works extremely well.</li>
            <li>This got old very quickly, so I just put a new battery in my old trimmer, and it works just fine.  </li>
            <li>I replaced a $20 rechargeable Conair that lasted me more than ten years, much to my regret --</li>
            <li>This trimmer does everything it said it would, and it works much better than my old Norelco trimmer which stopped working completely after the fifth time I used it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The Straight blade works great for ear hair and a other general trimming.  </li>
            <li>This is the best unit of this type/style I have found so far- 2 of the ones I bought from TV (you know the ones green) didn&#x27;t last 1 week.</li>
            <li>Worked well when I first purchased it but after a while it sounds and feels like it wants to come apart.  </li>
            <li>You may or may not cause your fellow housemates immense joy due to your laughter from the tickling sensation when using this product.</li>
            <li>Loved it until the trimmer attachment stopped working after a month :/</li>
            <li>so I guess the battery claims seems to be true thus far.</li>
            <li>Good little product - would highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li>Only problem is this thing falls apart so easily -</li>
            <li>This one is ok, but after a while it gets gummed up and is not easy to dismantle or clean.  </li>
            <li>It also comes in an easy to open plastic box.  </li>
            <li>very fact that a long life lithium battery is fitted means that battery replacement is not needed for many months.</li>
            <li>For something so small, it sure does sound like a chainsaw.</li>
            <li>i had another model that would wear out the batteries very quickly and it had only i shaving head .</li>
            <li>this wahl trimmer has 3 different heads that are easy to change and do the job it is  intended to do ..</li>
            <li>Very simple and easy.</li>
            <li>Feels nice and sturdy compared to previous ones I bought from stores for $15+.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The straight-line trimmer has a tendency to come apart (its 2 halves just split), but it&#x27;s easily put back together</li>
            <li>Had a microtouch for the longest time and it never would cut certain hairs.  </li>
            <li>or I wouldn&#x27;t have bought this one, but certainly longer than once.</li>
            <li>Had to put a new battery in right off.  </li>
            <li>It is so underpowered and has such inadequate bearings that, even with a fresh battery, it slows down while running free (not cutting anything, just trying to run freely).</li>
            <li>Nice little trimmer.</li>
            <li>Nice little gadget, works really well</li>
            <li>I only use it about once a week for fine hairs (or as some like to call it, light female mustache)</li>
            <li>but I can see myself losing them very soon.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To make the repair, I gently opened the plastic motor compartment and removed the motor, exposing the movable 1 cm shim connected to the switch.</li>
            <li>locally, only the Conaire versions are available, and they suck.</li>
            <li>Works very well, shipping was as described.</li>
            <li>Very underpowered and flimsily designed and constructed.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my hubby, he really loves it.</li>
            <li>Comes with both straight trimmer and rotary trimmer heads.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Very please with the power and precision of this trimmer.</li>
            <li>It works, feels a bit cheap, especially the trimmer heads.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the seen on TV versions and those were very flimsy.  </li>
            <li>Also, I really don&#x27;t know what the additional guards are for, they don&#x27;t seem to be helpful.</li>
            <li>THIS ITEM IS STRAIGHT UP</li>
            <li>It burns batteries extremely fast.</li>
            <li>I really like this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I dropped the clipper on the rug that I was standing on at my bathroom sink and when it hit the rug, the whole thing exploded into a bunch of pieces.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t cut hair as much as it pulled it.</li>
            <li>Cut very well for the price.</li>
            <li>A total piece of cheap junk.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle on skin but cuts hair without any problems.</li>
            <li>Absolutely avoid the Microtouch trimmer that is advertised on TV.</li>
            <li>got here in time promised and works very well.</li>
            <li>the plastic around the blade catches on skin and you cannot smoothly trim facial hair with this at all.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>I really like the way the head lock on.  </li>
            <li>It works well is very compact and versitile</li>
            <li>This is unusual for a lithium battery in my experience.  </li>
            <li>The nose and ear groomer as well as the eye brow attachments all work very well.</li>
            <li>use is very short, otherwise its high-pitch sound would send it into the garbage bin.</li>
            <li>i gently pinched them in a bit.</li>
            <li>It also pulled out some nose hairs, which was VERY</li>
            <li>Expected more power for some reason.....</li>
            <li>Thanks yo lo recomiendo</li>
            <li>Use a real battery, not a rechargeable.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t find it much of an issue.</li>
            <li>Works really well, I was amazed how fast it cut, no pulling or stalling.</li>
            <li>Works alright, on switch doesn&#x27;t work all of the time, and its much louder than I wanted it to be.</li>
            <li>The attachments work really well.  </li>
            <li>I am amazed in its performance and slim size that makes it very portable.</li>
            <li>(close and very close), and also trims the hair around my ears.</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>Works very well for all the spots its designed for.</li>
            <li>Very efficient.</li>
            <li>The tallest setting is still very short.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>price on this is fantastic, and now I don&#x27;t need to keep two two different trimmer around to have the features I need.  </li>
            <li>For the price I didn&#x27;t expect much with this item but neither did I expect it to bite the dust after just using it once.  </li>
            <li>Consequently,I threw the whole thing away since I could not use it.</li>
            <li>(who wants to talk about trimming nose hairs?).</li>
            <li>Works VERY well for me.</li>
            <li>The one thing I found absurde was the &amp;#34;thinning&amp;#34; attachment for the Straight blade.  </li>
            <li>For the cost I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but was pleasently suprised at how well it works.</li>
            <li>I was tired of using cheap $5 trimmers and I wanted something made with higher quality parts, so I made the mistake of assuming because the Wahl cost much more, it must be of higher quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I put it back, but it was not a snug fit and routinely fell off after that.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have only used it once so far, and it worked better than any product I have owned.  </li>
            <li>Initial assembly, especially putting in the batteries, is kind of tricky.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very powerful and it includes an alkaline AAA battery which is supposed to last up to a year.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight, small, and compact which makes it easy to travel.  </li>
            <li>It went thru batteries pretty quickly tho, and then stopped working after about a year or two of occasional use.  </li>
            <li>long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE, Wahl, PLEASE design and build a high-end model of decent durable quality and materials, with a decent very quiet more powerful motor, and proper bearings.</li>
            <li>I like this model because its the most compact and has the slider switch unlike other trimmers that are thicker and have a twist switch.</li>
            <li>Sharp but completely safe blades, and no discomfort.</li>
            <li>This is a great little tool, it trims hair, doesn&#x27;t cut long hair.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any issues assembling the product like many other reviewers have mentioned.  </li>
            <li>The previous model was far more quiet, more like a hum or a bee buzzing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was great while it worked, especially the small size which I appreciate for travelling.  </li>
            <li>Cover keep sliding off , in general I would have bought been better off buying  something different</li>
            <li>The first one i returned because as soon as it touched a hair, it wasn&#x27;t powerful enough to cut it.</li>
            <li>The switch seems solid and when it&#x27;s switched on it comes in full power and the blades moves fast.</li>
            <li>I liked it while it worked, just didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>The new one actually spun, and it trimmed a couple hairs, but easily clogged and shut down, forcing me to turn it on and off many times.</li>
            <li>These work pretty good, although they probably won&#x27;t last long through regular use... almost disposable.</li>
            <li>It works well enough, but nothing special here.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t expect it to last very long; However, it does what needs to be done effectively.</li>
            <li>The other trimmer we had that only lasted a year or so, was so light weight, it was easy to drop.</li>
            <li>Very nice looking and small - not much larger than a pen.</li>
            <li>It does what it needs to do, but because of the small motor it kind of struggles when putting on the nose or eyebrow attachment.</li>
            <li>Small, convenient and effective.  </li>
            <li>Build quality is average, lower outer sleeve slips off the device when removing the top sleeve if you are not holding pressure on the thumb switch.  </li>
            <li>Nothing spectacular, but small enough for travel, not bad for the price</li>
            <li>found the brow trimmer to be a little to high to make much of a noticeable difference, but it did help them to be more groomed looking.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d keep this trimmer if the attachment didn&#x27;t split in half and the battery compartment was more waterproof.</li>
            <li>Much better than the previous unit I had.  </li>
            <li>This was actually a decent trimmer in terms of power.</li>
            <li>Particularly the nose hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Better than the last personal trimmer I owned.</li>
            <li>It comes apart in my hand during use &amp; it doesn&#x27;t seem to get the job done like my older one.</li>
            <li>This little groomsman keeps me very comfortable between trips to the hair place.</li>
            <li>Also, even though it is not very loud, it is really too loud to be comfortable for trimming ear</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great and maneuverable, just a few problems: first, the tip comes off if you&#x27;re not careful -- it just rotates a few degrees and pops right off which can be a problem.  </li>
            <li>It worked GREAT for just long enough so that Amazon&#x27;s return window closed.</li>
            <li>One hint is when you are trimming your ears, use the rotary blade (the nose trimmer) because the reciprocating blade is VERY LOUD!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small and handy, and if it actually worked reliably it would be worth it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The product is of high quality and is as advertised at the site.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for an inexpensive trimmer, I would highly recommend this one.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li>saw the Wahl name and knew it would be high quality, and I was correct.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item.....</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li>I posted a highly unfavorable review on this product two weeks ago.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this hair clipper.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it is precisely identical to any number of other, much cheaper trimmers I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s solid, has nice sharp blade and lots of power.  </li>
            <li>I gave it five stars because it was very inexpensive (roughly $12) and for that price it works great compared to other similarly priced products.</li>
            <li>That piece of junk is both weak and poorly made, broke very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You could pay into the double digits and get more bells and whistles, but if you don&#x27;t need an elaborate high tech device, the Wahl 5640-1001 offers good value and reliability.</li>
            <li>This one is a little loud, but does the job quickly and cleanly.</li>
            <li>So I decided that a better made unit might be worth the few extra buck...</li>
            <li>This works really well so far, and has not fallen apart.</li>
            <li>really please with it so far.</li>
            <li>I would pay 5 times as much for a higher quality version of the same product if I could find one.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the motor is powerful enough.</li>
            <li>DO NOT USE FOR MORE THAN A FEW BEARD OR MUSTACHE HAIRS.</li>
            <li>My first one worked very well during the short time that I had it.  </li>
            <li>I have had more than a few.  </li>
            <li>When you are hairy like sasquewatch this makes you feel somewhat normal.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It runs hot, it barely cuts or trims, and it FALLS</li>
            <li>Worked ok a few times then wouldn&#x27;t turn on.</li>
            <li>I will purchase more of these in the future as long as they continue to make them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful enough to get the job done</li>
            <li>Really good power for such a small size.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many of these mini-trimmers and most of them are cheaply made crap.  </li>
            <li>I have used other ones that worked fine.  </li>
            <li>The other attachment runs fine.  </li>
            <li>Wahl is better than my previous groomer!</li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s so small, this is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve found to cut hair almost razor close ANYWHERE as long as you hold the skin fairly taut and hold the trimmer so that the tiny cutting blade that you can see moving if you look really close is on the side NOT brushing along the skin.</li>
            <li>Not nearly as well as my Panasonic ER-GN30-K, but adequate for use on a trip.</li>
            <li>I ordered this trying to find a decent small trimmer (most of them are junk)  </li>
            <li>it stays sharp and helps me comfortably maintain the areas this trimmer was intended for.  </li>
            <li>I tried new batteries and they did not solve the problem.  </li>
            <li>The motor spins like new without the heads attached and seems to have plenty of torque, but whenever I attach a head it stops spinning.  </li>
            <li>so I put brand new battries in and .....</li>
            <li>and bin it and buy a new one.</li>
            <li>So I went out to buy a new battery and tried it again.</li>
            <li>this should be more straight forward action like all other similar units (Twist to</li>
            <li>works great for a few a few times, then I go to use it</li>
            <li>was somewhat surprised since I thought Wahl had a decent reputation for this type of device.</li>
            <li>guide teeth are so long, it didn&#x27;t trim anything even though a lot of the hairs on my eyebrows were getting pretty overgrown!</li>
            <li>but none seemed to be as loud as this one but other than that is does a fine job trimming.</li>
            <li>Broke after 3 months, most of these don&#x27;t last long, but really 3 months, you would think it could last longer than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wont</li>
            <li>hell to get old and hairy!  </li>
            <li>This thing is loud!  </li>
            <li>I assume this thing works pretty well for facial hair detailing etc...</li>
            <li>First I couldn&#x27;t open the head to install the battery....</li>
            <li>Had in the past were always ok.</li>
            <li>First of all it&#x27;s a Wahl that in its self is enough.</li>
            <li>I ordered two to have an extra when/if the first one wears out.</li>
            <li>Once you get past the little-bit tricky assembly, you&#x27;ll love the functionality of this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also missing a light, my other one had a light</li>
            <li>Blades seem very sharp and it cuts smoothly.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is okay for small jobs, not heavy duty trimming.</li>
            <li>For super fine hairs, it&#x27;s not great but for everything else it is satisfactory.</li>
            <li>Next time I&#x27;ll spend the extra money for the full size.</li>
            <li>While it is nicely styled, the motor is so weak that it will not deal with anything but the lightest load when trimming</li>
            <li>Other times it would turn on at full power but as soon as it hit eyebrow hair, it would jam...and rip the hair out rather than cut</li>
            <li>It seems a little cheap</li>
            <li>I like how precise this little trimmer is.</li>
            <li>Even guys like clean looking noses and using this and a small scissors for targeting hairs really cleans you up.</li>
            <li>Handy little device for trimming hair in those hard to get to places.&lt;br /&gt;Sturdy, powerful and works just as described.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wax since my skin is quite sensitive and it&#x27;s just a few little hairs so this little trimmer is awesome!</li>
            <li>The price is low and the quality seems very high.</li>
            <li>Also, remember to clear out the inside of any hair</li>
            <li>im getting old and my nose is growing a ponytail.</li>
            <li>The motor compartment at the head of the unit snaps open with gentle nudging.</li>
            <li>Stopped working after a few weeks of light use.</li>
            <li>Even so, I doubt that it will last very</li>
            <li>I would much rather pay twice the price for a proper quality device.</li>
            <li>So far it works.</li>
            <li>For the low cost I did not expect much, but got nothing.</li>
            <li>I was  surprised.  </li>
            <li>I have used the trimmer attachment on my eyebrows and nether regions and so far it has lived up to my expectations.  </li>
            <li>So I can only complain so much.</li>
            <li>I have coarse hair and this groomsman had issues trimming my very manly beard.</li>
            <li>a bit loud for what it does.  </li>
            <li>replaced a old one that lasted 5 years</li>
            <li>recommend this product to anyone who wants a personal trimmer.</li>
            <li>old.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your time money.</li>
            <li>A bit loud.</li>
            <li>A regular beard trimmer works much</li>
            <li>REALLY loud.  </li>
            <li>It is, however, much sturdier than my last Conair trimmer.</li>
            <li>I preferred the old style that you had to take off and rotate for short/long.</li>
            <li>As far as power?</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so loud</li>
            <li>Quit working completely after two months.</li>
            <li>It came early and it was just like advertised.</li>
            <li>Circular blade (for your nose I suppose); Straight blade (regular trimming needs).  </li>
            <li>This trimmer actually works very well.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to replace my old trimmer.</li>
            <li>felt like an old man buying this product, but I don&#x27;t regret it.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>Or maybe I&#x27;m just really sensitive.</li>
            <li>For a few dollars more than the TV version you get a nicer wrapper but about the same functionality.</li>
            <li>This makes my wife happy for the least amount of trouble and expense, and I&#x27;ve tried all the body groomers, etc., with no luck at trimming those spots without irritation until now.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s had several of the rechargeable brands and this one is his favorite as the others die out after just a few uses.</li>
            <li>Only had a short time, but for the money its well worth it.</li>
            <li>But by then the thin cover that covers the battery that needs to be slid off to replace to the battery is effectively glued to the core of the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, you&#x27;ll probably find something going wrong with it after a good drop.</li>
            <li>Worked good for a couple of months but then started making a weird noise and yanking out the hair.  </li>
            <li>A little harsh, but better than many other trimmers that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>This little Wahl works better than other groomers that I&#x27;ve paid three times as much for.</li>
            <li>Then the power switch quit working properly and the only way to get it to function is to hold it at JUST the right place halfway between on and off.</li>
            <li>I have arthritic hands and although it&#x27;s a small trimmer, it&#x27;s easy to pull and assemble the parts.  </li>
            <li>Small size is easy to store in a drawer.  </li>
            <li>for the price, good for small jobs, pulls a little in the nose hairs but got used to it.  </li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t take any kind of rechargeable, not even eneloop pro, and it eats a high powered expensive battery every couple of months.  </li>
            <li>compact, powerful, battery last a long time</li>
            <li>The second one did exactly the same thing.</li>
            <li>Going back to using my older Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>This is my second, first lasted several years.</li>
            <li>This is one is decent enough.</li>
            <li>I have a beard and between my full sized WAHL timmer and this little beauty.....</li>
            <li>would highly recommend purchasing this trimmer - especially for the price and quality.</li>
            <li>All the brands are the same, as long as you buy this with the right expectations</li>
            <li>Small, light, and versatile.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small and cheap but is underpowered.</li>
            <li>I normally use a larger trimmer to keep my mustache trimmed and a dedicated nasal hair trimmer (Panasonic ER-GN30-K) at home, but didn&#x27;t want to bring them on my trip because of weight and size issues.</li>
            <li>I have absolutely no complaints about this trimmer - it works exactly as I had hoped with no problems at all.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Other similar trimmers have broken and malfunctioned very quickly and consistently.</li>
            <li>These things are made very poorly, they last a few months a best.  </li>
            <li>I used to always get these but had to get a new one pretty regularly as it got dull and gummed up pretty</li>
            <li>you feel like you need to change out a new battery to get the thing back up to &amp;</li>
            <li>The last one I bought would start dying after the 1st use with a new battery.</li>
            <li>If you clumsy and drop things easily, this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li>I used a small penknife to bend the shim into a more curved position to ensure it would make contact with the long metal plate that connects to the battery anode.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t yank or pull hair, even in the most delicate private parts.  </li>
            <li>Also, it did seem to cut through my thick hair fairly easily.</li>
            <li>Sure, it is small and looks like a marking pen, but it doesn&#x27;t cut close enough to the skin to actually do anything.</li>
            <li>Not extremely lightweight as some of them are.</li>
            <li>This one doesn&#x27;t look as rinky-dink as my previous others but instead looks pretty darn professional.  </li>
            <li>Right out of the box the trimmer attachment was split in half.</li>
            <li>she&#x27;s a powerful little devil.  </li>
            <li>Powerful little motor.</li>
            <li>This thing works well for trimming small fine hairs like described above and even does alright as a light-duty beard/mustache trimmer, although I&#x27;d suggest edging duties only.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its a pretty powerful little trimmer but its a little on the loud side.</li>
            <li>The motor runs very fast and doesn&#x27;t bog down like the others.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small and light enough so that even the smallest hands can operate it without any problem.  </li>
            <li>Over the years I have bought several nose and ear hair trimmers, they were all  under powered and needed frequent cleaning.</li>
            <li>I cut several heads of hair and had used up the old one I had.</li>
            <li>I have only used this trimmer once so far, but it performed well.</li>
            <li>bare minimum of instructions, though.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only downside is that it is too loud.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m going to check if the blade will work as a replacement for my old one (different brand).</li>
            <li>Its like the blades aren&#x27;t far enough apart or something.</li>
            <li>Second, it&#x27;s loud.  </li>
            <li>My only minus is that it&#x27;s pretty noisy when the body of the trimmer is close to your ears.</li>
            <li>The trimmer still bogs down when you first turn it on.  </li>
            <li>It will not cut through more than a single thick hair (like a mustache hair) at one time.</li>
            <li>After using it a few times, it wouldn&#x27;t always start right away.</li>
            <li>it are pretty odd.  </li>
            <li>The first worked and lasted slightly longer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine for stray hair for inner ears, but it doesn&#x27;t work on eyebrow hair hardly ever.</li>
            <li>Works better than any other item I have tried in the past.  </li>
            <li>The blades cut well, and the blade cleaning is a comprabale process to other trimming devices - pretty simple.</li>
            <li>The battery on this lasts much longer than other models I have used.</li>
            <li>bought the item, because I&#x27;ve had other Wahl products, and they work very well.</li>
            <li>Fit in tiny crevices to get the hard to reach places.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had the product for a short time, but so far it works just as advertised.</li>
            <li>Ever see the info commercial of similar product for over $20 this beats that way by far.</li>
            <li>This is a safe trimmer that can be used for your eyebrows, nose, ear, or wherever you have thin, short hair that need trimmed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really pretty noisy for a little trimmer.</li>
            <li>This little guy really does the job!</li>
            <li>Sometimes it has a little trouble with the power required to spin the blades on the vertical trimmer, but with a little finagling it does a good job.</li>
            <li>The eyebrow head,the only head that fit,broke in half the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>but I will say that the blades stay super sharp for a long long time on these.  </li>
            <li>It is so quiet, that it you can use it to cut ear hair, but barely.</li>
            <li>Barely worked in the beginning, and it doed six months later.</li>
            <li>It &#x27;s so under-powered that it can barely handle facial hair without jamming.  </li>
            <li>First micro trimmer I have purchased ( and I have bought them all ) that is not a cheap plastic trimmer with a 1 month life expectancy.</li>
            <li>It is small and powerful.  </li>
            <li>First one arrived dead on delivery.  </li>
            <li>This is the first round nose trimmer head I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>But the whole bottom half piece comes off.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by how long the batteries last.</li>
            <li>They work well but are easily damaged or broken.  </li>
            <li>Unit seems pretty heavy duty actually.</li>
            <li>It seems to run smoother than others and doesn&#x27;t bog down in hair as much as others (obviously I&#x27;m trying to control for battery power, but I&#x27;m not using scientific methods here, heh heh).</li>
            <li>This is junk broke after a month not strong loose battery drains quick</li>
            <li>because it is to much hassle to mess with</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first because I expected some cheap POS.</li>
            <li>but when you are poor like me this cuts it just fine.  </li>
            <li>The only hard part was popping all the attachments out of their tight fitting plastic crevices.  </li>
            <li>Got this to deal with the fact that as I get older my eyebrows and nose hair have decided to try to make their way down to party with my beard.</li>

            <li> The product do a really good job removing hair and does not pinch the skin which is great, but do not drop it.  </li>
            <li> Good quality, and they work great for my nose hairs.  </li>
            <li> Love this best trimmer made</li>
            <li> Its multi-use features are perfect and there is never any snagging of hair.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s strong an durable.</li>
            <li> He says it is very handy and precise!!</li>
            <li> Good value.</li>

            <li> Good tool for someone on the go.  </li>
            <li> works good</li>
            <li> Works good.</li>
            <li> it is good for the money.</li>

            <li> Good product and does what it should,</li>
            <li> Good instrument.</li>
            <li> Not as good as one I had before.  </li>
            <li> so I replaced the Lithium battery which did not seem to do much good.  </li>
            <li> but it works good on the hairs that grow along my cheek bones too.  </li>
            <li> Suprisinglly good battery life.  </li>
            <li> Does what a good portable trimmer should.</li>
            <li> Good product</li>
            <li> I tried another brand - wish I remembered the name so that I could trash it - and that broke after being used just two times, so it is obviously superior to something like that.  </li>
            <li> I got it and have loved using it.</li>
            <li> Good compact trimmer, Wish the attachments were somehow incorporated or self contained into the unit.</li>
            <li> It is a good value in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> engineering wise</li>
            <li> This seems like a good trimmer it cuts with no problems.</li>
            <li> But works good</li>
            <li> had one of these years ago and loved it.  </li>
            <li> Good battery life.</li>
            <li> Good trimmer for around $10 or so</li>

            <li> Battery power is nice too.</li>
            <li> HAS NICE ATTACHMENTS</li>
            <li> This model works perfectly, the nose trimmer lets you cut very close and has plenty of power.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any of the attachments, but  being waterproof is a nice feature.  </li>
            <li> It has nice &#x27;balance&#x27; as it were, so you feel you have a grip on it</li>
            <li> has a nice feel</li>
            <li> It washes nicely.</li>
            <li> This is the best personal trimmer I have found, it cuts great.</li>
            <li> Nice product.  </li>
            <li> Nice, you get what you see...</li>
            <li> It would have been nice if you could recharge it like the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Compact design and effective to use.</li>
            <li> It cuts the hairs so nicely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice tool, but a woman should not try this on her nose...</li>
            <li> Would be nice if container were included.</li>
            <li> Its compact and the fit and finish for this cheap trimmer are the best Ive seen for any of these micro trimmers including Panasonic</li>
            <li> Excellent price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> AMAZON HAS THE &amp;#34;TV&amp;#34; KIND ALSO.  </li>
            <li> Comes with it&#x27;s own battery too.  </li>
            <li> Very useful, durable, great product</li>
            <li> Despite cheap components, this is still a very handy thing to have.</li>

            <li> very easy to switch attachments.</li>
            <li> Works like a dream, though the attachment just a a bit too large to allow me to use this as a very good ear trimmer.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what I got them for, so they are definitely suitable.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I&#x27;ve used so far and can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> So far the best one I have purchased</li>
            <li> far this is the best nose trimmer I have had to date.</li>
            <li> By far the best one of these I&#x27;ve had in terms of strength.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there is anything perfect for maintaining these sensitive areas of the body...</li>
            <li> Nice and cheap!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of trimmers like this, and so far this is the best.</li>
            <li> The trimmer worked great right out of the box.</li>
            <li> two included bayonet mount trimming tools are nice and would be suitable for all grooming jobs if this trimmer were more appropriately</li>
            <li> Awesome little trimmer, I am happy with how durable this is.</li>
            <li> I been using this trimmer for about 3 weeks now, i have tried many others and this one is far the best for the price.</li>
            <li> does a nice clean job!</li>
            <li> Works great and does exactly what its made for.</li>
            <li> It worked great at first, and still works, but it stalls when I turn it on.</li>
            <li> Works good, not painful, like some.</li>
            <li> Works fine!</li>
            <li> VERY cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> Very cheaply made, and doesn&#x27;t cut hair, as advertised.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> Works extremely good, super light,and it has a cap</li>
            <li> When you insert the attachment for the trimmer PROPERLY it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> LOVE them.</li>
            <li> kinda flimsy but does the job the top keeps falling off but for the price it works</li>
            <li> You have to turn it off and take the top off and reset it and than do it over and over again to get it to work.</li>
            <li> MORE THAN COINCIDENCE, NSA?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This trimmer is way better than I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Performs better than any others used.</li>
            <li> I find that this shaver is great for intimate areas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used better trimmers for the nasal hairs.</li>
            <li> This is a compact battery powered trimmer that will be ok</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several micro trimmers over the years, but this one is the best I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> There has to be something better then this.  </li>
            <li> It is fast and efficient and came in at a great price.  </li>
            <li> Hope it works better.  </li>
            <li> Avoid this one and get a sturdier model even if you have to pay more.</li>
            <li> it probably work ok for that, between eyebrows, outer ear and lobes and for stray beard</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Perfect for facial hair</li>
            <li> but I mostly got this for eyebrow trimming.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Is much more efficient than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s safe and has never cut me.</li>
            <li> This one is holding up well- alot more power than the others</li>
            <li> Works ok as a trimmer but the nose hair trimmer attachment doesn&#x27;t work on the unit anymore</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I returned it and got 2 more...</li>
            <li> Otherwise, there are much better products to choose from.</li>
            <li> I have tried to fix, but was better off throwing away.</li>
            <li> My son says he looks and feels better with nose hair groomed.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this item.</li>
            <li> Works O.K., could use a better &#x27;rake&#x27; for doing eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works O.K., could use a better &#x27;rake for doing eyebrows.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still , glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Best out of the last 4 trimmers I have gotten.  </li>
            <li> I love the options of trimmer head.</li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> I used a screw driver to pop out most of the items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
            <li> Not what I was expecting, it more pulls hair than cuts.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it seem ok for $10.</li>
            <li> I have tried many brandsof trimmers</li>
            <li> but it seems ok quality</li>
            <li> sure if it makes sense...</li>
            <li> It was much more finicky when used by a 90 yr.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite ear/nose/eyebrow trimmer that I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li> Provides many helpful trimming functions.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay trimmer that could be made better.</li>
            <li> This product trims better than any I&#x27;ve found for nose, ear, eyebrow, etc.</li>
            <li> the phillips works much better.</li>
            <li> Pleased with it?</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a month now on my sideburns and to just trim off the top of my chest hair so it wouldn&#x27;t stick out of my shirt</li>
            <li> It needed many passes to trim my not-thick brows, so I feel that if you have hair thicker than I do, you would find it not too satisfying.</li>
            <li> Have used a &amp;#34;as seen on TV&amp;#34; version of this product before but wanted something a bit more robust in construction.  </li>
            <li> If you mostly shave and hygienate at night like I do</li>
            <li> Love</li>
            <li> I ordered this I would be pleased</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It does seem to be more powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the attachments.</li>
            <li> overall size is awesome as well.</li>
            <li> best thing about this Wahl Groomsman is it gives me both the blade and rotary head in the same compact trimmer.  </li>
            <li> safe to use everywhere</li>
            <li> AND HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY SATISFIED.  </li>
            <li> THOUGHT WAHL WOULD BE EVEN BETTER.  </li>
            <li> Just be sure you charge the battery appropriately</li>
            <li> and It was safe.</li>
            <li> A keeper for sure.</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding trimmer.</li>
            <li> To me this is a thousand times better than the Micro Touch Trimmer.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll be okay.  </li>
            <li> Works ok but it pulls hair once in a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it till I find something better.</li>
            <li> Seems ok.</li>
            <li> High quality and great service.  </li>
            <li> Started out pretty good...</li>
            <li> For the price-point one shouldn&#x27;t expect high-end performance, but it works perfectly for minor grooming needs.</li>
            <li> Cheaply priced, cheaply made, yet still effective.</li>
            <li> Excellent power, excellent cutting.</li>
            <li> Works so great, I was very surprised.</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars but the first one showed up DOA, quick replacement and happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is much more sturdy than the cheap as-seen-on-TV trimmer.</li>
            <li> Works great to shave your hands and feet if you suffer from being a werewolf or if you masturbate frequently and have to deal with hairy palms..</li>
            <li> I was able to jerk and rock the cheap plastic head that doesn&#x27;t turn...</li>
            <li> To me, this makes this a perfect candidate for a NiMH rechargeable battery that will provide full power and then just stop: no hair pulls, more energy efficient and cheaper to use in the long run.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the 9-bucks I spent on this item, I am very happy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very slim and does a good job.</li>
            <li> The nose hair trimmer could be a little better, but it&#x27;s an excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> battery is easy to replace - and the trimmer is more powerful than most I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> where I&#x27;ve never had it.&lt;br /&gt;Now easily managed.</li>
            <li> Easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li> IT WILL GET STUCK AND NOT LOOSEN EASILY</li>
            <li> Easy to stick in your travel bag, works with a battery.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if they have changed it or not, but it was easy to clip on the two attachments.  </li>
            <li> I can trip my beard and ears and noise easily.</li>
            <li> It easily fits in travel bags.</li>
            <li> Compact, easy to change trim heads, and to operate.  </li>
            <li> The motor seems strong and the trimmer has a quality feel to it.</li>
            <li> These personal trimmers have become very popular - and some work better than others.  </li>
            <li> perfect, for areas you don&#x27;t want hair but are not worth pulling or lasering, the shave is close and painless</li>
            <li> Cheap, easy to use, safe and quick to use.  </li>
            <li> But the nose trimmer still works fine.</li>
            <li> At this point, I would recommend this for anyone looking for a nose hair or fine tuning type of trimmer.</li>
            <li> Works fine.</li>
            <li> Instrument works fine.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet-its a backup-should be fine by its looks</li>
            <li> When I got that home, everything was fine except that the product didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> anywhere you have fine hair to be trimed.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and easy to use.</li>
            <li> High powered and sturdy, I am very pleased with the purchase.  </li>
            <li> This won&#x27;t likely be your primary trimmer, but it&#x27;s great for travel --</li>
            <li> Might have to get a cheap eyeglass case to hold them.</li>
            <li> Extra heads are great to have.</li>
            <li> The product is great for trimming neckline, facial, underarm hair and bikini area.  </li>
            <li> Cheaply made.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t knick and that is really important.</li>
            <li> Although it does the job, it feels cheap and flimsy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is no LED light here.</li>
            <li> cheap, broke within 3 months</li>
            <li> Cheaply made and falls apart.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and nice packaging.</li>
            <li> Works great with several attachments.  </li>
            <li> Cheap piece of junk.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But this thing was dirt cheap.</li>
            <li> I bought this Wahl trimmer primarily to trim my mustache, something that needs doing every week or two to stay looking neat.</li>
            <li> I would recommend the Wahl to those who may need a slim, light weight trimmer that hopefully will stand the test of time.</li>
            <li> Easy clean with water.</li>
            <li> I have tried many trimmers, but this one clearly wins out.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer works great for mustache, sideburns, neck, and back hair trimming.</li>
            <li> It comes with a lithium battery (not rechargeable) and feels so much more powerful then all the others.</li>
            <li> Expect it to work on light trimming, and it will do what you want it to.</li>
            <li> This product is comfortable, but locks up on nose and eye brow hair.</li>
            <li> So if I lightly tapped it against the counter, sometimes it would kick on.</li>
            <li> That might sound like a pain... and why still give it 5 stars?  </li>
            <li> Cheaply made product.</li>
            <li> In fact, the packaging is more worth than the content.</li>
            <li> that why its so cheap.</li>
            <li> battery life is great, but i only use this as needed  </li>
            <li> This is not like the cheap ones at walmart.</li>
            <li> It kind of snagged but didn&#x27;t trim much.</li>
            <li> ; product with the LED light beat them all, even Remington.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t cut hair comfortably but pulls the hair, pain to use.</li>
            <li> This item is so cheaply made.</li>
            <li> It works, but seems cheap.  </li>
            <li> Cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> Everything just seems like the fit is off.</li>
            <li> Attachments fit well.</li>
            <li> enough said, It cuts great</li>
            <li> Fantastic trimmer</li>
            <li> Sometimes it would turn on and sound like it was running at 1/2 power.</li>
            <li> AND the bedroom door so that my son wouldn&#x27;t wake up by its horrendous sound.</li>
            <li> The battery isn&#x27;t rechargeable, but will probably outlast the cheap plastic trimmer parts anyway.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean up.</li>
            <li> It is powerful and feels substantial and is much better than those advertised on TV and elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> This one is far superior in speed, power, and in time we&#x27;ll see if longevity also prevails.</li>
            <li> but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Great item, Better than expected</li>
            <li> The nose hair trimmer could do a better job, but good enough.  </li>
            <li> and so far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> worked pretty good the first time.&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
            <li> Very powerful, too.  </li>
            <li> It is simple to use and very effective for ear and nose trimming.</li>
            <li> Very powerful and doesn&#x27;t catch on the thicker hairs.</li>
            <li> this trimmer cuts my beard trimming time in half , very smooth and whal is a great company and make quality products ..</li>
            <li> It cut smoothly and quickly (again - I have relatively fine hair).</li>
            <li> The review said it was powerful !</li>
            <li> I had one of these, and was pretty satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li> This Wahl micro trimmer is the best of all these small type trimmers on the market.</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s not expensive, but it&#x27;s also cheap!  </li>
            <li> Not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li> Compared to others that I have seen it is significantly louder, about 86 decibels.</li>
            <li> The original battery has lasted for quite some time as well.</li>
            <li> Very much worth the cost!</li>
            <li> As long as it lasts for a year or two, I&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve tried in the past 10 years.</li>
            <li> Nice clean edges, good speed and the price was $3 less than when I happened to see it in the store after I got this one.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good in not being to rough on skin, but not too impressive on performance vs. other power groomers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have owned several of these micro trimmers and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> It stays clean.</li>
            <li> The fact that the trimmer is on the side is really nice because you&#x27;re able to see what you&#x27;re doing if you need to trim the hairline on the back of your head with two mirrors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can take it in the shower then put it under running water to clean effortlessly.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I have purchased several clippers of this type over the years, but this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> It was great for the price considering the strength of the blade, but I&#x27;ve seen other trimmers fall and continue to work fine (even if it needed assembly).</li>
            <li> Obviously, his favorite for a long time- great product!</li>
            <li> I was right!</li>
            <li> It trims nearly as close as a razor i highly recommend this trimmer for its great value</li>
            <li> This is not professional quality, but it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> Battery seems to last a good while.  </li>
            <li> Many uses and trims hair very well.  </li>
            <li> yet I have only owned it for a month and battery is still good</li>
            <li> This works very well, much better than others I had tried and disgarded.  </li>
            <li> The Rotary Cutter works well for nose hairs and the Eye Brow Comb is PERFECT for maintaining my thick bushy eyebrows.</li>
            <li> good value overall.</li>
            <li> and then I pulled the attachment off and the the whole top part popped apart.</li>
            <li> I love that this is waterproof and it works very well.</li>
            <li> product is good if you have some extra room in your trash bag that needs filling up.</li>
            <li> I found this product on some guide for how to shave my danglybits and ended up buying it since it was so cheap and looked damn useful.  </li>
            <li> Works well but is kind of loud.</li>
            <li> Not bad, used here and there.  </li>
            <li> Unlike the previous two trimmers I have purchased, this is trimmer is very good and worth the money.  </li>
            <li> This is good for a quick personal groomer.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made extension attachment, it broke right after the Amazon warranty was up.</li>
            <li> The other attachment works great for trimming neckline, sideburns, and cleaning up eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> I gave this One Star to make it more likely that people will see this and be able to repair their trimmers if they break.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and spend $5 more for a better trimmer that will actually last.</li>
            <li> Seems much more powerful that others and really works well.  </li>
            <li> It seems to have an adequate amount of power and trims well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The straight-edged trimmer was excellent for tidying up the area above my moustache and along the sides of my beard on my upper face.</li>
            <li> If you are a hairy guy and will use this for more than an occasional touch up, but a better quality trimmer.</li>
            <li> just as advertised and arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> ~ I am very satisfied, overall.</li>
            <li> This is the second one we&#x27;ve purchased - we are very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They say that the included battery should last for 3 or more years, so I am excited about that!</li>
            <li> so I shoved it into the guide attachment from my old one (didn&#x27;t fit quite right, of course, but you do what you can) and that was actually more</li>
            <li> Four months so far on the original battery-they are smart using a lithium battery rather that the cheap ones others ship, assuming that you get a better at all.</li>
            <li> Very light and easy to use, but only one AAA battery leaves it underpowered.  </li>
            <li> Works great and clogs less-often than my previous trimmer (</li>
            <li> Previously purchased this item and it was great.</li>
            <li> fast and easy.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and very compact.  </li>
            <li> It works really well and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Even if this were to stop working on me once a year, I&#x27;d be happy buying it annually because far too many similar products cost more and never work properly.  </li>
            <li> wish I would have used such a thing years ago, but I am so glad I have it now!</li>
            <li> The motor still sounds powerful just like the very first day</li>
            <li> It was much heavier, used one AA battery and provided a quick, comfortable trim.  </li>
            <li> , the caveat is that this is a great trimmer, but it is very cheaply made, and quality control is poor.</li>
            <li> Great little trimmer, works well, comes with the battery, is lightweight.</li>
            <li> A great little trimmer, powered by a AAA battery.</li>
            <li> Great little trimmer.</li>
            <li> If you need de-thatching, this is a great little device.  </li>
            <li> Better price than my old one from a different company and works better!  </li>
            <li> This is a great little tool.  </li>
            <li> Some trimmers include an LED bulb, but I&#x27;ve found that those don&#x27;t really aim where I need the light</li>
            <li> Was looking for a replacement and this fit the bill very well.</li>
            <li> Not too much else to say, it was cheap</li>
            <li> I bought this personal trimmer for myself (lady) to use for light downy facial hair, and it works great for that purpose.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few of these devices and this is the best one I&#x27;ve had so far.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> the speed of the rotating blades is not so powerful.  </li>
            <li> of caution, the hair trimmer attachment is kind of fragile, it broke apart once when I was removing the guard...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two others but this is far better.</li>
            <li> Still, well worth the $9.</li>
            <li> I could not give it a 5 as it is not as powerful as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> Works as expected, but it is fairly flimsy.  </li>
            <li> , it is worth it.  </li>
            <li> Not even worth returning.</li>
            <li> Useful addition to the home or for traveling.</li>
            <li> I have an old Remington groomer that started falling apart after using for many years.</li>
            <li> Looked pretty cool still trying to figure out how to use it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame that what could have been such a nice design doesn&#x27;t have any quality or longevity to it.</li>
            <li> Too loud for for me for the inner ear hairs, but works great on the nose, eyebrows, outer ears.</li>
            <li> it is truly worth the money.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never had it cut or scrape me even in the most sensitive places.</li>
            <li> I have a Wahl beard trimmer, but I bought this for two main purposes: to provide me with a rotary ear/nose hair trim and to neatly &amp; easily trim the &amp;#34;below-the-nose&amp;#34; area of my moustache.</li>
            <li> When I finally put my own battery in it, it worked.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> Has useful and well made attachments.</li>
            <li> but for my own personal needs...notta.&lt;br /&gt;*****************&lt;br</li>
            <li> He loved it so much that he insisted that I get the same one.</li>
            <li> Doesnt cut quite as well as some, but is FAR more reliable and well made.</li>
            <li> properly trimmed nose is more important than my ego.&lt;br /&gt;10/10</li>
            <li> A superb personal grooming product that simply works and is absolutely pain-free.  </li>
            <li> im not afraid to be embarrassed by a nose hair that is pocking out</li>
            <li> Only problem with these are you have to keep the shaving head very clean!</li>
            <li> Very handy little groomer to have.</li>
            <li> In fact, the first few times I used this I trimmed far more than I&#x27;d intended because this trimmer was so much more effective than ones I&#x27;d owned</li>
            <li> When we first tried to assemble it, we had a great deal of difficulty with the little plastic head.  </li>
            <li> Never worked right out of the package.</li>
            <li> This never worked even right out of the box.</li>
            <li> The trimmer has the right heads for all of my needs.</li>
            <li> Plus, priced right.</li>
            <li> Right for the price.</li>
            <li> You just gotta get the right grab and pull its guts out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are handy, you can make the repair easily and with no special tools.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is nice though we have only used it once, it seems solid and functional for many uses.</li>
            <li> Better quality than most of these little groomers I have bought.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this, I was confident that I would get a good product for the same amount of money that other brands were selling.</li>
            <li> I hope they&#x27;ll send me a new one free</li>
            <li> The first time I turned it on with the attachment, the attachment just fell apart; screws and pieces just fell right out.</li>
            <li> The trim head sits at a good angle so the handle is slightly lifted from your &amp;#34;work area&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is a great personal trimmer if you have coarse hair like me</li>
            <li> I will update if it doesn&#x27;t last or something, but so far, so good.</li>
            <li> Works great, especially like the attachments that come with it, especially the eyebrow trimming attachment.</li>
            <li> It is much more powerful than the female verison you buy at Sally beauty supply.</li>
            <li> The nose hair and straight trimmer does adequately function.  </li>
            <li> I use it to mostly trim facial area, very handle and reliable and not a bad pricing too.</li>
            <li> I waited to long to send it back though, so it is a good thing it was cheap.</li>
            <li> Nice, small, and strong</li>
            <li> I like these trimmers very much, and they handle ALL of the extraneous hairs on my bod.  </li>
            <li> thought the price was very reasonable too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Good little tool for touch up trimming...</li>
            <li> This little trimmer is good for lots of grooming tasks.  </li>
            <li> The extra power makes a huge difference!</li>
            <li> Returned first one for replacement as it didn&#x27;t work and will re-rate after getting a replacement.</li>
            <li> they spent all of their time making it look nice</li>
            <li> (so I had a backup in case something happened to the first one).</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Looks to be able to do the job for why I ordered for the grandson that like to keep properly groomed.</li>
            <li> i fiddled with it for 15 minutes switching it on and off trying the batteries many different ways.</li>
            <li> Not necessarily the most comfortable thing to use either, think of gripping a thin pencil, instead of something more ergonomic.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too sure that this product will stand up with daily use.</li>
            <li> I was able to piece it back together and haven&#x27;t had any problems since.</li>
            <li> Got it great made me feel like a real man after using this product and made my chest hair small.</li>
            <li> Will buy a better brand next time.</li>
            <li> This is also the most well made personal trimmer in it&#x27;s category--very durable.</li>
            <li> Next time, I&#x27;d like to try something with a bit better reputation, like the Philips line of trimmers.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Was able to snap it back together.</li>
            <li> Cleaning out he trimmer worked at first</li>
            <li> and this is this first trimmer I have found that I like and continue to use.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to return them even though they weren&#x27;t open???  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s supposed to be wet/dry, the first thing I did was immerse it in water w/o the battery.  </li>
            <li> It works well at first.</li>
            <li> the key is to remember not to make the &amp;#34;shaving&amp;#34; motion, but more like &amp;#34;placing the trimmer to the hair and let it cut the hair&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not</li>
            <li> Broke the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair trimmer 4 days ago and wanted to use it yesterday the first time.</li>
            <li> Had hoped Wahl would be better but still doesn&#x27;t cut close enough.</li>
            <li> It serves it&#x27;s purpose pretty well.</li>
            <li> to say that for the price point, it&#x27;s a relative bargain — more like 3.25 star review.</li>
            <li> Plus it fell apart in the first two minutes out of the box.  </li>
            <li> It works pretty well also and it came with a battery</li>
            <li> It also comes with an attachment for eyebrow trimming, but it you have a regular beard trimmer (hopefully a Wahl), it will do a better job.</li>
            <li> This one is so much better and was shipped the next day.  </li>
            <li> Was able to snap back together.  </li>
            <li> for me, it does exactly what it&#x27;s made to do.  </li>
            <li> Much higher quality than competitor models.  </li>
            <li> If Wahl made a higher end version of this product I would buy that too.</li>
            <li> Real metal!  </li>
            <li> I could only snip off a couple of nose hairs then sneeze 4x; snip a couple more and sneeze again 4x...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first micro groomer that I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t ask for anything more from a personal trimmer.  </li>
            <li> It does exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> But, for eyebrows, nose &amp; ears, this is a quick &amp; effective little trimmer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s loud and burns batteries pretty fast but gives a close trim and cleans up easily.</li>
            <li> Breaks quickly  within only 2 light uses.</li>
            <li> This may be the best inexpensive (around or less than $ low double digits) basic trimmer of its kind on the market.</li>
            <li> I like it has a light to see better, and comes with a stand for your counter and a little cleaning brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely nice and works extremely well.</li>
            <li> This got old very quickly, so I just put a new battery in my old trimmer, and it works just fine.  </li>
            <li> I replaced a $20 rechargeable Conair that lasted me more than ten years, much to my regret --</li>
            <li> This trimmer does everything it said it would, and it works much better than my old Norelco trimmer which stopped working completely after the fifth time I used it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The Straight blade works great for ear hair and a other general trimming.  </li>
            <li> This is the best unit of this type/style I have found so far- 2 of the ones I bought from TV (you know the ones green) didn&#x27;t last 1 week.</li>
            <li> Worked well when I first purchased it but after a while it sounds and feels like it wants to come apart.  </li>
            <li> You may or may not cause your fellow housemates immense joy due to your laughter from the tickling sensation when using this product.</li>
            <li> Loved it until the trimmer attachment stopped working after a month :/</li>
            <li> so I guess the battery claims seems to be true thus far.</li>
            <li> Good little product - would highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Only problem is this thing falls apart so easily -</li>
            <li> This one is ok, but after a while it gets gummed up and is not easy to dismantle or clean.  </li>
            <li> It also comes in an easy to open plastic box.  </li>
            <li> very fact that a long life lithium battery is fitted means that battery replacement is not needed for many months.</li>
            <li> For something so small, it sure does sound like a chainsaw.</li>
            <li> i had another model that would wear out the batteries very quickly and it had only i shaving head .</li>
            <li> this wahl trimmer has 3 different heads that are easy to change and do the job it is  intended to do ..</li>
            <li> Very simple and easy.</li>
            <li> Feels nice and sturdy compared to previous ones I bought from stores for $15+.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The straight-line trimmer has a tendency to come apart (its 2 halves just split), but it&#x27;s easily put back together</li>
            <li> Had a microtouch for the longest time and it never would cut certain hairs.  </li>
            <li> or I wouldn&#x27;t have bought this one, but certainly longer than once.</li>
            <li> Had to put a new battery in right off.  </li>
            <li> It is so underpowered and has such inadequate bearings that, even with a fresh battery, it slows down while running free (not cutting anything, just trying to run freely).</li>
            <li> Nice little trimmer.</li>
            <li> Nice little gadget, works really well</li>
            <li> I only use it about once a week for fine hairs (or as some like to call it, light female mustache)</li>
            <li> but I can see myself losing them very soon.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To make the repair, I gently opened the plastic motor compartment and removed the motor, exposing the movable 1 cm shim connected to the switch.</li>
            <li> locally, only the Conaire versions are available, and they suck.</li>
            <li> Works very well, shipping was as described.</li>
            <li> Very underpowered and flimsily designed and constructed.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my hubby, he really loves it.</li>
            <li> Comes with both straight trimmer and rotary trimmer heads.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Very please with the power and precision of this trimmer.</li>
            <li> It works, feels a bit cheap, especially the trimmer heads.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the seen on TV versions and those were very flimsy.  </li>
            <li> Also, I really don&#x27;t know what the additional guards are for, they don&#x27;t seem to be helpful.</li>
            <li> THIS ITEM IS STRAIGHT UP</li>
            <li> It burns batteries extremely fast.</li>
            <li> I really like this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I dropped the clipper on the rug that I was standing on at my bathroom sink and when it hit the rug, the whole thing exploded into a bunch of pieces.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t cut hair as much as it pulled it.</li>
            <li> Cut very well for the price.</li>
            <li> A total piece of cheap junk.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle on skin but cuts hair without any problems.</li>
            <li> Absolutely avoid the Microtouch trimmer that is advertised on TV.</li>
            <li> got here in time promised and works very well.</li>
            <li> the plastic around the blade catches on skin and you cannot smoothly trim facial hair with this at all.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> I really like the way the head lock on.  </li>
            <li> It works well is very compact and versitile</li>
            <li> This is unusual for a lithium battery in my experience.  </li>
            <li> The nose and ear groomer as well as the eye brow attachments all work very well.</li>
            <li> use is very short, otherwise its high-pitch sound would send it into the garbage bin.</li>
            <li> i gently pinched them in a bit.</li>
            <li> It also pulled out some nose hairs, which was VERY</li>
            <li> Expected more power for some reason.....</li>
            <li> Thanks yo lo recomiendo</li>
            <li> Use a real battery, not a rechargeable.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t find it much of an issue.</li>
            <li> Works really well, I was amazed how fast it cut, no pulling or stalling.</li>
            <li> Works alright, on switch doesn&#x27;t work all of the time, and its much louder than I wanted it to be.</li>
            <li> The attachments work really well.  </li>
            <li> I am amazed in its performance and slim size that makes it very portable.</li>
            <li> (close and very close), and also trims the hair around my ears.</li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> Works very well for all the spots its designed for.</li>
            <li> Very efficient.</li>
            <li> The tallest setting is still very short.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> price on this is fantastic, and now I don&#x27;t need to keep two two different trimmer around to have the features I need.  </li>
            <li> For the price I didn&#x27;t expect much with this item but neither did I expect it to bite the dust after just using it once.  </li>
            <li> Consequently,I threw the whole thing away since I could not use it.</li>
            <li> (who wants to talk about trimming nose hairs?).</li>
            <li> Works VERY well for me.</li>
            <li> The one thing I found absurde was the &amp;#34;thinning&amp;#34; attachment for the Straight blade.  </li>
            <li> For the cost I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but was pleasently suprised at how well it works.</li>
            <li> I was tired of using cheap $5 trimmers and I wanted something made with higher quality parts, so I made the mistake of assuming because the Wahl cost much more, it must be of higher quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put it back, but it was not a snug fit and routinely fell off after that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have only used it once so far, and it worked better than any product I have owned.  </li>
            <li> Initial assembly, especially putting in the batteries, is kind of tricky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very powerful and it includes an alkaline AAA battery which is supposed to last up to a year.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight, small, and compact which makes it easy to travel.  </li>
            <li> It went thru batteries pretty quickly tho, and then stopped working after about a year or two of occasional use.  </li>
            <li> long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE, Wahl, PLEASE design and build a high-end model of decent durable quality and materials, with a decent very quiet more powerful motor, and proper bearings.</li>
            <li> I like this model because its the most compact and has the slider switch unlike other trimmers that are thicker and have a twist switch.</li>
            <li> Sharp but completely safe blades, and no discomfort.</li>
            <li> This is a great little tool, it trims hair, doesn&#x27;t cut long hair.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any issues assembling the product like many other reviewers have mentioned.  </li>
            <li> The previous model was far more quiet, more like a hum or a bee buzzing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was great while it worked, especially the small size which I appreciate for travelling.  </li>
            <li> Cover keep sliding off , in general I would have bought been better off buying  something different</li>
            <li> The first one i returned because as soon as it touched a hair, it wasn&#x27;t powerful enough to cut it.</li>
            <li> The switch seems solid and when it&#x27;s switched on it comes in full power and the blades moves fast.</li>
            <li> I liked it while it worked, just didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> The new one actually spun, and it trimmed a couple hairs, but easily clogged and shut down, forcing me to turn it on and off many times.</li>
            <li> These work pretty good, although they probably won&#x27;t last long through regular use... almost disposable.</li>
            <li> It works well enough, but nothing special here.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect it to last very long; However, it does what needs to be done effectively.</li>
            <li> The other trimmer we had that only lasted a year or so, was so light weight, it was easy to drop.</li>
            <li> Very nice looking and small - not much larger than a pen.</li>
            <li> It does what it needs to do, but because of the small motor it kind of struggles when putting on the nose or eyebrow attachment.</li>
            <li> Small, convenient and effective.  </li>
            <li> Build quality is average, lower outer sleeve slips off the device when removing the top sleeve if you are not holding pressure on the thumb switch.  </li>
            <li> Nothing spectacular, but small enough for travel, not bad for the price</li>
            <li> found the brow trimmer to be a little to high to make much of a noticeable difference, but it did help them to be more groomed looking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d keep this trimmer if the attachment didn&#x27;t split in half and the battery compartment was more waterproof.</li>
            <li> Much better than the previous unit I had.  </li>
            <li> This was actually a decent trimmer in terms of power.</li>
            <li> Particularly the nose hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Better than the last personal trimmer I owned.</li>
            <li> It comes apart in my hand during use &amp; it doesn&#x27;t seem to get the job done like my older one.</li>
            <li> This little groomsman keeps me very comfortable between trips to the hair place.</li>
            <li> Also, even though it is not very loud, it is really too loud to be comfortable for trimming ear</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great and maneuverable, just a few problems: first, the tip comes off if you&#x27;re not careful -- it just rotates a few degrees and pops right off which can be a problem.  </li>
            <li> It worked GREAT for just long enough so that Amazon&#x27;s return window closed.</li>
            <li> One hint is when you are trimming your ears, use the rotary blade (the nose trimmer) because the reciprocating blade is VERY LOUD!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and handy, and if it actually worked reliably it would be worth it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The product is of high quality and is as advertised at the site.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for an inexpensive trimmer, I would highly recommend this one.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> saw the Wahl name and knew it would be high quality, and I was correct.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item.....</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I posted a highly unfavorable review on this product two weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this hair clipper.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it is precisely identical to any number of other, much cheaper trimmers I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s solid, has nice sharp blade and lots of power.  </li>
            <li> I gave it five stars because it was very inexpensive (roughly $12) and for that price it works great compared to other similarly priced products.</li>
            <li> That piece of junk is both weak and poorly made, broke very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You could pay into the double digits and get more bells and whistles, but if you don&#x27;t need an elaborate high tech device, the Wahl 5640-1001 offers good value and reliability.</li>
            <li> This one is a little loud, but does the job quickly and cleanly.</li>
            <li> So I decided that a better made unit might be worth the few extra buck...</li>
            <li> This works really well so far, and has not fallen apart.</li>
            <li> really please with it so far.</li>
            <li> I would pay 5 times as much for a higher quality version of the same product if I could find one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the motor is powerful enough.</li>
            <li> DO NOT USE FOR MORE THAN A FEW BEARD OR MUSTACHE HAIRS.</li>
            <li> My first one worked very well during the short time that I had it.  </li>
            <li> I have had more than a few.  </li>
            <li> When you are hairy like sasquewatch this makes you feel somewhat normal.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It runs hot, it barely cuts or trims, and it FALLS</li>
            <li> Worked ok a few times then wouldn&#x27;t turn on.</li>
            <li> I will purchase more of these in the future as long as they continue to make them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful enough to get the job done</li>
            <li> Really good power for such a small size.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many of these mini-trimmers and most of them are cheaply made crap.  </li>
            <li> I have used other ones that worked fine.  </li>
            <li> The other attachment runs fine.  </li>
            <li> Wahl is better than my previous groomer!</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s so small, this is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve found to cut hair almost razor close ANYWHERE as long as you hold the skin fairly taut and hold the trimmer so that the tiny cutting blade that you can see moving if you look really close is on the side NOT brushing along the skin.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as well as my Panasonic ER-GN30-K, but adequate for use on a trip.</li>
            <li> I ordered this trying to find a decent small trimmer (most of them are junk)  </li>
            <li> it stays sharp and helps me comfortably maintain the areas this trimmer was intended for.  </li>
            <li> I tried new batteries and they did not solve the problem.  </li>
            <li> The motor spins like new without the heads attached and seems to have plenty of torque, but whenever I attach a head it stops spinning.  </li>
            <li> so I put brand new battries in and .....</li>
            <li> and bin it and buy a new one.</li>
            <li> So I went out to buy a new battery and tried it again.</li>
            <li> this should be more straight forward action like all other similar units (Twist to</li>
            <li> works great for a few a few times, then I go to use it</li>
            <li> was somewhat surprised since I thought Wahl had a decent reputation for this type of device.</li>
            <li> guide teeth are so long, it didn&#x27;t trim anything even though a lot of the hairs on my eyebrows were getting pretty overgrown!</li>
            <li> but none seemed to be as loud as this one but other than that is does a fine job trimming.</li>
            <li> Broke after 3 months, most of these don&#x27;t last long, but really 3 months, you would think it could last longer than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wont</li>
            <li> hell to get old and hairy!  </li>
            <li> This thing is loud!  </li>
            <li> I assume this thing works pretty well for facial hair detailing etc...</li>
            <li> First I couldn&#x27;t open the head to install the battery....</li>
            <li> Had in the past were always ok.</li>
            <li> First of all it&#x27;s a Wahl that in its self is enough.</li>
            <li> I ordered two to have an extra when/if the first one wears out.</li>
            <li> Once you get past the little-bit tricky assembly, you&#x27;ll love the functionality of this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also missing a light, my other one had a light</li>
            <li> Blades seem very sharp and it cuts smoothly.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is okay for small jobs, not heavy duty trimming.</li>
            <li> For super fine hairs, it&#x27;s not great but for everything else it is satisfactory.</li>
            <li> Next time I&#x27;ll spend the extra money for the full size.</li>
            <li> While it is nicely styled, the motor is so weak that it will not deal with anything but the lightest load when trimming</li>
            <li> Other times it would turn on at full power but as soon as it hit eyebrow hair, it would jam...and rip the hair out rather than cut</li>
            <li> It seems a little cheap</li>
            <li> I like how precise this little trimmer is.</li>
            <li> Even guys like clean looking noses and using this and a small scissors for targeting hairs really cleans you up.</li>
            <li> Handy little device for trimming hair in those hard to get to places.&lt;br /&gt;Sturdy, powerful and works just as described.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wax since my skin is quite sensitive and it&#x27;s just a few little hairs so this little trimmer is awesome!</li>
            <li> The price is low and the quality seems very high.</li>
            <li> Also, remember to clear out the inside of any hair</li>
            <li> im getting old and my nose is growing a ponytail.</li>
            <li> The motor compartment at the head of the unit snaps open with gentle nudging.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after a few weeks of light use.</li>
            <li> Even so, I doubt that it will last very</li>
            <li> I would much rather pay twice the price for a proper quality device.</li>
            <li> So far it works.</li>
            <li> For the low cost I did not expect much, but got nothing.</li>
            <li> I was  surprised.  </li>
            <li> I have used the trimmer attachment on my eyebrows and nether regions and so far it has lived up to my expectations.  </li>
            <li> So I can only complain so much.</li>
            <li> I have coarse hair and this groomsman had issues trimming my very manly beard.</li>
            <li> a bit loud for what it does.  </li>
            <li> replaced a old one that lasted 5 years</li>
            <li> recommend this product to anyone who wants a personal trimmer.</li>
            <li> old.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your time money.</li>
            <li> A bit loud.</li>
            <li> A regular beard trimmer works much</li>
            <li> REALLY loud.  </li>
            <li> It is, however, much sturdier than my last Conair trimmer.</li>
            <li> I preferred the old style that you had to take off and rotate for short/long.</li>
            <li> As far as power?</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so loud</li>
            <li> Quit working completely after two months.</li>
            <li> It came early and it was just like advertised.</li>
            <li> Circular blade (for your nose I suppose); Straight blade (regular trimming needs).  </li>
            <li> This trimmer actually works very well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace my old trimmer.</li>
            <li> felt like an old man buying this product, but I don&#x27;t regret it.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> Or maybe I&#x27;m just really sensitive.</li>
            <li> For a few dollars more than the TV version you get a nicer wrapper but about the same functionality.</li>
            <li> This makes my wife happy for the least amount of trouble and expense, and I&#x27;ve tried all the body groomers, etc., with no luck at trimming those spots without irritation until now.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s had several of the rechargeable brands and this one is his favorite as the others die out after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> Only had a short time, but for the money its well worth it.</li>
            <li> But by then the thin cover that covers the battery that needs to be slid off to replace to the battery is effectively glued to the core of the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , you&#x27;ll probably find something going wrong with it after a good drop.</li>
            <li> Worked good for a couple of months but then started making a weird noise and yanking out the hair.  </li>
            <li> A little harsh, but better than many other trimmers that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This little Wahl works better than other groomers that I&#x27;ve paid three times as much for.</li>
            <li> Then the power switch quit working properly and the only way to get it to function is to hold it at JUST the right place halfway between on and off.</li>
            <li> I have arthritic hands and although it&#x27;s a small trimmer, it&#x27;s easy to pull and assemble the parts.  </li>
            <li> Small size is easy to store in a drawer.  </li>
            <li> for the price, good for small jobs, pulls a little in the nose hairs but got used to it.  </li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t take any kind of rechargeable, not even eneloop pro, and it eats a high powered expensive battery every couple of months.  </li>
            <li> compact, powerful, battery last a long time</li>
            <li> The second one did exactly the same thing.</li>
            <li> Going back to using my older Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> This is my second, first lasted several years.</li>
            <li> This is one is decent enough.</li>
            <li> I have a beard and between my full sized WAHL timmer and this little beauty.....</li>
            <li> would highly recommend purchasing this trimmer - especially for the price and quality.</li>
            <li> All the brands are the same, as long as you buy this with the right expectations</li>
            <li> Small, light, and versatile.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and cheap but is underpowered.</li>
            <li> I normally use a larger trimmer to keep my mustache trimmed and a dedicated nasal hair trimmer (Panasonic ER-GN30-K) at home, but didn&#x27;t want to bring them on my trip because of weight and size issues.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely no complaints about this trimmer - it works exactly as I had hoped with no problems at all.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Other similar trimmers have broken and malfunctioned very quickly and consistently.</li>
            <li> These things are made very poorly, they last a few months a best.  </li>
            <li> I used to always get these but had to get a new one pretty regularly as it got dull and gummed up pretty</li>
            <li> you feel like you need to change out a new battery to get the thing back up to &amp;</li>
            <li> The last one I bought would start dying after the 1st use with a new battery.</li>
            <li> If you clumsy and drop things easily, this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> I used a small penknife to bend the shim into a more curved position to ensure it would make contact with the long metal plate that connects to the battery anode.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t yank or pull hair, even in the most delicate private parts.  </li>
            <li> Also, it did seem to cut through my thick hair fairly easily.</li>
            <li> Sure, it is small and looks like a marking pen, but it doesn&#x27;t cut close enough to the skin to actually do anything.</li>
            <li> Not extremely lightweight as some of them are.</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t look as rinky-dink as my previous others but instead looks pretty darn professional.  </li>
            <li> Right out of the box the trimmer attachment was split in half.</li>
            <li> she&#x27;s a powerful little devil.  </li>
            <li> Powerful little motor.</li>
            <li> This thing works well for trimming small fine hairs like described above and even does alright as a light-duty beard/mustache trimmer, although I&#x27;d suggest edging duties only.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its a pretty powerful little trimmer but its a little on the loud side.</li>
            <li> The motor runs very fast and doesn&#x27;t bog down like the others.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and light enough so that even the smallest hands can operate it without any problem.  </li>
            <li> Over the years I have bought several nose and ear hair trimmers, they were all  under powered and needed frequent cleaning.</li>
            <li> I cut several heads of hair and had used up the old one I had.</li>
            <li> I have only used this trimmer once so far, but it performed well.</li>
            <li> bare minimum of instructions, though.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only downside is that it is too loud.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m going to check if the blade will work as a replacement for my old one (different brand).</li>
            <li> Its like the blades aren&#x27;t far enough apart or something.</li>
            <li> Second, it&#x27;s loud.  </li>
            <li> My only minus is that it&#x27;s pretty noisy when the body of the trimmer is close to your ears.</li>
            <li> The trimmer still bogs down when you first turn it on.  </li>
            <li> It will not cut through more than a single thick hair (like a mustache hair) at one time.</li>
            <li> After using it a few times, it wouldn&#x27;t always start right away.</li>
            <li> it are pretty odd.  </li>
            <li> The first worked and lasted slightly longer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine for stray hair for inner ears, but it doesn&#x27;t work on eyebrow hair hardly ever.</li>
            <li> Works better than any other item I have tried in the past.  </li>
            <li> The blades cut well, and the blade cleaning is a comprabale process to other trimming devices - pretty simple.</li>
            <li> The battery on this lasts much longer than other models I have used.</li>
            <li> bought the item, because I&#x27;ve had other Wahl products, and they work very well.</li>
            <li> Fit in tiny crevices to get the hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the product for a short time, but so far it works just as advertised.</li>
            <li> Ever see the info commercial of similar product for over $20 this beats that way by far.</li>
            <li> This is a safe trimmer that can be used for your eyebrows, nose, ear, or wherever you have thin, short hair that need trimmed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really pretty noisy for a little trimmer.</li>
            <li> This little guy really does the job!</li>
            <li> Sometimes it has a little trouble with the power required to spin the blades on the vertical trimmer, but with a little finagling it does a good job.</li>
            <li> The eyebrow head,the only head that fit,broke in half the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> but I will say that the blades stay super sharp for a long long time on these.  </li>
            <li> It is so quiet, that it you can use it to cut ear hair, but barely.</li>
            <li> Barely worked in the beginning, and it doed six months later.</li>
            <li> It &#x27;s so under-powered that it can barely handle facial hair without jamming.  </li>
            <li> First micro trimmer I have purchased ( and I have bought them all ) that is not a cheap plastic trimmer with a 1 month life expectancy.</li>
            <li> It is small and powerful.  </li>
            <li> First one arrived dead on delivery.  </li>
            <li> This is the first round nose trimmer head I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> But the whole bottom half piece comes off.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by how long the batteries last.</li>
            <li> They work well but are easily damaged or broken.  </li>
            <li> Unit seems pretty heavy duty actually.</li>
            <li> It seems to run smoother than others and doesn&#x27;t bog down in hair as much as others (obviously I&#x27;m trying to control for battery power, but I&#x27;m not using scientific methods here, heh heh).</li>
            <li> This is junk broke after a month not strong loose battery drains quick</li>
            <li> because it is to much hassle to mess with</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because I expected some cheap POS.</li>
            <li> but when you are poor like me this cuts it just fine.  </li>
            <li> The only hard part was popping all the attachments out of their tight fitting plastic crevices.  </li>
            <li> Got this to deal with the fact that as I get older my eyebrows and nose hair have decided to try to make their way down to party with my beard.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a very thin tin sleeve that slides over the case and gives it a tiny bit of heft and a slightly more refined feel in the hand.  </li>
            <li> robust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am trying to be very careful with it and use it only for slow and precise micro-grooming.</li>
            <li> ended up buying another brand that uses a AA battery instead of the AAA battery that this thing uses and I tend to get at least 3 uses out of the new one before a new battery is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Does the job, is extremely compact, and surprisingly loud.</li>
            <li> In this case, the shim was too flat, lacking enough spring to make contact when the switch was moved to the \\&quot;on\\</li>
            <li> I purchased another one because I lost my original receipt and kept exchanging the broken one.</li>
            <li> the name and the review  was the main reason I bought it , however the name let me down !</li>
            <li> You can replace it with a regular AAA sized battery (those don&#x27;t last very long either).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Literally....the attachment heads have small internal parts that will simply fall right out and go down the drain or disappear into a rug.</li>
            <li> The straight blade is rather small for trimming neck hair - for me there a better/faster methods of losing the neck hair.  </li>
            <li> At least it was not expensive, so I threw this trimmer away today.</li>
            <li> I returned 3 to walmart because the long blade attachment kept falling apart and its a pain to put it back together.</li>
            <li> By then I will long have forgotten about my embarrassing declaration regarding over-abundant facial hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long the battery is going to last</li>
            <li> the battery goes flat, do yourself a favour</li>
            <li> Thats not saying any of them will last a long time.</li>
            <li> never had a problem and don&#x27;t expect to have one as long as I remember that it&#x27;s fairly fragile.  </li>
            <li> I bought a couple nose hair trimmer off of ebay, and they didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I also have a Wahl mustache trimmer, and it has served me long and well, so I am hopeful that this device will do the same.</li>
            <li> I held this personal trimmer in my Wish List for a long time wondering it was the correct design that would be suit my needs.  </li>
            <li> Ours didn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is it is a little on the loud side.</li>
            <li> New unit worked for the few times I used it</li>
            <li> this product is not brand new, it has missing parts.</li>
            <li> like this product however the Battery did not last very Long?</li>
            <li> is that the lithium battery does not last very long.  </li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t even cut the soft hairs on my arm much less the neck hair</li>
            <li> You can easily reach areas that are difficult to reach.</li>
            <li> After having purchased another well touted brand and then returning it due to poor workmanship, I bought this WAHL trimmer and am entirely pleased with it as I have been with other WAHL products.</li>
            <li> i use the the trimmer in my travel shaving kit , it work fine and for cost you cant go wrong</li>
            <li> does a decent job, and is small</li>
            <li> It is also a little loud when opperating, but it is compact and does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> A little louder than my old Panasonic but cuts well.</li>
            <li> A little loud, feels kinda flimsy, but it works.</li>
            <li> I hasnt failed me yet and is very simple to clean and use.</li>
            <li> Worked decently for a while, but after a few weeks and minimal use it just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> The small, yet comfortable size, plus the inexpensive price make this product hard to beat.</li>
            <li> Cheap, flimsy construction, and even when it was working, the quality of the trimming was quite mediocre.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as powerful as I thought, barely cuts hair.</li>
            <li> It did have a rough edge on the plastic just outside the trimming area, but a couple of buffs with a nail file smoothed that out.</li>
            <li> So no worry probably sitting in a wear house for too long</li>
            <li> Once it lasts a long time I can then give it 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> Power button pushes too far up after a few uses so then power doesn&#x27;t cut on.  </li>
            <li> It does its job well and has lasted a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While still wet on the outside, I pulled out the battery compartment.  </li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> The plastic is hollow and the tip came off constantly.</li>
            <li> My nose hair is annoyingly long.</li>
            <li> The package is solid but not very convenient for storage with the instructions.  </li>
            <li> But Battery Life Not what I expected for long lasting lithium Battery</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem very sharp and I have to go over the same area multiple times before I get all the hairs trimmed to the correct uniform length.</li>
            <li> I was tired of the lady&#x27;s trimmers not working properly or breaking down quickly.</li>
            <li> with regular cleaning and adding a little bit of clipper oil, they can last quite a long time.  </li>
            <li> The other one that I used to use had to be opened regularly and cleaned out-and it devoured batteries.</li>
            <li> The trimmer attachment has two possible positions when you mount it, one gives about 4 mm of space between the ends of the combs and the cutter, the other gives about 2 mm of space.</li>
            <li> Still, it cleans up brows and nose hair just like any other similar item.</li>
            <li> Cuts well, we will see how long it lasts!</li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different brands that have had rotating blades heads and other models of the blade design.  </li>
            <li> Returned the first one because of a weak battery.</li>
            <li> He uses it for trimming nose hairs and other facial hair.</li>
            <li> The chrome nickel alloy means it will be unlikely that you will need to clean the contacts.</li>
            <li> Like many others this one failed within a few months.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is LOUD.  </li>
            <li> I use this trimmer to tame down any stray wild eyebrow hairs and he uses it himself for his mustache and such.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s just no excuse for something like this to last barely a month, and I&#x27;m now noticing a LOT of other negative reviews about its quality and length of life.</li>
            <li> While I was at it, I disassembled the blade compartment, cleaned it out and used a single drop of oil to lubricate the metal blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is about the size and weight of a fountain pen and runs on a single AAA lithium or alkaline battery.</li>
            <li> It is somewhat limited on the functions it can perform, but it does what I want it to do.</li>
            <li> Works but limited uses.</li>
            <li> Have tried other newer ones and the plastic piece that juts out from the end prevents them from getting close enough to remove coarse facial hairs that appear as you get older unfortunately.</li>
            <li> The cap will not stay on, there is nothing to make it stay on, it just sits there loose...</li>
            <li> I put it back together and put it down.</li>
            <li> This is a piece of junk, the motor cant keep up and runs slow even on a new battery.</li>
            <li> I have resolved this by tapping the base lightly on the counter before using and for some reason this will have it working normally again.  </li>
            <li> Had two spend three hours with tweezers putting it back together multiple times because there are four small pieces in the head.  </li>
            <li> I have had two other similar models by other companies.</li>
            <li> I HAVE HAD SIMILAR TRIMMERS FOR LESS - AS</li>
            <li> Using scissors for my eyebrows was just so uneven and shaving down below created ingrown hairs and awful razor burn, this product has helped me with both things and now I am nice and neat in a few easy swipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Feels very well made, not some weak piece of plastic that you feel like you will break.</li>
            <li> The terminals were dry, but the inner housing had a few drops of water.  </li>
            <li> WHAT WAHL AND AMAZON.COM SHOULD DO IS REIMBURSE EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO HAD BOUGHT THAT ITEM!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t send it back as I live outside the USA, so once butten forever shy.  </li>
            <li> It works well and comes with lots of little attachments that I personally never use.  </li>
            <li> shaves those little grey hairs on your face you cant see, eye brows out side their boundaries, and even inside my nose.  does not hurt or cut and gets those little black old people hairs.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used cheaper ones in the past that didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> The Remington has a much better designed head but low and behold the ugly lime green &amp;#34;As Seen</li>
            <li> Not much to say when you have to buy this.  </li>
            <li> so the plastic gears don&#x27;t get jammed.</li>
            <li> so be careful.</li>
            <li> I was careful not to wet the handle but moisture gets inside the battery compartment and causes corrosion.</li>
            <li> All in all it works as expected</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m careful when taking the two pieces apart.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get the results I expected.</li>
            <li> It has already broken, and we were gentle with it.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it works as expected.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve owned a lot of these and really expected a lot with this brand.</li>
            <li> If you take it and rub it back and forth on your arm hair it will cut a few of them.</li>
            <li> It works well and doesn&#x27;t pull the hair like I expected.  </li>
            <li> Do not get it wet, on the package they depict it covered in water as well as advertising it as virtually indestructible.</li>
            <li> The battery which was delivered with the trimmer seemed to be empty within 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s when I have time), be careful not to wake your roommates.</li>
            <li> rough on your skin</li>
            <li> Not quite heavy duty enough</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t bother me much, but it&#x27;s still a bit of false advertising I would say.</li>
            <li> Generally they slow down after the 3rd use but this one just keeps going.</li>
            <li> I showed it to my GF to see if I was using it wrong, but she said I was using it right...</li>
            <li> The caved-in tube right out of the package won&#x27;t permit the on/off switch to work or reassemble and is useless.  </li>
            <li> So I was a little disappointed with the loud, high-pitched sound it has</li>
            <li> /&gt;The downside is the attachment system is a little chintzy and the whole thing looks and feels fragile, but it did cost me less than $9 shipped haven&#x27;t broken anything yet after about two months of use.</li>
            <li> The power switch feels a little whimpy, but as long as it turns on and off - it does</li>
            <li> major complaint</li>
            <li> They run slow, and don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I saw the other attachments and decided to try them.</li>
            <li> At under $10 I didn&#x27;t expect a &amp;#34;tank&amp;#34; but this is lightweight plastic and not worth the $9 I spent.</li>
            <li> The wahl is the standard which all small trimmers should be compared to.</li>
            <li> The teeth are too small, and the motor doesn&#x27;t have enough power.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It almost sounds like the blades are rubbing against each other????  </li>
            <li> I assumed that it would work as poorly as other similarly marketed products I purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> I assume this is due to the lithium battery that comes with it, but it packs a punch.  </li>
            <li> The only small trimmer that makes sense.</li>
            <li> I have used other trimmers like this before</li>
            <li> Small and battery operated with three different attachments.</li>
            <li> The brow attachment just compression fits and usually just makes the trimmer not function properly and does not cut.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Found this wahl at walmart and saw that it replaces both of those other trimmers</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have had problems with longevity.  </li>
            <li> Other than that it does the job.</li>
            <li> the brand new battery was dead !!!</li>
            <li> I went back to the little green one you pick up at CVS.</li>
            <li> I tried to put it back together as the pieces did not look broken, only that it fell apart.  </li>
            <li> Flat lateral trimming attachment and comb can easily be misplaced or lost!</li>
            <li> Now, the&lt;br /&gt;trimmings, both nose and ear, and effortless, I actually can get those hard to get hairs</li>
            <li> not worth it for trying to clip a nose hair.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if its five stars yet because I haven&#x27;t had it long.  </li>
            <li> Trimmer cuts close enough, at least for me, and my wife approves of the results.</li>
            <li> Not worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not worth the effort or hassle to return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> I love getting hair cuts, but hate going.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer feature works okay for me to trim side burns, but the nose trimmer is worthless.</li>
            <li> I can trim nose hair, hair growing out of ears, and thin busy eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> It took these catepillars down in no time.</li>
            <li> I use rechargeable batteries to cut down on cost.</li>
            <li> it soon started slowing down.  </li>
            <li> and it did not let me down.</li>
            <li> For some reason with the nose attachment on it loads up not with hair but starts running slower like it&#x27;s loading down the battery.  </li>
            <li> but it is a little louder than other units that I have used.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and cuts without pulling.  </li>
            <li> I tried to use them since Amazon wouldn&#x27;t take them back, but the  blade is small, thin &amp; shuts off constantly.  </li>
            <li> This little tool cuts and/or trims thick hair efficiently with only one AAA battery, which is included.  </li>
            <li> The other heads would not fit.</li>
            <li> cant beat the price, less than $10</li>
            <li> it does not work anymore, lasted less than 4 months  </li>
            <li> I bought this after my previous trimmer died.  </li>
            <li> I typically have always like and approved of the Wahl products I have purchased over the years.</li>
            <li> I have had this for less than a year</li>
            <li> I had a Conair trimmer previously and they were flimsy in that area.  </li>
            <li> He didn&#x27;t like the unpredictable behavior and would not use it.  </li>
            <li> In less than 4 minutes the thing was close to a crawl and</li>
            <li> The fact that the blades are at a slight angle makes trimming sideburns even easier.</li>
            <li> The kit includes rotary head, detailer head, eyebrow guide, protective cap, english/spanish instructions, and 1 AAA lithium battery and costs less than $15.</li>
            <li> Snap the trimmer on before pulling on the bottom half of the device.</li>
            <li> Nothing is loose, but with the small frame, when the blade vibrates the plastic casing also vibrates; causing it to be a little noisy.</li>
            <li> Not too bad for the occasional trimming - eyebrows in particular.</li>
            <li> Works well in tight places, and unlike some of its competitors, I haven&#x27;t cut myself yet.</li>
            <li> I thought the blades were too tight to the silver barrel tip of the nose trimmer part.</li>
            <li> Not strong enough for some serious grooming though,</li>
            <li> When I tried to attach the nose hair clipper to the base and use it for the first time, the little gear inside the nose trimmer was dis-lodged and I ended returning same to amazon.</li>
            <li> The other thing is it comes with the small attachments</li>
            <li> Seems a little hair gets stuck in there</li>
            <li> If need to do a little trimming, use this.</li>
            <li> A little noisy when using on ears, but tolerable.</li>
            <li> This little guy kicks ass.</li>
            <li> The switch on my unit is a little flaky so sometimes one needs to work a little to get the thing turned on.</li>
            <li> It seems the vibrations makes it a little looser.  </li>
            <li> Save your money,  they&#x27;re just not worth it!</li>
            <li> A little noisy</li>
            <li> works well, but a little noisy</li>
            <li> This trimmer is a little noisy but works as described.  </li>
            <li> I wish is had a little case or bag of some sort to keep everything together.  </li>
            <li> Little difficult to open at first and sometimes opens the wrong end, but does the job.</li>
            <li> It is a little under powered and it stopped working after 6 months.</li>
            <li> This little thing can trim everything.</li>
            <li> Now my other son would like one!!</li>
            <li> When I went to use it again today, it was Dead On Arrival.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with this underpowered toy.</li>
            <li> Come with a few extras.</li>
            <li> I will post a review on it in a few months.</li>
            <li> This item broke after using it just a few times, and I had to throw it away.  </li>
            <li> hairs(just a few hairs) CAUTION:</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> but then this happened after a few uses.</li>
            <li> - it has lasted a few years and always works well.</li>
            <li> Had before and lasts a few years.  </li>
            <li> A few times it would not start up</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> This trimmer lasted the few times</li>
            <li> So I have to turn it on a few times to get it to run.</li>
            <li> After a few iterations, I found out that the lithium battery which came with the product was DOA (even through it was labelled for us till 2028).  </li>
            <li> , the battery that came with it was dead</li>
            <li> Hope it lasts a few years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it a few years</li>
            <li> Unless I&#x27;m missing something, the lithium just refers to the AAA battery.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy to use because of the design.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately one of the pieces went down the drain, so I can&#x27;t put it back together.</li>
            <li> trimmer comes with a Lithium battery, and Wahl recommends that, to prevent hair &amp;#34;pulling&amp;#34;, that you replace the battery when you hear the trimmer begin to slow down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not been satisfied with any of the little groomers, but this one is the worst.</li>
            <li> The attachments are not constructed well and two of them failed to operate correctly after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> Got one of these after getting frustrated with nose/ear trimmers that just pushed hairs back in or missed them entirely.  </li>
            <li> This little trimmer gets the job done!  </li>
            <li> but then the motor became weak enough that the motor would only run with the cutting head off.</li>
            <li> A little noisy and delicate.  </li>
            <li> I WOULD LIKE TO SAY TO  ALL OF MY FELLOW AMAZON CUSTOMERS, DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF JUNK BY WAHL.</li>
            <li> it is the battery compartment is difficult to figure out and to open even if you know how to.</li>
            <li> Its small like a lipstick pen and takes a battery</li>
            <li> not sure on battery life</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what they were thinking when designing the cap.  </li>
            <li> and it is small and compact for travel and can be placed in any piece of luggage.</li>
            <li> I purchased a Panasonic Trimmer in the past.  </li>
            <li> Works well to trim small areas.</li>
            <li> usually just rips them out.</li>
            <li> I accidentally ordered these instead of the usual ones we purchase.  </li>
            <li> (when it was placed correctly so that it should&#x27;ve held on, especially with the work it sometimes took to take the cap off) and basically became 6 pieces of useless on the floor.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Connect a battery to a small motor.  </li>
            <li> I would not buy this product again, and I especially wouldn&#x27;t purchase it online where it is so difficult to return.</li>
            <li> I used it once and the serrated trimmer head (the one shown in the product picture, which is the one I usually use) broke and won&#x27;t trim.  </li>
            <li> Save your money and buy a $5 unit, chances are it will serve you just as well, if not better.</li>
            <li> No very good quality.</li>
            <li> I was worried to purchase this thing because I read some bad reviews about it not powering on, but so far I have had no problems and it has worked well for me!  </li>
            <li> I use this in those wrinkly places that I&#x27;ve had trouble getting fully trimmed up in the past, and I can do them all in just about ten minutes, with no leftover irritation, or painful bites.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that hard, or maybe it is, given the number of one star ratings on this</li>
            <li> &quot; It confused me a little bit because I thought this trimmer was powered by lithium-ion rechargeables which this is NOT.</li>
            <li> At least it&#x27;s well-powered...</li>
            <li> would have lasted me at least a year.</li>
            <li> it just sucks do not recommend buying</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money on this poorly made trimmer.</li>
            <li> When it does run,l it&#x27;s so slow that it doesn&#x27;t cut the hairs, just grabs them and pulls!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do not have thick brows, but I thought this kinda strained trying to trim them.</li>
            <li> thick hair&lt;br /&gt;Isn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> It broke into three pieces - the two main components separated as did the razor blade within (very dangerous).</li>
            <li> Small hair get in the blade and stops the blade from working  !</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t mean just the one.</li>
            <li> Small and compact!</li>
            <li> I guess I mistook the &amp;#34;LITHIUM&amp;#34; part of the title to mean that it was rechargeable...</li>
            <li> Lithium AAA might be a little expensive and hard to find, but I&#x27;ve had mine for about 6 mos.</li>
            <li> It stops spinning and/or clogs constantly making it impossible to trim your nose hairs, which is why I bought it.</li>
            <li> had a bad experience with it getting stuck in thicker facial hair...</li>
            <li> I thought I had a bad battery but replaced and same problem.</li>
            <li> no good</li>
            <li> The weak link is the shim connected to the actuator switch.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;connection&amp;#34; that provides power to this unit seems to be weak.  </li>
            <li> I install the Lithium battery...and put the nose clipper on and turned it on....and start slowing down the minute I put in my nose and the cutting started.....</li>
            <li> Easily broken after use for 2 months.</li>
            <li> Not great quality, doesn&#x27;t work well</li>
            <li> and it was broken beyond repair.</li>
            <li> this is a poorly built/designed product.  </li>
            <li> but I got tired of the battery issue</li>
            <li> This thing is a big piece of crap.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not great, but it&#x27;s doable.</li>
            <li> Not a great groomer</li>
            <li> the poorly designed plastic blade side cover popped off.  </li>
            <li> Nope, it&#x27;s  just poorly crafted.</li>
            <li> you are traveling and desperate for anything to trim those small hairs...</li>
            <li> Pulls instead of cutting, must be dull, and sounds worse.</li>
            <li> I look at the &amp;#34;3 yr Limited warranty&amp;#34; and shake my head that one piece of crap.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a little difficult for me to get this trimmer working every time, and the pulling/tugging at hair can be annoying.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all, it&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li> But try as I may, I was unable to reassemble it.  </li>
            <li> It was completely useless.</li>
            <li> extremely uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a model out there that doesn&#x27;t pull or make uncomfortable cuts when its battery starts to get low.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The trimmer I bought was totally useless.</li>
            <li> Rather than cutting the hair, it usually pulls it out by the root, painfully.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality on this, and I&#x27;d advise you to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I have used this type of groomer in the past for the annoying peach fuzz I have along my hairline.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> While it works well for a little while, the battery life on these things is horrible in my experience.</li>
            <li> Bad design and low-power equals useless.  </li>
            <li> The motor spins but when you put on any of the cutting attachments it lacks the power to operate.  </li>
            <li> crazy</li>
            <li> You get to the eyebrows without cutting all the brow off.</li>
            <li> No danger of cutting.  </li>
            <li> Very poorly made, with inferior materials, ultimately worthless.</li>
            <li> Reassembling it was impossible.</li>
            <li> Looks like I got a bad batch of clipers.</li>
            <li> If you bought one of those off TV and were,Understandably, ticked off out how bad it was....</li>
            <li> Too bad it is not made in the USA.</li>
            <li> I was shocked at how flimsy it was made.  </li>
            <li> the clipper couldn&#x27;t cut the hair but kept pulling it in and was painful.</li>
            <li> My nose hair got stuck in the cutter which had to be painfully removed.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for an example of the atrocious JUNK that China is dumping on the US market</li>
            <li> **! :(</li>
            <li> Sadly, they are horrible compared to the Braun brand.  </li>
            <li> i was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS CRAP IN AUGUST OF 2014</li>
            <li> Crap.</li>
            <li> It seems the alignment with the cutter head and the power base is not reliable and I cannot recommend this for anybody that expects it to be &#x27;plug and play&#x27; every time you hook up the cutter head.</li>
            <li> Its very bad</li>
            <li> I was disappointed !</li>
            <li> Disappointed again !</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this trimmer.</li>
            <li> very disappointed with this product.....</li>
            <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED.  </li>
            <li> but it functions like crap!!!</li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>
            <li> It pulls hairs terribly.  </li>
            <li> What a terrible product.  </li>
            <li> Unbelievably terrible.</li>
            <li> It was just insanely under-powered.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Always  need a spare groomsman.  This is a Wahl product, so I know it will be dependable.</li>
            <li> cause im getting old and my nose is growing a ponytail.</li>
            <li> A little harsh, but better than many other trimmers that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed. I thought the Wahl products were well made. The attachment for the trimmer jams when you place it on the trimmer. This makes it inoperable. Overall the trimmer works ok(without the attachment).&lt;br /&gt;I guess for the price it&#x27;s ok.&lt;br /&gt;12/18/2014 - Change to a five star rating. When you insert the attachment for the trimmer PROPERLY it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my upper lip because another brand stopped working and I trust Wahl clippers. It worked perfectly for that. I saw the other attachments and decided to try them. LOVE them. I&#x27;ve always did my eyebrows differently but will probably using this from now on. The only things I don&#x27;t like about it is the battery compartment is difficult to figure out and to open even if you know how to. The other thing is it comes with the small attachments but I can see myself losing them very soon. Might have to get a cheap eyeglass case to hold them.</li>
            <li> Does the trick. Works very well.</li>
            <li> These personal trimmers have become very popular - and some work better than others.  This is definitely one that works well.  It&#x27;s solid, has nice sharp blade and lots of power.  The power switch feels a little whimpy, but as long as it turns on and off - it does it&#x27;s job and it does that nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery is easy to replace - and the trimmer is more powerful than most I&#x27;ve tried.  Good little product - would highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Gave this as a gift. It works great!! Good value.</li>
            <li> Stopped working in three days.</li>
            <li> Great little trimmer, works well, comes with the battery, is lightweight.</li>
            <li> kinda flimsy but does the job the top keeps falling off but for the price it works</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very handy for trimming my mustache and beard. Kinda noisy. Good attachments for trimming a unibrow if you got one.</li>
            <li> Small, light, and versatile.  Good tool for someone on the go.  Battery seems to last a good while.  Extra heads are great to have.</li>
            <li> VERY cheaply made.  Returned first one for replacement as it didn&#x27;t work and will re-rate after getting a replacement. At under $10 I didn&#x27;t expect a &amp;#34;tank&amp;#34; but this is lightweight plastic and not worth the $9 I spent.</li>
            <li> best product for the price</li>
            <li> Tends to stick a lot.  I like Wahl products but this one just doesn&#x27;t work as well as the ones I&#x27;ve had before.  Seems a little hair gets stuck in there and it doesn&#x27;t want keep moving.  It&#x27;s also missing a light, my other one had a light so I could see.  Still a good looking product just wish it was more functional.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it was just mine, but it is a piece of junk. The first time I turned it on with the attachment, the attachment just fell apart; screws and pieces just fell right out.</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer we&#x27;ve found (nose, ears, around the ears). We&#x27;ve tried tons of these and this one is sturdy and works great.  For the price, we have a few in the house and if they break after a year or two, we don&#x27;t really care.</li>
            <li> This device has no power and seams like you have to have it up your nose forever to get the hair out and my nose isn&#x27;t even that hairy. The cap also doesn&#x27;t stay on!!! Seams they spent all of their time making it look nice but it functions like crap!!!</li>
            <li> Not much to say when you have to buy this.  Works well on the nose hairs, so my BF tells me!</li>
            <li> Broke after 3 months, most of these don&#x27;t last long, but really 3 months, you would think it could last longer than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wont buy again!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all, it&#x27;s useless. I opened the package inserted the battery turned it on but it wouldn&#x27;t turn on. I need my refund</li>
            <li> when you use the nose trimmer, it&#x27;s clogs and stops constantly. You have to turn it off and take the top off and reset it and than do it over and over again to get it to work. stopped using nose trimmer. because it is to much hassle to mess with</li>
            <li> Right out of the box the trimmer attachment was split in half. I tried to get one of theses before and it was also coming apart at the seam. Very poor quality.</li>
            <li> works good does job its supposed to do</li>
            <li> I love getting hair cuts, but hate going.  This little groomsman keeps me very comfortable between trips to the hair place.</li>
            <li> Designed obsolescence?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have mixed feelings about this. The trimmer worked great right out of the box. Once. When I went to use it again today, it was Dead On Arrival. As luck would have it the return policy expired yesterday. MORE THAN COINCIDENCE, NSA?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the repair was fairly simple. The motor compartment at the head of the unit snaps open with gentle nudging. There are two metal shims which connect the battery to the motor. There is no point to point soldering in this low price unit. Continuity relies on physical contact. The chrome nickel alloy means it will be unlikely that you will need to clean the contacts. The weak link is the shim connected to the actuator switch. In this case, the shim was too flat, lacking enough spring to make contact when the switch was moved to the \\&quot;on\\&quot; position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make the repair, I gently opened the plastic motor compartment and removed the motor, exposing the movable 1 cm shim connected to the switch. I used a small penknife to bend the shim into a more curved position to ensure it would make contact with the long metal plate that connects to the battery anode. After confirming continuity with an ohmmeter, everything was dusted and reassembled. While I was at it, I disassembled the blade compartment, cleaned it out and used a single drop of oil to lubricate the metal blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Success! The trimmer works perfectly again. Total repair time: under five minutes. Cost: zero. See my uploaded picture of disassembled trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the caveat is that this is a great trimmer, but it is very cheaply made, and quality control is poor. If you are handy, you can make the repair easily and with no special tools. When it works it is a great 4-5 Star unit. I gave this One Star to make it more likely that people will see this and be able to repair their trimmers if they break.</li>
            <li> Excellent, fast , great , thank you</li>
            <li> locally, only the Conaire versions are available, and they suck. They run slow, and don&#x27;t last very long. This one is far superior in speed, power, and in time we&#x27;ll see if longevity also prevails.</li>
            <li> Bought for husband, said its the best trimmer he&#x27;s used yet!</li>
            <li> I cant used it. Its very bad</li>
            <li> Not too bad for the occasional trimming - eyebrows in particular. Not strong enough for some serious grooming though,</li>
            <li> Cheaply priced, cheaply made, yet still effective.</li>
            <li> The product is great for trimming neckline, facial, underarm hair and bikini area.  This trimmer is way better than I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> compact, powerful, battery last a long time</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with this underpowered toy. Sure, it is small and looks like a marking pen, but it doesn&#x27;t cut close enough to the skin to actually do anything. Bad design and low-power equals useless.  It is so quiet, that it you can use it to cut ear hair, but barely.</li>
            <li> Works great !&lt;br /&gt;Hair where I&#x27;ve never had it.&lt;br /&gt;Now easily managed.</li>
            <li> Love it. Perfect solution for my nose grooming.</li>
            <li> Great product for trimming unsightly hair. Works very well, shipping was as described. Price was very good.</li>
            <li> It was great while it worked, especially the small size which I appreciate for travelling.  It&#x27;s now broken after only three months, obviously because of cheap construction.  I would pay 5 times as much for a higher quality version of the same product if I could find one.</li>
            <li> Not bad, used here and there.  cant beat the price, less than $10</li>
            <li> Trims those nose hairs like nobody&#x27;s business. I like the eyebrow trimmer guide. The battery on this lasts much longer than other models I have used. Generally they slow down after the 3rd use but this one just keeps going.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made. Bought 2 (so I had a backup in case something happened to the first one). After one use, the blade and head of the trimmer broke off and lodged in its protective cap. I then went to my backup that I purchased and I used it twice before having to replace the battery. After replacing the battery and attempting to use it again, the blade broke off yet again, this time WHILE I WAS USING IT. Do yourself a favor and spend $5 more for a better trimmer that will actually last.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband. He loves it!</li>
            <li> Stopped working after a few weeks of light use.</li>
            <li> Silent when using and it does the job.</li>
            <li> shaves those little grey hairs on your face you cant see, eye brows out side their boundaries, and even inside my nose.  does not hurt or cut and gets those little black old people hairs.  Its small like a lipstick pen and takes a battery I can buy at walmart.</li>
            <li> This worked great.. For about 30 seconds. I accidentally dropped it and it broke into pieces. Unfortunately one of the pieces went down the drain, so I can&#x27;t put it back together. If you clumsy and drop things easily, this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Use it daily for hygiene purposes.  Very strong battery.  Many uses and trims hair very well.  Use it all the time at home.</li>
            <li> Very nice looking and small - not much larger than a pen. Very underpowered and flimsily designed and constructed. It is so underpowered and has such inadequate bearings that, even with a fresh battery, it slows down while running free (not cutting anything, just trying to run freely). It will not cut through more than a single thick hair (like a mustache hair) at one time. Also, even though it is not very loud, it is really too loud to be comfortable for trimming ear hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two included bayonet mount trimming tools are nice and would be suitable for all grooming jobs if this trimmer were more appropriately robust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am trying to be very careful with it and use it only for slow and precise micro-grooming. Even so, I doubt that it will last very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE, Wahl, PLEASE design and build a high-end model of decent durable quality and materials, with a decent very quiet more powerful motor, and proper bearings. I would much rather pay twice the price for a proper quality device.</li>
            <li> The attachments are not constructed well and two of them failed to operate correctly after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> Loved it until the trimmer attachment stopped working after a month :/ I hope they&#x27;ll send me a new one free</li>
            <li> Very sharp and cuts without pulling.  A ligh would make it out of this world.</li>
            <li> Performs better than any others used.</li>
            <li> I have owned several of these micro trimmers and this one is by far the best. Four months so far on the original battery-they are smart using a lithium battery rather that the cheap ones others ship, assuming that you get a better at all. I am a cyclist and use it on my legs. The motor runs very fast and doesn&#x27;t bog down like the others. It stays clean. The other one that I used to use had to be opened regularly and cleaned out-and it devoured batteries. This one hasn&#x27;t pulled or grabbed yet. It did have a rough edge on the plastic just outside the trimming area, but a couple of buffs with a nail file smoothed that out. The trim head sits at a good angle so the handle is slightly lifted from your &amp;#34;work area&amp;#34;. I am going to get another so I have a backup.</li>
            <li> Arrived and would not work, had to replace. New unit worked for the few times I used it and then it stopped. Did not expect this from a Wahl product.</li>
            <li> So far it works. It seems a little cheap but it works for around the eyes and ears for the shih Tzu&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I find that this shaver is great for intimate areas. It doesn&#x27;t knick and that is really important. Easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used better trimmers for the nasal hairs. Haven&#x27;t tried the trimmer yet. This is a compact battery powered trimmer that will be ok</li>
            <li> Great power. best I have used</li>
            <li> I use these to do a finishing touch to my shaving and it&#x27;s great. I&#x27;ve had a few of these devices and this is the best one I&#x27;ve had so far.</li>
            <li> Excellent 100% Recommended</li>
            <li> Like many others this one failed within a few months. I replaced a $20 rechargeable Conair that lasted me more than ten years, much to my regret -- don&#x27;t waste your money on this poorly made trimmer.</li>
            <li> Although it does the job, it feels cheap and flimsy.</li>
            <li> It cracked after a week.</li>
            <li> Good little tool for touch up trimming...</li>
            <li> Over the years I have bought several nose and ear hair trimmers, they were all  under powered and needed frequent cleaning. The wahl is the standard which all small trimmers should be compared to. Great product.</li>
            <li> Works good. not sure on battery life yet I have only owned it for a month and battery is still good</li>
            <li> does a decent job, and is small</li>
            <li> I bought this for my hubby, he really loves it. Come with a few extras. Definitely nice and works extremely well.</li>
            <li> Excellent power, excellent cutting. This won&#x27;t likely be your primary trimmer, but it&#x27;s great for travel -- that&#x27;s what I use it for. Comes with both straight trimmer and rotary trimmer heads.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer, best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Groom yourself. Keep those nostril hairs out of sight. The same goes for ear hairs too. Battery power is nice too.</li>
            <li> It simply does not work.  The motor spins but when you put on any of the cutting attachments it lacks the power to operate.  I tried new batteries and they did not solve the problem.  For the low cost I did not expect much, but got nothing.</li>
            <li> I now have a hairless nose.</li>
            <li> A great little trimmer, powered by a AAA battery. I&#x27;ve owned several micro trimmers over the years, but this one is the best I&#x27;ve had. It seems to run smoother than others and doesn&#x27;t bog down in hair as much as others (obviously I&#x27;m trying to control for battery power, but I&#x27;m not using scientific methods here, heh heh). In fact, the first few times I used this I trimmed far more than I&#x27;d intended because this trimmer was so much more effective than ones I&#x27;d owned previously!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no LED light here. Some trimmers include an LED bulb, but I&#x27;ve found that those don&#x27;t really aim where I need the light anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is without a doubt the best micro trimmer I&#x27;ve owned, and is a good value. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Looks to be able to do the job for why I ordered for the grandson that like to keep properly groomed.</li>
            <li> First micro trimmer I have purchased ( and I have bought them all ) that is not a cheap plastic trimmer with a 1 month life expectancy. Very please with the power and precision of this trimmer.</li>
            <li> This Product works great!!!!  It is high quality!!!!!!!  I was  surprised.  HAS NICE ATTACHMENTS&lt;br /&gt;i USED IT ON MY NASAL HAIRS.</li>
            <li> Bar-none, the best mini trimmer!</li>
            <li> It works, feels a bit cheap, especially the trimmer heads.  The cap will not stay on, there is nothing to make it stay on, it just sits there loose... I&#x27;m not sure what they were thinking when designing the cap.  There is an attachment to help you trim your eyebrows, I started to use it but noticed that it was basically removing my entire eyebrow!!!  I showed it to my GF to see if I was using it wrong, but she said I was using it right... So beware of this attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say that the included battery should last for 3 or more years, so I am excited about that!</li>
            <li> Nice little gadget, works really well and it is small and compact for travel and can be placed in any piece of luggage.</li>
            <li> Of the trimmers found - this one works the best and lasts about 2 years. Easy to clean and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Flimsy construction. i fiddled with it for 15 minutes switching it on and off trying the batteries many different ways. until finally it turned on and almost chopped my finger off. not worth it for trying to clip a nose hair.</li>
            <li> I cut several heads of hair and had used up the old one I had. Was looking for a replacement and this fit the bill very well. Nice clean edges, good speed and the price was $3 less than when I happened to see it in the store after I got this one.</li>
            <li> Easily broken after use for 2 months.</li>
            <li> This little trimmer is good for lots of grooming tasks.  My only minus is that it&#x27;s pretty noisy when the body of the trimmer is close to your ears.</li>
            <li> for the price, good for small jobs, pulls a little in the nose hairs but got used to it.  works on eyebrow trimming etc.  hell to get old and hairy!  fast and easy.</li>
            <li> cheap, broke within 3 months</li>
            <li> it is good for the money. Cheaply made and falls apart. It is also a little loud when opperating, but it is compact and does what it says it will do. Fast shipping and nice packaging.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re lying about the battery.  Used once a week, the battery will last about 2 months.  It won&#x27;t take any kind of rechargeable, not even eneloop pro, and it eats a high powered expensive battery every couple of months.  Rather than cutting the hair, it usually pulls it out by the root, painfully.</li>
            <li> It met all expectations.  Delivered on time and the package was not damaged.  Works great with several attachments.  I recommend the product.</li>
            <li> This thing is loud!  Trimming my ears was almost unbearable because of the noise.  There has to be something better then this.  It does work like it should, no complaints on performance.</li>
            <li> Not great quality, doesn&#x27;t work well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the seen on TV versions and those were very flimsy.  This Wahl brand is powerful and awesome.  Great attachments also.  Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> nice for touching up in areas where you won&#x27;t go with a razor !!!! lite and dose a good job</li>
            <li> I have gone through a couple of these.  They work well but are easily damaged or broken.  It works well and comes with lots of little attachments that I personally never use.  The product does work well...just don&#x27;t expect it to last for years.</li>
            <li> My wife uses it all the time</li>
            <li> I bought this from Target for my boyfriend.  He used it a couple of times and it broke.</li>
            <li> This is a piece of junk, the motor cant keep up and runs slow even on a new battery. it does not work anymore, lasted less than 4 months  I cannot give a thumbs up, stay away.</li>
            <li> The trimmer feature works okay for me to trim side burns, but the nose trimmer is worthless. It stops spinning and/or clogs constantly making it impossible to trim your nose hairs, which is why I bought it. I don&#x27;t think the motor is powerful enough.</li>
            <li> Cheap, easy to use, safe and quick to use.  If you keep your hair short, you may want to think about mirror usage to get the back of your neck.  Also, remember to clear out the inside of any hair so the plastic gears don&#x27;t get jammed.</li>
            <li> I bought this after my previous trimmer died.  I read lots of reviews and ultimately chose this one.  I am very pleased with my purchase.  It is fast and efficient and came in at a great price.  If need to do a little trimming, use this.</li>
            <li> I use it to mostly trim facial area, very handle and reliable and not a bad pricing too. It also comes with a nose hair trimmer, so why not touch up on that too.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made extension attachment, it broke right after the Amazon warranty was up. But the nose trimmer still works fine. I liked it while it worked, just didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I got this for my father for Christmas.  I am a hairstylist and always trust Wahl and have no problem with this item.  When I cut my fathers hair I use this trimmer to tame down any stray wild eyebrow hairs and he uses it himself for his mustache and such.  Good product and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The extra power makes a huge difference!</li>
            <li> Good product and does what it should, but it&#x27;s a bit on the noisier side. Nothing is loose, but with the small frame, when the blade vibrates the plastic casing also vibrates; causing it to be a little noisy.</li>
            <li> I have bought about 20 different trimmers in my life to trim my facial, nose and ear hair. None have worked as well as this one!I do not know what they did different but it just works great everywhere. I would recommended this to anyone!</li>
            <li> This is a great personal trimmer if you have coarse hair like me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to give zero stars. Cheap piece of junk. Never worked right out of the package. Seems like the on off switch is defective. Like everything else you get what you pay for. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> I was worried to purchase this thing because I read some bad reviews about it not powering on, but so far I have had no problems and it has worked well for me!  I have used the trimmer attachment on my eyebrows and nether regions and so far it has lived up to my expectations.  Using scissors for my eyebrows was just so uneven and shaving down below created ingrown hairs and awful razor burn, this product has helped me with both things and now I am nice and neat in a few easy swipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I would have used such a thing years ago, but I am so glad I have it now!</li>
            <li> Bought it because it was a Wahl.  I love my Wahl 9243-5001 Home Pro and have used it for years!  However, this thing worked great for about two months and then stopped working.  The motor spins like new without the heads attached and seems to have plenty of torque, but whenever I attach a head it stops spinning.  I have cleaned the nose trimmer meticulously and replaced it and it still doesn&#x27;t work.  I do not recommend it.  Ordered a Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex today.  Hope it works better.  I will post a review on it in a few months.</li>
            <li> Had a microtouch for the longest time and it never would cut certain hairs.  This one will cut every hair I have tried it on very pleased.</li>
            <li> Nice little trimmer. Does a great job with nose hairs and hairs around the ears.</li>
            <li> Works great at going where no hair should grow on our bodies and places we do not want to tell anyone there is hair growing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really pretty noisy for a little trimmer. Also, I really don&#x27;t know what the additional guards are for, they don&#x27;t seem to be helpful. Next time I&#x27;ll buy a different one.</li>
            <li> i use the the trimmer in my travel shaving kit , it work fine and for cost you cant go wrong</li>
            <li> This item broke after using it just a few times, and I had to throw it away.  Avoid this one and get a sturdier model even if you have to pay more.</li>
            <li> dont use it a lot but it works some. had a bad experience with it getting stuck in thicker facial hair... so be careful. i got nose trimmer already bit it probably work ok for that, between eyebrows, outer ear and lobes and for stray beard hairs(just a few hairs) CAUTION: DO NOT USE FOR MORE THAN A FEW BEARD OR MUSTACHE HAIRS. IT WILL GET STUCK AND NOT LOOSEN EASILY AT ALL. TRUST ME</li>
            <li> Got this to deal with the fact that as I get older my eyebrows and nose hair have decided to try to make their way down to party with my beard. It&#x27;s not yet old-man crazy but it&#x27;s become enough that I notice it when I look closely in the mirror and want to start cleaning it up a bit. This thing works well for trimming small fine hairs like described above and even does alright as a light-duty beard/mustache trimmer, although I&#x27;d suggest edging duties only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside is the attachment system is a little chintzy and the whole thing looks and feels fragile, but it did cost me less than $9 shipped haven&#x27;t broken anything yet after about two months of use.</li>
            <li> Great. It cuts the hair without any pain. You get to the eyebrows without cutting all the brow off. Good instrument.</li>
            <li> The motor seems strong and the trimmer has a quality feel to it. All of the attachments work as advertised. I&#x27;m pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Perfect for facial hair</li>
            <li> I was disappointed ! I the brand new battery was dead !!! So no worry probably sitting in a wear house for too long so I put brand new battries in and ..... Disappointed again ! No power ! The review said it was powerful ! the name and the review  was the main reason I bought it , however the name let me down ! Small hair get in the blade and stops the blade from working  ! Cover keep sliding off , in general I would have bought been better off buying  something different</li>
            <li> I returned 3 to walmart because the long blade attachment kept falling apart and its a pain to put it back together. I was careful not to wet the handle but moisture gets inside the battery compartment and causes corrosion. I like this model because its the most compact and has the slider switch unlike other trimmers that are thicker and have a twist switch. I&#x27;d keep this trimmer if the attachment didn&#x27;t split in half and the battery compartment was more waterproof.</li>
            <li> I assume this thing works pretty well for facial hair detailing etc... but I mostly got this for eyebrow trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guide teeth are so long, it didn&#x27;t trim anything even though a lot of the hairs on my eyebrows were getting pretty overgrown! At least it&#x27;s well-powered...so I shoved it into the guide attachment from my old one (didn&#x27;t fit quite right, of course, but you do what you can) and that was actually more successful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this thing was dirt cheap. So I can only complain so much.</li>
            <li> I bought this Wahl 5640-1001 Micro Groomsman for a one month trip to Europe. I normally use a larger trimmer to keep my mustache trimmed and a dedicated nasal hair trimmer (Panasonic ER-GN30-K) at home, but didn&#x27;t want to bring them on my trip because of weight and size issues. This Wahl Micro Groomsman scores an A+ for size and weight. it is about the size and weight of a fountain pen and runs on a single AAA lithium or alkaline battery. The nasal hair trimmer works moderately well. Not nearly as well as my Panasonic ER-GN30-K, but adequate for use on a trip. I bought this Wahl trimmer primarily to trim my mustache, something that needs doing every week or two to stay looking neat. The trimmer attachment has two possible positions when you mount it, one gives about 4 mm of space between the ends of the combs and the cutter, the other gives about 2 mm of space. I use the 4 mm position. The cutter works moderately well when trimming my mustache. It doesn&#x27;t seem very sharp and I have to go over the same area multiple times before I get all the hairs trimmed to the correct uniform length. But it does eventually get my mustache trimmed and neat looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mustache trimmer attachment must be removed before you can put the storage cap back on. The nasal trimmer attachment can be left on when putting the cap on. Overall, I would not use this as my trimmer at home, but it works well enough that you can take this tiny lightweight device on your extended trips and maintain a neat, trimmed appearance.</li>
            <li> I WOULD LIKE TO SAY TO  ALL OF MY FELLOW AMAZON CUSTOMERS, DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF JUNK BY WAHL. WHAT WAHL AND AMAZON.COM SHOULD DO IS REIMBURSE EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO HAD BOUGHT THAT ITEM! I BOUGHT THIS CRAP IN AUGUST OF 2014 AND IT DID&#x27;NT EVEN LAST A MONTH! WHAT I NOTICED WITH IT, AFTER AWHILE IT DOES NOT TRIM ANYTHING AT ANYMORE! AND IF YOU REMOVE THE TRIMMMER ATTACHMENT, THE MOTOR WILL WORK. THEN PUT IT BACK ON AND THE MOTOR WON&#x27;T WORK! THIS ITEM IS STRAIGHT UP S***! :(</li>
            <li> Great little trimmer. Is much more efficient than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> I have coarse hair and this groomsman had issues trimming my very manly beard.</li>
            <li> What a POC.  Barely worked in the beginning, and it doed six months later.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after 2 uses...changed battery...no good</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this item and it worked for about 10 minutes. I returned it and got another one. It will run for about 45 seconds to a minute and goes stops. It burns batteries extremely fast.</li>
            <li> Bought to replace my As seen on TV trimmer. For a few dollars more than the TV version you get a nicer wrapper but about the same functionality. All in all it works as expected</li>
            <li> I like these trimmers very much, and they handle ALL of the extraneous hairs on my bod.  That&#x27;s what I got them for, so they are definitely suitable. I also like the fact that they have all of the necessary attachments, and each head is simple to change - Gary</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.  Works wonders ad serves its purpose.</li>
            <li> a bit loud for what it does.  Not necessarily the most comfortable thing to use either, think of gripping a thin pencil, instead of something more ergonomic.  Still, it cleans up brows and nose hair just like any other similar item.</li>
            <li> do you need to trim your stache, side burns, nose, ear, and  beard?.  then this is your happy  body tool.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too sure that this product will stand up with daily use. The Wahl name is supposed to be very good but the item is flimsy, uses one AAA battery and the speed of the rotating blades is not so powerful.  I purchased a Panasonic Trimmer in the past.  It was much heavier, used one AA battery and provided a quick, comfortable trim.  I had it for quite some time until I dropped it on the floor and it was broken beyond repair. I decided to buy another Panasonic for daily use and keep the Wahl for traveling. I would recommend the Wahl to those who may need a slim, light weight trimmer that hopefully will stand the test of time.</li>
            <li> Works great, love the attachments. Very powerful, too.  I highly recommend.  I bought this to replace a panasonic trimmer, which was a piece of junk, and used to burn thru batteries all the time and didn&#x27;t trim nose hair closely enough.  This model works perfectly, the nose trimmer lets you cut very close and has plenty of power.  The other attachment works great for trimming neckline, sideburns, and cleaning up eyebrows.  I also use it to trim my southern region and the thing does the job well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note of caution, the hair trimmer attachment is kind of fragile, it broke apart once when I was removing the guard...I was able to piece it back together and haven&#x27;t had any problems since. I&#x27;m careful when taking the two pieces apart.</li>
            <li> she&#x27;s a powerful little devil.  This works very well, much better than others I had tried and disgarded.  I have no complaints, and I am a complainer!</li>
            <li> the blades flew apart upon initial turn-on.  Look elsewhere... this is a poorly built/designed product.  The nose hair trimmer does work, however.</li>
            <li> Got it great made me feel like a real man after using this product and made my chest hair small.</li>
            <li> Need to get those hairs out of your nose? What your ears? Need to trim up the eye brows? This does them all with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feels very well made, not some weak piece of plastic that you feel like you will break. Great, well made product.</li>
            <li> This never worked even right out of the box. I waited to long to send it back though, so it is a good thing it was cheap. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this.</li>
            <li> This get in there and makes your nose beautiful ( some noses)  !!!! Even guys like clean looking noses and using this and a small scissors for targeting hairs really cleans you up.</li>
            <li> Excellent for trimming nose hair, sideburns, trimming neck hair, unibrow, etc.  Sharp but completely safe blades, and no discomfort. Ideal.</li>
            <li> While it works well for a little while, the battery life on these things is horrible in my experience. You use it once to trim nose/ears and then the next time you go to use it you feel like you need to change out a new battery to get the thing back up to &amp;#34;full speed&amp;#34; if that makes any sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up buying another brand that uses a AA battery instead of the AAA battery that this thing uses and I tend to get at least 3 uses out of the new one before a new battery is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had purchased these on Amazon and in my local stores over time. The one in my local store broke, so I bought this one from Amazon. It didn&#x27;t break but I got tired of the battery issue so I bought another type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, overall I give 2 stars since I view these as battery hogs and &amp;#34;throw away&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Like that it has 2 heads but it is a little louder than other units that I have used.</li>
            <li> This is a great device for hairy guys like me. The trimmer has the right heads for all of my needs. It&#x27;s safe and has never cut me. The battery life is very good too! I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great product. A bargain.</li>
            <li> It often stops working. I take it apart and put it back together and it works. Tried it on my eyebrows and it often locked up part way thru a hair. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Works well, lots of power and speed. Easy clean with water.</li>
            <li> I really like this trimmer.  Works well after about 6 months of usage, and the attachments are great.  Best trimmer I&#x27;ve used so far and can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a device that I could trim my nosehairs and I found the hair trimmer attachment a plus. Only problem is this thing falls apart so easily - the plastic cover comes off, the rotor won&#x27;t actually make the attachments work. I have to spend 10-15&#x27; just messing with it in order to use it for its advertised purposes.</li>
            <li> Not as good as one I had before.  Didn&#x27;t realize this was for a guy and I&#x27;m a girl.  Didn&#x27;t need all these attachments.</li>
            <li> This item works great. I&#x27;ve had two others but this is far better. Good RPM and easy to use. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Better quality than most of these little groomers I have bought. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is actually my second one.  My first one worked very well during the short time that I had it.  It did start to lose power so I replaced the Lithium battery which did not seem to do much good.  And then a bigger problem occurred.  I dropped the clipper on the rug that I was standing on at my bathroom sink and when it hit the rug, the whole thing exploded into a bunch of pieces.  I was shocked at how flimsy it was made.  I tried to put it back together as the pieces did not look broken, only that it fell apart.  But try as I may, I was unable to reassemble it.  So I ordered this second one.  I will do my best not to drop this one!</li>
            <li> Works good, not painful, like some. Lithium AAA might be a little expensive and hard to find, but I&#x27;ve had mine for about 6 mos. with no troubles.</li>
            <li> Works well to trim small areas.</li>
            <li> I had an el cheapo one of these before.  Who am I kidding.  I have had more than a few.  This one doesn&#x27;t look as rinky-dink as my previous others but instead looks pretty darn professional.  Oh well that I am a chick having to use a mans product, but the ends justify the means.  When you are hairy like sasquewatch this makes you feel somewhat normal.  Electrolysis would be heaven but when you are poor like me this cuts it just fine.  No one at work realizes I could totally be their uncle.  This product keeps the nose hairs at bay.  I still pluck my mustache and chin hairs but it works good on the hairs that grow along my cheek bones too.  I am not sure if its five stars yet because I haven&#x27;t had it long.  Once it lasts a long time I can then give it 5 stars.  By then I will long have forgotten about my embarrassing declaration regarding over-abundant facial hair. And I haven&#x27;t even hit menapause yet. Darn.</li>
            <li> This is the best unit of this type/style I have found so far- 2 of the ones I bought from TV (you know the ones green) didn&#x27;t last 1 week. This one is holding up well- alot more power than the others</li>
            <li> My fiancé LOVES it. Its multi-use features are perfect and there is never any snagging of hair.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s strong an durable. The nose hair trimmer could be a little better, but it&#x27;s an excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;We would highly recommend purchasing this trimmer - especially for the price and quality. A++</li>
            <li> Stopped working after one use.  This is the second Wahl trimmer I have tried...  Neither worked for any length of time.</li>
            <li> Great for me &amp; my husband.  Easy to use and very compact.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Does the job, is extremely compact, and surprisingly loud.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t cut hair as much as it pulled it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get the results I expected.</li>
            <li> wonderful tool......thank u</li>
            <li> This was used once before it didn&#x27;t work anymore.  I&#x27;m going back to Conair - they last forever.  Well - not forever, or I wouldn&#x27;t have bought this one, but certainly longer than once.</li>
            <li> Got one of these after getting frustrated with nose/ear trimmers that just pushed hairs back in or missed them entirely.  Works like a dream, though the attachment just a a bit too large to allow me to use this as a very good ear trimmer.  Still, well worth the $9.</li>
            <li> All around great trimmer.  I use fro my eyebrows, ears and nose.  It is small and powerful.  Fit in tiny crevices to get the hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> Works ok as a trimmer but the nose hair trimmer attachment doesn&#x27;t work on the unit anymore</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this trimmer. I thought I did my homework before I bought it, but I guess not. I had troubles immediately, starting with making it run.  It got to the point where I had to remove the head, turn on the clippers, then attach the clipper head. Even then, it still wouldn&#x27;t run well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a working nose hair trimmer, keep looking.</li>
            <li> Replaced a micro touch I had from several years ago.  Works just as I wanted.  Love it.</li>
            <li> It has already broken, and we were gentle with it. Would not buy again. Will buy a better brand next time.</li>
            <li> I bought this for nose hair trimming. It was completely useless. It turns on but doesn&#x27;t actually trim any hairs AT ALL.</li>
            <li> Works great and does exactly what its made for.</li>
            <li> This does the job around my ears and nose. I could not give it a 5 as it is not as powerful as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> It does what it needs to do, but because of the small motor it kind of struggles when putting on the nose or eyebrow attachment.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made, and doesn&#x27;t cut hair, as advertised. The teeth are too small, and the motor doesn&#x27;t have enough power.&lt;br /&gt;I bought the item, because I&#x27;ve had other Wahl products, and they work very well. This is an inexpensive item, so I guess you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> Great for trimming ears, nose, neckline, eye brows, and side burns. A must have product for the guys. This is also the most well made personal trimmer in it&#x27;s category--very durable.</li>
            <li> I have tried many trimmers, but this one clearly wins out.  Seems much more powerful that others and really works well.  I don&#x27;t use any of the attachments, but  being waterproof is a nice feature.  Overall, I plan on purchasing another one of these.  So far the best one I have purchased</li>
            <li> The Wahl brand carries superb quality and workmanship. When I ordered this, I was confident that I would get a good product for the same amount of money that other brands were selling. What exceeded my expectations was the weight and size of this personal trimmer. It has nice &#x27;balance&#x27; as it were, so you feel you have a grip on it, you can feel it in your hand. The other trimmer we had that only lasted a year or so, was so light weight, it was easy to drop.</li>
            <li> Unlike the previous two trimmers I have purchased, this is trimmer is very good and worth the money.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a great product. It&#x27;s fine for stray hair for inner ears, but it doesn&#x27;t work on eyebrow hair hardly ever. It also doesn&#x27;t work well with trimming nose hairs...usually just rips them out.</li>
            <li> Battery died after a month of usage</li>
            <li> Cut very well for the price.</li>
            <li> A total piece of cheap junk. I typically have always like and approved of the Wahl products I have purchased over the years. NOT THIS GARBAGE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It runs hot, it barely cuts or trims, and it FALLS APART!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Literally....the attachment heads have small internal parts that will simply fall right out and go down the drain or disappear into a rug. And I don&#x27;t mean just the one. I returned it and got 2 more...local purchases at different retail stores...and they all fell apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are traveling and desperate for anything to trim those small hairs...hey do what you have to do. Otherwise, there are much better products to choose from.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a little difficult for me to get this trimmer working every time, and the pulling/tugging at hair can be annoying. But you get what you pay for, I suppose. Next time, I&#x27;d like to try something with a bit better reputation, like the Philips line of trimmers.</li>
            <li> Horrible! Pulls instead of cutting, must be dull, and sounds worse.</li>
            <li> Best grooming accessory for older man.  I can trim nose hair, hair growing out of ears, and thin busy eyebrows.  Comes with multiple attachments.  Works better than any other item I have tried in the past.  Suprisinglly good battery life.  A little noisy when using on ears, but tolerable. Very nice package!</li>
            <li> Gets where it won&#x27;t trim often and must be cleaned to go on.</li>
            <li> the clipper couldn&#x27;t cut the hair but kept pulling it in and was painful. Looks like I got a bad batch of clipers.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the purchase. The product is of high quality and is as advertised at the site. I would by it again.</li>
            <li> Power button pushes too far up after a few uses so then power doesn&#x27;t cut on.  POS. Don&#x27;t buy this one.  Started out pretty good...but then this happened after a few uses.</li>
            <li> Worked ok a few times then wouldn&#x27;t turn on. Not too much else to say, it was cheap but I guess you get what you pay for here.</li>
            <li> It &#x27;s so under-powered that it can barely handle facial hair without jamming.  Let it get a grip on nose hair or ear hair and you&#x27;re in for a rip-roaring time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emphasis on &amp;#34;rip.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Light, great for traveling</li>
            <li> If you need de-thatching, this is a great little device.  The straight blade is rather small for trimming neck hair - for me there a better/faster methods of losing the neck hair.  But, for eyebrows, nose &amp; ears, this is a quick &amp; effective little trimmer.  Wish I had bought one years ago.</li>
            <li> Bought this on vacation to trim my ears and nose, it works great does a nice clean job! Easy to stick in your travel bag, works with a battery.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is nice though we have only used it once, it seems solid and functional for many uses. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is much more sturdy than the cheap as-seen-on-TV trimmer. It may be for a man, but it works great on peach fuzz and women&#x27;s unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works great for mustache, sideburns, neck, and back hair trimming. Great price too.</li>
            <li> Worked great for about 2 weeks, then made it its life mission to rip the hair off my body instead of cut.  It almost sounds like the blades are rubbing against each other????  I have tried to fix, but was better off throwing away.</li>
            <li> My son says he looks and feels better with nose hair groomed.</li>
            <li> Great--met all expectations</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s so small, this is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve found to cut hair almost razor close ANYWHERE as long as you hold the skin fairly taut and hold the trimmer so that the tiny cutting blade that you can see moving if you look really close is on the side NOT brushing along the skin. I use this in those wrinkly places that I&#x27;ve had trouble getting fully trimmed up in the past, and I can do them all in just about ten minutes, with no leftover irritation, or painful bites. This makes my wife happy for the least amount of trouble and expense, and I&#x27;ve tried all the body groomers, etc., with no luck at trimming those spots without irritation until now. I like the replaceable battery too; since I use rechargeables, it&#x27;s super-easy to trim all I want!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for an inexpensive trimmer, I would highly recommend this one.  It&#x27;s light weight, small, and compact which makes it easy to travel.  This trimmer is okay for small jobs, not heavy duty trimming.</li>
            <li> Does what a good portable trimmer should. I would recommend this product quiet comparatively, feels well made and can be rinsed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product however the Battery did not last very Long? Now use regular Battery.  Good product But Battery Life Not what I expected for long lasting lithium Battery</li>
            <li> This micro shaver has exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> Works as expected, but it is fairly flimsy.  Tip fell apart when installing.  Was able to snap it back together.</li>
            <li> its just a nose trimmer. what can i say about it. battery does not last at all. has a nice feel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good luck with your nose hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;happy trimming</li>
            <li> Not nearly as powerful as I thought, barely cuts hair. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend purchasing.</li>
            <li> This little guy kicks ass.</li>
            <li> I had one of these, and was pretty satisfied with it.  A man can use it to trim nose hair, ear hair, and eyebrows.  It went thru batteries pretty quickly tho, and then stopped working after about a year or two of occasional use.  Still, at the low price I am seeing here as I write this ($9), it is worth it.  I tried another brand - wish I remembered the name so that I could trash it - and that broke after being used just two times, so it is obviously superior to something like that.  I have a full-size Wahl trimmer (a Groomsman) that plugs into an outlet, and that is a very good item - it has lasted a few years and always works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many of these mini-trimmers and most of them are cheaply made crap.  This is not professional quality, but it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> I have only used this trimmer once so far, but it performed well. It seems to have an adequate amount of power and trims well. At this point, I would recommend this for anyone looking for a nose hair or fine tuning type of trimmer. I will update if it doesn&#x27;t last or something, but so far, so good.</li>
            <li> Great utility , I like the fact that it turns off when the cap is put on. Works as advertised.</li>
            <li> Worked great for five or six uses then the motor started to freeze up. Cleaning out he trimmer worked at first but then the motor became weak enough that the motor would only run with the cutting head off. I&#x27;m not a hairy guy and I&#x27;d hopped this would have lasted me at least a year. It did not.</li>
            <li> After using it a few times, it wouldn&#x27;t always start right away. I had to jiggle the head of it a bit to get it to turn on.</li>
            <li> I have had this for less than a year and this is this first trimmer I have found that I like and continue to use. The Rotary Cutter works well for nose hairs and the Eye Brow Comb is PERFECT for maintaining my thick bushy eyebrows. I LOVE this item. I would replace it if it broke. I bought mine at Walmart but I wanted to leave a review here. RECOMMENDED!!</li>
            <li> When I tried to attach the nose hair clipper to the base and use it for the first time, the little gear inside the nose trimmer was dis-lodged and I ended returning same to amazon.</li>
            <li> Works well in tight places, and unlike some of its competitors, I haven&#x27;t cut myself yet. Trimmer cuts close enough, at least for me, and my wife approves of the results. The switch on my unit is a little flaky so sometimes one needs to work a little to get the thing turned on.</li>
            <li> Works O.K., could use a better &#x27;rake&#x27; for doing eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works O.K., could use a better &#x27;rake for doing eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Wahl 5640-1001 Lithium Micro Groomsman Personal Trimmer&lt;br /&gt;I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR ITS QUALITY AND PRICE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wahl 5640-1001 Lithium Micro Groomsman Personal Trimmer</li>
            <li> Worked well when I first purchased it but after a while it sounds and feels like it wants to come apart.  It seems the vibrations makes it a little looser.  It is still going but I wonder when it will give out...but for the price, it&#x27;s done it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> This Wahl micro trimmer is the best of all these small type trimmers on the market. It comes with a lithium battery (not rechargeable) and feels so much more powerful then all the others. It has a matching cap that helps keep it sanitary. The price is low and the quality seems very high. Great buy!</li>
            <li> I accidentally ordered these instead of the usual ones we purchase.  Sadly, they are horrible compared to the Braun brand.  I wasn&#x27;t able to return them even though they weren&#x27;t open???  I would not recommend these.  I tried to use them since Amazon wouldn&#x27;t take them back, but the  blade is small, thin &amp; shuts off constantly.  Save your money,  they&#x27;re just not worth it!</li>
            <li> This thing is great for cleaning up your neck line. It&#x27;s gentle on skin but cuts hair without any problems. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This one is ok, but after a while it gets gummed up and is not easy to dismantle or clean.  I used to always get these but had to get a new one pretty regularly as it got dull and gummed up pretty fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a great nose trimmer try Andis. (my review below)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far this is the best nose trimmer I have had to date. I hasnt failed me yet and is very simple to clean and use. I like it has a light to see better, and comes with a stand for your counter and a little cleaning brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best one out there IMHO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See your review on the site</li>
            <li> I had it replaced after it stopped working after one use. The second one did exactly the same thing. Worked once and died.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and forget this product.</li>
            <li> Had before and lasts a few years.  Works fine!</li>
            <li> Works so great, I was very surprised. I assumed that it would work as poorly as other similarly marketed products I purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> This little trimmer gets the job done!  By far the best one of these I&#x27;ve had in terms of strength.  I assume this is due to the lithium battery that comes with it, but it packs a punch.  A tip on these trimmers: with regular cleaning and adding a little bit of clipper oil, they can last quite a long time.  I will update the review if I have any problems or when the battery gives out (will have to see if it lives up to its longetity claims).  But overall I recommend.</li>
            <li> good value overall. bare minimum of instructions, though.&lt;br /&gt;Still , glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Lasted about 5 uses and died</li>
            <li> This is a great little tool, it trims hair, doesn&#x27;t cut long hair.  Expect it to work on light trimming, and it will do what you want it to.</li>
            <li> Crap. Turned on and died immediately in my hands. Not even worth returning.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because I expected some cheap POS. I got it and have loved using it. I was also hesitant to use the eyebrow trimmer, but again, works like a charm. It took these catepillars down in no time.</li>
            <li> Awesome little trimmer, I am happy with how durable this is.And it comes with two attachment. Only downside is that it is too loud.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman, and I use this exclusively on my nose hair.  It works perfectly, and I have had no problems with it.  I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> This may be the best inexpensive (around or less than $ low double digits) basic trimmer of its kind on the market. It does its job well and has lasted a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other similar trimmers have broken and malfunctioned very quickly and consistently. Avoid at all costs the Remington MPT3500. I went through two of the Remingtons, and the blade and motor are flimsy, and jam up. Absolutely avoid the Microtouch trimmer that is advertised on TV. That piece of junk is both weak and poorly made, broke very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You could pay into the double digits and get more bells and whistles, but if you don&#x27;t need an elaborate high tech device, the Wahl 5640-1001 offers good value and reliability.</li>
            <li> Best out of the last 4 trimmers I have gotten.  I love the options of trimmer head.</li>
            <li> Hurts to use this.  It pulls hairs terribly.  I tossed mine in the trash.</li>
            <li> A little noisy and delicate.  Otherwise it works as expected.</li>
            <li> got here in time promised and works very well. replaced a old one that lasted 5 years</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s not expensive, but it&#x27;s also cheap!  Seems like the clippers both stall the low power motor.  In fact, sometimes the motor just stops when I put the clipper or trimmer on the shaft.  When it does run,l it&#x27;s so slow that it doesn&#x27;t cut the hairs, just grabs them and pulls!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put mine where it belongs..... in the trash.</li>
            <li> I love this thing. It is simple to use and very effective for ear and nose trimming. I don&#x27;t know how long the battery is going to last but so far so good.</li>
            <li> This little tool cuts and/or trims thick hair efficiently with only one AAA battery, which is included.  It doesn&#x27;t yank or pull hair, even in the most delicate private parts.  I have arthritic hands and although it&#x27;s a small trimmer, it&#x27;s easy to pull and assemble the parts.  It also comes in an easy to open plastic box.  The only hard part was popping all the attachments out of their tight fitting plastic crevices.  I used a screw driver to pop out most of the items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it&#x27;s supposed to be wet/dry, the first thing I did was immerse it in water w/o the battery.  While still wet on the outside, I pulled out the battery compartment.  The terminals were dry, but the inner housing had a few drops of water.  So, I&#x27;ll only wash the head under running water whenever the battery is in place.  It washes nicely.</li>
            <li> Not what I was expecting, it more pulls hair than cuts. It&#x27;s not easy to use because of the design.</li>
            <li> This product is comfortable, but locks up on nose and eye brow hair. I thought I had a bad battery but replaced and same problem. Otherwise it seem ok for $10.</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars but the first one showed up DOA, quick replacement and happy with it.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve owned a lot of these and really expected a lot with this brand. i was disappointed. the plastic around the blade catches on skin and you cannot smoothly trim facial hair with this at all. i&#x27;m going to check if the blade will work as a replacement for my old one (different brand).</li>
            <li> Good compact trimmer, Wish the attachments were somehow incorporated or self contained into the unit. Flat lateral trimming attachment and comb can easily be misplaced or lost!</li>
            <li> It works every bit as well as advertised. I especially like the eyebrow trimmer.</li>
            <li> Works well. Small and compact!</li>
            <li> This is the best personal trimmer I have found, it cuts great.</li>
            <li> The only small trimmer that makes sense.</li>
            <li> Worked decently for a while, but after a few weeks and minimal use it just doesn&#x27;t work. Turns on, but doesn&#x27;t cut hair at all.</li>
            <li> Works great and clogs less-often than my previous trimmer (remington branded one).</li>
            <li> I have tried many brandsof trimmers these are best I have tried!  Good price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had 2 of these and both broke after a month .</li>
            <li> Nice product.  Affordable and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This thing stopped working in a month. Well it occasionally stopped working. It would turn on sporadically , and yes the batteries were fully charged. So if I lightly tapped it against the counter, sometimes it would kick on. Except for the last time I did that, it just fell apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say when it did work, it worked great.</li>
            <li> It works well at first. Small, convenient and effective.  But when it comes to replacing the battery this is when the problems start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The very fact that a long life lithium battery is fitted means that battery replacement is not needed for many months. But by then the thin cover that covers the battery that needs to be slid off to replace to the battery is effectively glued to the core of the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the battery goes flat, do yourself a favour and bin it and buy a new one.</li>
            <li> Works great to shave your hands and feet if you suffer from being a werewolf or if you masturbate frequently and have to deal with hairy palms..</li>
            <li> Very handy little groomer to have. I&#x27;ve used cheaper ones in the past that didn&#x27;t last long. So I decided that a better made unit might be worth the few extra buck... I was right! Very solid groomer, lots of power. Not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li> For something so small, it sure does sound like a chainsaw. And, yet, it pulls hairs as often as it cuts them.</li>
            <li> 1)powerful.  2)quality material.  3)durable construction.  ~ I am very satisfied, overall. The blades cut well, and the blade cleaning is a comprabale process to other trimming devices - pretty simple.</li>
            <li> Build quality is average, lower outer sleeve slips off the device when removing the top sleeve if you are not holding pressure on the thumb switch.  Cuts well, we will see how long it lasts!</li>
            <li> This thing is a big piece of crap. All it does is make noise. If you take it and rub it back and forth on your arm hair it will cut a few of them. Its like the blades aren&#x27;t far enough apart or something. save your money and don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> Works fine. A little noisy but it seems ok quality</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my husband. I read the reviews on amazon.com and everyone seemed to give it 5stars and said it worked great.&lt;br /&gt;My husband used it and loves it! He said it works great on his nose hairs.&lt;br /&gt;I thought the price was very reasonable too.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to anyone who wants a personal trimmer.</li>
            <li> The perfect grooming tool for my husband.  He&#x27;s had several of the rechargeable brands and this one is his favorite as the others die out after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> This was a great gift for a man.  It works really well and is easy to use.  He seemed to be happier with this one, than the one before it, which was Avon.  haha</li>
            <li> does not trim as closely as some of the others I have had. For super fine hairs, it&#x27;s not great but for everything else it is satisfactory.</li>
            <li> Works great, especially like the attachments that come with it, especially the eyebrow trimming attachment. Ultimate manscaping machine!</li>
            <li> I guess I mistook the &amp;#34;LITHIUM&amp;#34; part of the title to mean that it was rechargeable... It&#x27;s not...</li>
            <li> This is good for a quick personal groomer. Nothing spectacular, but small enough for travel, not bad for the price and it does the job.</li>
            <li> I been using this trimmer for about 3 weeks now, i have tried many others and this one is far the best for the price. It trims nearly as close as a razor i highly recommend this trimmer for its great value</li>
            <li> After having purchased another well touted brand and then returning it due to poor workmanship, I bought this WAHL trimmer and am entirely pleased with it as I have been with other WAHL products. i have used all of the attachments. I have a beard and between my full sized WAHL timmer and this little beauty.....I am well groomed......Jack,LA</li>
            <li> i wanted an inexpensive trimmer. this was it and i like it. it&#x27;s not great, but it&#x27;s doable. it pulls the hair if longer than 1/8&amp;#34;. the key is to remember not to make the &amp;#34;shaving&amp;#34; motion, but more like &amp;#34;placing the trimmer to the hair and let it cut the hair&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not sure if it makes sense... i&#x27;ll keep it.</li>
            <li> What a fiasco.  First one arrived dead on delivery.  Being somewhat compulsive I shipped it back (my nickle...) to Wahl two plus weeks ago. The second one arrived, neatly boxed, today. The caved-in tube right out of the package won&#x27;t permit the on/off switch to work or reassemble and is useless.  Where is their &amp;#34;quality control?&amp;#34;  Anyway, I give up on them and the product is off to the landfill.</li>
            <li> Better price than my old one from a different company and works better!  Solid trimmer and no complaints.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> This works really well so far, and has not fallen apart. I too was expecting a rechargeable lithium battery, but it works.</li>
            <li> I really like the way the head lock on.  I had a Conair trimmer previously and they were flimsy in that area.  This is a solid trimmer.  This is the first round nose trimmer head I&#x27;ve ever used.  It works well and doesn&#x27;t pull the hair like I expected.  I highly recommend this trimmer. It is a great value.</li>
            <li> This one is a little loud, but does the job quickly and cleanly.</li>
            <li> It works well is very compact and versitile</li>
            <li> leaves 1/4 inch /// no close shave here</li>
            <li> Ordered this for an elderly relative.  It seemed to work when I unpacked, assembled and tested. It was much more finicky when used by a 90 yr. old.  He didn&#x27;t like the unpredictable behavior and would not use it.  It seems the alignment with the cutter head and the power base is not reliable and I cannot recommend this for anybody that expects it to be &#x27;plug and play&#x27; every time you hook up the cutter head.</li>
            <li> This is a great little tool.  It was a gift for my hubby and he loves it.  Wahl&#x27;s are usually very good quality.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite ear/nose/eyebrow trimmer that I have ever tried.  Is it perfect?  No.  I don&#x27;t think there is anything perfect for maintaining these sensitive areas of the body... but I will say that the blades stay super sharp for a long long time on these.  (2 years and still sharp).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The major complaint I do have about this trimmer is that the lithium battery does not last very long.  If I remember it was about 2 months until mine gave up the ghost.  This is unusual for a lithium battery in my experience.  Don&#x27;t despair though!  You can replace it with a regular AAA sized battery (those don&#x27;t last very long either).  The &amp;#34;connection&amp;#34; that provides power to this unit seems to be weak.  I have resolved this by tapping the base lightly on the counter before using and for some reason this will have it working normally again.  That might sound like a pain... and why still give it 5 stars?  As said above... it stays sharp and helps me comfortably maintain the areas this trimmer was intended for.  I will purchase more of these in the future as long as they continue to make them.</li>
            <li> Instrument works fine.  It is somewhat limited on the functions it can perform, but it does what I want it to do.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made product. I don&#x27;t expect it to last very long; However, it does what needs to be done effectively.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.  It is a good value in my opinion.  I would purchase this again if this one wears out.</li>
            <li> The nose and ear groomer as well as the eye brow attachments all work very well. The small, yet comfortable size, plus the inexpensive price make this product hard to beat.</li>
            <li> Never worked out of the package. Very poorly made, with inferior materials, ultimately worthless. Do not waste your time money.</li>
            <li> This is a safe trimmer that can be used for your eyebrows, nose, ear, or wherever you have thin, short hair that need trimmed.</li>
            <li> First I couldn&#x27;t open the head to install the battery....then after reading all the reviews online..I was able to jerk and rock the cheap plastic head that doesn&#x27;t turn...engineering wise this should be more straight forward action like all other similar units (Twist to open).....anyway...I install the Lithium battery...and put the nose clipper on and turned it on....and start slowing down the minute I put in my nose and the cutting started.....then the guarantee was &amp;#34;no pulling&#x27; well it pulled and pinched and hurt too, and the minute I saw that I put it back in the box and tomorrow I am taking back to the store I bought from to get my money back....very disappointed with this product.....poor engineering and cheaply made</li>
            <li> This seems like a good trimmer it cuts with no problems. The only issue I have is it is a little on the loud side. I have used other trimmers like this before but none seemed to be as loud as this one but other than that is does a fine job trimming.</li>
            <li> Small and battery operated with three different attachments. Provides many helpful trimming functions. Useful addition to the home or for traveling.</li>
            <li> Nice, you get what you see...</li>
            <li> Works perfect and better than anything I have bought anywhere else</li>
            <li> I bought this together with the Wahl Lithium Ion All in One Trimmer. I probably didn&#x27;t read the description close enough but seeing that it was Lithium powered like the trimmer, I assumed it would be rechargeable, it is not.  It is just a standard disposable AAA battery.  You can use any AAA. It would have been nice if you could recharge it like the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The performance is satisfactory.  A few times it would not start up and I had to remove/re-install the head to allow it to start turning. It&#x27;s an okay trimmer that could be made better.</li>
            <li> Broke the first time I used it. Had in the past were always ok.</li>
            <li> I must be blessed with a lot of testosterone because I&#x27;m a hairy guy. For this reason I&#x27;m somewhat of a trimmer connoisseur. This product trims better than any I&#x27;ve found for nose, ear, eyebrow, etc. However, I end up replacing it every six months or so. Every time I try a different product I always end up coming back to the Wahl despite it&#x27;s lack of durability.</li>
            <li> Worked for about a month and then broke. If you want a disposable trimmer than this is for you.</li>
            <li> works great for a few a few times, then I go to use it and then I pulled the attachment off and the the whole top part popped apart.</li>
            <li> What a terrible product.  While it is nicely styled, the motor is so weak that it will not deal with anything but the lightest load when trimming and it has no way to keep up with the spare parts.  Going back to using my older Panasonic.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> Unbelievably terrible. Wouldn&#x27;t even cut the soft hairs on my arm much less the neck hair I bought it for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and cheap but is underpowered. Not a great groomer but it works. I&#x27;d look elsewhere</li>
            <li> works well, but a little noisy</li>
            <li> Just like the one you see on TV. Works but limited uses.</li>
            <li> Do not get it wet, on the package they depict it covered in water as well as advertising it as virtually indestructible. I rinsed the head out under the faucet and it almost immediately stopped working shortly after. Do not rinse under water, it is very easily destructible. Misleading packaging.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair trimmer 4 days ago and wanted to use it yesterday the first time. The battery which was delivered with the trimmer seemed to be empty within 2 minutes. My nose hair got stuck in the cutter which had to be painfully removed. So I went out to buy a new battery and tried it again. It didn&#x27;t cut my nose hair properly and always stopped working. I still haven&#x27;t finished to cut my hair and I won&#x27;t do that with this trimmer anymore. I can&#x27;t recommend to anyone. At least it was not expensive, so I threw this trimmer away today. In fact, the packaging is more worth than the content.</li>
            <li> worked for about two months, kinda hoped to get a year out of it. do not recommend. the phillips works much better. should have saved my money</li>
            <li> This was actually a decent trimmer in terms of power. The last one I bought would start dying after the 1st use with a new battery. This trimmer lasted the few times I tried it with arguably the same power. Also, it did seem to cut through my thick hair fairly easily. My problem with this is that it slipped out of it&#x27;s cap when I was holding it (when it was placed correctly so that it should&#x27;ve held on, especially with the work it sometimes took to take the cap off) and basically became 6 pieces of useless on the floor. Reassembling it was impossible. It was great for the price considering the strength of the blade, but I&#x27;ve seen other trimmers fall and continue to work fine (even if it needed assembly). Unfortunately, I&#x27;d prefer something that can hold itself together better than this though...</li>
            <li> This is junk broke after a month not strong loose battery drains quick it just sucks do not recommend buying</li>
            <li> this product is not brand new, it has missing parts. that why its so cheap.</li>
            <li> Very useful, durable, great product</li>
            <li> Previously purchased this item and it was great. Bought it again and it was defective. I was disappointed but I did receive a refund.</li>
            <li> no complaints it does the job would recommend</li>
            <li> Finally, I found a trimmer that works. This thing does my nose, ears, eyebrows, and neckline. All of it. I think I will buy another in case they stop making these and I need to replace the one that I have. Has 3 different attachments shown in the item pictures. Great trimmer! Nice one Wahl!</li>
            <li> I love that this is waterproof and it works very well. It is much more powerful than the female verison you buy at Sally beauty supply.</li>
            <li> I have an old Remington groomer that started falling apart after using for many years. Have tried other newer ones and the plastic piece that juts out from the end prevents them from getting close enough to remove coarse facial hairs that appear as you get older unfortunately. Had hoped Wahl would be better but still doesn&#x27;t cut close enough.</li>
            <li> Great item, Better than expected</li>
            <li> These work pretty good, although they probably won&#x27;t last long through regular use... almost disposable. Don&#x27;t think you can cut yourself though even if you try.</li>
            <li> i had another model that would wear out the batteries very quickly and it had only i shaving head . this wahl trimmer has 3 different heads that are easy to change and do the job it is  intended to do .. this trimmer cuts my beard trimming time in half , very smooth and whal is a great company and make quality products ..</li>
            <li> Great piece...trimmer works perfectly.  battery life is great, but i only use this as needed  No Issues at all....Great buy</li>
            <li> This trimmer is awesome!! Very powerful and doesn&#x27;t catch on the thicker hairs. I definitely would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used alot of trimmers and this one surpasses all the others. Compact design and effective to use. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> perfect, for areas you don&#x27;t want hair but are not worth pulling or lasering, the shave is close and painless</li>
            <li> I like how precise this little trimmer is. You can easily reach areas that are difficult to reach. The fact that the trimmer is on the side is really nice because you&#x27;re able to see what you&#x27;re doing if you need to trim the hairline on the back of your head with two mirrors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the brow trimmer to be a little to high to make much of a noticeable difference, but it did help them to be more groomed looking. It serves it&#x27;s purpose pretty well. Some people may like to have a shorter option, though.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is a little noisy but works as described.  The head add-on&#x27;s that come with it are pretty odd.  But I haven&#x27;t seen any trimmer have correct size heads for my needs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the product for a short time, but so far it works just as advertised. It&#x27;s very slim and does a good job.</li>
            <li> The nose hair trimmer could do a better job, but good enough.  I wish is had a little case or bag of some sort to keep everything together.  But for the price I can&#x27;t expect everything.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after  2 weeks!  I bought the product because it was supposed to be water-proof.  Used it twice while shaving and with water.  Stopped working...Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> This is not like the cheap ones at walmart. It actually works.&lt;br /&gt;Powerful and does the job. I like it..</li>
            <li> If you bought one of those off TV and were,Understandably, ticked off out how bad it was....you NEED this Wahl Micro Groomer, it wporks and does a job you won&#x27;t believe. It trims the eye brown, mustache, hair in the ears, nose, where ever and does it neat with out pulling hairs out by the roots. It cuts the hairs so nicely. Great product.</li>
            <li> Looked pretty cool still trying to figure out how to use it.</li>
            <li> This replaced a similar trimmer that was over 15 y.o.; I believe it was a Wahl product as well. The selling points were the wet/dry capability plus attachments. So I was a little disappointed with the loud, high-pitched sound it has when operating — reminds me of a dentist&#x27;s drill. The previous model was far more quiet, more like a hum or a bee buzzing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fair to say that for the price point, it&#x27;s a relative bargain — more like 3.25 star review. Pleased with it? Yeah... meh... but thankfully it&#x27;s use is very short, otherwise its high-pitch sound would send it into the garbage bin.</li>
            <li> Had to put a new battery in right off.  The trimmer still bogs down when you first turn it on.  Plus it fell apart in the first two minutes out of the box.  Had two spend three hours with tweezers putting it back together multiple times because there are four small pieces in the head.  Next time I&#x27;ll spend the extra money for the full size.</li>
            <li> The first one i returned because as soon as it touched a hair, it wasn&#x27;t powerful enough to cut it. i replaced the battery, same thing. I thought the blades were too tight to the silver barrel tip of the nose trimmer part. i gently pinched them in a bit. Still didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;I thought maybe it&#x27;s just a lemon, so returned it and got another.  The new one actually spun, and it trimmed a couple hairs, but easily clogged and shut down, forcing me to turn it on and off many times. It also pulled out some nose hairs, which was VERY uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;This product is good if you have some extra room in your trash bag that needs filling up.</li>
            <li> I have had two other similar models by other companies. They both have shortcomings.&lt;br /&gt;I saw the Wahl name and knew it would be high quality, and I was correct. Now, the&lt;br /&gt;trimmings, both nose and ear, and effortless, I actually can get those hard to get hairs&lt;br /&gt;in the front of the nose, and there is no pain. I highly recommend this item.....</li>
            <li> Wahl, you had one job.  Connect a battery to a small motor.  One job.  It&#x27;s not that hard, or maybe it is, given the number of one star ratings on this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t work out of the box.  The problem is the metal parts in the switch don&#x27;t make proper contact.  Maybe with some fiddling it will work.  I&#x27;m wishing I bought a different model.</li>
            <li> I bought this personal trimmer for myself (lady) to use for light downy facial hair, and it works great for that purpose.  I was tired of the lady&#x27;s trimmers not working properly or breaking down quickly.</li>
            <li> Expected more power for some reason..... it&#x27;s good in not being to rough on skin, but not too impressive on performance vs. other power groomers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Took a chance on it because of the price. Worked when it arrived then put it in a drawer. Didn&#x27;t work again about a month later. Thought the battery had died but that wasn&#x27;t the case.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made.  The razor part falls apart whenever I take off the shield.  Doesn&#x27;t trim well at all.</li>
            <li> wonderful groomer for the price!</li>
            <li> This little guy really does the job! It&#x27;s loud and burns batteries pretty fast but gives a close trim and cleans up easily. I use rechargeable batteries to cut down on cost.</li>
            <li> Does the job. A bit loud. But works good</li>
            <li> Thanks yo lo recomiendo</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this since December and use it irregularly. It worked great at first, and still works, but it stalls when I turn it on. So I have to turn it on a few times to get it to run.</li>
            <li> The product do a really good job removing hair and does not pinch the skin which is great, but do not drop it.  I dropped on of the attachments and that attachment no longer works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not been satisfied with any of the little groomers, but this one is the worst. It kind of snagged but didn&#x27;t trim much. It stopped working about two weeks in. This is the second one I&#x27;ve had. The first worked and lasted slightly longer. It&#x27;s small and handy, and if it actually worked reliably it would be worth it.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely no complaints about this trimmer - it works exactly as I had hoped with no problems at all.  I only use it about once a week for fine hairs (or as some like to call it, light female mustache) and I love it.  I don&#x27;t wax since my skin is quite sensitive and it&#x27;s just a few little hairs so this little trimmer is awesome! I also like how discrete it looks when the cap is on it. No complaints here!</li>
            <li> Great for your nose and ears</li>
            <li> Very simple and easy. Comes with 3 attachments and is oh-so-easy to operate. I&#x27;ve gone through many a nose hair trimmer, and I&#x27;m sticking with Wahl!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice tool, but a woman should not try this on her nose...I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking when I purchased it for myself.</li>
            <li> I did not like it and after about 3 uses, it quit.  Complete waste of money.  I went back to the little green one you pick up at CVS.</li>
            <li> It worked GREAT for just long enough so that Amazon&#x27;s return window closed. Then the power switch quit working properly and the only way to get it to function is to hold it at JUST the right place halfway between on and off. There&#x27;s just no excuse for something like this to last barely a month, and I&#x27;m now noticing a LOT of other negative reviews about its quality and length of life. Very poor quality on this, and I&#x27;d advise you to look elsewhere. It&#x27;s a shame that what could have been such a nice design doesn&#x27;t have any quality or longevity to it.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet-its a backup-should be fine by its looks</li>
            <li> Good quality, and they work great for my nose hairs.  Much better than the previous unit I had.  Unit seems pretty heavy duty actually.</li>
            <li> Packaging says the lithium battery will last 3 or 4 years.  Try 3 or 4 minutes.  Out of the box I turned it on and initially it sounded okay it soon started slowing down.  In less than 4 minutes the thing was close to a crawl and the poorly designed plastic blade side cover popped off.  The Remington has a much better designed head but low and behold the ugly lime green &amp;#34;As Seen On TV&amp;#34; product with the LED light beat them all, even Remington.  Thats not saying any of them will last a long time.</li>
            <li> This runs like a champ for me. Even if this were to stop working on me once a year, I&#x27;d be happy buying it annually because far too many similar products cost more and never work properly.  Use a real battery, not a rechargeable. Too loud for for me for the inner ear hairs, but works great on the nose, eyebrows, outer ears.</li>
            <li> This works well as a trimmer.  My only complaint is that it is LOUD.  Compared to others that I have seen it is significantly louder, about 86 decibels.</li>
            <li> This thing is great.  Its lightweight and does a great job.</li>
            <li> This product is just as seen in the picture. It works pretty well also and it came with a battery it is truly worth the money.</li>
            <li> Its a pretty powerful little trimmer but its a little on the loud side. The original battery has lasted for quite some time as well.</li>
            <li> Feels nice and sturdy compared to previous ones I bought from stores for $15+. It&#x27;s very powerful and it includes an alkaline AAA battery which is supposed to last up to a year. I have been using this for over a month now on my sideburns and to just trim off the top of my chest hair so it wouldn&#x27;t stick out of my shirt and so far so good. The motor still sounds powerful just like the very first day so I guess the battery claims seems to be true thus far.</li>
            <li> I did not find that this trimmer worked.  It seemed to just go over and over the skin without removing any hair.  I have used other ones that worked fine.  I would not recommend this one.</li>
            <li> The perfect trimmer for me!  Works well all over the body and I&#x27;ve never had it cut or scrape me even in the most sensitive places.</li>
            <li> extremely uncomfortable. doesn&#x27;t cut hair comfortably but pulls the hair, pain to use. waist of money.</li>
            <li> THE PERFECT GROOMING TOOL FOR ME.</li>
            <li> I have a Wahl beard trimmer, but I bought this for two main purposes: to provide me with a rotary ear/nose hair trim and to neatly &amp; easily trim the &amp;#34;below-the-nose&amp;#34; area of my moustache. It works great for both uses. It also comes with an attachment for eyebrow trimming, but it you have a regular beard trimmer (hopefully a Wahl), it will do a better job. I do not have thick brows, but I thought this kinda strained trying to trim them. It needed many passes to trim my not-thick brows, so I feel that if you have hair thicker than I do, you would find it not too satisfying. A regular beard trimmer works much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The straight-edged trimmer was excellent for tidying up the area above my moustache and along the sides of my beard on my upper face. It cut smoothly and quickly (again - I have relatively fine hair). The ear/nose trimmer worked perfectly with no snags or pulls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer comes with a Lithium battery, and Wahl recommends that, to prevent hair &amp;#34;pulling&amp;#34;, that you replace the battery when you hear the trimmer begin to slow down. To me, this makes this a perfect candidate for a NiMH rechargeable battery that will provide full power and then just stop: no hair pulls, more energy efficient and cheaper to use in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The straight-line trimmer has a tendency to come apart (its 2 halves just split), but it&#x27;s easily put back together and I didn&#x27;t find it much of an issue. For the 9-bucks I spent on this item, I am very happy. I have always been happy with the quality of Wahl products, and this is no exception. Great for fine-tuning your electric shave.</li>
            <li> Just bought one at CVS.  One of the heads (the eyebrow trimmer attachment) fell apart when I opened it. It broke into three pieces - the two main components separated as did the razor blade within (very dangerous). I returned it and got another. When I got that home, everything was fine except that the product didn&#x27;t work.  After a few iterations, I found out that the lithium battery which came with the product was DOA (even through it was labelled for us till 2028).  When I finally put my own battery in it, it worked.  I would not buy this product again, and I especially wouldn&#x27;t purchase it online where it is so difficult to return.</li>
            <li> This item is so cheaply made. The plastic is hollow and the tip came off constantly. Do not buy. I used this on my kids side burns and not only did it pull on his hair but it broke too.</li>
            <li> Nose hair trimmer is absolute waste, does not work. Internal plastic rotation system in fragile and does not work well with nose hair trimmer. Gets stuck all the time.</li>
            <li> Works really well, I was amazed how fast it cut, no pulling or stalling.</li>
            <li> Works alright, on switch doesn&#x27;t work all of the time, and its much louder than I wanted it to be.</li>
            <li> Have used a &amp;#34;as seen on TV&amp;#34; version of this product before but wanted something a bit more robust in construction.  Handy little device for trimming hair in those hard to get to places.&lt;br /&gt;Sturdy, powerful and works just as described.</li>
            <li> I found this product on some guide for how to shave my danglybits and ended up buying it since it was so cheap and looked damn useful.  It&#x27;s great and maneuverable, just a few problems: first, the tip comes off if you&#x27;re not careful -- it just rotates a few degrees and pops right off which can be a problem.  Second, it&#x27;s loud.  REALLY loud.  If you mostly shave and hygienate at night like I do (it&#x27;s when I have time), be careful not to wake your roommates.</li>
            <li> It works, but seems cheap.  The brow attachment just compression fits and usually just makes the trimmer not function properly and does not cut.  The nose hair and straight trimmer does adequately function.  If you are a hairy guy and will use this for more than an occasional touch up, but a better quality trimmer.</li>
            <li> No very good quality. It gets stuck all the time.</li>
            <li> Does just what you want it to! Perfect little tool and the attachments work great! Would definitely recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Awesome product for the price.  The attachments work really well.  I have not used it in the shower yet.  Would give it 5 stars if the attachment heads were not made of plastic.  Those plastic heads seem like they will eventually break.  It is, however, much sturdier than my last Conair trimmer.</li>
            <li> I have owned a similar product bought 8 years ago.  Needed to replace it and found this item on Amazon selecting it for its name and value.  I am amazed in its performance and slim size that makes it very portable.</li>
            <li> The attachments don&#x27;t stay attached. Cheap plastic. Not worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;I was somewhat surprised since I thought Wahl had a decent reputation for this type of device.</li>
            <li> had one of these years ago and loved it.  This one is so much better and was shipped the next day.  Love it would recommend it to any one</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT  DOES  WHAT IT SAYS IT WILL DO.  I USE THEM ALL.  I RECOMMEND THIS TO ANY PERSON WHO NEEDS IT.</li>
            <li> Mustache blade came apart when I put it on.  Was able to snap back together.  Everything just seems like the fit is off.</li>
            <li> Hurts my ears sometimes.</li>
            <li> Trims well and seems to have been made well. Good battery life. Attachments fit well. Would be nice if container were included.</li>
            <li> great item..works well</li>
            <li> First of all it&#x27;s a Wahl that in its self is enough. I knew wine I ordered this I would be pleased and it did not let me down. I highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> enough said, It cuts great, I have no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps&lt;br /&gt;Use do care, and never drop it, you&#x27;ll probably find something going wrong with it after a good drop.</li>
            <li> Works extremely good, super light,and it has a cap</li>
            <li> Nice and cheap! Sometimes it has a little trouble with the power required to spin the blades on the vertical trimmer, but with a little finagling it does a good job. For the price-point one shouldn&#x27;t expect high-end performance, but it works perfectly for minor grooming needs.</li>
            <li> Used once and it didn&#x27;t turn on the second time I tried to use it. I replaced the battery, still didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;Figured it may be stuck so I rinsed it off and oiled it. Still no luck. The head fell apart in my hands. I put it back together and put it down. I tried the next day and it worked.&lt;br /&gt;Next time, same order of events. Fell apart even further and it&#x27;s sitting in pieces as I type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Tried to put it back together, but it fell apart once again, and some of the tiny plastic parts disappeared. I threw it away.</li>
            <li> Love it. I have used many and for the price this rocks! I would buy again and would recommend to anyone who needs a great groomer.</li>
            <li> Fantastic trimmer and I use it daily.  Powerful little motor. Works on eyebrows, ears, and nose hair.  Buy it today.</li>
            <li> this is not the best engineered product but I use it all the time. never had a problem and don&#x27;t expect to have one as long as I remember that it&#x27;s fairly fragile.  for me, it does exactly what it&#x27;s made to do.  has attachment to trim nose hair, an attachment to trim eyebrows (if you have bushy eyebrows, this attachment can trim to 2 lenghts..(close and very close), and also trims the hair around my ears. it can trim the hair around the back of the neck or even on your chest. anywhere you have fine hair to be trimed. I really like it.  very easy to switch attachments.</li>
            <li> And it saves my ears from being chopped into purée from my DE razor.  Its compact and the fit and finish for this cheap trimmer are the best Ive seen for any of these micro trimmers including Panasonic</li>
            <li> Much higher quality than competitor models.  High powered and sturdy, I am very pleased with the purchase.  Plus, priced right.</li>
            <li> Works very well for all the spots its designed for. Only had a short time, but for the money its well worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for hubby.  When we first tried to assemble it, we had a great deal of difficulty with the little plastic head.  Once we figured it out we were very pleased with it&#x27;s performance</li>
            <li> Good trimmer for around $10 or so, the battery that came with it was dead so i put in a good sanyo oneloop rechargeable battery and this thing is good for trimming hair. Ever see the info commercial of similar product for over $20 this beats that way by far. Again Wahl gives you the bang for you buck.</li>
            <li> Worked good for a couple of months but then started making a weird noise and yanking out the hair.  Had to go back to the Remington.  Sorry but the Wahl just didn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any issues assembling the product like many other reviewers have mentioned.  I don&#x27;t know if they have changed it or not, but it was easy to clip on the two attachments.  It does seem to be more powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Powerful&lt;br /&gt;Cuts thick hair&lt;br /&gt;Isn&#x27;t rough on your skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Lithium\\&quot; is misleading, it is just a AAA battery.  I guess you could put in a lithium battery if you want.&lt;br /&gt;Cutting comb that covers blade claims to have a \\&quot;short\\&quot; and \\&quot;long\\&quot; side, but they seem to cut about the same...  It also cuts based on the angle you are holding the trimmer.  I preferred the old style that you had to take off and rotate for short/long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great. I ordered two to have an extra when/if the first one wears out. Not extremely lightweight as some of them are.</li>
            <li> I had a Phillips nose trimmer. Used it for awhile until the power button actually fell off! I had a Conair trimmer (it broke) and a Remington trimmer too. Used that for eyebrows. It was just insanely under-powered. Sometimes it would turn on and sound like it was running at 1/2 power. Other times it would turn on at full power but as soon as it hit eyebrow hair, it would jam...and rip the hair out rather than cut it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Found this wahl at walmart and saw that it replaces both of those other trimmers so I bought it. Blades seem very sharp and it cuts smoothly. As far as power? The switch seems solid and when it&#x27;s switched on it comes in full power and the blades moves fast. One hint is when you are trimming your ears, use the rotary blade (the nose trimmer) because the reciprocating blade is VERY LOUD! When you put that one up to your ear, it&#x27;s a bit much.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really please with it so far. Hope it lasts a few years.</li>
            <li> This little Wahl works better than other groomers that I&#x27;ve paid three times as much for. I was surprised by how long the batteries last. Very efficient.</li>
            <li> just as advertised and arrived quickly.  would buy again. This is a WAHL and they make good home products.  Christmas for the husband.</li>
            <li> I love the attachments. I can trip my beard and ears and noise easily. The only thing I would change is the length of the eyebrow trimmer. It has a setting for 2 lengths. The tallest setting is still very short.&lt;br /&gt;The overall size is awesome as well. It easily fits in travel bags.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it a few years and it is still working. Does a good job.</li>
            <li> Excellent price and fast shipping. Thanks</li>
            <li> Arrived on time &amp; as described.  We love this product!</li>
            <li> Look no Further!!!!  Say good by to vibrating Nose hairs! Public speaker must</li>
            <li> My husband loves this!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like having a Cessna buzzing your face and forget your ears: you&#x27;ll go deaf. it&#x27;s so loud I had to close the bathroom door AND the bedroom door so that my son wouldn&#x27;t wake up by its horrendous sound. total junk</li>
            <li> Little difficult to open at first and sometimes opens the wrong end, but does the job.</li>
            <li> Works well but is kind of loud.</li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different brands that have had rotating blades heads and other models of the blade design.  Blade head models I&#x27;ve used include this [[ASIN:B0006UTYTW Conair Men&#x27;s 2-Blade Trimming System]] and rotary head models have included both the [[ASIN:B005YVTI30 Panasonic ER115 Nose &amp; Ear Hair Trimmer Wet/Dry Application]] and [[ASIN:B00C7LCBM0 Panasonic PAN-ER415SC Nose/Ear Hair Trimmers]].  I find the blade models work best for eyebrows, and the rotary head models work best for the nose (probably ears too but I&#x27;m not there yet).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about this Wahl Groomsman is it gives me both the blade and rotary head in the same compact trimmer.  It&#x27;s powerful enough to get the job done and I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a model out there that doesn&#x27;t pull or make uncomfortable cuts when its battery starts to get low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price on this is fantastic, and now I don&#x27;t need to keep two two different trimmer around to have the features I need.  Good job Wahl!</li>
            <li> For the price can&#x27;t beat it</li>
            <li> great product and use it all the time to trim unwanted body hair. safe to use everywhere i&#x27;ve tried it.</li>
            <li> broke on me before i even used it</li>
            <li> Perfect for nosehairs</li>
            <li> The battery isn&#x27;t rechargeable, but will probably outlast the cheap plastic trimmer parts anyway.  Despite cheap components, this is still a very handy thing to have.</li>
            <li> I HAVE HAD SIMILAR TRIMMERS FOR LESS - AS ADVERTISED ON TV AND HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY SATISFIED.  THOUGHT WAHL WOULD BE EVEN BETTER.  VERY DISAPPOINTED.  ENDED UP IN THE TRASH CAN.  AMAZON HAS THE &amp;#34;TV&amp;#34; KIND ALSO.  GET THEM INSTEAD.</li>
            <li> For the price I didn&#x27;t expect much with this item but neither did I expect it to bite the dust after just using it once.  Can&#x27;t send it back as I live outside the USA, so once butten forever shy.  Don&#x27;t bother buying this thing.</li>
            <li> The Wahl Groomsman Trimmer works well on only on battery. This is my second, first lasted several years. Only problem with these are you have to keep the shaving head very clean!</li>
            <li> Quit working completely after two months.</li>
            <li> I bought a couple nose hair trimmer off of ebay, and they didn&#x27;t last long. This is one is decent enough. In my opinion, it&#x27;s worth the price. It works well enough for me.</li>
            <li> I may well end up rating this a five if it has any staying power.  Other reviewers have had problems with longevity.  I have only used it once so far, and it worked better than any product I have owned.  I also have a Wahl mustache trimmer, and it has served me long and well, so I am hopeful that this device will do the same.</li>
            <li> I posted a highly unfavorable review on this product two weeks ago.It has been removed.The trimmer I bought was totally useless. The eyebrow head,the only head that fit,broke in half the first time I used it.The other heads would not fit.Consequently,I threw the whole thing away since I could not use it.This would not happen if it was made in the USA,not China.</li>
            <li> This is the second one we&#x27;ve purchased - we are very pleased with it.  Good size and weight!  Does the job! (who wants to talk about trimming nose hairs?).</li>
            <li> Works VERY well for me. Has useful and well made attachments. Just be sure you charge the battery appropriately and you shouldn&#x27;t encounter the problems some others have been posting. Very much worth the cost!</li>
            <li> Really good power for such a small size.  I&#x27;m impressed.  Small size is easy to store in a drawer.  The fact that the blades are at a slight angle makes trimming sideburns even easier.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for.  It works well enough, but nothing special here.  As long as it lasts for a year or two, I&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for myself and three of my friends each received one as a Christmas gift. I gave it five stars because it was very inexpensive (roughly $12) and for that price it works great compared to other similarly priced products. If Wahl made a higher end version of this product I would buy that too.</li>
            <li> I just got this and have used it once.  For some reason with the nose attachment on it loads up not with hair but starts running slower like it&#x27;s loading down the battery.  I put in another battery and it still does the same thing.  The other attachment runs fine.  It might be a throwaway.  I&#x27;ll get back to you.</li>
            <li> It came early and it was just like advertised. When I used it, I got a close trim and It was safe.</li>
            <li> High quality and great service.  Real metal!  I was amazed at the precision and sleek design.  A keeper for sure.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do a very good job on my eyebrows which is what I bought it for. It misses a lot of</li>
            <li> I held this personal trimmer in my Wish List for a long time wondering it was the correct design that would be suit my needs.  After finally purchasing it...I found it had (2) blade attachments: Circular blade (for your nose I suppose); Straight blade (regular trimming needs).  The one thing I found absurde was the &amp;#34;thinning&amp;#34; attachment for the Straight blade.  Granted...there may some people who use it...but for my own personal needs...notta.&lt;br /&gt;*****************&lt;br /&gt;The Straight blade works great for ear hair and a other general trimming.  The Circular blade I tried for my unsightly nose hair...and have to admit...I could only snip off a couple of nose hairs then sneeze 4x; snip a couple more and sneeze again 4x...etc.  I still can&#x27;t use it without sneezing...if anyone can...I&#x27;d like to know how.&lt;br /&gt;******************&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product and of course...I totally recommend Amazon...they are an amazing company.</li>
            <li> Returned the first one because of a weak battery. Same problem with the second one so I threw it away.</li>
            <li> Yep, used it once and it&#x27;s not working. I know the one guy wrote how to repair it, but after one use?! Joke product. Get what you pay for</li>
            <li> Very light and easy to use, but only one AAA battery leaves it underpowered.  Particularly the nose hair trimmer.  Right for the price.</li>
            <li> Nice, small, and strong</li>
            <li> It died after one use. Not worth the effort or hassle to return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money. Skip this product. Buy scissors</li>
            <li> The best trimmers ever.  I&#x27;ve used others and they just don&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best on the market. Works well and last .If you want to look good all around buy it</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding trimmer. To me this is a thousand times better than the Micro Touch Trimmer. I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> This trimmer actually works very well. The kit includes rotary head, detailer head, eyebrow guide, protective cap, english/spanish instructions, and 1 AAA lithium battery and costs less than $15. Good deal!!</li>
            <li> This trimmer does everything it said it would, and it works much better than my old Norelco trimmer which stopped working completely after the fifth time I used it.</li>
            <li> These things are made very poorly, they last a few months a best.  I have been using them for years and they always stop working or fall apart.  All the brands are the same, as long as you buy this with the right expectations you&#x27;ll be okay.  It does a good job on nose and ear hair.</li>
            <li> I bought one, and it broke a week later. I purchased another one because I lost my original receipt and kept exchanging the broken one. I&#x27;m on my fifth or sixth exchanged trimmer in three months. I look at the &amp;#34;3 yr Limited warranty&amp;#34; and shake my head that one piece of crap.</li>
            <li> Nice product, two cutting attachments plus a guard.  Comes with it&#x27;s own battery too.  So far so good. Better than the last personal trimmer I owned.</li>
            <li> Received one as a gift. It is a little under powered and it stopped working after 6 months. I did like the different attachments it came with. I think the plastic gear inside stripped out.</li>
            <li> I have used this type of groomer in the past for the annoying peach fuzz I have along my hairline.&lt;br /&gt;This Wahl is better than my previous groomer!</li>
            <li> Works ok but it pulls hair once in a while. Other than that it does the job. I think I&#x27;ll keep it!</li>
            <li> My teenager son uses it daily ! Works great for him! He says it is very handy and precise!! Great Christmas gift for him! Now my other son would like one!!</li>
            <li> Bought the same item twice thinking it was my issue versus the device. Nope, it&#x27;s  just poorly crafted. Breaks quickly  within only 2 light uses.</li>
            <li> Trying to install the battery was a nightmare. I thought it was scam after 30 minutes of trying to figure out where it went. But the whole bottom half piece comes off. Snap the trimmer on before pulling on the bottom half of the device.</li>
            <li> My husband had this trimmer for about 10 years and it just recently died. He loved it so much that he insisted that I get the same one. He uses it for trimming nose hairs and other facial hair. Obviously, his favorite for a long time- great product!</li>
            <li> As advertised- It&#x27;s the first micro groomer that I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Best I&#x27;ve tried in the past 10 years.</li>
            <li> Garbage.  The plastic drive system didn&#x27;t work at all.  Threw it away after a month</li>
            <li> Love this best trimmer made</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of trimmers like this, and so far this is the best. Doesnt cut quite as well as some, but is FAR more reliable and well made.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace my old trimmer. It comes apart in my hand during use &amp; it doesn&#x27;t seem to get the job done like my older one. I&#x27;m using it till I find something better. At times it doesn&#x27;t even feel like it removed anything.</li>
            <li> Not quite heavy duty enough but it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> worked pretty good the first time.&lt;br /&gt;for some reason the trimmer applicator seemed to open a bit and the actual rotating motor inside did not hook onto the trimmer anymore so all it did was make noise. The blades were not being moved so it did not work after that.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t ask for anything more from a personal trimmer.  Ear and nose hair don&#x27;t stand a chance.  A little louder than my old Panasonic but cuts well.</li>
            <li> Arrived DOA, Amazon didn&#x27;t want it shipped back, said to trash it. I&#x27;ve bought several of these, they usually last a couple months before dying.</li>
            <li> My nose hair is annoyingly long. It was itchy, it was out there, and it had to go.&lt;br /&gt;I felt like an old man buying this product, but I don&#x27;t regret it.&lt;br /&gt;A properly trimmed nose is more important than my ego.&lt;br /&gt;10/10 would recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Fun fact: You may or may not cause your fellow housemates immense joy due to your laughter from the tickling sensation when using this product. Or maybe I&#x27;m just really sensitive. But still.)</li>
            <li> Unlike similar products, the body is made of anodized aluminum, not plastic.  Compact, easy to change trim heads, and to operate.  It&#x27;s small and light enough so that even the smallest hands can operate it without any problem.  It does exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Ours didn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> This little thing can trim everything. Although I&#x27;m not so fond of the product description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some things to note:&lt;br /&gt;- Unlike the picture, the color of this trimmer is closer to ivory. But no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;- Entire body is waterproof. You can take it in the shower then put it under running water to clean effortlessly.&lt;br /&gt;- Initial assembly, especially putting in the batteries, is kind of tricky. You just gotta get the right grab and pull its guts out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing iffy about this product is that it advertises to be \\&quot;lithium powered.\\&quot; Huh? Unless I&#x27;m missing something, the lithium just refers to the AAA battery. Equivalent statement would be \\&quot;battery powered.\\&quot; It confused me a little bit because I thought this trimmer was powered by lithium-ion rechargeables which this is NOT. Doesn&#x27;t bother me much, but it&#x27;s still a bit of false advertising I would say. Maybe not. Maybe it&#x27;s just me but be aware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, great trimmer at an affordable price. Recommended. Once you get past the little-bit tricky assembly, you&#x27;ll love the functionality of this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this trying to find a decent small trimmer (most of them are junk)  From the reviews I was hoping this was a good one. I used it once and the serrated trimmer head (the one shown in the product picture, which is the one I usually use) broke and won&#x27;t trim.  If I take it off the trimmer and turn the trimmer on it runs, but when I put the head on it won&#x27;t run.  So - another pice of junk.</li>
            <li> One month later, it stopped working. Cheap, flimsy construction, and even when it was working, the quality of the trimming was quite mediocre.</li>
            <li> For the cost I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but was pleasently suprised at how well it works. Easy to use and clean up.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several clippers of this type over the years, but this one is by far the best.  It is powerful and feels substantial and is much better than those advertised on TV and elsewhere.  Wahl has been making hair grooming products for years and this item shows the results of that experience.  I highly recommend this hair clipper.</li>
            <li> A superb personal grooming product that simply works and is absolutely pain-free.  I can enthusiastically recommend this product to anyone considering such a purchase.</li>
            <li> I was tired of using cheap $5 trimmers and I wanted something made with higher quality parts, so I made the mistake of assuming because the Wahl cost much more, it must be of higher quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a very thin tin sleeve that slides over the case and gives it a tiny bit of heft and a slightly more refined feel in the hand.  Otherwise it is precisely identical to any number of other, much cheaper trimmers I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a panel that covers the reciprocating blade assembly, which, as it turns out, is the same as my last trimmer.  The way I discovered this is the panel on the Wahl simply fell off one day, about two weeks after I bought it.  I put it back, but it was not a snug fit and routinely fell off after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reciprocating assembly would also become misaligned, and I&#x27;d have to fiddle with it to get the trimmer working again.  This got old very quickly, so I just put a new battery in my old trimmer, and it works just fine.  Save your money and buy a $5 unit, chances are it will serve you just as well, if not better.</li>
            <li> It is a good nose hair trimmer im not gonna lie. it gets all the hair trimmed and im not afraid to be embarrassed by a nose hair that is pocking out</li>
            <li> Seems ok. A little loud, feels kinda flimsy, but it works.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  We both use it and it does what it says.  No danger of cutting.  The package is solid but not very convenient for storage with the instructions.  Too bad it is not made in the USA.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for an example of the atrocious JUNK that China is dumping on the US market this would be exhibit A.</li>
