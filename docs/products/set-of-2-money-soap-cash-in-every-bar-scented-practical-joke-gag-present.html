            <li>Ordered 2 soaps as gifts for 10 year old boys.</li>

            <li> I bought this as stocking stuffers for the family.  Kept one for myself.  Everyone loved it.  I bought it for the money mystery but after using it I really like the scent. I would buy it to use all the time but the price is too high.  It&#x27;s the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.  Lower the price and I will be a regular buyer.</li>
            <li> Bought these as stocking stuffers for my roommates and they were a hit! They are working on getting to that money inside! The soap smells amazing too.</li>
            <li> It is a really good idea. My son loved it but the money was to close to the edge so he got it out after just a couple uses. It was only a dollar.</li>
            <li> was the hit of the grandkids christmas</li>
            <li> This soap was bit expensive but worth it to get my teen boy into the shower!!!  and it smells fantastic!!</li>
            <li> The smell is wonderful, but I was a bit sad at the amount that we found in our first bar.  These were a fantastic stocking stuffer though for the older kids</li>
            <li> My son enjoyed getting these for Christmas! I don&#x27;t think he has ever taken so many showers just trying to get the money!! Loved the soap, smelled really good too! Thank you1</li>
            <li> A HUGE hit with the grandkids!  The 15 yr. old told his mom he wanted to &amp;#34;go home and take a 4 hour shower&amp;#34;!  LOL  A couple of them were impatient and slit the soap open to reveal the cash.  All received $1 bills in their soap, but they still clamoured for me to &amp;#34;get it for us next year too!&amp;#34;.  I hope I can FIND it next year!</li>
            <li> Great gag gift, the soap smells wonderful, and the user gets free money for staying clean!  You can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
            <li> Great for a stocking stuffer! I did purchase one for myself, I only got a dollar in it, BUT the soap smelled really good so it was worth it in my eyes. My only complaint is that once it gets to about a week of use, FYI I just put mine in our bathroom by the sink for hand washing, I felt like it was starting to come apart and then a couple days later it split open and the little money packet fell out. Would have been cooler if it stayed together longer.</li>
            <li> The soap split in half during the first use and the money was retrieved right away.  This was exciting for the kids but I was hoping it would last a bit longer</li>
            <li> really enjoyed this product didn&#x27;t have to wait long for shipment and I liked that this was the way it was described.</li>
            <li> Ordered 2 soaps as gifts for 10 year old boys. Thought this to be a great gift idea! Regular sized bar.  Nice smelling, clean scent.</li>
            <li> I bought these as a stocking stuffer this last Christmas and my kids thought it was great.  The soap actually smells good too.&lt;br /&gt;My youngest didn&#x27;t want to take the time to wait until the bar was worn enough to get the money out, but was still enthused about finding money in the middle of it.  Great gift for the kids.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing and kids LOVE it!!!</li>
            <li> Do you have a teenage boy at home who eschews showering? These bars of soap are miracle cures for the unwashed masses. My brother scrubbed himself until he got the money out. I don&#x27;t care how much it costs; I&#x27;m buying these sweet little things until he decides to start washing of his own accord.</li>
            <li> These were stocking stuffers for the men and they were like little kids when they opened them.&lt;br /&gt;They had so much fun teasing each other about who was going to get the most money etc. One said he was going to hide it from his roommates so they wouldn&#x27;t get it and take the money. My oldest son took his on the road with him, called last night and raved about the soap itself. He loves the scent, said it lathers up real nice and feels good on his skin. He said it&#x27;s a real good quality soap. I almost wasn&#x27;t going to purchase this item but am so glad I did. It was worth it just to have the fun of watching them act like little boys again with a hidden treasure. This just might become a Christmas tradition, soap in the stocking!</li>
            <li> Great gag gift for the holiday.  Will probably buy again because the soap appears to be good quality.  Money comes in a pouch - have no idea what denomination yet.</li>
            <li> I bought these for stocking stuffers this year! Everybody loved them and they smelled nice.</li>
            <li> Only got $1 in BOTH bars. Fun, but what a waste.</li>
            <li> Bought them for my grandchildren and they loved the idea that there was money inside and they had no idea how much,  They both had one dollar.  I would recommend these in the bathroom because kids will wash their hands sfaithfully, waiting to get to the money.  Cheryl</li>
            <li> I bought this soap for a Christmas gift for my kids. They didn&#x27;t like the way the soap smelled. They ran water over the bar to shrink it to get the dollar so the soap was never used.</li>
            <li> They smell so good! Only dollar bills though. Too pricey to only have a dollar in it. I got 2 of them. Both only had a dollar. :(</li>
