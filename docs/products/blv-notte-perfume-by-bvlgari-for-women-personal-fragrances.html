            <li>Always thought the Americans are very lucky to have access to all these wonderful products at such reasonable prices.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this one.</li>
            <li>The smell is fantastic and so is the price.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was free and the package got to me in 3-4 days.</li>
            <li>I can put on a perfume that I think smells wonderful and have a migraine after a few minutes, but not with this product.  </li>
            <li>The smell is clean and light.  </li>
            <li>It is light, a bit of vanilla but not too sweet.</li>
            <li>and I was excited to find it for such a nice price!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s different and still remarkable.</li>
            <li>I was all too excited when I found the scent on Amazon.</li>
            <li>My sinuses are very sensitive to strong smells and to many perfumes.  </li>
            <li>I choose five stars for the quick, efficient, friendly service.</li>
            <li>Full my expectatativas with respect to the product.</li>
            <li>Very feminine and others love it too.</li>
            <li>A grower and definitely worth sampling.</li>
            <li>The men in my office love that it is classy but not overwhelmig.</li>
            <li>It smells so good on me &amp; other&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I am still on my guest for that just right fragrance that has my name on it.</li>
            <li>really keeps things interesting when a woman couldn&#x27;t smell me from afar and with cologne its proper to wear them lightly.</li>
            <li>This perfume smells wonderful and is not so overwhelming that it makes me sick</li>
            <li>Total strangers comment on this scent and they all agree that it smells elegant.</li>
            <li>Bulgari Blu is the epitome of an utterly grown up, sophisticated fragrance.</li>
            <li>I first found this fragrance in a shop in Disney.  </li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t smell like my first one that I got from a department store.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product was exactly what I was hoping it would be.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is exactly the product that my friend was waiting</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first thing that jumps out is a dryness that is at once sensual and contemporary.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Blu is the soul of subtlety and stays very close to the body.</li>
            <li>The very aloofness of Blu transforms it into an invitation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blu is approprite for day or night and any season.  </li>
            <li>and if it&#x27;d be the real product.</li>
            <li>and we looked at various different malls and found it on amazon to be the most economical.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended as a gift!</li>
            <li>It is very different, soft but has an exotic aroma.  </li>
            <li>It really looks new.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is chic and urbane, the sleek, deep blue bottle is a metaphor for elegant simplicity.</li>
            <li>a scent to match her cool, somewhat remote but absolutely irresistable charm.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I took a change on this one and thought at least it would have a nice lingering smell.</li>
            <li>This cologne is now one of my Mother&#x27;s new favorites.</li>
            <li>Some very light florals (jasmine is definitely in the mix), a slight woody note, and just the merest hint of musk emerge after it&#x27;s had time to sit on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It compels people to get very close, luring them nearer and nearer in order to track down its intriguing and elusive scent.</li>
            <li>I frequently get asked what I am wearing, when this is the scent I chose that day.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The fragrance deepens and becomes more complex as you wear it.</li>
            <li>My ex girlfriend went wild when we were up close</li>
            <li>The smell is okay, but does not last but a few moments.</li>
            <li>I was a little nervous about ordering perfume like this, but it is as you would buy it in the store in the original packaging.</li>
            <li>It is very fresh and delicate and stays on for  along while.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s subtle enough to be smelled when I&#x27;m close by but not so strong</li>
            <li>the smell is soft and stays on you all day long.</li>

            <li> It is very long lasting and works for both day and night.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far I have not been disappointed with any Bulgari fragrance I have tried but this scent is at the top of the list.</li>
            <li> I usually end up having to change and shower after trying something new.  </li>
            <li> A few extra sprays in the winter makes it last all night long.  </li>
            <li> I get compliments every single time I wear it.</li>
            <li> It is dark, mysterious.</li>
            <li> It was a shame because when my friend opened the box, the bottle was almost empty.</li>
            <li> Delivery was not fast, but I think it had to come ground because it&#x27;s perfume.</li>
            <li> and she thinks they are not original because they don&#x27;t smell the same as the other one she already has.</li>
            <li> youll never beat this price in amazon compared to other stores....</li>
            <li> She already knew that she wanted this so it came down to how soon could we receive it if we order it online</li>
            <li> Wears close to the skin and could be worn every day, provided you don&#x27;t mind people mistaking your perfume for alcoholic drinks.</li>
            <li> The scent is dark and sensual with base notes of irish, dark chocolate and vodka.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately she was not happy with the perfums, because they don&#x27;t have the same smell</li>
            <li> Subtle, earthy scent, almost anyone could pull it off.  </li>
            <li> So why do they insist on that silly pretentious spelling.</li>
            <li> not happy</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s really disappointing considering&lt;br</li>
            <li> it´s gone, really bad permanence.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the cost. :(</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this purchase.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this perfum as a gift for my sister. She lives in Brazil, so I was there and finaly could give her perfums.  Unfortunately she was not happy with the perfums, because they don&#x27;t have the same smell and she thinks they are not original because they don&#x27;t smell the same as the other one she already has. I am very disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> the perfume comes very nicely pack. the smell is soft and stays on you all day long. if you want to refresh and put it on again it don&#x27;t overcomes the smell.&lt;br /&gt;the perfume is very nice thank you. love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume as a gift. It was a shame because when my friend opened the box, the bottle was almost empty.</li>
            <li> A very sensual &amp; erotic scent. I have tried Blv many times, but it never spoke to me. This one does. It is dark, mysterious. It&#x27;s got a bit of a boozy note. Seems to me like drinking champagne in bed. I really enjoy this one. Wears close to the skin and could be worn every day, provided you don&#x27;t mind people mistaking your perfume for alcoholic drinks. A grower and definitely worth sampling. I like it, but not even to rebuy it.</li>
            <li> I have received many compliments on this fragrance. It is light, a bit of vanilla but not too sweet. I am going to order more for friends.</li>
            <li> This cologne is now one of my Mother&#x27;s new favorites. Total strangers comment on this scent and they all agree that it smells elegant.</li>
            <li> My wife was elated to receive this gift...and I was excited to find it for such a nice price!  Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> The packaging is great. It really looks new. The smell is really great. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love a good fragrance and this is one of the best.  It&#x27;s easily my favorite and my go to scent for any occasion. I frequently get asked what I am wearing, when this is the scent I chose that day.&lt;br /&gt;So far I have not been disappointed with any Bulgari fragrance I have tried but this scent is at the top of the list.</li>
            <li> This is a scent I will buy over and over again.  The smell is clean and light.  I receive many compliments!</li>
            <li> This parfum is the most exquisite one I ever have used.  It is very fresh and delicate and stays on for  along while.  I receive lots of compliments about how I good smell when I use Notte.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect fragrance for those who doesn´t like sweety smell. It&#x27;s different and still remarkable. I love it!</li>
            <li> Bulgari Blu is the epitome of an utterly grown up, sophisticated fragrance. This, I imagine, is what Audrey Hepburn might wear...a scent to match her cool, somewhat remote but absolutely irresistable charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing that jumps out is a dryness that is at once sensual and contemporary. The fragrance deepens and becomes more complex as you wear it. Some very light florals (jasmine is definitely in the mix), a slight woody note, and just the merest hint of musk emerge after it&#x27;s had time to sit on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blu is the soul of subtlety and stays very close to the body. It compels people to get very close, luring them nearer and nearer in order to track down its intriguing and elusive scent. This, I think, is the purpose of perfume...not to sledgehammer bystanders into submission. The very aloofness of Blu transforms it into an invitation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blu is approprite for day or night and any season.  But be warned:  despite its subtlety (or maybe because of it), wearing Blu is just asking for some neck nuzzling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing is puzzling though.  The fragrance is chic and urbane, the sleek, deep blue bottle is a metaphor for elegant simplicity. So why do they insist on that silly pretentious spelling. Blv?  Come on, Bvlgari. Get over yourself.</li>
            <li> Was worried about the condition this would come in and if it&#x27;d be the real product. It was, box arrived unopened with the plastic wrapping. Good!</li>
            <li> This is another beautifully bottle perfume.  The smell is fantastic and so is the price.  My friend assists me in bringing the product to Singapore on the trip here.  Always thought the Americans are very lucky to have access to all these wonderful products at such reasonable prices.</li>
            <li> I wanted to buy this for my wife on her birthday and we looked at various different malls and found it on amazon to be the most economical. She already knew that she wanted this so it came down to how soon could we receive it if we order it online and amazon did a great job as always. Planning to buy a couple more of these for friends and relatives.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Bvlgari and was said to see they stopped carrying Notte.  The chocolate notes are so alluring. I was all too excited when I found the scent on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Bulgari BLV Notte  has discontinued this product in stores. I love the fragrance was glad I could still get it online.</li>
            <li> This perfume is just what I wanted and I got it for a great price. Amazon is definitely the way to go if you are looking to purchase this item!! The shipping was free and the package got to me in 3-4 days. Thank you for an outstanding service!!</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about ordering perfume like this, but it is as you would buy it in the store in the original packaging. I ordered two of them, and have not opened them, as they are gifts. The service was smooth, and the seller was easy to contact. Delivery was not fast, but I think it had to come ground because it&#x27;s perfume.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality. Recommended!</li>
            <li> I first found this fragrance in a shop in Disney.  I couldn&#x27;t get it in the local stores and found it on Amazon.  It&#x27;s one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> Nice scent perfect for work and I would order again from this supplier.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t even explain how much i love this fragrance. My ex girlfriend went wild when we were up close and i would get good complements after a hug. really keeps things interesting when a woman couldn&#x27;t smell me from afar and with cologne its proper to wear them lightly.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t smell like my first one that I got from a department store.&lt;br /&gt;It was a birthday gift from me to me .....not happy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this perfume before at T.J. Maxx and it was quite&lt;br /&gt;a bit more potent than this bottle. That&#x27;s really disappointing considering&lt;br /&gt;the cost. :(</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume!  It&#x27;s perfect in the summer and divine in the winter.  A few extra sprays in the winter makes it last all night long.  The scent is dark and sensual with base notes of irish, dark chocolate and vodka.  YUM!  I get compliments every single time I wear it.</li>
            <li> Really good fragance, but when i get to my destination (party, dinner, etc) it´s gone, really bad permanence. For me...keep winning Montblanc</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have bought this perfume.  It is very different, soft but has an exotic aroma.  It is very long lasting and works for both day and night.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift to my sister-in-law, he liked the fragrance ! So I am glad I got it!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this perfume for my mom as a Christmas gift. It was such a great price and it is her favorite perfume! I will be ordering another bottle when she runs out</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scnets, can&#x27;t even find in the store anymore, and very good price through amazon.  Subtle, earthy scent, almost anyone could pull it off.  If you like flowery perfumes, stay away from this one.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my girlfriend&#x27;s birthday, and she absolutely loved it. In fact, she bought a second one. Highly recommended as a gift!</li>
            <li> This perfume smells really great very elegant, smelling not overpowering and great price...youll never beat this price in amazon compared to other stores....I get a lot compliment from patients and colleagues.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a BVLGARI fragrance that has a just showered smell. I took a change on this one and thought at least it would have a nice lingering smell. NOT! The smell is okay, but does not last but a few moments. I am still on my guest for that just right fragrance that has my name on it. Oh well!</li>
            <li> This is the only perfume I wear. The men in my office love that it is classy but not overwhelmig. wished It came in a powder for the summer whe it get too warm. I always feel wonderful wearing this.</li>
            <li> I choose five stars for the quick, efficient, friendly service. The product was exactly what I was hoping it would be.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume spray. I would definitely buy again. I love the smell. Would recommend this spray to others.......the end.</li>
            <li> Full my expectatativas with respect to the product.</li>
            <li> Received a great price in Amazon for this perfume.  Bought it as a gift for my wife.  Doesn&#x27;t smell as good as I thought-it was recommended to me, but it&#x27;s more that it&#x27;s just not my preference vs the product itself.  Saved a lot of money at the time on this and was shipped in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazingly beautiful! I can&#x27;t imagine wearing anything else. It&#x27;s floral with no woodsiness or spicyness. Very feminine and others love it too.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  My sinuses are very sensitive to strong smells and to many perfumes.  I have to try a perfume in the store and go home to make sure I can wear it.  I usually end up having to change and shower after trying something new.  I can put on a perfume that I think smells wonderful and have a migraine after a few minutes, but not with this product.  This perfume smells wonderful and is not so overwhelming that it makes me sick and it&#x27;s subtle enough to be smelled when I&#x27;m close by but not so strong you can smell me a mile away.  I would purchase this product again and again.</li>
            <li> What can I say except that I love this fragrance! It smells so good on me &amp; other&#x27;s are happily receptive of this scent. Love, love, love Bulgari!</li>
            <li> So happy to have found it!!!</li>
            <li> This is exactly the product that my friend was waiting</li>
