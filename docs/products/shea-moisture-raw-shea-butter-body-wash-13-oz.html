            <li> Only need a small bit too so a little goes a long way in the shower.</li>
            <li> but since buying the first bottle we have been unable to find it again.</li>
            <li> This was watered down.</li>
            <li> The scent is not overpowering, you can&#x27;t even tell you&#x27;ve used scented body wash after you&#x27;ve dried off.</li>
            <li> Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter Body Wash provides hydration to the skin.</li>
            <li> The product is usually THICK.</li>
            <li> and you need a very small amount</li>
            <li> some ingredient in it made me get a rash :(</li>
            <li> BOY, WAS I WRONG!!</li>
            <li> However, Amazons price is outrageous.  </li>

            <li> I decided to try this after I bought the hand cream and body lotionâ€¦.wow is what I want to say. I have sensitive skin and usually my body does not agree with too much but this soap is all natural organic products. After using it, I felt clean and pampered.</li>
            <li> I was looking at this in Target today thinking about buying it. I didn&#x27;t buy because I was sure it would be cheaper here. BOY, WAS I WRONG!! Will buy elsewhere.</li>
            <li> This was watered down. The product is usually THICK. Only buy in store going forward....</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this body wash and how it feels so silky when u wash with it. But I can no longer use it bc some ingredient in it made me get a rash :(</li>
            <li> my daughter loves this body wash! Keeps her skin smooth and smells divine especially when used with the raw shea butter</li>
            <li> Smells good, good, really good. Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter Body Wash provides hydration to the skin. Excellent product. I highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> This is creamy and smells real lovely! The lather is rich &amp; substantial. I believe this will be a sample in my arsenal. Cleans well w/o the sulfates &amp; parabens.</li>
            <li> I bought this as I love the scent and my skin isn&#x27;t dry after using, like some products can dry out your skin.  Only need a small bit too so a little goes a long way in the shower.</li>
            <li> Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter Body Wash makes my skin smooth and soft.  This 13oz bottle lasts a long time too because it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li> I like the product and will continue on buying it.  I found this is the store so I will just stock up</li>
            <li> My wife use this product and really enjoys it.</li>
            <li> Got my order the very next day so very happy with that. When u apply this soap to your skin it feels so silky and smooth. Just feels great. Cleans and smells great also. The only reason its not a 5 star is because price and it works like any other body soap. After I wash it off it doesn&#x27;t really make my skin feel super smooth but it didn&#x27;t dry out my skin either. i just expected a little more out of a Shea butter body soap. Other wise feels great when applying it to the skin. I may just use dove or Olay instead.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shower gel! My skin it very sensitive and usually red and itchy after shower. Not after this product! I love that it&#x27;s thick and you need a very small amount and it leathers so nice! The smell is great and not as fragranced as all those cheap pharmacy products. The price is a little higher but the quality is totally worth it. It will never dry out your skin! I&#x27;m on my second bottle and loving it!</li>
            <li> This Body Wash is great and I will re-order when needed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
            <li> This is a product I will continue to use and its worth the price!!  I Love it.!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the past 2 months and absolutely love it!  However, Amazons price is outrageous.  Get it at Target for 8.99!</li>
            <li> My family decided to start using natural body care and we found this at Wal-Mart but since buying the first bottle we have been unable to find it again. The scent is not overpowering, you can&#x27;t even tell you&#x27;ve used scented body wash after you&#x27;ve dried off. That is a big deal to me because I find frankincense and myrrh can be overpowering but this one is not. You&#x27;re body feels so soft afterwards. And the absolute bonus is that there are no harsh chemicals!!! For people with skin issues or auto immune disorders this is a great alternative to all the soaps and body washes out there on the market and the bonus is no harsh chemicals!</li>
            <li> Great product... Leaves your skin feeling silky.</li>
            <li> Winter in North Texas can wreak havoc on skin - dryness is very much a thing here.  This cleans without leaving my skin dry, and I love the fragrance. I&#x27;ve read elsewhere that this is considered an &amp;#34;ethnic&amp;#34; product - I see no reason for that. It&#x27;s a gentle formula that doesn&#x27;t have the chemical issues I run into with most other liquid soaps.</li>
