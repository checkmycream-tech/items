            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>This is a great product for pumping shampoo or conditioner into your hand.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve been through 2 now and the pump fits both and works great.</li>
            <li>However it has worked perfectly and makes the liters so easy to use.</li>

            <li>Works perfectly - just what I needed as I order hair products in large quantity to save money!  </li>
            <li>Although I might have been successful in finding &amp;#34;second hand&amp;#34; pumps from miscellaneous bottles, I am so glad I ordered these pumps for their corresponding shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>An efficient pump which perfectly fits the large refill Matrix shampoo bottle.</li>
            <li>I havent gotten a chance to use them yet (purchased 2) but they look like they are nice quality pumps</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have a pump for the shampoo, but a pain to not have one for the conditioner bottles.</li>
            <li>It makes it very easy in the shower.</li>
            <li>These make using the product very easy.</li>
            <li>They are great and will make bathing the kiddos so much easier!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought two of these.</li>

            <li>Thanks for the great product.</li>
            <li>I will probably be purchasing another for my conditioner :)</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like the pump when I ordered it.  </li>
            <li>This is perfect for the large bottles of Matrix shampoo and conditioner, but if you have purchased a supply of bottles that is of the older design, the pump doesn&#x27;t fit the cap.</li>
            <li>The pumps are perfect, the same color as the bottles, and, most importantly, provide just the right amount for each use.</li>
            <li>Read the fine print folks.  </li>
            <li>This pump doesn&#x27;t fit the 33.8 oz.</li>
            <li>Very useful.</li>
            <li>I have received pumps in the past that were defective, so I was worred about ordering online, but these are strong, good pumps!</li>
            <li>This was a much needed item at our house ..can&#x27;t tell you how many times we dropped the bottles in the shower.</li>
            <li>Fits right with the matrix 32 oz bottle, very useful</li>
            <li>Arrived so quick.</li>
            <li>Even though I use the large bottle to refill the standard size I find the pump a nice convenience to have.</li>
            <li>I bought this for some large shampoo bottles</li>
            <li>The pump makes it much easier in the shower to get the shampoo and conditioner from the large 33.8 oz.</li>
            <li>I do all my shopping with Amazon as much as I can.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Slooooooooowwwww shipping, which BTW is about as much as the pump itself.</li>
            <li>They are not white color, as in the picture, but they are light brown color.</li>
            <li>As long as you have the bottle this pump is intended to fit, however, it works well.  </li>
            <li>Arrived as promised and new in package as promised.</li>
            <li>They work well so far.</li>
            <li>The color of the lid that arrived was slightly beige, as opposed to the pure white of the bottle, but I can live with that.</li>

            <li> One of the shampoo / conditioner duos came from across the country (at least 2000 miles away), AND was much heavier (4-5 pounds).  </li>

            <li> Not much to say.</li>
            <li> push down on it</li>
            <li> The 4 pumps weighed less than 1 pound and came from a location between 200 to 300 miles from me.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid the shampoo might leak around it or be too thick for the pump.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought two of these. I will buy more when they are on sale. Very useful. Thanks for the great product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for pumping shampoo or conditioner into your hand.  It makes it very easy in the shower.</li>
            <li> These pumps for the large shampoo and conditioner are excellent, great price. Arrived so quick.Will be ordering again! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I havent gotten a chance to use them yet (purchased 2) but they look like they are nice quality pumps</li>
            <li> I do all my shopping with Amazon as much as I can. It&#x27;s the best one stop shopping place no matter what time it is.&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
            <li> Perfect fit for my Biolage liter bottles.  I checked around and this was the lowest price. They are great and will make bathing the kiddos so much easier!</li>
            <li> An efficient pump which perfectly fits the large refill Matrix shampoo bottle. Even though I use the large bottle to refill the standard size I find the pump a nice convenience to have.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly - just what I needed as I order hair products in large quantity to save money!  A great buy!</li>
            <li> Not clue why Matrix does not come with pumps. This works for Matrix Total Results bottles for both shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done. I bought this for some large shampoo bottles, I&#x27;ve been through 2 now and the pump fits both and works great. Awesome price. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The pump makes it much easier in the shower to get the shampoo and conditioner from the large 33.8 oz. liter bottles.</li>
            <li> Although I might have been successful in finding &amp;#34;second hand&amp;#34; pumps from miscellaneous bottles, I am so glad I ordered these pumps for their corresponding shampoo and conditioner.  The pumps are perfect, the same color as the bottles, and, most importantly, provide just the right amount for each use.</li>
            <li> This pump is sturdy and fits my Biologe 33.8 oz. bottle of shampoo.  The pump is not white and is not pearl colored.  I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a  pearly taupe.  Not what I expected, but it fits, it works and it&#x27;s built to last.  Slooooooooowwwww shipping, which BTW is about as much as the pump itself.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great! Fits right with the matrix 32 oz bottle, very useful I will probably be purchasing another for my conditioner :)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t pick up shampoo bottles, not squeeze them to get product out.  These make using the product very easy.</li>
            <li> Arrived as promised and new in package as promised. Works great! I have received pumps in the past that were defective, so I was worred about ordering online, but these are strong, good pumps!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this for the conditioner products! This pump doesn&#x27;t fit the 33.8 oz. conditioner bottles for Matrix products. It&#x27;s nice to have a pump for the shampoo, but a pain to not have one for the conditioner bottles.</li>
            <li> If your lid \\&quot;pops\\&quot; off instead of unscrewing, this won&#x27;t work for you.  As long as you have the bottle this pump is intended to fit, however, it works well.  The color of the lid that arrived was slightly beige, as opposed to the pure white of the bottle, but I can live with that.</li>
            <li> This was a much needed item at our house ..can&#x27;t tell you how many times we dropped the bottles in the shower.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for the large bottles of Matrix shampoo and conditioner, but if you have purchased a supply of bottles that is of the older design, the pump doesn&#x27;t fit the cap.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like the pump when I ordered it.  I was afraid the shampoo might leak around it or be too thick for the pump.  However it has worked perfectly and makes the liters so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Not much to say. push down on it shampoo or conditioner come out in a controlled manner. Works well for it&#x27;s intended use.</li>
            <li> I was looking for 4 pumps for shampoo / conditioner containers that I purchased.  I went with the seller that had all 4 that I needed.  I assumed that I would be charged one shipping price for doing so.  The four pumps were just as expensive as the shampoo / conditioner duos that I bought.  One of the shampoo / conditioner duos came from across the country (at least 2000 miles away), AND was much heavier (4-5 pounds).  The 4 pumps weighed less than 1 pound and came from a location between 200 to 300 miles from me.  Four pumps cost me close to $25.  Read the fine print folks.  I contacted the seller about the shipping and he offered to send me a couple of extra pumps.  What a joke.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these to use them with the Matrix shampoo and conditioner 33.8 oz bottles. They arrived in 4 days. They are not white color, as in the picture, but they are light brown color. This is not an issue for me. They work well so far. I hope they last a long time.</li>
