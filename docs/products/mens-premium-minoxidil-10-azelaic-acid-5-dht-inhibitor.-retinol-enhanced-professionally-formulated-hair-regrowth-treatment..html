    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I strongly recomend this product!!!!</li>
            <li>but I went with Perfect Image Solutions because of it&#x27;s bottle design.</li>
            <li>I must say I am totally impressed with this company and their product,very reliable!</li>
            <li>Its been a year and 2 months now since I been using the Minoxidil 10% with Azelaic Acid 5% DHT Inhibitor by Perfect Image Solutions., and it has changed my life.</li>
            <li>If I had a lot of money, I would invest in like a year supply of Perfect Image Solution Products.  </li>
            <li>this product and 15% concentrations of minoxidil have been banned by the oh so wonderful fda.</li>
            <li>It has a wonderful consistency.  </li>
            <li>1 reason is it might make your scalp more susceptible to \\&quot;SUNBURN\\&quot; WHAT?!?!?!</li>
            <li>&quot; photo because the \\&quot;after\\&quot; is amazing!!</li>
            <li>so I am happy.</li>
            <li>that sounds nice!</li>
            <li>the Company of Perfect Image Solutions,; It was pleasant to see the price drop to like $23/$24 with free shipping.</li>
            <li>hopefully it has good quality control.</li>
            <li>Anyway, good luck with yours, and</li>
            <li>The point is, tell yourself your a good person, regardless of how your appearance is.</li>
            <li>My ex girl that I was with for 5 years loved me for who I was, didn&#x27;t care how my teeth looked, my hair etc.</li>
            <li>Not quite sure, but shampoo smeels good though.  </li>
            <li>Furthermore, I just placed an order for my Father for a nice Christmas Gift, and myself.     </li>
            <li>Thanks Perfect Image Solutions.  </li>
            <li>I sure hope I&#x27;m not one of them.  </li>
            <li>When I purchased this product, I wasn&#x27;t sure of the amount of ounces.  </li>
            <li>The shipping weight that is listed indicates it is 7 ounces, but I didn&#x27;t see any indication if product was one month supply or more.</li>
            <li>Bottom line, if you don&#x27;t like the oily residue with many minoxidil products, you may want to stear away from this product.</li>
            <li>so I will be buying more.      </li>
            <li>Well, Been using this shampoo for more than a month.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re just thinning, may have better results.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you have a plan, and getting thousands of grafts</li>
            <li>I use it once a day on the top of my scalp.</li>
            <li>&amp; stop wasting time. :-)</li>
            <li>Hopefully they might give preferred customer discounts. :-)</li>
            <li>My hair looks thicker for sure.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Its great to take multivitamins anyways, along with what I highly recommend \\&quot; ACAI Berry Juice\\&quot; .</li>
            <li>It would be perfect otherwise although it seems to early to see how effective it really is.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t like any company that does not list a toll free number on its package and this product has no number period; this means to me that it may not be a reputable company...</li>
            <li>So far, I have seen some pretty good regrowth on the front, and some on top.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>i think anyone using these products is over the age of consent and able to decide if a product is \\&quot;dangerous\\&quot; or not to them and should be left to make their own decision.</li>
            <li>I will reserve my full judgment after using the product for 3 months.</li>
            <li>Also guys, if your worried about women wanting you to have more hair, just think about how much money women spend a year on beauty supplies, and so on to keep themselves looking how they want.</li>
            <li>But this little bottle did more than just look good.</li>
            <li>Your overall wellness will be amazing.</li>
            <li>this is a great product or waste my time.</li>
            <li>I have to assume that Rogain which has max of 5% is probably because the company thinks that 5% is the right amount.</li>
            <li>It destroys the collagen production in your face,  aging it by about 10 years within the first week or two of use in my case.  </li>
            <li>Lastly, the product makes claims that a higher dose of minoxidil works better than the 5%, but I have not seen any statements from FDA stating this to be the case.</li>
            <li>I was researching many different hair growth products, including Provillus which I almost bought a 6 month supply.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very thinned on top and lost hair in crown, back area.  </li>
            <li>Thanks very much.</li>
            <li>in all the  hundreds of reviews that i read about 15% minox positive and</li>
            <li>It is very easy to apply, dries quickly and does not smell nor stains which is a major plus compared to other products.</li>
            <li>I got huge bags under my eyes and deep gigantic wrinkles, though my hair did seem to start to fill in a bit.    </li>
            <li>but if you still have hair where you are applying it, you need to use it very sparingly.  </li>
            <li>This product works very well</li>
            <li>When 1 bottle alone if you use it right, and not crazy last you about a month.</li>
            <li>Many of reviews state it is non-greasy which prompted me to buy it since all the other products are oily (except for Rogain foam)but</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this product back in the summer of 2011.  </li>
            <li>the reason why there are so many favorable reviews for higher percentage minoxidil is because it ACTUALLY works and 5% simply doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>People smile at me, people talk to me, I do the same with confidence.</li>
            <li>The more procedurs done, the less and less donor area is available.  </li>
            <li>The product that is now being show along side my review is not the same product I bought (I bought the 15% Minoxidil in a blue bottle which seems to be no longer available???).</li>
            <li>Product was shipped in a very fast manner by the supplier, that was the only plus.</li>
            <li>When I first purchased this product, it was only $35 with shipping.  </li>
            <li>And never really completed a full transplant.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed some new thicker hair growth even near my hair line.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve Used the straight 15% Minoxidil for several months before getting this one with the DHT inhibitor.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The one with DHT left my hair much too greasy in feel and texture.  </li>
            <li>I hope you are not as sensitive like me.</li>
            <li>I can already see improvement, it definitely works and I will highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>many) hair transplants proceudres done over a span of time, which is not good.  </li>
            <li>true story used 15% minox twice a day all summer long and on a 2 week trip to the virgin islands where i spent all day every day on the beach and no sunburns on scalp or anywhere else.fda approved finasteride - side effect : impotence and testicular pain!</li>
            <li>with all the crazy products that ARE harmful to the public out there they decide to target a great product that actually WORKS and HELPS people!!</li>
            <li>My next orders however, I might order directly through perfectimagesolutions.com sometime.</li>
            <li>However, $199 was expensive for what I wanted to spend not knowing how effective it would be.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product since march 21 st of 2011 and have seen significant hair growth everywhere such as in the heavily damaged areas (crown of my head) and non damaged areas such as (my hair line).</li>
            <li>once did i come across a review that was neg that stated anything other than it didn&#x27;t work or complaints about the same exact side effects that you&#x27;d experience upon beginning 5% minox.</li>
            <li>The straight Minoxidil worked very well with hair thinning due to extreme weight loss.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product though is something less to be desired as it is very sticky and clumps the hair.  </li>

            <li> product came in time, as always  product in expected condition, as always  have been buying from this seller for the last 6 months  A+++</li>
            <li> In reality though, who cares what people think of you, as long as you care about yourself.</li>
            <li> not one reason they&#x27;ve listed would make 15% anymore harmful than 5% minox or a thousand other products out there, on the shelves of your local supermarket.</li>
            <li> A product with similar ingredients - Xandrax - has had it&#x27;s website shut down by the FDA.</li>
            <li> I tried again a few days later with 1/4 dose and did not have a problem.</li>
            <li> Not as greasy as some other products.</li>
            <li> Anyway, after a few hours wait, I ran back home with heavy doses of allergy pills, inflammation, and anti-itchy cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As for the product, it will only slow your hair loss.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps the company should use less propylene glycol.</li>
            <li> I have been using for about 2 and a half months now.</li>
            <li> While I was never totally bald, the hair loss was bad enough to be noticed.</li>
            <li> That is the time it usually takes to see NOTICABLE improvement I am told.</li>
            <li> Used the product for 4 days with less than recommended doses, my head started to have red bumps everywhere and itchy like crazy.</li>
            <li> Maybe it would do what it claims in time, but it is hard to apply.</li>
            <li> I am 40 now, and have been slowly losing my hair since I was around 23.</li>
            <li> However there is  one serious flaw that makes it unusable for me.  </li>
            <li> beyond ridiculous doesn&#x27;t even scratch the surface of these explanations.</li>
            <li> The doctor said minoxidil sometimes causes strange side effect to people, and my case is bad.</li>
            <li> After I put it on, my hair and scalp were greasy and my thin hair looked much worse.</li>
            <li> and it was getting worse in face.</li>
            <li> google the absurd reasoning for their banning of 15% minox.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a bad product</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve Used the straight 15% Minoxidil for several months before getting this one with the DHT inhibitor.  The straight Minoxidil worked very well with hair thinning due to extreme weight loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one with DHT left my hair much too greasy in feel and texture.  I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a bad product but if you still have hair where you are applying it, you need to use it very sparingly.  Even then, it may leave a residue.</li>
            <li> This product will probably grow some hair.  It has proven ingredients. However there is  one serious flaw that makes it unusable for me.  It destroys the collagen production in your face,  aging it by about 10 years within the first week or two of use in my case.  I got huge bags under my eyes and deep gigantic wrinkles, though my hair did seem to start to fill in a bit.    This is a known side effect of minoxidil but it is never mentioned in the standard side effect warnings.  I suppose if it  were no one would buy it and BigPharma would stop funding the FDA.  However just do a search on minoxidil and bags under the eyes or wrinkles and you will understand. Some people never recovered their youthful appearance after stopping.  I sure hope I&#x27;m not one of them.  Only time will tell...</li>
            <li> product came in time, as always  product in expected condition, as always  have been buying from this seller for the last 6 months  A+++</li>
            <li> When I purchased this product, I wasn&#x27;t sure of the amount of ounces.  The shipping weight that is listed indicates it is 7 ounces, but I didn&#x27;t see any indication if product was one month supply or more. It turns out it is only 2 ounces which is one month supply. Many of reviews state it is non-greasy which prompted me to buy it since all the other products are oily (except for Rogain foam)but this is not the case! After I put it on, my hair and scalp were greasy and my thin hair looked much worse. Perhaps the company should use less propylene glycol. I will go back to Rogain foam, which is cheaper and is not oily at all.  I also don&#x27;t like any company that does not list a toll free number on its package and this product has no number period; this means to me that it may not be a reputable company...hopefully it has good quality control. Lastly, the product makes claims that a higher dose of minoxidil works better than the 5%, but I have not seen any statements from FDA stating this to be the case. I have to assume that Rogain which has max of 5% is probably because the company thinks that 5% is the right amount. I do like the fact that this product has retinol in it. Bottom line, if you don&#x27;t like the oily residue with many minoxidil products, you may want to stear away from this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and seems to be working. I&#x27;ve noticed some new thicker hair growth even near my hair line. It is very easy to apply, dries quickly and does not smell nor stains which is a major plus compared to other products. However, it dries my hair and scalp to a point that I cannot apply it and go so I put it on at night and rinse it off in the morning. It would be perfect otherwise although it seems to early to see how effective it really is.</li>
            <li> Wish I had taken a \\&quot;before\\&quot; photo because the \\&quot;after\\&quot; is amazing!! I can actually feel the wind in my hair again. This product works very well and I&#x27;m still on the firts bottle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want mislead anyone about the product, but I think I had already seen hair growth after two weeks of use...so I am happy. I will reserve my full judgment after using the product for 3 months. That is the time it usually takes to see NOTICABLE improvement I am told. The bottle does last for about a month...so I will be buying more.      ****UPDATE*** The product that is now being show along side my review is not the same product I bought (I bought the 15% Minoxidil in a blue bottle which seems to be no longer available???). I guess when the company updates their products on Amazon, the pictures and name of the product also changes on the reviews?</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this product back in the summer of 2011.  When I first purchased this product, it was only $35 with shipping.  Now, these companies have doubled the price, taking advantage of people that are losing their hair.  As for the product, it will only slow your hair loss.  I&#x27;m 25 and started using this product when my hair began thinning.  It did not regrow any hair for me; it just slowed the hair loss process.  I&#x27;ve been using minoxidil for over a year now and I&#x27;m still going bald.  If I didn&#x27;t feel like I was being taken advantage of, I would still use this product.  Even though I&#x27;m just delaying the inevitable.</li>
            <li> Used the product for 4 days with less than recommended doses, my head started to have red bumps everywhere and itchy like crazy. Stopped using it for 5 days, but problem did not go away and it was getting worse in face. Drove myself to the emergency room since my eyes and ears got swollen all the sudden. The doctor said minoxidil sometimes causes strange side effect to people, and my case is bad. Anyway, after a few hours wait, I ran back home with heavy doses of allergy pills, inflammation, and anti-itchy cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cannot tell if it would work for me at the end or not, since I am not planning to use this anymore. If I could start all over again, would have tried the lowest minoxidil % and tested a small area first. Anyway, good luck with yours, and I hope you are not as sensitive like me.</li>
            <li> I was in urgent need of the product.  The product arrived in record   time and met my need.    Thanks very much.</li>
            <li> I bought this product 2 weeks ago and I see results on my hairline that I was loosing. I strongly recomend this product!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been suffering with alopecia since the age of nine, and was instructed by my dermatologist to purchase Rogain brand Minoxidil but I went with Perfect Image Solutions because of it&#x27;s bottle design. But this little bottle did more than just look good. I have been using this product since march 21 st of 2011 and have seen significant hair growth everywhere such as in the heavily damaged areas (crown of my head) and non damaged areas such as (my hair line). I must say I am totally impressed with this company and their product,very reliable!</li>
            <li> Well, Been using this shampoo for more than a month.  Is it growing hair? Not quite sure, but shampoo smeels good though.  Taking it along with their Minoxidil 10% with 5% Azelaic Acid.  I&#x27;m very thinned on top and lost hair in crown, back area.  If you&#x27;re just thinning, may have better results.  I&#x27;ve had many(too many) hair transplants proceudres done over a span of time, which is not good.  And never really completed a full transplant.  The more procedurs done, the less and less donor area is available.  SO BEWARE WHEN LOOKING INTO TRANSPLANTS. Make sure you have a plan, and getting thousands of grafts (2k - 3 k) done in one vist.</li>
            <li> My hair seems to be thicker.  I think so as does my beautician.  I use it once a day on the top of my scalp.</li>
            <li> I have been using 2% minoxidil for years and started using this product recently. I can already see improvement, it definitely works and I will highly recommend it. Not as greasy as some other products.</li>
            <li> I was researching many different hair growth products, including Provillus which I almost bought a 6 month supply. However, $199 was expensive for what I wanted to spend not knowing how effective it would be. Its great to take multivitamins anyways, along with what I highly recommend \\&quot; ACAI Berry Juice\\&quot; . Your overall wellness will be amazing. Its been a year and 2 months now since I been using the Minoxidil 10% with Azelaic Acid 5% DHT Inhibitor by Perfect Image Solutions., and it has changed my life. I haven&#x27;t even wrote a review on this, because I&#x27;m not trying to convince the world this is a great product or waste my time. I know it works, and I have seen results, and I no longer shave my head. I used to keep my head shaved for 3 years or so. People smile at me, people talk to me, I do the same with confidence. In reality though, who cares what people think of you, as long as you care about yourself. People today, are focused on an image, an image that has to meet there standards, or what they would like it to meet. The point is, tell yourself your a good person, regardless of how your appearance is. Always know that people care about you for who you are. Also guys, if your worried about women wanting you to have more hair, just think about how much money women spend a year on beauty supplies, and so on to keep themselves looking how they want. My ex girl that I was with for 5 years loved me for who I was, didn&#x27;t care how my teeth looked, my hair etc. \\&quot;Guys, find a women who isn&#x27;t focused on just your image!! What I can say as well is, give this product a try! &amp; stop wasting time. :-) If I had a lot of money, I would invest in like a year supply of Perfect Image Solution Products.  You can also think about how much of your money goes to waste, on things you don&#x27;t need. When 1 bottle alone if you use it right, and not crazy last you about a month. Furthermore, I just placed an order for my Father for a nice Christmas Gift, and myself.     Thanks Perfect Image Solutions.  Clint Burford      P.S.  \\&quot;To the Company of Perfect Image Solutions,; It was pleasant to see the price drop to like $23/$24 with free shipping. My next orders however, I might order directly through perfectimagesolutions.com sometime. Hopefully they might give preferred customer discounts. :-)</li>
            <li> I have been using for about 2 and a half months now. I use this 2 times a day, and in the afternoon, I sometimes use 5% minoxidil. So far, I have seen some pretty good regrowth on the front, and some on top. My hair looks thicker for sure. I will continue to be using this for at least the next year to see how much thicker my hair will get.     I am 40 now, and have been slowly losing my hair since I was around 23. While I was never totally bald, the hair loss was bad enough to be noticed. Especially in photos.     If you are thinking about using this, I say go for it. It works.</li>
            <li> Product was shipped in a very fast manner by the supplier, that was the only plus. The product though is something less to be desired as it is very sticky and clumps the hair.  I stopped using for this reason alone.  Maybe it would do what it claims in time, but it is hard to apply.</li>
            <li> this product and 15% concentrations of minoxidil have been banned by the oh so wonderful fda. with all the crazy products that ARE harmful to the public out there they decide to target a great product that actually WORKS and HELPS people!! i think anyone using these products is over the age of consent and able to decide if a product is \\&quot;dangerous\\&quot; or not to them and should be left to make their own decision. google the absurd reasoning for their banning of 15% minox. 1 reason is it might make your scalp more susceptible to \\&quot;SUNBURN\\&quot; WHAT?!?!?! oh the horror! true story used 15% minox twice a day all summer long and on a 2 week trip to the virgin islands where i spent all day every day on the beach and no sunburns on scalp or anywhere else.fda approved finasteride - side effect : impotence and testicular pain! yeah that sounds nice! in all the  hundreds of reviews that i read about 15% minox positive and negative(mostly positive!)not once did i come across a review that was neg that stated anything other than it didn&#x27;t work or complaints about the same exact side effects that you&#x27;d experience upon beginning 5% minox. NOTHING about sunburns or systemic issues. if anybody got a sunburn TRY SUNBLOCK! then again take a look at the chemical ingredients on the back of a bottle of sunblock and try to pronounce the names. i&#x27;ve got it! ban spf&#x27;s and people just stay in the shade. beyond ridiculous doesn&#x27;t even scratch the surface of these explanations. not one reason they&#x27;ve listed would make 15% anymore harmful than 5% minox or a thousand other products out there, on the shelves of your local supermarket. could $ be a motivating factor?? hmmm? don&#x27;t know, just saying! the reason why there are so many favorable reviews for higher percentage minoxidil is because it ACTUALLY works and 5% simply doesn&#x27;t. what a joke!</li>
            <li> This gave me a severe headache and nausea for 4 hours after one application. I have been taking 5% minoxidil for 10+ years with no headaches or problems. I have no known allergies to medications. A product with similar ingredients - Xandrax - has had it&#x27;s website shut down by the FDA. I feel this product should come with a warning to try smaller doses. Nothing in the insert mentioned possible severe headaches. I tried again a few days later with 1/4 dose and did not have a problem.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It has a wonderful consistency.  Not at all greasy like the Rogaine products.  It is easy to apply and dries quickly.</li>
