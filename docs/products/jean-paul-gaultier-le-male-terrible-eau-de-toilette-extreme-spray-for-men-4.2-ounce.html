            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I should have read the description better.</li>
            <li>Price is much better than retail stores.</li>
            <li>but this is one of my favorite all time</li>
            <li>and i am looking forward of buying one more</li>
            <li>But this is supposedly more concentrated,??  </li>
            <li>and i am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This was for a birthday present &amp; He loved it!!!</li>
            <li>Lovely bottle.</li>
            <li>the product.&lt;br /&gt;Was this a returned item that was not checked out before it was sealed up and sent to me?&lt;br /&gt;I would expect more...</li>
            <li>The bottle is unique, its in a class of its own.</li>
            <li>The smell is... just no way to explain it, its amazing hands down the best jean paul colonge, much better than the orginal.</li>
            <li>Packaging was perfect,  the bottle looks authentic but the smell seems to be a little off.</li>
            <li>The vanilla dominates this part, but the spices/woods are still easy to smell.</li>
            <li>Love this cool smell</li>
            <li>First bottle purchased on Amazon was absolutely perfect, with the same fragrance and potency as the store.  </li>
            <li>It is lightly fruity with a strong woody aroma.  </li>
            <li>It is perfect for any occassion I just wished it lasted a little longer</li>
            <li>My grandson was so happy to receive this for his 13th birthday.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m on my own and this is not the same it smells nice</li>
            <li>Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>The fragance is very fresh, my wife and friends like this a lot.</li>
            <li>the original version smells betta.</li>
            <li>Nothing special and smells nothing like the original would not buy again.smell disappears after a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>This arrived way sooner than I expected, and it was all wrapped up really great</li>
            <li>smell good only momentarily.</li>
            <li>Good like all of the Le Male colognes</li>
            <li>Very robust and more citrusy.</li>
            <li>Has enduring effect without overpowering the user, really lives upto it&#x27;s reputation as a top notch performer.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I am on my bed so it does not break&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased this directly from amazon (amazon was the seller), and after comparing it to the department store bottle, what I received appears (and smells) to be authentic.</li>
            <li>Another plus is as far as I know, Le male isn&#x27;t very popular around here</li>
            <li>Once it dies down a bit to the heart notes, I love it even more.</li>
            <li>It comes on warm and spicy, with much less powder than the original, but seems to dissipate on contact.</li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced; when I told a co-worker that I got it</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>At the top, I notice a big blast of mint, lavender, and vanilla.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to buy from Amazon, since they aren&#x27;t an authorized retailer, but after receiving the product, and verifying it&#x27;s authenticity, I would be confident buying colognes from them in the future.</li>
            <li>Has been a favorite of mine for several years.</li>
            <li>delivery, better than the picture, he said he will have enough for a year!!</li>
            <li>macys,the same product is better.</li>
            <li>Shipping was incredibly fast!</li>
            <li>This line of cologne by Gaultier is by far my favorite masculine scent.  </li>
            <li>I get compliments from everyone, and the best part of this cologne is that its not overpowering more like welcoming, the base, the scent of vanilla will make you melt, LITERALLY.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the same I thought, new, original, closed, I recommended 100% service was fast and good.</li>
            <li>Smell is good &amp; long lasting</li>
            <li>I used to primarily wear Jean Paul Gaultier&#x27;s Le Male, but I&#x27;ve found that their newer formulations lack a certain longevity.</li>
            <li>I get a very vanilla-y spicey/woody sort of vibe from it.</li>
            <li>This part of the fragrance lasts about 5-8 hours on me, projecting very well for about 5.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend really likes this on me and says it smells manly.</li>
            <li>A lot of reviews I&#x27;ve read says it gives off a feminine vibe, but I don&#x27;t really get that much.</li>
            <li>I guess some people think vanilla is very feminine.</li>
            <li>It was the real deal.</li>
            <li>and I know my juice is real as I compare everything to samples...</li>
            <li>This is the real deal.</li>
            <li>Really strong&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li>is you haha</li>
            <li>gentle.</li>
            <li>( he&#x27;s really picky)</li>
            <li>received, all right, thank you very much, the&#x27;ll take into account for future purchase</li>
            <li>but I like the classic Le Male &amp; the summer Le Male better.  </li>
            <li>So for all you guys out there that want to try a new scent, try this one and watch the heads turn.</li>
            <li>The notes at the top last on my skin anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour and a half.</li>
            <li>The original one lasts long, this lasts only 1 hour</li>
            <li>Long lasting fresh smell.</li>
            <li>100 % real and authentic colognes and they are a fraction of the price cant go wrong here...</li>
            <li>Not sure if this is the original.  </li>
            <li>easy on the sprays with this guys, I usually use only 2 or 3 sprays and I&#x27;m set.</li>
            <li>all that I ever woremy wife always took care of me as far as buying the proper colognes.she is passed away now</li>

            <li> Not sure if this is the original.  </li>
            <li> easy on the sprays with this guys, I usually use only 2 or 3 sprays and I&#x27;m set.</li>
            <li> all that I ever woremy wife always took care of me as far as buying the proper colognes.she is passed away now</li>
            <li> Nice scent, weird bottle!</li>
            <li> I get small hints of citrus, but it doesn&#x27;t dominate and I really have to dig for it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a little heavy at first</li>
            <li> scent doesn&#x27;t hold very long at all.</li>
            <li> The top of the cap was missing on the sprayer so I am unable to use</li>
            <li> I guess it comes down to what an individual likes</li>
            <li> spent years buying product on amazon</li>
            <li> but this seems like the naughtier spicier cousin who just got out of jail.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not really what they say it is</li>
            <li> The can came very bent up and the plastic was broken inside.  </li>
            <li> At the base, it&#x27;s pretty much all vanilla for me.</li>
            <li> watered down fraction of what it once was.</li>
            <li> but JPG fragrances are known to be slightly lighter.</li>
            <li> I very skeptical at first</li>
            <li> The base can linger for another 8 hours or so on me, but obviously it&#x27;s going to be very close to the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I dare say this not original one, or at least I sent this to me</li>
            <li> I originally smelled this a year or two ago and hated it for some reason.</li>
            <li> I really find totally disappointed apart</li>
            <li> I accidentally ordered this, thinking it was the normal Le Male Terrible by Jean Paul Gaultier , but now this is my scent.</li>
            <li> I decided to try out Le Male Terrible, and what I got was exactly what I should have expected… a terrible version of Le Male.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fake.</li>
            <li> The holder inside the can, which is used to fix the position of the bottle inside, fails to work.</li>
            <li> I read complaints of fakes but have not had any bad luck yet</li>
            <li> I never gave a bad review (unless i had to)</li>
            <li> , there&#x27;s nothing bad to say about this cologne.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I used to buy this perfume for my dad every birthday, christmas, fathers day, you name it. Now I am buying it for my husband. Both and I love it.</li>
            <li> Smells good and lasts official</li>
            <li> Nice scent, weird bottle!</li>
            <li> Very reasonably priced; when I told a co-worker that I got it she said she loved the scent (and I do too).  She then told me about a scent she recently bought for her boyfriend and as she was describing it, we discovered we were talking about the same cologne!  I can understand why she picked it up -- it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> Good smell. Great price</li>
            <li> I think I was expecting an actual cologne and not a body spray.  The scent could have been stronger.  I should have read the description better.</li>
            <li> Excellent cologne. Long lasting fresh smell. Price is much better than retail stores.</li>
            <li> First bottle purchased on Amazon was absolutely perfect, with the same fragrance and potency as the store.  Second bottle was totally bogus, not even close.</li>
            <li> Great warm men&#x27;s fragrence.</li>
            <li> watered down fraction of what it once was. scent doesn&#x27;t hold very long at all. smell good only momentarily.</li>
            <li> Thanks! Thanks! Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Not as lasting as the regular &amp;#34;Le male&amp;#34; I used to have but great nonetheless.</li>
            <li> Excellent value and a great fragrance. I have ordered this item numerous times. I will definitely order this item again</li>
            <li> Coming from a woman, smelt this on my BF and I just couldn&#x27;t take it. Made him go shower.</li>
            <li> Smells great. Will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I originally smelled this a year or two ago and hated it for some reason. I smelled it on a piece of paper and just thought it smelt chemical. I got a sample of this from Sephora and loved it. At the top, I notice a big blast of mint, lavender, and vanilla. I get small hints of citrus, but it doesn&#x27;t dominate and I really have to dig for it. The notes at the top last on my skin anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour and a half. Once it dies down a bit to the heart notes, I love it even more. I get a very vanilla-y spicey/woody sort of vibe from it. The vanilla dominates this part, but the spices/woods are still easy to smell. This part of the fragrance lasts about 5-8 hours on me, projecting very well for about 5. At the base, it&#x27;s pretty much all vanilla for me. The base can linger for another 8 hours or so on me, but obviously it&#x27;s going to be very close to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go easy on the sprays with this guys, I usually use only 2 or 3 sprays and I&#x27;m set. It&#x27;s also a little heavy at first so you might not want to spray the front of your neck if you&#x27;re susceptible to headaches. My girlfriend really likes this on me and says it smells manly. A lot of reviews I&#x27;ve read says it gives off a feminine vibe, but I don&#x27;t really get that much. I guess some people think vanilla is very feminine. Another plus is as far as I know, Le male isn&#x27;t very popular around here / I don&#x27;t smell it much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whenever I order fragrances off Amazon, I get it through Fragrancenet. All of the fragrances I&#x27;ve received from them have been authentic for a good price with free shipping.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is the original.  Packaging was perfect,  the bottle looks authentic but the smell seems to be a little off.</li>
            <li> The fragance is very fresh, my wife and friends like this a lot. I use this every day. I have almost 3 months and only I spend abouf of 15% of  the &amp;#34;eau de toilette&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> COVER MY EXPECTATIONS</li>
            <li> I loved this perfume is at the height of the house of jean paul gaultier  , the scent lasts all night</li>
            <li> I very skeptical at first but when I order it. It was the real deal. Excellent product and delivered fast</li>
            <li> This line of cologne by Gaultier is by far my favorite masculine scent.  It is lightly fruity with a strong woody aroma.  It lasts all day.  Great buy for any guy trying to turn some heads and noses when entering a room.</li>
            <li> 100 % real and authentic colognes and they are a fraction of the price cant go wrong here... I read complaints of fakes but have not had any bad luck yet and I know my juice is real as I compare everything to samples...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fake. Don&#x27;t buy it.&lt;br /&gt;- The holder inside the can, which is used to fix the position of the bottle inside, fails to work. When I open it, the bottle falls out immediately. Luckily, I am on my bed so it does not break&lt;br /&gt;- No serial number in the bottom of the bottle&lt;br /&gt;- The original one lasts long, this lasts only 1 hour</li>
            <li> I guess it comes down to what an individual likes but this is one of my favorite all time</li>
            <li> Everything was Good! Excellent product! It&#x27;s the same I thought, new, original, closed, I recommended 100% service was fast and good.</li>
            <li> Nothing special and smells nothing like the original would not buy again.smell disappears after a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x60;t like it this time...</li>
            <li> Great price, great smell!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend for Valentines Day.  The perfect gift.  We received a sample at Christmas time and I remembered this one.  Loved it.  This arrived in perfect time for me to wrap and it was packaged very well.&lt;br /&gt;He has also received compliments on it.  Very pleased with this product and service. Would buy again</li>
            <li> Good purchase my son&#x27;s favorite.</li>
            <li> Smell is good &amp; long lasting</li>
            <li> I always worry when ordering this cologne online that I will get a knock off. This is the real deal. At the end of the day, he still smells great!</li>
            <li> Love this cool smell and i am looking forward of buying one more</li>
            <li> My grandson was so happy to receive this for his 13th birthday. He loves it. He used to use his Dad&#x27;s. He thanked me so many times that I was s happy as he was.&lt;br /&gt;S. Calcagno</li>
            <li> excelent service and product</li>
            <li> the original version smells betta. But this is supposedly more concentrated,??  I really find totally disappointed apart I feel I threw my money away. i know a lot of colonies and I dare say this not original one, or at least I sent this to me what is not. spent years buying product on amazon and I had never been anything like this. :@</li>
            <li> Good like all of the Le Male colognes but I like the classic Le Male &amp; the summer Le Male better.  Still a quality scent</li>
            <li> I purchased this directly from amazon (amazon was the seller), and after comparing it to the department store bottle, what I received appears (and smells) to be authentic. The cologne smells great, and is exactly what I was expecting. I was hesitant to buy from Amazon, since they aren&#x27;t an authorized retailer, but after receiving the product, and verifying it&#x27;s authenticity, I would be confident buying colognes from them in the future.</li>
            <li> very similar to le male but this seems like the naughtier spicier cousin who just got out of jail. i wear one in the day and put terible on for night.</li>
            <li> I always wanted to buy Jean paul, my brother had a bottle, i would spary it on because it smelled awesome, never noticed it was from jean paul the name wasnt on the bottle or anything, untill i came across the same bottle my brother had on amazon. So i had to order it and i am pleased with my purchase. The smell is... just no way to explain it, its amazing hands down the best jean paul colonge, much better than the orginal. I get compliments from everyone, and the best part of this cologne is that its not overpowering more like welcoming, the base, the scent of vanilla will make you melt, LITERALLY. I would recommend this to any guy, you wont be dissapointed. I never gave a bad review (unless i had to), there&#x27;s nothing bad to say about this cologne. The bottle is unique, its in a class of its own. So for all you guys out there that want to try a new scent, try this one and watch the heads turn.</li>
            <li> Has been a favorite of mine for several years.</li>
            <li> years ago this is all that I ever woremy wife always took care of me as far as buying the proper colognes.she is passed away now so I&#x27;m on my own and this is not the same it smells nice but it disappears quicklyI have a feeling it&#x27;s not really what they say it is I don&#x27;t know</li>
            <li> I get tons of comments.</li>
            <li> I accidentally ordered this, thinking it was the normal Le Male Terrible by Jean Paul Gaultier , but now this is my scent. Very robust and more citrusy. I love it. My wife kept the razor blade medallion!</li>
            <li> This is great stuff. Really strong&lt;br /&gt;Last all day. All yoh can smell is you haha</li>
            <li> gentle. Has enduring effect without overpowering the user, really lives upto it&#x27;s reputation as a top notch performer. good value for money</li>
            <li> This was for a birthday present &amp; He loved it!!! This arrived way sooner than I expected, and it was all wrapped up really great ( he&#x27;s really picky) but from what I hear he&#x27;s wearing it to all the clubs &amp; even sleeping in it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Fast delivery, better than the picture, he said he will have enough for a year!! And very good price, definately remember this company!!! If I could I&#x27;d give a 10</li>
            <li> I encountered this in 2012 and decided to add it to my Winter 2013 collection.  It is perfect for any occassion I just wished it lasted a little longer but JPG fragrances are known to be slightly lighter.</li>
            <li> I used to primarily wear Jean Paul Gaultier&#x27;s Le Male, but I&#x27;ve found that their newer formulations lack a certain longevity. I decided to try out Le Male Terrible, and what I got was exactly what I should have expected… a terrible version of Le Male. It comes on warm and spicy, with much less powder than the original, but seems to dissipate on contact. I guess I could use this as a room deodorizer...</li>
            <li> Requested by my son for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time , my husband loves it</li>
            <li> Excellent product and delivered fast</li>
            <li> Perfect scent.  Lovely bottle.</li>
            <li> macys,the same product is better.</li>
            <li> received, all right, thank you very much, the&#x27;ll take into account for future purchase</li>
            <li> Shipping was incredibly fast! Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The can came very bent up and the plastic was broken inside.  The top of the cap was missing on the sprayer so I am unable to use the product.&lt;br /&gt;Was this a returned item that was not checked out before it was sealed up and sent to me?&lt;br /&gt;I would expect more...&lt;br /&gt;AND I still need a cap.&lt;br /&gt;Dang...</li>
