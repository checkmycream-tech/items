            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>, my face builds sweat and oil, and this does a good job of keeping it under control washing my face 3 times a day.</li>
            <li>I dont know how to describe it but this soap feels soooo good when rubbing it on your face.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>My son liked it..</li>
            <li>After washing, my face looks nice.</li>
            <li>Nice face wash for the shower on days when I&#x27;m not using an exfoliant.</li>
            <li>Nice face wash.</li>
            <li>The menthol coolness is a nice touch.</li>
            <li>It also makes it very easy to apply sunblock and BB cream on my face as well.</li>
            <li>Beats most of Neutrogena ones I&#x27;ve tried in my opinion (except for the invigorating men&#x27;s wash) and my skin just seems to feel better!</li>
            <li>I tried the neutrogena mens wash, and it had a great cooling feeling the first time.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments about my skin being all bright and clean after I use this product.</li>
            <li>He Is 24 he order more.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff been using it for years</li>
            <li>I was rather pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many.</li>
            <li>I love this one.</li>
            <li>Very impressed with this facial wash.</li>
            <li>I will buy more when this supply runs out.</li>
            <li>After you use it though it makes it feel really nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>You should make sure to massage it into the skin for 1-2 minutes continuously before rinsing.</li>
            <li>Love Nivea products and have been using them for some time.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>As time goes by, it seems to get better.</li>
            <li>a fan of nivea for a while, though not all of their products are great (their coq10 makes me break out and just adds too much oils)</li>
            <li>I agree with Nivea&#x27;s recommendation to use a lotion afterwards, but that&#x27;s the case with most cleaners I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have an acne problem as many of the reviewers seem to use this for</li>
            <li>Most of the time, it&#x27;s not an issue.  </li>
            <li>, i will pay more attention to this shop, everything runs well</li>
            <li>One of the better face washes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Not what it was intended for, but it works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>well maybe my skin could be a smidge better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I will get used to it, but I wanted to post that warning for others</li>
            <li>I felt that I needed to update this review, as this review is the top review for this product at the time I write this.</li>
            <li>I have since begun using an alternative brand, which is working out much better.</li>
            <li>I have since begun using an alternative brand, which is working out much better.</li>
            <li>Will buy again when I need more</li>
            <li>better than I expected!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Like any facewash, your skin will become used to it over time and you will need to switch it up every so many months or so.</li>
            <li>Buy it, use it, love it.</li>
            <li>Cleans and feels refreshing.</li>
            <li>and it is better than neutrogena.</li>
            <li>very good,it is helpful and quick,so it is really good, cannot be better,it is suitable for my face, so buy it</li>
            <li>I loved this product very much.</li>
            <li>This one makes my skin feel very clean and refreshed without overdrying.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good substitute.  </li>
            <li>My favorite part of all is that this product is available in most stores.</li>
            <li>but i thought it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to help completely prevent breakouts, and it helped greatly.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon for having a great price and shipping it quickly.</li>
            <li>After using it, your face will feel very clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>After that I bought this at my store as 4 pack because it was easy and nearer to me.</li>
            <li>BUT for being able to pick this up quickly at your local grocery store and is readily available almost everywhere and for the priceâ€¦ it is a very good face wash that cleans well.</li>
            <li>a senior and have special skin issues, like most of us.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nivea has never let me down, and this product is awesome.  </li>
            <li>Very strong fragrance , which really bothers me as I am allergic to many smells.</li>
            <li>Between this and the Neutrogena, you should do just fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Nivea face products for men for several years and have found them to be consistently great products and have no reservations about recommending them.</li>
            <li>Great Face Wash, feels fresh i like the menthol cooling effect it gives, it leavs skin feeling soft and smooth,</li>
            <li>I enjoy nivea for men.</li>
            <li>It definitely works to wash oil away and leaves your face feeling really great.</li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t perfect, but the improvement was very noticeble both visually and sensually.  </li>
            <li>But, I quickly realized that it didnt clean my face well and the cooling affect went away the more I used it.</li>
            <li>and it also smells very fresh but not too overpowering.</li>
            <li>This did the trick and keeps my face clean and smooth throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>you feeling clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It does help maintain a clean oil free face though.</li>
            <li>It does not dry my skin, makes it smell great, and keeps it feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>The scent is mildly refreshing and it lathers up pretty well and rinses off in the shower</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line is that it gets my face clean without drying it out, and it does not leave any residue, and the scent washes away.  </li>
            <li>for me it just wasn&#x27;t a good fit and actually made my skin break out.</li>
            <li>Again, after about 3 days of use, the blemishes on my forehead are completely gone and replaced with nice smooth skin.</li>
            <li>my face feels clean and I can notice a difference.</li>
            <li>does thoroughly clean your face, and it somehow prevents my face from being oily</li>
            <li>Leaves your face feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling cool, clean</li>
            <li>Love the scent and te product as a whole.  </li>
            <li>It feels cool after you wash it off your face.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling clean and fresh, unlike some that leave it waxy or greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my face fresh and clean without oily tracks...</li>
            <li>it leaves  your face clean and fresh,  </li>
            <li>I have mild acne and it doesn&#x27;t seem to have any impact on it.</li>
            <li>Only 4 / 5 stars because there are definitely better face washes out there, that give better resultsâ€¦</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it, and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Works well keeps skin moist and clean good price item as described not sure how much more I can write about soap</li>
            <li>the pack is great too as it will last me for at least six months to 8 months so that is great</li>
            <li>I feel like it really helps keep my face clean and free of issues.</li>
            <li>Even with the that dry issue my skin looks good.</li>
            <li>And I suffer from very mild acne, if really any at all</li>
            <li>only is it highly effective, but at this price, it can&#x27;t be beaten.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried the Gillette Pro Series Sensitive Face Wash, but I prefer the Nivea for Men wash since it seems to lather a bit better.</li>
            <li>This is a very useful men&#x27;s care product that I have enjoyed using for several years.</li>
            <li>Not only does it clean your face, but the menthol gives it a  refreshing feel..</li>
            <li>just wanted to write a quick note that this is probably (i&#x27;m assuming) good for a lot of folks, seeing the previous reviews.</li>
            <li>Although there are other products out in the market, I have had a good track record with Nivea.</li>
            <li>highly recommended if you just need a good facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>on my face right away.</li>
            <li>, right?</li>
            <li>It really leaves you feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your face very refreshed and clean after use.</li>
            <li>Not painful to use like Apricot Scrub and does a much nicer job.  </li>
            <li>I believe this is a new formula and new label, as I think the old one was made in Germany and this one is now made in France and has a little more \\&quot;mintyness\\&quot; still very good.</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels much better through regular use of this product.  </li>
            <li>It &amp;#34;feels&amp;#34; refreshing, but you definitely need to use a moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li>i been using this product for a couple of years and it cleans pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not that I am aware of.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>First of all let me tell you that  the smell is manly, like  all face washing soaps  </li>
            <li>However, after using this product for just a few days, I have had no issues with flaking skin, which is surprising since the wash is not abrasive in any way.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone with the above issues, it has worked wonders for me, and after dealing with these issues for a decade and a half, it&#x27;s a wonderful</li>
            <li>I mean I tried it because of the great reviews</li>
            <li>Clean and masculine smelling.</li>
            <li>The double action wash cleans my face gently and effectively even after working in the heat and humidity and makes you feel refreshed.</li>
            <li>I pretty much swear by this facewash.</li>
            <li>I tried all the major brands and have to say this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>Nice cleaning, doesn&#x27;t dry the skin and has a soft scent.</li>
            <li>I needed a moisturizer for morning and nighttime because my face has been getting very oily</li>
            <li>and so this really does the job.</li>
            <li>If it didn&#x27;t cost so much, I&#x27;d use it everywhere.</li>
            <li>is that it&#x27;s gone too fast</li>
            <li>Using them on three different occasions confirmed it was not environmental, but rather this product.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li>I used to try Neutrogena, and St. Ives and whatever else is out there, but they&#x27;re really girly smelling</li>
            <li>I realize this may be my own personal experience, and that they also suggest using the Nivea facial lotion on the bottle</li>
            <li>I know of no other facial cleanser in the same price range that is as good as this one.</li>
            <li>Other than that, enjoy!</li>
            <li>Since I have started using this face wash, along with other products, my condition has gotten better.</li>
            <li>Since the original purchase last year, I have since given these away.</li>
            <li>I have been using Nivea products for many years now and I will not use any other.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Nivea products for years, and it keeps my skin properly moisturized and clean.</li>
            <li>Has a slight menthol tingle that actually feels good.  </li>
            <li>This face wash has a very delicate, smooth feel to it when being applied, and it&#x27;s extremely refreshing.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it keep your face dry and oil free, but it keeps it smooth and soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>for me, most face washes are the same unless they carry some acne medication along with it which i don&#x27;t find necessary for me.</li>
            <li>Came quickly and works well on my face, will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s invigorating, fresh, deep cleaning, and works very well.</li>
            <li>It does do the job of cleaning and refreshing, but it makes my face way too tight.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using it for men.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it  </li>
            <li>Keeps your face feeling clean for a long time and helps to moisturize the skin, too.</li>
            <li>In the stores its a little bit more.</li>
            <li>It is a little bit sticky, but it is OK.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling clean, fresh, and firm.</li>
            <li>leaves your skin feeling clean and refreshed, not a bit dry like the oil control face wash with marine elements, which could also be used when having oily face and pimples.</li>
            <li>I had been searching for a while for a face wash that would leave my face feeling clean without leaving it feeling too dry afterwards.</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t like the feeling of lotion on my face), but after using this product, for a couple hours after (until my face creates normal oils again)</li>
            <li>Only issue is that it dries up your skin a lot because it is quite powerful.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t clear up all your pimples and acne, not many facewashes can actually do that at a fair price over time.</li>
            <li>Nivea has been my go to brand for lotions, shaving cream and face wash for the high quality, and sensitive skin focus.</li>
            <li>I usually never use facewash because i don&#x27;t need it</li>
            <li>Over the last few months I have tried a few different products in search of the best face wash.</li>
            <li>It also leaves a cool feeling and lasts longer than other facewashes.</li>
            <li>This face wash is nice for thicker skin, I would not use it everyday though because it seems to dry out the skin.</li>
            <li>This dries out my skin noticeably versus the sensitive skin formula.</li>
            <li>face wash itself is gentle, but you definitely have to use a moisturizer afterwards.  </li>
            <li>While this may not apply to you, the reader, be warned that if this does happen, it&#x27;s likely this product.ks, very sore, etc.</li>
            <li>Very gentle, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin or leave a soapy residue.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a similar product in Neutrogena at a cheaper price and very much the same as this product.</li>
            <li>I am quite certain this is a personal issue, but using this product the three times I did, each time, after a day or two, I would break out severely in the deep, large, red pimples.</li>
            <li>(in my 30&#x27;s now), and while most of it has gone, I still would get small bumps on my forehead and the occasional pimple here and there.</li>
            <li>I generally have sensitive skin that has been prone to acne breakouts.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s not easy for you to decide when you have washed it clean...</li>
            <li>people who wrote if feels dry its bc you need to follow with a moisterizer, and dont use too much about a dime size in the palm.</li>
            <li>One last thing, try not putting too much of the face wash on your face, the size of a dime should be enough.</li>
            <li>The pimples these create are the ones that are deep under the skin and last for weeks, very sore, etc.</li>
            <li>It does help cool your face down while washing it at the same time.  </li>
            <li>you feeling refreshed, nothing too special about it so far, though I have only been using it for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 21 and have not had any major breakouts in those 2 years.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s even better than some other much more expensive face washing products!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to deal with dry skin on my face for the better part of 15 years, and this was a small investment that turned out wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff actually may be a little less drying than plain old soap, so that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>I used to use Gillette Face Wash for men that was blue and came in a clear tube that was about the same size and this product, but I ran out and Gillette apparently stopped making it.  </li>
            <li>The menthol is nice for opening your sinuses each morning in combination with the steam of the shower, especially for us that are subject to ridiculous allergies.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a few different face washes and all seem to work pretty well, so maybe I&#x27;m not the harshest judge, but I keep going back to Nivea because my fiancee likes the smell on me.</li>

            <li> Good luck.</li>
            <li> , my face builds sweat and oil, and this does a good job of keeping it under control washing my face 3 times a day.</li>
            <li> I dont know how to describe it but this soap feels soooo good when rubbing it on your face.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> My son liked it..</li>
            <li> After washing, my face looks nice.</li>
            <li> Nice face wash for the shower on days when I&#x27;m not using an exfoliant.</li>
            <li> Nice face wash.</li>
            <li> The menthol coolness is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> It also makes it very easy to apply sunblock and BB cream on my face as well.</li>
            <li> Beats most of Neutrogena ones I&#x27;ve tried in my opinion (except for the invigorating men&#x27;s wash) and my skin just seems to feel better!</li>
            <li> I tried the neutrogena mens wash, and it had a great cooling feeling the first time.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments about my skin being all bright and clean after I use this product.</li>
            <li> He Is 24 he order more.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff been using it for years</li>
            <li> I was rather pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many.</li>
            <li> I love this one.</li>
            <li> Very impressed with this facial wash.</li>
            <li> I will buy more when this supply runs out.</li>
            <li> After you use it though it makes it feel really nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> You should make sure to massage it into the skin for 1-2 minutes continuously before rinsing.</li>
            <li> Love Nivea products and have been using them for some time.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> As time goes by, it seems to get better.</li>
            <li> a fan of nivea for a while, though not all of their products are great (their coq10 makes me break out and just adds too much oils)</li>
            <li> I agree with Nivea&#x27;s recommendation to use a lotion afterwards, but that&#x27;s the case with most cleaners I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have an acne problem as many of the reviewers seem to use this for</li>
            <li> Most of the time, it&#x27;s not an issue.  </li>
            <li> , i will pay more attention to this shop, everything runs well</li>
            <li> One of the better face washes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Not what it was intended for, but it works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> well maybe my skin could be a smidge better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I will get used to it, but I wanted to post that warning for others</li>
            <li> I felt that I needed to update this review, as this review is the top review for this product at the time I write this.</li>
            <li> I have since begun using an alternative brand, which is working out much better.</li>
            <li> I have since begun using an alternative brand, which is working out much better.</li>
            <li> Will buy again when I need more</li>
            <li> better than I expected!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Like any facewash, your skin will become used to it over time and you will need to switch it up every so many months or so.</li>
            <li> Buy it, use it, love it.</li>
            <li> Cleans and feels refreshing.</li>
            <li> and it is better than neutrogena.</li>
            <li> very good,it is helpful and quick,so it is really good, cannot be better,it is suitable for my face, so buy it</li>
            <li> I loved this product very much.</li>
            <li> This one makes my skin feel very clean and refreshed without overdrying.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good substitute.  </li>
            <li> My favorite part of all is that this product is available in most stores.</li>
            <li> but i thought it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to help completely prevent breakouts, and it helped greatly.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon for having a great price and shipping it quickly.</li>
            <li> After using it, your face will feel very clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> After that I bought this at my store as 4 pack because it was easy and nearer to me.</li>
            <li> BUT for being able to pick this up quickly at your local grocery store and is readily available almost everywhere and for the priceâ€¦ it is a very good face wash that cleans well.</li>
            <li> a senior and have special skin issues, like most of us.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nivea has never let me down, and this product is awesome.  </li>
            <li> Very strong fragrance , which really bothers me as I am allergic to many smells.</li>
            <li> Between this and the Neutrogena, you should do just fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Nivea face products for men for several years and have found them to be consistently great products and have no reservations about recommending them.</li>
            <li> Great Face Wash, feels fresh i like the menthol cooling effect it gives, it leavs skin feeling soft and smooth,</li>
            <li> I enjoy nivea for men.</li>
            <li> It definitely works to wash oil away and leaves your face feeling really great.</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t perfect, but the improvement was very noticeble both visually and sensually.  </li>
            <li> But, I quickly realized that it didnt clean my face well and the cooling affect went away the more I used it.</li>
            <li> and it also smells very fresh but not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> This did the trick and keeps my face clean and smooth throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> you feeling clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li> It does help maintain a clean oil free face though.</li>
            <li> It does not dry my skin, makes it smell great, and keeps it feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> The scent is mildly refreshing and it lathers up pretty well and rinses off in the shower</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line is that it gets my face clean without drying it out, and it does not leave any residue, and the scent washes away.  </li>
            <li> for me it just wasn&#x27;t a good fit and actually made my skin break out.</li>
            <li> Again, after about 3 days of use, the blemishes on my forehead are completely gone and replaced with nice smooth skin.</li>
            <li> my face feels clean and I can notice a difference.</li>
            <li> does thoroughly clean your face, and it somehow prevents my face from being oily</li>
            <li> Leaves your face feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling cool, clean</li>
            <li> Love the scent and te product as a whole.  </li>
            <li> It feels cool after you wash it off your face.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling clean and fresh, unlike some that leave it waxy or greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my face fresh and clean without oily tracks...</li>
            <li> it leaves  your face clean and fresh,  </li>
            <li> I have mild acne and it doesn&#x27;t seem to have any impact on it.</li>
            <li> Only 4 / 5 stars because there are definitely better face washes out there, that give better resultsâ€¦</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it, and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works well keeps skin moist and clean good price item as described not sure how much more I can write about soap</li>
            <li> the pack is great too as it will last me for at least six months to 8 months so that is great</li>
            <li> I feel like it really helps keep my face clean and free of issues.</li>
            <li> Even with the that dry issue my skin looks good.</li>
            <li> And I suffer from very mild acne, if really any at all</li>
            <li> only is it highly effective, but at this price, it can&#x27;t be beaten.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried the Gillette Pro Series Sensitive Face Wash, but I prefer the Nivea for Men wash since it seems to lather a bit better.</li>
            <li> This is a very useful men&#x27;s care product that I have enjoyed using for several years.</li>
            <li> Not only does it clean your face, but the menthol gives it a  refreshing feel..</li>
            <li> just wanted to write a quick note that this is probably (i&#x27;m assuming) good for a lot of folks, seeing the previous reviews.</li>
            <li> Although there are other products out in the market, I have had a good track record with Nivea.</li>
            <li> highly recommended if you just need a good facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> on my face right away.</li>
            <li> , right?</li>
            <li> It really leaves you feeling clean.  </li>
            <li> Leaves your face very refreshed and clean after use.</li>
            <li> Not painful to use like Apricot Scrub and does a much nicer job.  </li>
            <li> I believe this is a new formula and new label, as I think the old one was made in Germany and this one is now made in France and has a little more \\&quot;mintyness\\&quot; still very good.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels much better through regular use of this product.  </li>
            <li> It &amp;#34;feels&amp;#34; refreshing, but you definitely need to use a moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li> i been using this product for a couple of years and it cleans pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not that I am aware of.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> First of all let me tell you that  the smell is manly, like  all face washing soaps  </li>
            <li> However, after using this product for just a few days, I have had no issues with flaking skin, which is surprising since the wash is not abrasive in any way.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone with the above issues, it has worked wonders for me, and after dealing with these issues for a decade and a half, it&#x27;s a wonderful</li>
            <li> I mean I tried it because of the great reviews</li>
            <li> Clean and masculine smelling.</li>
            <li> The double action wash cleans my face gently and effectively even after working in the heat and humidity and makes you feel refreshed.</li>
            <li> I pretty much swear by this facewash.</li>
            <li> I tried all the major brands and have to say this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> Nice cleaning, doesn&#x27;t dry the skin and has a soft scent.</li>
            <li> I needed a moisturizer for morning and nighttime because my face has been getting very oily</li>
            <li> and so this really does the job.</li>
            <li> If it didn&#x27;t cost so much, I&#x27;d use it everywhere.</li>
            <li> is that it&#x27;s gone too fast</li>
            <li> Using them on three different occasions confirmed it was not environmental, but rather this product.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> I used to try Neutrogena, and St. Ives and whatever else is out there, but they&#x27;re really girly smelling</li>
            <li> I realize this may be my own personal experience, and that they also suggest using the Nivea facial lotion on the bottle</li>
            <li> I know of no other facial cleanser in the same price range that is as good as this one.</li>
            <li> Other than that, enjoy!</li>
            <li> Since I have started using this face wash, along with other products, my condition has gotten better.</li>
            <li> Since the original purchase last year, I have since given these away.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nivea products for many years now and I will not use any other.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nivea products for years, and it keeps my skin properly moisturized and clean.</li>
            <li> Has a slight menthol tingle that actually feels good.  </li>
            <li> This face wash has a very delicate, smooth feel to it when being applied, and it&#x27;s extremely refreshing.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it keep your face dry and oil free, but it keeps it smooth and soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> for me, most face washes are the same unless they carry some acne medication along with it which i don&#x27;t find necessary for me.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and works well on my face, will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s invigorating, fresh, deep cleaning, and works very well.</li>
            <li> It does do the job of cleaning and refreshing, but it makes my face way too tight.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using it for men.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it  </li>
            <li> Keeps your face feeling clean for a long time and helps to moisturize the skin, too.</li>
            <li> In the stores its a little bit more.</li>
            <li> It is a little bit sticky, but it is OK.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling clean, fresh, and firm.</li>
            <li> leaves your skin feeling clean and refreshed, not a bit dry like the oil control face wash with marine elements, which could also be used when having oily face and pimples.</li>
            <li> I had been searching for a while for a face wash that would leave my face feeling clean without leaving it feeling too dry afterwards.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t like the feeling of lotion on my face), but after using this product, for a couple hours after (until my face creates normal oils again)</li>
            <li> Only issue is that it dries up your skin a lot because it is quite powerful.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t clear up all your pimples and acne, not many facewashes can actually do that at a fair price over time.</li>
            <li> Nivea has been my go to brand for lotions, shaving cream and face wash for the high quality, and sensitive skin focus.</li>
            <li> I usually never use facewash because i don&#x27;t need it</li>
            <li> Over the last few months I have tried a few different products in search of the best face wash.</li>
            <li> It also leaves a cool feeling and lasts longer than other facewashes.</li>
            <li> This face wash is nice for thicker skin, I would not use it everyday though because it seems to dry out the skin.</li>
            <li> This dries out my skin noticeably versus the sensitive skin formula.</li>
            <li> face wash itself is gentle, but you definitely have to use a moisturizer afterwards.  </li>
            <li> While this may not apply to you, the reader, be warned that if this does happen, it&#x27;s likely this product.ks, very sore, etc.</li>
            <li> Very gentle, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin or leave a soapy residue.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a similar product in Neutrogena at a cheaper price and very much the same as this product.</li>
            <li> I am quite certain this is a personal issue, but using this product the three times I did, each time, after a day or two, I would break out severely in the deep, large, red pimples.</li>
            <li> (in my 30&#x27;s now), and while most of it has gone, I still would get small bumps on my forehead and the occasional pimple here and there.</li>
            <li> I generally have sensitive skin that has been prone to acne breakouts.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not easy for you to decide when you have washed it clean...</li>
            <li> people who wrote if feels dry its bc you need to follow with a moisterizer, and dont use too much about a dime size in the palm.</li>
            <li> One last thing, try not putting too much of the face wash on your face, the size of a dime should be enough.</li>
            <li> The pimples these create are the ones that are deep under the skin and last for weeks, very sore, etc.</li>
            <li> It does help cool your face down while washing it at the same time.  </li>
            <li> you feeling refreshed, nothing too special about it so far, though I have only been using it for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 21 and have not had any major breakouts in those 2 years.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s even better than some other much more expensive face washing products!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to deal with dry skin on my face for the better part of 15 years, and this was a small investment that turned out wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff actually may be a little less drying than plain old soap, so that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> I used to use Gillette Face Wash for men that was blue and came in a clear tube that was about the same size and this product, but I ran out and Gillette apparently stopped making it.  </li>
            <li> The menthol is nice for opening your sinuses each morning in combination with the steam of the shower, especially for us that are subject to ridiculous allergies.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different face washes and all seem to work pretty well, so maybe I&#x27;m not the harshest judge, but I keep going back to Nivea because my fiancee likes the smell on me.</li>
            <li> so each tube seems to last a long time.</li>
            <li> nice face wash and the only bad thing can be said about it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately I suffer from dry skin on my face, which has a tendency to peel and flake fairly regularly.</li>
            <li> I have cancelled the order, and would recommend that other shoppers consider using different vendor, perhaps a source that reports stock in a timely manner, and actually possesses the items they sell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several other facial cleansers from clearasil, neutrogena, basis, and so on.</li>
            <li> ready for hard day of work.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Having trouble locating Nivea Men Face Wash at the local stores (Target, Giant, Safeway, Harris Teeter), I decided to come back to Amazon for another 4 pack.  </li>
            <li> how long I wash my face with it</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin that typically shows a little bit of acne.  </li>
            <li> My face stay a little bit oily, but not too much, for few hours afterward.</li>
            <li> Kinda leaves my skin dry</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin and smells minty.</li>
            <li> It cleans face well, but i still feel a bit of dry on my face after washing.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my face out either.  </li>
            <li> What I do have is somewhat dry skin on my face.  </li>
            <li> During the dryer months, my face tends to really dry out.  </li>
            <li> It does not feel dry to the touch, nor does it flake, but it&#x27;s an unnerving feeling.</li>
            <li> wash does not leave my face dry</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like face wash that make my face feel completely dry.</li>
            <li> I bought 4 pack after I tried a single tube which I bought it in my nearby store.</li>
            <li> Not sure why they dropped the other formula, but now I&#x27;m stuck looking for a new face wash</li>
            <li> Applying more would make your face feel all slippery and impossible to rinse off.</li>
            <li> Also your face may get just a little bit dry afterwards, so use a facial moisturizer like Jack Blacks after your shower.</li>
            <li> my face feels very dry.</li>
            <li> Does not seem to dry out your skin, but time will tell seeing have only been using it for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> It is priced well, and it takes a minimal amount with each use...</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll just say be careful.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to help keep my neck protected from razor burn, ingrown hairs and any other issues associated with shaving.  </li>
            <li> When I ordered this product, there was no \\&quot;out of stock\\&quot; or \\&quot;due in stock\\&quot; statement on the web page.</li>
            <li> It removes all the excess oils and all the other stuff that doesn&#x27;t belong on your face.</li>
            <li> On that note, the menthol is minimal, and I wouldn&#x27;t mind if it were a little stronger.  </li>
            <li> I have oily skin and a little bit of acne problem but not much.</li>
            <li> A little dab&#x27;ll do ya.</li>
            <li> I know sometimes it takes a little longer for products to work</li>
            <li> When something increases in price by approximately 40% in two years you&#x27;d like to feel there was a reason beyond corporate enrichment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In a few days I noticed my face was a lot clearer.</li>
            <li> It kinda dried my face and made it stiff though.</li>
            <li> I tried this product and ended up with and allergic reaction and I feel sick my face under my right eye is swollen.</li>
            <li> I wanted to improve my skin at least a little</li>

            <li> I started using this because Nivea discontinued the sensitive skin face wash, and I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I felt incredibly weird using them.</li>
            <li> but I mean if I used it 3 times over 2 days and my skin reacted horribly to it each time it sounds like its time to cut the chord</li>
            <li> I had a bad case of acne from say 16-23</li>
            <li> I used to be ugly before I bought this product, But ever since Ive been using it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Received as stated . Excellent</li>
            <li> My son liked it.. He Is 24 he order more.</li>
            <li> I bought this package for myself, and I like it. After washing, my face looks nice. Besides, it smells good.</li>
            <li> Smells great. Nice face wash for the shower on days when I&#x27;m not using an exfoliant. Clean and masculine smelling.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff been using it for years and now I have found a place I can get it for a great price and never run out</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I have very oily skin that typically shows a little bit of acne.  I wanted to improve my skin at least a little so I purchased this product along with Nivea&#x27;s enrgizing gel to apply morning and night.  I was rather pleased with the results.  My skin isn&#x27;t perfect, but the improvement was very noticeble both visually and sensually.  My skin looks and feels much better through regular use of this product.  This face wash has a very delicate, smooth feel to it when being applied, and it&#x27;s extremely refreshing.  It is not a miracle worker but without a doubt a great face wash.</li>
            <li> I have tried many. I love this one. I get so many compliments about my skin being all bright and clean after I use this product. Wish I can get bulk discount. I will buy 1 yr supplies.</li>
            <li> This product is good for washing man&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Nivea face products for men for several years and have found them to be consistently great products and have no reservations about recommending them. The double action wash cleans my face gently and effectively even after working in the heat and humidity and makes you feel refreshed. I believe this is a new formula and new label, as I think the old one was made in Germany and this one is now made in France and has a little more \\&quot;mintyness\\&quot; still very good. I also use the energizing face scrub a couple times a week, that will wake you up.</li>
            <li> Great Face Wash, feels fresh i like the menthol cooling effect it gives, it leavs skin feeling soft and smooth, people who wrote if feels dry its bc you need to follow with a moisterizer, and dont use too much about a dime size in the palm.</li>
            <li> Very impressed with this facial wash. I needed a moisturizer for morning and nighttime because my face has been getting very oily and so this really does the job. Not only does it keep your face dry and oil free, but it keeps it smooth and soft to the touch. My girlfriend has noticed a difference in my skin without having known that I started using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only is it highly effective, but at this price, it can&#x27;t be beaten.</li>
            <li> Great ! leaves your skin feeling clean and refreshed, not a bit dry like the oil control face wash with marine elements, which could also be used when having oily face and pimples.</li>
            <li> I used to use Gillette Face Wash for men that was blue and came in a clear tube that was about the same size and this product, but I ran out and Gillette apparently stopped making it.  This is a pretty good substitute.  I bought it on Amazon because it is a bit pricier in the grocery store.  The scent is mildly refreshing and it lathers up pretty well and rinses off in the shower easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is that it gets my face clean without drying it out, and it does not leave any residue, and the scent washes away.  I will buy more when this supply runs out.</li>
            <li> Kinda leaves my skin dry but you can use lotion, cocoa butter or aloe to fix that. Even with the that dry issue my skin looks good. Will order again.</li>
            <li> I started using face wash in order to help prevent razor burns while I was shaving.  This did the trick and keeps my face clean and smooth throughout the day.  Thanks to Amazon for having a great price and shipping it quickly.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin and smells minty. I think this may be the best men&#x27;s face wash I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a senior and have special skin issues, like most of us. Everything else I&#x27;ve used felt&lt;br /&gt;dried on my face right away. It almost feels like there&#x27;s a patina of moisturizer on my face.</li>
            <li> It cleans face well, but i still feel a bit of dry on my face after washing. So i only give it a four star.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and use it regularly each and every day after shaving.  It does help cool your face down while washing it at the same time.  You can use soap but some will leave you with a burning feeling and htis doesn&#x27;t do that.  It really leaves you feeling clean.  I highly recommend using it for men.</li>
            <li> Very gentle, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin or leave a soapy residue. I&#x27;ve also tried the Gillette Pro Series Sensitive Face Wash, but I prefer the Nivea for Men wash since it seems to lather a bit better. Good stuff and very fairly priced.</li>
            <li> This face wash is nice for thicker skin, I would not use it everyday though because it seems to dry out the skin. After you use it though it makes it feel really nice and smooth. You should make sure to massage it into the skin for 1-2 minutes continuously before rinsing.</li>
            <li> I tried this product and ended up with and allergic reaction and I feel sick my face under my right eye is swollen.I also feel a burning sensation .This product just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I usually never use facewash because i don&#x27;t need it but i thought it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to help completely prevent breakouts, and it helped greatly. Smells good and you feel great after using it.</li>
            <li> She just couldn&#x27;t stand it that I was using---soap! to wash my face. This stuff actually may be a little less drying than plain old soap, so that&#x27;s good. I need all the help I can get in that respect. A little dab&#x27;ll do ya.</li>
            <li> I started using this face wash about 2 years ago and have never looked back. I&#x27;m 21 and have not had any major breakouts in those 2 years. I would suggest using this in the shower after you are done washing your body and cleaning your hair. Also your face may get just a little bit dry afterwards, so use a facial moisturizer like Jack Blacks after your shower. One last thing, try not putting too much of the face wash on your face, the size of a dime should be enough. Applying more would make your face feel all slippery and impossible to rinse off. Other than that, enjoy!</li>
            <li> Love Nivea products and have been using them for some time. Great value for money and great results. I love it.</li>
            <li> Nice cleaning, doesn&#x27;t dry the skin and has a soft scent. Nice face wash. Would recomended. Definitely will buy again</li>
            <li> it dries out my skin when I used it daily. It &amp;#34;feels&amp;#34; refreshing, but you definitely need to use a moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li> I loved this product very much. I feel refreshed after washing my face with this. It gives cooling feel on my face. I bought 4 pack after I tried a single tube which I bought it in my nearby store. After that I bought this at my store as 4 pack because it was easy and nearer to me. Now I don;t see it in my store and wanted to buy online and I see this product $9 overpriced. There&#x27;s a similar product in Neutrogena at a cheaper price and very much the same as this product.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to help keep my neck protected from razor burn, ingrown hairs and any other issues associated with shaving.  After using this product for a week, I noticed improvement.  As time goes by, it seems to get better.</li>
            <li> i use a lot of premium products, like baxter, anthony logistics and american crew, but sometimes it&#x27;s just not necessary. like face wash. for me, most face washes are the same unless they carry some acne medication along with it which i don&#x27;t find necessary for me. just need something that cleans the mug, anything else is a bonus since i use a lot of follow ups (toner, cream, etc) so this gets the job done. the pack is great too as it will last me for at least six months to 8 months so that is great value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;been a fan of nivea for a while, though not all of their products are great (their coq10 makes me break out and just adds too much oils) their basics are what work best. highly recommended if you just need a good facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> Great face wash for guys. Not girly smelling at all. Leaves your face very refreshed and clean after use. I agree with Nivea&#x27;s recommendation to use a lotion afterwards, but that&#x27;s the case with most cleaners I&#x27;ve tried. I will definitely continue to utilize this for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li> I tear through this wash every morning in the shower.  It leaves my face feeling clean and fresh, unlike some that leave it waxy or greasy feeling.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my face out either.  The menthol is nice for opening your sinuses each morning in combination with the steam of the shower, especially for us that are subject to ridiculous allergies.  On that note, the menthol is minimal, and I wouldn&#x27;t mind if it were a little stronger.  Occasionally I let my facial hair grow out a bit, and it softens the hair and washes out easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nivea has never let me down, and this product is awesome.  It is priced well, and it takes a minimal amount with each use... so each tube seems to last a long time.</li>
            <li> I enjoy nivea for men. Its also good to use it as a shaving cream. Leaves my face feeling cool, clean</li>
            <li> Came quickly and works well on my face, will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have an acne problem as many of the reviewers seem to use this for so I can&#x27;t comment on that.  What I do have is somewhat dry skin on my face.  Most of the time, it&#x27;s not an issue.  During the dryer months, my face tends to really dry out.  This stuff does the trick.  If it didn&#x27;t cost so much, I&#x27;d use it everywhere.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really good and i like it, i will pay more attention to this shop, everything runs well, hope this one helps</li>
            <li> One of the better face washes I&#x27;ve used. Beats most of Neutrogena ones I&#x27;ve tried in my opinion (except for the invigorating men&#x27;s wash) and my skin just seems to feel better! Also my girlfriend enjoys the smell.</li>
            <li> i been using this product for a couple of years and it cleans pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend this product</li>
            <li> I started using this because Nivea discontinued the sensitive skin face wash, and I am very disappointed. Very strong fragrance , which really bothers me as I am allergic to many smells. This dries out my skin noticeably versus the sensitive skin formula. Not sure why they dropped the other formula, but now I&#x27;m stuck looking for a new face wash</li>
            <li> nice face wash and the only bad thing can be said about it is that it&#x27;s gone too fast and i have to buy another pack.</li>
            <li> Having trouble locating Nivea Men Face Wash at the local stores (Target, Giant, Safeway, Harris Teeter), I decided to come back to Amazon for another 4 pack.  Unfortunately since my initial order back in 2012 was used up, the same product is now 26% more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The face wash itself is gentle, but you definitely have to use a moisturizer afterwards.  You also don&#x27;t need to use a bunch, maybe a dime size and that&#x27;ll be sufficient for the entire face.</li>
            <li> I used to be ugly before I bought this product, But ever since Ive been using it. Its been washing the ugly off my face! Why Arent we funding this!? D:</li>
            <li> When I ordered this product, there was no \\&quot;out of stock\\&quot; or \\&quot;due in stock\\&quot; statement on the web page. Only after I ordered was I informed that the item was out of stock. I have cancelled the order, and would recommend that other shoppers consider using different vendor, perhaps a source that reports stock in a timely manner, and actually possesses the items they sell.</li>
            <li> This face wash leaves you feeling clean and smooth.  It is not overpowering on the smell (during or after using it).  Has a slight menthol tingle that actually feels good.  I purchased a shower mirror (great mirror by ToiletTree) and now use Nivea product after I shave in lieu of after shave. Works great.</li>
            <li> I use it to control bacne. Not what it was intended for, but it works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Nivea has been my go to brand for lotions, shaving cream and face wash for the high quality, and sensitive skin focus. Although there are other products out in the market, I have had a good track record with Nivea.</li>
            <li> I had been searching for a while for a face wash that would leave my face feeling clean without leaving it feeling too dry afterwards. I generally have sensitive skin that has been prone to acne breakouts. Since I have started using this face wash, along with other products, my condition has gotten better.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product to replace the last face wash that caused my face to become irritated.Works great and I use Nivea men 3 in 1 moisturizer after washing my face. Great products.</li>
            <li> I know of no other facial cleanser in the same price range that is as good as this one. I&#x27;ve used several other facial cleansers from clearasil, neutrogena, basis, and so on. This one makes my skin feel very clean and refreshed without overdrying. It removes all the excess oils and all the other stuff that doesn&#x27;t belong on your face. My favorite part of all is that this product is available in most stores.</li>
            <li> I bought this and used for it for 2 days and broke out 2 times. I know sometimes it takes a little longer for products to work but I mean if I used it 3 times over 2 days and my skin reacted horribly to it each time it sounds like its time to cut the chord, right? I mean I tried it because of the great reviews but I&#x27;ll just say be careful. And I suffer from very mild acne, if really any at all and I was like well maybe my skin could be a smidge better. Yeah, this just didnt work for me. Good luck.</li>
            <li> just wanted to write a quick note that this is probably (i&#x27;m assuming) good for a lot of folks, seeing the previous reviews. for me it just wasn&#x27;t a good fit and actually made my skin break out. fyi.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best face wash materials i&#x27;ve purchased. It leaves my face fresh and clean without oily tracks...next i&#x27;ll be getting the energy facial scrub.</li>
            <li> I realize this may be my own personal experience, and that they also suggest using the Nivea facial lotion on the bottle (I don&#x27;t like the feeling of lotion on my face), but after using this product, for a couple hours after (until my face creates normal oils again) my face feels very dry. It does not feel dry to the touch, nor does it flake, but it&#x27;s an unnerving feeling. I&#x27;m sure I will get used to it, but I wanted to post that warning for others so others know nothing is \\&quot;wrong\\&quot; if this happens to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I suffer from dry skin on my face, which has a tendency to peel and flake fairly regularly. However, after using this product for just a few days, I have had no issues with flaking skin, which is surprising since the wash is not abrasive in any way. I&#x27;ve had to deal with dry skin on my face for the better part of 15 years, and this was a small investment that turned out wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also had very bad acne when I was a teenager (in my 30&#x27;s now), and while most of it has gone, I still would get small bumps on my forehead and the occasional pimple here and there. Again, after about 3 days of use, the blemishes on my forehead are completely gone and replaced with nice smooth skin. I highly recommend this product to anyone with the above issues, it has worked wonders for me, and after dealing with these issues for a decade and a half, it&#x27;s a wonderful change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 7/8/2014- I felt that I needed to update this review, as this review is the top review for this product at the time I write this. Since the original purchase last year, I have since given these away. I am quite certain this is a personal issue, but using this product the three times I did, each time, after a day or two, I would break out severely in the deep, large, red pimples. Using them on three different occasions confirmed it was not environmental, but rather this product. The pimples these create are the ones that are deep under the skin and last for weeks, very sore, etc. I have since begun using an alternative brand, which is working out much better. While this may not apply to you, the reader, be warned that if this does happen, it&#x27;s likely this product.ks, very sore, etc. I have since begun using an alternative brand, which is working out much better. While this may not apply to you, the reader, be warned that if this does happen, it&#x27;s likely this product.</li>
            <li> It does do the job of cleaning and refreshing, but it makes my face way too tight.</li>
            <li> I am Very happy with the product. my face feels clean and I can notice a difference. Great buy. Will buy again when I need more</li>
            <li> great face wash with a touch of  menthol to perk you up</li>
            <li> Have acne, oily skin, dirty skin, sensitive skin...? list goes on... Whatever it is this product will help you out. I had a bad case of acne from say 16-23 used all sorts of medicine internally and externally. One day on vacation I spot this at the grocery store, decided to give it a try, best thing ever. Not only does it clean your face, but the menthol gives it a  refreshing feel.. blah blah blah, just give this product a try.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nivea products for many years now and I will not use any other.  Love the scent and te product as a whole.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nivea products for years, and it keeps my skin properly moisturized and clean. Highly Recommend! Good stuff!</li>
            <li> better than I expected!!&lt;br /&gt;I does thoroughly clean your face, and it somehow prevents my face from being oily&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s even better than some other much more expensive face washing products!</li>
            <li> This face wash leaves you feeling refreshed, nothing too special about it so far, though I have only been using it for a few weeks now. I have mild acne and it doesn&#x27;t seem to have any impact on it. Very good price for the amount of face wash though.</li>
            <li> Over the last few months I have tried a few different products in search of the best face wash. I tried all the major brands and have to say this is by far my favorite. Leaves my face feeling clean, fresh, and firm. Great value.</li>
            <li> It feels cool after you wash it off your face. But it&#x27;s not easy for you to decide when you have washed it clean... I feel like no matter how long I wash my face with it it&#x27;s still there...</li>
            <li> After trying this soup awhile ago I always find it and buy it all the time. I feel like it really helps keep my face clean and free of issues.</li>
            <li> Leaves your face feeling clean and refreshed. Does not seem to dry out your skin, but time will tell seeing have only been using it for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> This Nivea face wash does not leave my face dry and it also smells very fresh but not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> This is a very useful men&#x27;s care product that I have enjoyed using for several years. However...the price has gone from $18 and change to $26 and change for the four-pack in two years&#x27; time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is there something different about the product? Larger tube, mystery ingredients, bonus toaster included? Not that I am aware of. When something increases in price by approximately 40% in two years you&#x27;d like to feel there was a reason beyond corporate enrichment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it continues to go up for the same product, I&#x27;m out of here. This is a facial cleanser, not a life-saving cancer treatment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a men&#x27;s face wash â€” it&#x27;s invigorating, fresh, deep cleaning, and works very well. Keeps your face feeling clean for a long time and helps to moisturize the skin, too. Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with this product and will continue to use it. Only 4 / 5 stars because there are definitely better face washes out there, that give better resultsâ€¦ BUT for being able to pick this up quickly at your local grocery store and is readily available almost everywhere and for the priceâ€¦ it is a very good face wash that cleans well.</li>
            <li> I was using Neutrogena Men&#x27;s facewash for a while after my face adjusted to it so I bought this. In a few days I noticed my face was a lot clearer. It also leaves a cool feeling and lasts longer than other facewashes. All you need is a dime amount to apply to your face. It won&#x27;t clear up all your pimples and acne, not many facewashes can actually do that at a fair price over time. It does help maintain a clean oil free face though. A&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;t work and at the gym, my face builds sweat and oil, and this does a good job of keeping it under control washing my face 3 times a day. Like any facewash, your skin will become used to it over time and you will need to switch it up every so many months or so. Between this and the Neutrogena, you should do just fine. I got 4 of these tubes for $18.00 with Prime which was also a great deal. In the stores its a little bit more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face cleaner for several years now. I absolutely love it, and highly recommend it. It cleared up my face within a week or so of use twice a day. Once you get to that point, you can get by using it once a day. It definitely works to wash oil away and leaves your face feeling really great. I pretty much swear by this facewash. I used to try Neutrogena, and St. Ives and whatever else is out there, but they&#x27;re really girly smelling and I felt incredibly weird using them. This stuff, however, rocks. Buy it, use it, love it. It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and a little bit of acne problem but not much. I don&#x27;t like face wash that make my face feel completely dry. I think this product leaves my face at the optimal level of oiliness (if that word exists). My face stay a little bit oily, but not too much, for few hours afterward. It also makes it very easy to apply sunblock and BB cream on my face as well. This is the best face wash I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Not painful to use like Apricot Scrub and does a much nicer job.  On my second pack of four tubes....hope they never stop making this product!</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Cleans with vigor and passion; my face looks more magnificent then ever before. Only issue is that it dries up your skin a lot because it is quite powerful. Recommend using some extra moisturizier on your face.</li>
            <li> Cleans and feels refreshing. I&#x27;ve used a few different face washes and all seem to work pretty well, so maybe I&#x27;m not the harshest judge, but I keep going back to Nivea because my fiancee likes the smell on me.</li>
            <li> Been using this face wash for two years now and never wanted to change. It does not dry my skin, makes it smell great, and keeps it feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and tried this as a replacement for the Nivea Oil Control since I can&#x27;t seem to find that stuff anymore.  Hydrates well, but leaves me with a oilier feel than I prefer.  The menthol coolness is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> It is a little bit sticky, but it is OK. I think it does not have smell and it is better than neutrogena.</li>
            <li> First of all let me tell you that  the smell is manly, like  all face washing soaps  should be.&lt;br /&gt;After using  it  it leaves  your face clean and fresh,  ready for hard day of work.&lt;br /&gt;I use it in the mornings and  after coming from work, because it also moisturizes my face.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it  and if you go with subscribe and save,  definitely  you cannot  go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;Nivea  , you just made me a happy man.</li>
            <li> I being using this for a couple days and I like it so for. I tried the neutrogena mens wash, and it had a great cooling feeling the first time. But, I quickly realized that it didnt clean my face well and the cooling affect went away the more I used it. I dont know how to describe it but this soap feels soooo good when rubbing it on your face. After using it, your face will feel very clean and smooth. It kinda dried my face and made it stiff though. But I have face lotion for that.</li>
            <li> Works well keeps skin moist and clean good price item as described not sure how much more I can write about soap</li>
            <li> very good,it is helpful and quick,so it is really good, cannot be better,it is suitable for my face, so buy it</li>
