            <li>I will always make sure that he has plenty GBS Beard Oil on hand and can&#x27;t wait to get him more products to try!&lt;br /&gt;Way</li>

            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Love the packaging and art work.</li>
            <li>The OG smells great but the Viking and Pine don&#x27;t really have fragrance at all.</li>
            <li>my beard and face absorb the oil readily and look great all day.</li>
            <li>My beard hasn&#x27;t looked, felt, and for that matter smelled any better than it does when I use this product.</li>
            <li>Made my beard look magical</li>
            <li>Great products highly recommended</li>
            <li>Its a pretty good deal to get the 3 pack.  </li>
            <li>Great product as far as the oil goes.  </li>
            <li>This product was amazing the first time I used it and continues to impress me the more I use</li>
            <li>and I really enjoy the light scent, does make his beard softer and more kissable:)</li>
            <li>Good product and fast shipping</li>
            <li>Awesome beard oil ever sent is amazing and not overwhelming strong.</li>
            <li>than I originally thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using GBS Beard Oil I&#x27;ll probably check out more of Fisticuffs&#x27; products.</li>
            <li>Scents are not too strong and overpowering.</li>
            <li>The pine one smelled pretty amazing</li>
            <li>scent was pleasant and masculine.</li>
            <li>provides a shine to my beard, a nice scent and really helps to smooth the hair together</li>
            <li>makes your beard silky smooth.</li>
            <li>All the different scents smell great.</li>
            <li>The three different kinds is a great deal.</li>
            <li>These beard oils are fantastic.</li>
            <li>to go on the light scent that doesn&#x27;t overpower the nose.  </li>
            <li>Great product, I can&#x27;t swoon enough!</li>
            <li>I assure you, BOTH of you will enjoy the scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Loved the pine sent the most, only receiving a four because of packaging.  </li>
            <li>Made my beard very soft and easy to comb which is nice being</li>
            <li>Great way to be able to switch up aromas to break the mundane.</li>
            <li>As far as texture goes, it spreads through the beard great and the dropper makes it much easier to get the content out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>The initial burst of manly scent is quite pleasant and then it dissipates as time goes on.</li>
            <li>My beard looks more relaxed and it feels so much softer.</li>
            <li>Leaves my beard nice and soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really liking the Viking blend, probably my favorite of the three.</li>
            <li>also the stickers are cool.</li>
            <li>It came with two stickers that was cool.</li>
            <li>The only good thing is the products look cool on the shelf</li>
            <li>/&gt;Keeps the beard shiny and soft, fragrance isn&#x27;t strong but noticeable, with my favorite being the pine smell.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how quickly there was a noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li>but as the previous reviews have said, I think it is great.</li>
            <li>It was a breath of fresh air when I discovered the Grave</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used two of the three scents so far and love them.</li>
            <li>I thought about writing a review immediately after the first time I used it, but decided to give it a while to get my true feelings about the product instead of immediate impressions.</li>
            <li>I bought him this variety back for Christmas to try because I liked the packaging and the scents sounded right up his alley.</li>
            <li>3-pack came at just the right price.</li>
            <li>He says he likes that the scents aren&#x27;t overpowering for being right under his nose.</li>
            <li>I should have just written the review right away.</li>
            <li>A lot of beard oils make you feel like you are walking around in a fog of scent, as it is right there on your face.</li>
            <li>, favorite is OG scent, pine is a little bit more aggresive and the neutral one is viking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I live in a tropical country where the humidity is extreme and this beard oils have been a great asset to my arsenal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I frequently get migraines and strong scents are one of the things that will trigger a migraine.</li>
            <li>It would be nice to see a three pack with a single flavor.  </li>
            <li>Thanks guys!</li>
            <li>They are my first ones trying out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;shipping was fast and packaging too!</li>
            <li>It leaves my beard smooth, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>First beard oils I have used</li>
            <li>First beard oil I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>Thank you guys so much!</li>
            <li>Not only that it is more manageable.</li>
            <li>This is a good deal for the price and to use as an everyday oil.</li>
            <li>They apply easily and last.</li>
            <li>I love this oil, it keeps it laid down and looks overall healthy.</li>
            <li>My little brother got jealous of the manliness that is my beard (thanks to this amazing beard oil) and snagged one of the vials from my bag while we were  staying the night at my dads for a family get together.</li>
            <li>just because I like it so much.</li>
            <li>I think people are too scared to give it a real review.</li>
            <li>thanks a lot USPS)</li>
            <li>But I do recommend going straight to the GBS page.</li>
            <li>but if you like the products I highly suggest going on over to Facebook &amp; giving GBS a like, &amp; join the GBS community!</li>
            <li>Thanks for igniting a passion in him.</li>
            <li>Close your eyes (but don&#x27;t really, read this)...</li>
            <li>Item as described, fast shipment.  </li>
            <li>really softens your beard.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Well the dropper is good, the lid sucks.  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed having 3 flavors to toy with, and combined, they come in cheaper per bottle than some of the other brands out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>100% recommended if you´re starting to grow a beard of if you have a full one already.</li>
            <li>I had previously never used any type of beard oil, after using this the first time i didnt want to stop stroking my beard.</li>
            <li>You will soon repopulate the entire island with boldly bearded offspring.</li>
            <li>When I ordered I thought the price seemed a bit high</li>
            <li>/&gt;Considering the high price of this product I&#x27;d prefer they leave out the &amp;#34;Scent of Fish&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Oil seems to be of high quality and blends well.</li>
            <li>Highly reccomended it.</li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Really easy to just put a few drops in your hands and massage it in.</li>
            <li>Makes my beard feel really soft.</li>
            <li>The natural scented one has a smell to it</li>
            <li>Keeps the beard soft yet manly.</li>
            <li>The crass smell of sea salt and masculine man scent of your comrades fill the air.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Before using this product, my beard would be very &amp;#34;wiry&amp;#34; and coarse.</li>
            <li>Now it is extremely soft and luscious.</li>
            <li>and I have noticed a considerable change in my beard.</li>
            <li>Was a little bit skeptical but after applying it, it feels and smells very nice, not greasy at all!</li>
            <li>After a couple of weeks of regular use I can tell a difference, his beard is softer, looks fuller, and is more tame.</li>
            <li>Really help my dry flakey skin under beared I even started useing it on my scalp an</li>
            <li>The scents are fantastic, not overwhelming but enough to let you know that you a man with an awsome beard.</li>
            <li>The other two bottles we&#x27;re not used much.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s neither good nor bad.</li>

            <li> Love the packaging and art work.</li>
            <li> The OG smells great but the Viking and Pine don&#x27;t really have fragrance at all.</li>
            <li> my beard and face absorb the oil readily and look great all day.</li>
            <li> My beard hasn&#x27;t looked, felt, and for that matter smelled any better than it does when I use this product.</li>
            <li> Made my beard look magical</li>
            <li> Great products highly recommended</li>

            <li> Awesome beard oil ever sent is amazing and not overwhelming strong.</li>
            <li> than I originally thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using GBS Beard Oil I&#x27;ll probably check out more of Fisticuffs&#x27; products.</li>
            <li> Scents are not too strong and overpowering.</li>
            <li> The pine one smelled pretty amazing</li>
            <li> scent was pleasant and masculine.</li>
            <li> provides a shine to my beard, a nice scent and really helps to smooth the hair together</li>

            <li> All the different scents smell great.</li>
            <li> The three different kinds is a great deal.</li>
            <li> These beard oils are fantastic.</li>
            <li> to go on the light scent that doesn&#x27;t overpower the nose.  </li>
            <li> Great product, I can&#x27;t swoon enough!</li>
            <li> I assure you, BOTH of you will enjoy the scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Loved the pine sent the most, only receiving a four because of packaging.  </li>
            <li> Made my beard very soft and easy to comb which is nice being</li>
            <li> Great way to be able to switch up aromas to break the mundane.</li>
            <li> As far as texture goes, it spreads through the beard great and the dropper makes it much easier to get the content out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> The initial burst of manly scent is quite pleasant and then it dissipates as time goes on.</li>
            <li> My beard looks more relaxed and it feels so much softer.</li>
            <li> Leaves my beard nice and soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really liking the Viking blend, probably my favorite of the three.</li>
            <li> also the stickers are cool.</li>
            <li> It came with two stickers that was cool.</li>
            <li> The only good thing is the products look cool on the shelf</li>
            <li> /&gt;Keeps the beard shiny and soft, fragrance isn&#x27;t strong but noticeable, with my favorite being the pine smell.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how quickly there was a noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li> but as the previous reviews have said, I think it is great.</li>
            <li> It was a breath of fresh air when I discovered the Grave</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used two of the three scents so far and love them.</li>
            <li> I thought about writing a review immediately after the first time I used it, but decided to give it a while to get my true feelings about the product instead of immediate impressions.</li>
            <li> I bought him this variety back for Christmas to try because I liked the packaging and the scents sounded right up his alley.</li>
            <li> 3-pack came at just the right price.</li>
            <li> He says he likes that the scents aren&#x27;t overpowering for being right under his nose.</li>
            <li> I should have just written the review right away.</li>
            <li> A lot of beard oils make you feel like you are walking around in a fog of scent, as it is right there on your face.</li>
            <li> , favorite is OG scent, pine is a little bit more aggresive and the neutral one is viking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I live in a tropical country where the humidity is extreme and this beard oils have been a great asset to my arsenal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I frequently get migraines and strong scents are one of the things that will trigger a migraine.</li>
            <li> It would be nice to see a three pack with a single flavor.  </li>
            <li> Thanks guys!</li>
            <li> They are my first ones trying out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;shipping was fast and packaging too!</li>
            <li> It leaves my beard smooth, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> First beard oils I have used</li>
            <li> First beard oil I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> Thank you guys so much!</li>
            <li> Not only that it is more manageable.</li>
            <li> This is a good deal for the price and to use as an everyday oil.</li>
            <li> They apply easily and last.</li>
            <li> I love this oil, it keeps it laid down and looks overall healthy.</li>
            <li> My little brother got jealous of the manliness that is my beard (thanks to this amazing beard oil) and snagged one of the vials from my bag while we were  staying the night at my dads for a family get together.</li>
            <li> just because I like it so much.</li>
            <li> I think people are too scared to give it a real review.</li>
            <li> thanks a lot USPS)</li>
            <li> But I do recommend going straight to the GBS page.</li>
            <li> but if you like the products I highly suggest going on over to Facebook &amp; giving GBS a like, &amp; join the GBS community!</li>
            <li> Thanks for igniting a passion in him.</li>
            <li> Close your eyes (but don&#x27;t really, read this)...</li>
            <li> Item as described, fast shipment.  </li>
            <li> really softens your beard.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Well the dropper is good, the lid sucks.  </li>
            <li> I enjoyed having 3 flavors to toy with, and combined, they come in cheaper per bottle than some of the other brands out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 100% recommended if you´re starting to grow a beard of if you have a full one already.</li>
            <li> I had previously never used any type of beard oil, after using this the first time i didnt want to stop stroking my beard.</li>
            <li> You will soon repopulate the entire island with boldly bearded offspring.</li>
            <li> When I ordered I thought the price seemed a bit high</li>
            <li> /&gt;Considering the high price of this product I&#x27;d prefer they leave out the &amp;#34;Scent of Fish&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Oil seems to be of high quality and blends well.</li>
            <li> Highly reccomended it.</li>
            <li> highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Really easy to just put a few drops in your hands and massage it in.</li>
            <li> Makes my beard feel really soft.</li>
            <li> The natural scented one has a smell to it</li>
            <li> Keeps the beard soft yet manly.</li>
            <li> The crass smell of sea salt and masculine man scent of your comrades fill the air.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before using this product, my beard would be very &amp;#34;wiry&amp;#34; and coarse.</li>
            <li> Now it is extremely soft and luscious.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed a considerable change in my beard.</li>
            <li> Was a little bit skeptical but after applying it, it feels and smells very nice, not greasy at all!</li>
            <li> After a couple of weeks of regular use I can tell a difference, his beard is softer, looks fuller, and is more tame.</li>
            <li> Really help my dry flakey skin under beared I even started useing it on my scalp an</li>
            <li> The scents are fantastic, not overwhelming but enough to let you know that you a man with an awsome beard.</li>
            <li> The other two bottles we&#x27;re not used much.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s neither good nor bad.</li>
            <li> So far, this has left my beard a bit softer, and feeling a little fuller.</li>
            <li> I expected more of a blood and stale beer smell.</li>
            <li> They give his beard a healthy shine and tame it so that even though it is very thick, it looks neat</li>
            <li> She actually rolled over in bed the other day, buried her nose in my beard and inhaled deeply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a terribly dry beard.</li>
            <li> The little bit left over in my hands</li>
            <li> because I&#x27;m not real fond of the scent of the Viking blend.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After only a few hours I can tell you</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but after about a week of using the viking beard oil</li>
            <li> Initially I feared it would leave my beard and face feeling like an oil slick.</li>
            <li> Bit of a challenge to get the droplets spread throughout my beard before it runs down the tip.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve let my beard grow out a few times but always ended up keeping it trimmed way down due to the seasons changing.</li>
            <li> Dry weather is not kind to my beard.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re all a little overpowering for both myself and my girlfriend.</li>
            <li> I like the oil, however, I&#x27;d preferred a little stronger fragrance.</li>
            <li> If used properly (a little bit goes a looooong way)</li>
            <li> Took a few days longer to get to me, it was Christmas time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried regular leave in conditioners, Moroccan Oils, conditioning washes, and beard conditioners with no relief for my poor beard.</li>
            <li> Even without trimming my beard, this product manages to keep it tame and under control.</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> You grab the three healthiest women and parade them to you lofty seaside villa on board your ship.</li>
            <li> Before using this not many women talked to me, but all of a sudden I had random Swedish women hitting on me.</li>
            <li> I ordered him the 3 scent beard oil kit and have since had a hard time keeping him offline.</li>
            <li> The dropper application and the lid, sucks.  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend has an impressively thick, curly beard that refuses to be tamed.</li>
            <li> I went on a 72 hour sex bender, and sadly now my beard is gone due to friction.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> First off, all three of these smell awful.</li>
            <li> No more!!</li>
            <li> Not great but alright</li>
            <li> Lots of beard oils out there are so expensive.</li>
            <li> Plus it smells like you just came out of a forest cutting timber.</li>
            <li> Obsessed!</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong?!?!?!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> ALL of the GBS products smell and work fantastic!  My girlfriend loves them more than me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use and my wife loves the smell of it she likes to cuddle at night I think it smells really nice. Makes my beard feel really soft. And I did order another one. just because I like it so much.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great and had made my beard much better.  I gave it four instead of five because I&#x27;m not real fond of the scent of the Viking blend.  I expected more of a blood and stale beer smell.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;d been growing a beard for sometime when I found out about beard oil. I went with this. Pretty disappointed. I think people are too scared to give it a real review. I&#x27;m here to do that. First off, all three of these smell awful. Smells like your putting Aunt Birtha&#x27;s bunion ointment on your face. Yuck! I like to touch my beard from time to time during the day. Well when you do that, it&#x27;s a bit greasy. Even if you apply it sparingly, it&#x27;s greasy. The only good thing is the products look cool on the shelf and they do offer a bit of beard management.</li>
            <li> I have only used the Viking scented oil but that was enough to make a regular customer out of me. I tried using beard oil once before and didn&#x27;t care for it but I recently decided maybe the problem was the brand I was using so I looked around Amazon and found Grave Before Shave, checked the reviews and thought I&#x27;d test drive some myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After only a few hours I can tell you I&#x27;m a fan. My beard looks more relaxed and it feels so much softer. I can&#x27;t believe how quickly there was a noticeable difference.  The Viking scented one smells so good, my wife won&#x27;t stop sniffing my face like a weirdo. The natural scented one has a smell to it but it&#x27;s neither good nor bad. The pine one smelled pretty amazing but it didn&#x27;t make it through shipping (thanks a lot USPS) When I ordered I thought the price seemed a bit high but I only needed 4 drops for my beard so I could see this supply lasting a lot longer than I originally thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using GBS Beard Oil I&#x27;ll probably check out more of Fisticuffs&#x27; products.</li>
            <li> Took a few days longer to get to me, it was Christmas time so I assume it was because of a back up of some sort. Still love it and husband loves it as well. Thanks guys!</li>
            <li> Viking oil is amazing... need I say more? GBS is the way to go. But I do recommend going straight to the GBS page. Cheaper,  &amp; get ton &#x27;o more swag!!! talk about run along sentence...but if you like the products I highly suggest going on over to Facebook &amp; giving GBS a like, &amp; join the GBS community!</li>
            <li> Love these oils. They condition beautifully. Great way to be able to switch up aromas to break the mundane. Grave Before Shave makes some of the best grooming products on the market.</li>
            <li> It turns your face pubes into a wonderful field of cotton. All while projecting dominance for all to bask in</li>
            <li> The oil is good quality, I just don&#x27;t happen to be a fan of any of these scents. They&#x27;re all a little overpowering for both myself and my girlfriend.</li>
            <li> makes your beard silky smooth. I had previously never used any type of beard oil, after using this the first time i didnt want to stop stroking my beard. it was glorious and smelled great too.</li>
            <li> It was a breath of fresh air when I discovered the Grave Before Shave beard oil set. A friend linked it to me on Facebook, and I was blown away with the packaging. The art is very attractive, and the brand name made me chuckle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 3-pack came at just the right price. I enjoyed having 3 flavors to toy with, and combined, they come in cheaper per bottle than some of the other brands out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each scent was pleasant and masculine. Of the three, my favorite is the pine-scented one. My wife loved them all! She has a better sense of smell than I do (her favorite was the Viking Blend).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with this one and will buy again.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has an impressively thick, curly beard that refuses to be tamed. I bought him this variety back for Christmas to try because I liked the packaging and the scents sounded right up his alley. Now these are his favorite beard oils - they all work great and smell wonderful! I especially love the OG scent...so good!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li> Great beard oil. I&#x27;ve got a terribly dry beard. I&#x27;ve tried regular leave in conditioners, Moroccan Oils, conditioning washes, and beard conditioners with no relief for my poor beard. But this stuff, this stuff works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeps the beard shiny and soft, fragrance isn&#x27;t strong but noticeable, with my favorite being the pine smell. Totally recommend this for anyone with a beard.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my boyfriend who had just started growing his beard.  3 months later he loves them and uses them every day.  They give his beard a healthy shine and tame it so that even though it is very thick, it looks neat</li>
            <li> Very happy with these oils so far. They are my first ones trying out. Made my beard very soft and easy to comb which is nice being I have a wiry beard.</li>
            <li> Women love to ride my beard when I slap this sh*t on. Great product. Great extras</li>
            <li> Bought this pack for my boyfriend and he loved it! After a couple of weeks of regular use I can tell a difference, his beard is softer, looks fuller, and is more tame. He says he likes that the scents aren&#x27;t overpowering for being right under his nose.</li>
            <li> Wish the scent was stronger and longer lasting.</li>
            <li> Really help my dry flakey skin under beared I even started useing it on my scalp an it reduced my itchy scalp</li>
            <li> Great product. Good value. All the different scents smell great. Throwing in some stickers was a nice touch.</li>
            <li> Obsessed! My man loves the brand! Keep it up guys! You have a great product line here. I ordered him the 3 scent beard oil kit and have since had a hard time keeping him offline. He&#x27;s since ordered a shirt, comb, soap, a shaping balm. Thanks for igniting a passion in him. Its great to see!</li>
            <li> Excellent Product!! Was a little bit skeptical but after applying it, it feels and smells very nice, not greasy at all! I live in a tropical country where the humidity is extreme and this beard oils have been a great asset to my arsenal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleasant smells, favorite is OG scent, pine is a little bit more aggresive and the neutral one is viking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;shipping was fast and packaging too! 100% recommended if you´re starting to grow a beard of if you have a full one already.</li>
            <li> So I like the way it conditions my beard - but it has the hint of a fishy smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering the high price of this product I&#x27;d prefer they leave out the &amp;#34;Scent of Fish&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Awesome beard oil ever sent is amazing and not overwhelming strong. It leaves my beard smooth, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Smells great! First beard oils I have used and I love it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t decide which one I like the best, these are all made very well, I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  Tried all sorts of oils and balms. These work and smell amazing. The three different kinds is a great deal.</li>
            <li> Keeps the beard soft yet manly. 3 different scents to suit my mood.</li>
            <li> Close your eyes (but don&#x27;t really, read this)... Imagine you&#x27;re a viking warrior, your luscious facial hair waves blowing in the wind. The crass smell of sea salt and masculine man scent of your comrades fill the air. You see land ahead and decide to stop for you are low on whiskey and red meat. You land upon an island of pine and evergreen. The scent of the trees permeates the fibers of your facial foliage. As you wander upon the island, looking for your prey, you run upon a hill of lemongrass and honey. Soon your grassy beard is dragging along the ground, collecting all of the scents of the lemon and honey that bees have gingerly placed in your manly path. You make your way back to your ship as the island women swoon over you. You grab the three healthiest women and parade them to you lofty seaside villa on board your ship. You will soon repopulate the entire island with boldly bearded offspring. You may now open your eyes... This journey has described the three scents provided in this pack. The question is are you man-viking enough to  embark on this journey?</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but after about a week of using the viking beard oil I was very pleased with the results. Before using this not many women talked to me, but all of a sudden I had random Swedish women hitting on me. I went on a 72 hour sex bender, and sadly now my beard is gone due to friction. I will say though I cannot wait for it to grow back so I can use this beard oil again.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift.  Item as described, fast shipment.  Thanik you</li>
            <li> Good product and fast shipping</li>
            <li> I like the oil, however, I&#x27;d preferred a little stronger fragrance.</li>
            <li> These beard oils are fantastic.</li>
            <li> The scent was just too overbearing for me!</li>
            <li> I am in love with these oils. They smell amazing and help my beard to glisten in the sun. Great price as well. Lots of beard oils out there are so expensive. I will definitely be getting these again.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, the wife loves it. Leaves my beard nice and soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I&#x27;ve let my beard grow out a few times but always ended up keeping it trimmed way down due to the seasons changing. Dry weather is not kind to my beard. I love this oil, it keeps it laid down and looks overall healthy. Plus it smells like you just came out of a forest cutting timber. I&#x27;m really liking the Viking blend, probably my favorite of the three. Really easy to just put a few drops in your hands and massage it in. Comb through it a bit and you are set. The little bit left over in my hands I just put it through my hair and it&#x27;s great. No beard-druff anymore either!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend that already has the most amazing beard - now I can&#x27;t keep my hands off of his rugged cheeks or my nose away!  Amazing products!  I will always make sure that he has plenty GBS Beard Oil on hand and can&#x27;t wait to get him more products to try!&lt;br /&gt;Way to go on the light scent that doesn&#x27;t overpower the nose.  Great product, I can&#x27;t swoon enough!</li>
            <li> I think this stuff is alright . Not great but alright</li>
            <li> First beard oil I&#x27;ve used but as the previous reviews have said, I think it is great. provides a shine to my beard, a nice scent and really helps to smooth the hair together so it provides a more kept look.</li>
            <li> Crunchy beard? No more!! And my man&#x27;s face smells like a dream. A Viking dream. Yum!</li>
            <li> So far, this has left my beard a bit softer, and feeling a little fuller. The scents are pleasant, but not over-powering. I would definitely recommend for guys in cold/dry climates. This has helped me a lot.</li>
            <li> really softens your beard.  plus my wife enjoys the smell.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Great products. Scents are not too strong and overpowering. Love the packaging and art work. Stickers were a neat bonus. Thanks</li>
            <li> Smells great and gives a nice look to your beard I&#x27;m very happy with it also the stickers are cool.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. 3 great scents to choose from. Shipped quick and came at a good price. Already spreading the word to friends about the product.</li>
            <li> Oil seems to be of high quality and blends well. All the scents however seem very similar.</li>
            <li> This was a great bargain!! Each item if about $15 so u get one free!! The scents take a bit to get used to. They smell more oily than one would think and the scent that is added is very light. As far as texture goes, it spreads through the beard great and the dropper makes it much easier to get the content out of the bottle. This is a good deal for the price and to use as an everyday oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m liking the product but I think I may have gotten a &amp;#34;stale&amp;#34; batch. The OG smells great but the Viking and Pine don&#x27;t really have fragrance at all. I would likely get the OG again but I&#x27;m leery of buying in bulk now.</li>
            <li> Opon receiving this wonderful oil my beard has never felt and looked so good sence I have been growing. It also makes it smell awesome!!  My wife can&#x27;t keep here hands off me because she says it smells fantastic!!  Thank you guys so much!</li>
            <li> What can I say. My beard loves it, great sheen, my beard cooperates with me now, and my lady loves the feel after. The scents are fantastic, not overwhelming but enough to let you know that you a man with an awsome beard. Highly reccomended it. The best bang for buck with this set. You will thank yourself later.</li>
            <li> Seriously. My little brother got jealous of the manliness that is my beard (thanks to this amazing beard oil) and snagged one of the vials from my bag while we were  staying the night at my dads for a family get together. This is a must if you are going to grow facial hair of any kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Added bonus: the girlfriend loves it. It also can with an awesome sticker that is now on my toolbox.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the beard oils for his beard.</li>
            <li> I puts the oilbon the beard ....boom perfection...I&#x27;m going to go make out with my beard now</li>
            <li> Great product as far as the oil goes.  Loved the pine sent the most, only receiving a four because of packaging.  The other two bottles we&#x27;re not used much.  The dropper application and the lid, sucks.  Well the dropper is good, the lid sucks.  I had a lot of product spill from the bottle tipping over in the drawer.  If they tip, they leak.  Wishing the pine was on my face, not my drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again.  It would be nice to see a three pack with a single flavor.  Could see buying three pines in a pack.</li>
            <li> It came with two stickers that was cool.</li>
            <li> All three scents are excellent.  They smell great all day without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> I am all that is man and this product solidifies that. Women want to bear my seed, husbands throw wives at me, I even believe this is infused with the sweat from Chuck Norris.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used two of the three scents so far and love them. If you want a health face and beard, use oil. They apply easily and last.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product about a month ago. I thought about writing a review immediately after the first time I used it, but decided to give it a while to get my true feelings about the product instead of immediate impressions. What did I learn from the month of using it? I should have just written the review right away. This product was amazing the first time I used it and continues to impress me the more I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially I was a bit worried about the scents. I frequently get migraines and strong scents are one of the things that will trigger a migraine. I was worried that a scent emanating from my beard and moustache would immediately trigger a migraine. Boy was I wrong?!?!?! All three of these scents are amazing. The initial burst of manly scent is quite pleasant and then it dissipates as time goes on. A lot of beard oils make you feel like you are walking around in a fog of scent, as it is right there on your face. This one does not. Also, it doesn&#x27;t hurt any that my wife loves the scents. She actually rolled over in bed the other day, buried her nose in my beard and inhaled deeply. I commented on the &amp;#34;creepiness&amp;#34; of the act. Her response? &amp;#34;I just can&#x27;t help it your beard smells soooooo good.&amp;#34; So, ladies don&#x27;t fear your man smelling like a cologne factory. I assure you, BOTH of you will enjoy the scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before using this product, my beard would be very &amp;#34;wiry&amp;#34; and coarse. Now it is extremely soft and luscious. Not only that it is more manageable. Even without trimming my beard, this product manages to keep it tame and under control. Initially I feared it would leave my beard and face feeling like an oil slick. Au contraire!! If used properly (a little bit goes a looooong way) my beard and face absorb the oil readily and look great all day. I found it is best to apply immediately after showering while my beard is still damp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to EVERYBODY who loves their beard (or their man&#x27;s beard). My beard hasn&#x27;t looked, felt, and for that matter smelled any better than it does when I use this product. Keep up the good work.</li>
            <li> Its a pretty good deal to get the 3 pack.  All the scents are pretty good too, not the best I&#x27;ve ever had, but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Great products highly recommended</li>
            <li> Great smells. Maybe I&#x27;m doing it wrong, but it seems like a spray or mist would be more efficient. Bit of a challenge to get the droplets spread throughout my beard before it runs down the tip.</li>
            <li> Smells great, great shine, healthy beard. highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My husband loved all of them and I really enjoy the light scent, does make his beard softer and more kissable:)</li>
            <li> Made my beard look magical</li>
            <li> Great product! I have only been using this for a few weeks and I have noticed a considerable change in my beard. The smells are great and I will be using this again!</li>
