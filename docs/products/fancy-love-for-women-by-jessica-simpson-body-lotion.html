            <li> Cannot go wrong with this.  I get the most compliments when I wear this scent.  The lotion is wonderful.. goes on nicely and makes your skin feel great.  The scent stays with you all day as well, so you don&#x27;t actually need the cologne.  I&#x27;d recommend it for anyone that loves Fancy Love.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells so good, I want the whole line of fancy love products.</li>
            <li> This product arrived &amp; honestly smelled like &amp;#34;old perfume&amp;#34;! I am a huge &amp;#34;Fancy&amp;#34; fan &amp; but this at my local Bellk&#x27;s all the time. I saw this deal on Amazon &amp; thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Needless to say, I will now only buy my &amp;#34;Fancy&amp;#34; lotion, perfume, &amp; bath gel at Belks. This particular bottle literally smelled like it had been sitting around for a very long time, I know my &amp;#34;Fancy&amp;#34; &amp; this was not it.</li>
            <li> The small is amazing but the lotion is a little too runny..</li>
            <li> I Have the fragrance, received it yesterday and the lotion enhances like you would never believe. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> way to strong for someone my age so I gave it to my daughter-in law and she loved it. smells very nice on her. not the type of scent I would choose for myself.</li>
            <li> It Stinks....it&#x27;s watery it smells like medicine very disappointed</li>
            <li> You are the only one who had the lotion and at a wonderful price. I love it. I will definately be back for other items.</li>
            <li> I love both products I have been using Jessica Simpsons for years.  I am Johns wife.  Can&#x27;t say enough good things.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t as pleased with this scent as I had hoped to. Probably won&#x27;t order it again.</li>
            <li> Love this product, can&#x27;t beat the price when compared to retail stores!</li>

            <li> It is horrible. I am sending it back!!!</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance &amp; always receive compliments when wearing!  The price was definitely the deciding factor.  My daughter bought me this cologne for my birthday &amp; I just loved it, so I had to get the lotion too!</li>
            <li> Love it spells great!!!</li>
            <li> The Jessica Simpson Fancy Love body lotion that I purchased was absolutely horrible.  It smelled like it was old and did not smell  even close to what it should be. I will never order it on line again. It actually made me sick after smelling it.</li>
            <li> Smells soooo good. i used this over entire body. love it. want buy anything else, till they stop makeing this. i hope they never do.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! I get complimented all the time when I wear it and sometimes I wear it instead of my perfume for a lighter scent. Love it!</li>
