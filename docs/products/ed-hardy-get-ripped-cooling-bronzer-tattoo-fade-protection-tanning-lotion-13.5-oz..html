            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t really recommend anything with a bronzer.</li>
            <li>I gave to a brother whole loves it.</li>
            <li>But, I also ordered it online simply because it was a tattoo protector and fairly cheap.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I am a girl and I mistakenly bought this not knowing it was for men.  My bad, I didn&#x27;t read it all, just the indoor tanning and tat protector.  Anyway may I say the smell while completely confused me at first, I LOVE!!!  It&#x27;s a horrible aphrodisiac!!  Like drive me crazy smell!  Even my daughter has commented on the how good I smell when I wear this!  So MEN, WEAR this!!!  OMG it&#x27;s divine!!  It&#x27;s the Spanish Fly of lotions and I can only pray they make a cologne that smells this good!  I will continue to use this bottle up and until I find a man who smells this good I may just buy another, as they say Love thyself First ;)</li>
            <li> Just got my lotion in and used it for the first time today. Showed it to my tanning salon professional and she said it was the real deal same smell consistency and everything! They sell this for $80!!! Used it once smelled amazing with a light invisible bronzing effect! And super good results. Will always order from fusion hardware!</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband and he absolutely LOVES it!&lt;br /&gt;It has a great masculine smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering and doesn&#x27;t drastically fade.&lt;br /&gt;He likes the cooling effect and how it lasts for awhile after he tans.&lt;br /&gt;He has not seen any fading on his tattoo&#x27;s, be it the new ones or his older ones.&lt;br /&gt;It has good moisturizers, but the Ed Hardy line is pretty good for that.&lt;br /&gt;The bronzer we were both kinda worried about, because of that awful orange color people can get, but we have been pleasantly surprised by how well it works and with no orange-y skin!!&lt;br /&gt;One thing I like is that his tan doesn&#x27;t fade as quickly as it used to.&lt;br /&gt;This, for our family, is a definite reorder item.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell how it works right now, but it does no harm at least. with no iches or rash.</li>
            <li> Arrived Quickly.. I have used 2 times and can already see a big diffrence in my tan. I would recommend this if u are hard to tan abmnd on a budget.</li>
            <li> I like the smell, however the price might be a little high. I don&#x27;t see the Bronzer working like other bronzers. Over all if you like MAN smell its OK.</li>
            <li> Smells really good. The bronzer gives you a streaky appearance though.  It also washes away in the shower. Wouldn&#x27;t really recommend anything with a bronzer.</li>
            <li> Love the small and feel of this product. All i will use when tanning. I dont tan often but when i do this is my go to tanning asistant.</li>
            <li> Wish the smell was describes to me. It&#x27;s like AXE body spray. I gave to a brother whole loves it.</li>
            <li> I like it because it smells great, it works okay and it doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling sticky afterwards!  Love it a lot!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite tanning lotion.  It smells like cologne so I don&#x27;t have to wear something that smells fruity or like a girl.  This also has a cooling effect after you get out of the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> This lotion does what it needs to, but I didn&#x27;t realize it would smell like a man&#x27;s tanner. But, I also ordered it online simply because it was a tattoo protector and fairly cheap. I got what I needed and that&#x27;s all that matters!</li>
            <li> I have tried 20+ lotions in all price brackets.  As a guy, this is one of my new favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;  - after tan odor eliminator&lt;br /&gt;  - masculine cologne smell&lt;br /&gt;  - light weight serum, absorbs instantly&lt;br /&gt;  - not greasy, won&#x27;t cause breakouts&lt;br /&gt;  - excellent tanning accelerator and light bronzer (color after first session)&lt;br /&gt;  - unique cool &amp; refreshing effect&lt;br /&gt;  - helps keep your tattoos vibrant&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;  - not as moisturizing as silicone emulsion lotions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrap Up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  - This is very similar to the Devoted Creations Couture Sport lotion for men (yellow bottle/black cap)&lt;br /&gt;  - Great buy!</li>
            <li> Love the smell, best part of it.&lt;br /&gt;Rubs in great and if not rubbed in fully will not stain the skin like some other tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> This item arrived fast! And the smell is great! I love the cooling/tingling feeling from this when applied also! Overall, a-w-e-s-o-m-e!</li>
            <li> Cap broke off on day 2 ... made my whole body cold.... used in winter good summer lotion</li>
            <li> i received my lotion and i absolutely love it not oily at all  anyone tanning and with tattoos must try</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t seem to do much for me....The cooling bit seemed to be more of a burning sensation at times.  Plus, if I remember correctly (I quit using this a couple of months ago), it didn&#x27;t protect that well and I got a bit crispy - - which hasn&#x27;t happened with most of the lotions I&#x27;ve tried.....Oh and pay attention to the bit about the cap breaking...mine did and I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d hardly put any pressure on it.</li>
            <li> This Bronzer is really good. I have tried a couple different ones, but the Ed Hardy tanning lotion really stands up to its claim. I am buying this again.</li>
            <li> Seller was fine, shipment was good, but product did not work as good as I thought it would.  Not worth the cost.  Will look for something that works better for tattooes</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the smell. Waay too much fragrance. Not good for sensitive skin. I would not recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li> Love the product and the scent!</li>
            <li> I am used to Ed Hardy get ripped tanning lotion, so I thought I would order this since I LOVE bronzing lotions to tan with. However it did not work for me, &amp; that&#x27;s the only reason I gave it 2 stars. I contacted the seller &amp; they immediately credited my account back. I highly recommend this seller though.</li>
            <li> Not to happy with this tanning lotion. I wanted more from it for the price. It smells like man so that is good cause I gave it to my husband for Christmas but we are big tanners and the bronzer in it could be a lot better.</li>
            <li> I just got mine in the mail and it smells just like a man.. not sure if I will use it since im a girl...</li>
            <li> It smells like a guy if you oike that sent but women have tattoo s also so this one I don&#x27;t think I would buy again</li>
            <li> GOOD Stuff.  Just wished Id seen the silicone style before I bought this one.  Still great value and will def. use it but did buy the  2012 Black Elixir a few days ago.</li>
            <li> I really do like this stuff.  I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell though, and I dropped the lid and it shattered... :/ Bummer.  I still use the product, but I fear I may have reached my tanning plateau.  Still satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, not sure how much bronzer there is in this, i&#x27;ve used other lotions where they get me more tan faster, but this stuff works and the scent gets rid of the tanning smell...kinda lol</li>
            <li> I wanted to get this since I do have sleeve of tattoos and more. I wanted a lotion that would protect when I went to the tanning salon once a week ( I hate being pale,yuk). This is for men since it smells like a strong cologne, but in the description it did NOT say anything about being a male lotion. I had already opened it so I could not return it. I am using it and just coming home and showering immediately..</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Smells awesome and not to much oil</li>
            <li> It work&#x27;s great, but I don&#x27;t recommend it for women. I smelled like I was wearing men&#x27;s cologne. woman should not buy this one.</li>
