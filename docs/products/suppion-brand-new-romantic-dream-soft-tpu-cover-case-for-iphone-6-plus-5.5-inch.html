            <li>It&#x27;s was cheap</li>
            <li>so what can I expect does fit on my phone</li>
            <li>but it is cheap silicon/plastic</li>

            <li>The power cut off didn&#x27;t fit the charging wire.</li>

            <li>Maybe this wasn&#x27;t made clear in the description, but I bought this case for my iPhone 6, which is almost 5.5 inches long (the dimension included in the title), but the actual case is much too big for my phone</li>
