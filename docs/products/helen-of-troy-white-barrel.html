            <li>, it is ok.</li>
            <li>My wife has been using this brush iron product for many years.</li>
            <li>&quot; is the perfect size for short haircuts.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s okay--</li>
            <li>It is working OK for me.</li>
            <li>I love having the comb like barrel for ease in curling.</li>
            <li>I love it also love the 3/4 inch brush and the 1/2 inch curling iron I bought to., will be shopping at Amazon again, thank you..</li>
            <li>I have used these brush irons for years and love them (but I still have to use a cotton glove on one hand or I burn my fingers).</li>
            <li>just wanted something to run thru my hair quickly on days I do not feel like fixing my hair but still want to look decent..serves the purpose well and am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Helen of Troy 1512/1511 works perfect, Does get extremely hot on the high setting</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy for me to handle at my age</li>
            <li>but this will do just fine.</li>
            <li>This one I have now is fine.</li>
            <li>It came really quickly too!</li>
            <li>I find that it heats up quickly and reliably, and does a very good job of curling my short, baby-fine hair.</li>
            <li>the light on it didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>Was happy to receive my Helen of Troy 1512 and I can&#x27;t say enough about it.  </li>
            <li>I love the size and the heat is right with 2 settings.</li>
            <li>The one downside is you cannot remove the combs to clean the unit or replace them</li>
            <li>I can remove the spokes and clean the barrell.</li>
            <li>The wife likes it so much that she asked for more for Christmas.</li>
            <li>It does a good job, but some pieces of hair are just too short for its barrel.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a cool tip.</li>
            <li>Stays hot and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I loved the brush-I have purchased several of this same brush from Amazon-I keep my hair very short &amp; this size is perfect for a quick style.</li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted and work fine.</li>
            <li>It heats quickly.  </li>
            <li>It does heat up quite quickly</li>
            <li>I read several reviews of this styling brush iron and also of some others before deciding to try this one, mainly because the price was right and most people liked it.</li>
            <li>Light weight and heats up fast</li>
            <li>This is great and I purchased it to have as a spare for the one I purchased a few years ago.  </li>
            <li>The store where she originally purchased does not carry this particular model.</li>
            <li>This iron give me great curls that will last several days.  </li>
            <li>I like it very much.  </li>
            <li>And of course once the teeth fall off, then you start burning your head when the hot iron touches your scalp.  </li>
            <li>This curling brush is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Broke in the first week</li>
            <li>This is not the first one I have bought of this brand.  </li>
            <li>Gets really hot and doesn&#x27;t have an auto off</li>
            <li>/&gt;It only has two settings (low/high) compared to Conair&#x27;s many.  </li>
            <li>I see now from reading negative reviews that many others have experienced the very same problem.</li>
            <li>Was wanting hot air brush.</li>
            <li>My hair is short, fine and straight.  </li>
            <li>I really like this curling brush</li>
            <li>However, I would absolutely purchase again.</li>
            <li>After only a couple uses the barrel disconnected from the handle and moved freely around.  </li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t get much of a curl.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>It is a very well made iron.</li>
            <li>The handle was too long for me to use easily.</li>
            <li>and it is better than any other curling iron I have had.  </li>
            <li>I had already thrown away the packaging because, really, who expects a brand new product not to work?  </li>
            <li>Just what we expected, was shipped quickly with no problems, thanks.</li>
            <li>It is the right size barrel for short hair.  </li>
            <li>I have had one of these for years, but one of the brushes kept sliding out of the barrel, so I purchased a new one.</li>
            <li>and I could not return or exchange it for a new one.  </li>
            <li>I did not use Amazon for the new one.</li>
            <li>Not as nice as my old brush, but this barrel size is hard to find.</li>
            <li>It did not get hot enough to curl my hair.</li>
            <li>It is cheap, and still not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Still</li>
            <li>B001BO0KMC Instant Heat Hot Brush, 1 1/4-Inch]].  </li>
            <li>The brushs are too far apart.</li>
            <li>This is a professional product.  </li>
            <li>This iron was not used everyday either--just occasionally when more body was desired.  </li>
            <li>On top of that, I am just 12 days past the return period on this ..... how convienent for them!  </li>
            <li>So it seems like the quality has steadily declined to where it lasts only a month.  </li>
            <li>The high setting on Helen of Troy seems to deliver the same amount of heat as Conair&#x27;s highest setting, so I&#x27;m happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This size is difficult to find just anywhere and it works perfectly, I am very pleased and will be ordering another one for the travel bag soon.</li>
            <li>I still like it, but have only had this new one for awhile and one of the brushes is sliding out of the barrel, so</li>
            <li>I keep using it to train the curls clear until my next perm.</li>
            <li>Any type hot brush is hard to find in a real store, so I started my initial search at Amazon instead.  </li>
            <li>My hair is soft, fine, and thin.  </li>
            <li>I keep my hair short, so I&#x27;ve had no trouble mentioned in some reviews with my hair getting twisted in the &amp;#34;joint.&amp;#34; My hair is also very fine.</li>
            <li>All other curling brushes were too large for her short hair</li>
            <li>You can burn your fingers, since the space is too large and your fingers go down to the iron.</li>
            <li>The first one I bought lasted about 3 years or so, the next one I bought lasted about one and half years.  </li>
            <li>I normally buy my curling irons at a local beauty supply store, but the last two didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>I did try it out and my one complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t get very hot.</li>
            <li>Probably because hair is thin and fine.</li>
            <li>The little brushes are removable for cleaning and the handle is nicely shaped so your hand doesn&#x27;t get tired.</li>

            <li> My five star rating has gone down to one because this brush iron lasted ten months before a row of teeth simply broke off, and can&#x27;t be fixed or replaced.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t even aware it happened--found out the hard way by getting a big forehead burn.  </li>
            <li> my old one breaks down</li>
            <li> The tines could be a bit longer but, other than that being a personal preference, this Brush/Iron works well.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I found out that the dimension of the rod isn&#x27;t right for my current style</li>
            <li> Only used a little.</li>
            <li> bristles are so hard and far apart</li>
            <li> Not very hot.  </li>
            <li> We had this only a few months when parts started falling off of it.  </li>
            <li> This is because the plate around the circumference is not smooth enough.  </li>
            <li> Teeth are short and round on the end</li>
            <li> so be careful.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t give curl like I expected.</li>
            <li> I have short hair and need a small curling brush.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to be caught without one if mine breaks down.  </li>
            <li> bucket lids are kust what i wanted but could be a little thicker.</li>
            <li> As I stated previously I have purchased several-not because of poor quality-but the wear &amp; tear of constant use on my part.</li>
            <li> Basically a waste of money</li>
            <li> It is not smooth.  </li>
            <li> I have short thin hair</li>
            <li> I have had trouble finding this item.  </li>
            <li> The teeth (bristles) are made of a hard plastic &amp; are rather sharp, not well-finished.  </li>
            <li> I looked everywhere and couldn&#x27;t find anything this small.  </li>
            <li> You cannot find these small curling brushes in the stores</li>
            <li> My mom needed a small barrel curling brush but could not find one in stores.  </li>
            <li> so when I order I usually order two.</li>
            <li> It is so hard to find a curling iron with a small barrel and brushes.  </li>
            <li> Guess I was not thinking how small the barrel would be, because it is small!</li>
            <li> It is hard to find one this size with the prongs to hold the hair.  </li>
            <li> Hard to wrap my hair around it.  </li>
            <li> The size is hard to find.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find the 1/2&amp;#34; barrel in the brush iron</li>
            <li> you, Amazon, for stocking a hard to find product and thank you, Helen of Troy, for making it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to hold the tip without your fingers feeling the heat.</li>
            <li> I think I would be difficult to use with short, thin hair without burning your head.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed in Amazon, or whoever it is that has put these restrictions on such items.</li>
            <li> The teeth on the brush have broken off in spots.</li>
            <li> and it ended up getting broken.</li>
            <li> Got this for a family member and this is just what she wanted, she likes the thin barrel compared to thicker ones.</li>
            <li> Not happy!!!!</li>
            <li> It is totally useless.  </li>
            <li> VERY disappointed, to say the least.</li>
            <li> and it is impossible for me to use a curling iron with no brushes.  </li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment!  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t turn off after 20 or 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Very, very frustrated in my purchased!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this model of curling brush for over 10 years.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I found out that the dimension of the rod isn&#x27;t right for my current style so I&#x27;m not using it regularly.  I did try it out and my one complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t get very hot.</li>
            <li> It did not get hot enough to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> The handle was too long for me to use easily.</li>
            <li> Wife likes  the roller</li>
            <li> I like it very much.  I  have a torn ligament in my right arm and it is hard for me to curl my hair myself but my neighbor does it for me and it comes out great.  I would recommend it to anyone who asked me about it.</li>
            <li> Lovely product but sadly useless here in Ireland as it does not have dual voltage.</li>
            <li> I have short hair and need a small curling brush.  I looked everywhere and couldn&#x27;t find anything this small.  I looked on line and found it so I ordered it.  I really like this curling brush and it works for me just perfect.</li>
            <li> It is the right size barrel for short hair.  It is hard to find one this size with the prongs to hold the hair.  I have only one small problem, it doesn&#x27;t heat up as fast as my bigger one.  However, I would absolutely purchase again.</li>
            <li> The product received is like the one described and works properly for its use. My wife is very happy with it</li>
            <li> Just what we expected, was shipped quickly with no problems, thanks.</li>
            <li> Not happy!!!! Second time I tried to use it a row of the brush came out!  Would not recommend this prouduct</li>
            <li> After only a couple uses the barrel disconnected from the handle and moved freely around.  Basically a waste of money</li>
            <li> Hard to wrap my hair around it.  Probably because hair is thin and fine.</li>
            <li> I read several reviews of this styling brush iron and also of some others before deciding to try this one, mainly because the price was right and most people liked it. I have not been disappointed. I keep my hair short, so I&#x27;ve had no trouble mentioned in some reviews with my hair getting twisted in the &amp;#34;joint.&amp;#34; My hair is also very fine. The 1/2-inch barrel on this brush is perfect for my hair. I get a perm about every 3 months, &amp; I use this brush from day one of a perm to &amp;#34;fill out&amp;#34; the curls. I keep using it to train the curls clear until my next perm. I love it!</li>
            <li> You cannot find these small curling brushes in the stores&lt;br /&gt;and I was happy to find them online.  They&lt;br /&gt;are exactly what I wanted and work fine.</li>
            <li> It works great and heats up fast.  Makes a good curl.  I am very glad I ordered it.  I would order it again.</li>
            <li> Was everything I hoped it to be.  Light weight and heats up fast</li>
            <li> I like this curling brush works great for me</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with my Helen of Troy Brush Iron.</li>
            <li> We had this only a few months when parts started falling off of it.  And of course once the teeth fall off, then you start burning your head when the hot iron touches your scalp.  It is cheap, and still not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Still, the 1/2 inch barrel was very handy while it worked...</li>
            <li> If, you have a lot of hair, it might work for you, but if you don&#x27;t have lot of hair, &amp;#34;DON&#x27;T BOTHER&amp;#34; buying this brush iron.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are so hard and far apart, I can&#x27;t get much of a curl.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t turn off after 20 or 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Very, very frustrated in my purchased!</li>
            <li> I have ordered this iron from another source for years and the iron is not the same. The brushs are too far apart. You can burn your fingers, since the space is too large and your fingers go down to the iron.</li>
            <li> I loved the brush-I have purchased several of this same brush from Amazon-I keep my hair very short &amp; this size is perfect for a quick style. As I stated previously I have purchased several-not because of poor quality-but the wear &amp; tear of constant use on my part.</li>
            <li> This item does NOT heat up to more than tepid.  It is totally useless.  I would not recommend this at all.</li>
            <li> The teeth (bristles) are made of a hard plastic &amp; are rather sharp, not well-finished.  Not as nice as my old brush, but this barrel size is hard to find.</li>
            <li> This model has 5 rows of bristles, my current one (another brand) has 8.  I think I would be difficult to use with short, thin hair without burning your head.  I did not even plug it in to test the heat.</li>
            <li> This curling brush is exactly what I wanted. I have been purchasing this type curling iron at a beauty supply store, but was dissatisfied with the rising costs and the low quality of the styler. This meets my needs beautifully and is a better value.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted. Good quality so far and good price.</li>
            <li> It is not smooth.  It grabs my hair and does not want to let it go.  This is because the plate around the circumference is not smooth enough.  Consequently, it pulls out a lot of my hair.  Other than that, it is ok.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this brush iron product for many years. The store where she originally purchased does not carry this particular model. This was the second time that I purchased this for her as I was ordering something else from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Wanted for that additional hair styling. Is perfect and found no faults as some comments shown. Can&#x27;t complain, It works to my satisfaction.</li>
            <li> My mom needed a small barrel curling brush but could not find one in stores.  I found this one and ordered it for her.  She loves it.  It came really quickly too!</li>
            <li> The wife likes it so much that she asked for more for Christmas. The size is hard to find. The product is well made. The one downside is you cannot remove the combs to clean the unit or replace them</li>
            <li> Not very hot.  You gave mr a refund.</li>
            <li> The curling brush didn&#x27;t work.  I had already thrown away the packaging because, really, who expects a brand new product not to work?  VERY disappointed, to say the least.</li>
            <li> excellent service wonderful product</li>
            <li> It works great and meets my expectations.  The tines could be a bit longer but, other than that being a personal preference, this Brush/Iron works well.  This was a good buy at a great price and with quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Great brush iron - great price.</li>
            <li> Broke in the first week</li>
            <li> I received this brush iron at the begining of January, 2013.  Today, February 12, 2013, it no longer is working.  What a disappointment!  This is not the first one I have bought of this brand.  The first one I bought lasted about 3 years or so, the next one I bought lasted about one and half years.  So it seems like the quality has steadily declined to where it lasts only a month.  On top of that, I am just 12 days past the return period on this ..... how convienent for them!  I have already located another brand that I will be buying now - won&#x27;t be returning to Helen of Troy brand again.</li>
            <li> Purchased for a friend who could not find this product anywhere else.  She is very happy with it.  All other curling brushes were too large for her short hair</li>
            <li> I love this brush iron!!  My hair is soft, fine, and thin.  It does a good job on it.  It is hard to find the 1/2&amp;#34; barrel in the brush iron so when I order I usually order two.</li>
            <li> It has a slot at the end for removing the strips of teeth for cleaning.  It heats quickly.  Teeth are short and round on the end so no tangles.  All around wonderful product.</li>
            <li> This is a professional product.  Gets really hot and doesn&#x27;t have an auto off so be careful.</li>
            <li> The teeth on the brush have broken off in spots. Only used a little. The plastic body seem very light and flimsy.</li>
            <li> Why didn&#x27;t I buy this size brush iron sooner?  I have short, layered hair and have been using [[ASIN:B001BO0KMC Instant Heat Hot Brush, 1 1/4-Inch]].  It does a good job, but some pieces of hair are just too short for its barrel. Any type hot brush is hard to find in a real store, so I started my initial search at Amazon instead.  1/2\\&quot; is the perfect size for short haircuts.  I prefer added body rather than outright curls, and this does that if the barrel is kept on my hair for about 6-8 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only has two settings (low/high) compared to Conair&#x27;s many.  That&#x27;s okay--once I found the perfect Conair setting, I never moved it elsewhere anyway.  The high setting on Helen of Troy seems to deliver the same amount of heat as Conair&#x27;s highest setting, so I&#x27;m happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Amazon, for stocking a hard to find product and thank you, Helen of Troy, for making it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11-12-2013 UPDATE:  My five star rating has gone down to one because this brush iron lasted ten months before a row of teeth simply broke off, and can&#x27;t be fixed or replaced.  I wasn&#x27;t even aware it happened--found out the hard way by getting a big forehead burn.  This iron was not used everyday either--just occasionally when more body was desired.  I see now from reading negative reviews that many others have experienced the very same problem.</li>
            <li> It is working OK for me. I do like that I can remove the spokes and clean the barrell. It does heat up quite quickly</li>
            <li> I love the size and the heat is right with 2 settings.</li>
            <li> Guess I was not thinking how small the barrel would be, because it is small! I have short thin hair and I wish I had got a larger barrel.</li>
            <li> I normally buy my curling irons at a local beauty supply store, but the last two didn&#x27;t last long. I thought I would try online and found this one. It is a very well made iron. I find that it heats up quickly and reliably, and does a very good job of curling my short, baby-fine hair. (I bought the 1/2 inch barrel.) The little brushes are removable for cleaning and the handle is nicely shaped so your hand doesn&#x27;t get tired. This was a bargain at the price. And i am looking good!</li>
            <li> It is a good product. Bought as a gift and they really liked it!</li>
            <li> I have had trouble finding this item.  It works great and was shipped quickly!  My mother in law is very happy!</li>
            <li> I have had this curling brush for several years and I don&#x27;t like it for a couple of reasons. 1. It doesn&#x27;t have a cool tip. It&#x27;s hard to hold the tip without your fingers feeling the heat. 2. The tip has a grove in it. If the grove lines up with one of the brushes the brush has a tendency to fall out. I had 1 to fall out and it ended up getting broken. Now I have one spot that is like a curling iron and I have a tendency to burn myself.</li>
            <li> I should have bought another one. My wife uses this constantly. Too often she is in a rush and forgets to turn it off so, after a while we are having to get another. She can&#x27;t be with out it.</li>
            <li> Was wanting hot air brush. Doesn&#x27;t give curl like I expected.</li>
            <li> I AM VERY HAPPY WITH MY HELEN OF TROY BRUSH IRON!</li>
            <li> It is perfect!!  Thank you.</li>
            <li> The brush part of the curling irons fall out.  You have to keep turning the tip to keep them in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bucket lids are kust what i wanted but could be a little thicker.</li>
            <li> Works great however, I was trying to find a 3/8&amp;#34; barrel but this will do just fine.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t like my other brush iron I had but just a used brush iron that was the same as my old one--was $30 and the light on it didn&#x27;t work.  This one I have now is fine.</li>
            <li> Got this for a family member and this is just what she wanted, she likes the thin barrel compared to thicker ones.</li>
            <li> My short hair loves this iron.  Does the job well!!  Stays hot and easy to use.  I love having the comb like barrel for ease in curling.</li>
            <li> I have had one of these for years, but one of the brushes kept sliding out of the barrel, so I purchased a new one. I still like it, but have only had this new one for awhile and one of the brushes is sliding out of the barrel, so that is an inconvenience. That is why I only gave it four stars instead of five.</li>
            <li> just wanted something to run thru my hair quickly on days I do not feel like fixing my hair but still want to look decent..serves the purpose well and am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love it also love the 3/4 inch brush and the 1/2 inch curling iron I bought to., will be shopping at Amazon again, thank you..</li>
            <li> I could never get the hang of curling irons and was forever burning my cheek, ear, and fingers. I have used these brush irons for years and love them (but I still have to use a cotton glove on one hand or I burn my fingers).</li>
            <li> Helen of Troy 1512/1511 works perfect, Does get extremely hot on the high setting but I just use the low setting&lt;br /&gt;and it performs miracles if you want beautiful curls! love it!</li>
            <li> Great, I am always looking for these hen my old one breaks down</li>
            <li> Was happy to receive my Helen of Troy 1512 and I can&#x27;t say enough about it.  My hair is short, fine and straight.  This iron give me great curls that will last several days.  It&#x27;s easy for me to handle at my age and it is better than any other curling iron I have had.  Will be ordering another to keep on hand.</li>
            <li> I ordered this in December and did not need to use it until recently.  I like the product except this one I received was defective.  The handle turned and I could not tighten the screws.  It was nor repairable.  When I went to purchase another one, it was an add on product and I could not return or exchange it for a new one.  I am disappointed in Amazon, or whoever it is that has put these restrictions on such items. I did not use Amazon for the new one.</li>
            <li> This size is difficult to find just anywhere and it works perfectly, I am very pleased and will be ordering another one for the travel bag soon.</li>
            <li> It is so hard to find a curling iron with a small barrel and brushes.  I have severe arthritis in my hands and it is impossible for me to use a curling iron with no brushes.  This is great and I purchased it to have as a spare for the one I purchased a few years ago.  I don&#x27;t want to be caught without one if mine breaks down.  This is a great product.</li>
