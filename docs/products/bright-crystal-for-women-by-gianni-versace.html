            <li>and I definitely got the best deal at amazon.com.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fan of Fresh scents and Versace&#x27; s Bright Crystal fell under that category.</li>
            <li>I love how this smells.</li>

            <li>I love it.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful scent and I will continue to wear it for a long time..</li>
            <li>was great, smooth transaction, and fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I totally agree with this seller, it was a very good product.</li>
            <li>Secondly, there are some very very very good knock offs out there.</li>
            <li>This is the real Versace Bright Crystal fragrance.  </li>
            <li>price was good &amp; fast shipping</li>
            <li>I always ask her what she wants because of thinking what smells good on the floor of Macy&#x27;s or Nordstrom on someone else does not translate to her.  </li>
            <li>It is a good product is 100% real</li>
            <li>price is good for the whole bottle</li>
            <li>Perhaps I got a faulty bottle, but I plan on giving it to a friend or family member since its a popular scent right now.</li>
            <li>To be fair, I could easily see this perfume giving people with more sensitive noses a headache.</li>
            <li>The smell is so clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li>I love how clean this perfume smells.</li>
            <li>It was so easy on Amazon to order this perfume.  </li>
            <li>Arrive very quickly</li>
            <li>This perfume is not as strong as the ones I have tried in the dept. stores.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the sweet and seductive smell of this perfume.</li>
            <li>delivery was quick..:-)</li>
            <li>Very light, airy, citrusy, fresh scent.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>That was a nice unexpected surprise! :)</li>
            <li>This is fresh, and if I had to choose the prominent note - it would be grapefruit.</li>
            <li>I got a 80% filled in bottle.</li>
            <li>I can say it really does smell nice.  </li>
            <li>in the duty free</li>
            <li>The scent is ultra feminine and light.</li>
            <li>To tell if it is genuine look at the box.</li>
            <li>Made for an awesome gift, definitely the real thing.</li>
            <li>just got it today, and I was amazed at how fast it shipped, but most of all, I am amazed at how good and REAL it smells.</li>
            <li>i dont really use gucci perfume but the smell is great and very feminine..</li>
            <li>sample a lot of fragrance until I settle on one that I really love and right now</li>
            <li>Just make sure it is the right one because you won&#x27;t get a refund on this one.</li>
            <li>but not bad not too strong.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>Light, fresh scent that doesn&#x27;t arrive in the room before you do!  </li>
            <li>The smell is fresh and clean and I get lots of compliments on the way I smell!</li>
            <li>Amazing smell, not too strong, not so soft.</li>
            <li>excelente producto, 100% ORIGINAL</li>
            <li>so  was familiar with the fragrance&lt;br</li>
            <li>The original does not stay on me.</li>
            <li>Original perfume.</li>
            <li>you enjoy a light floral scent, I definitely recommend BRIGHT CRYSTAL by Versace.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Still worth it though!</li>
            <li>So worth it!</li>
            <li>Women don&#x27;t realize how much alcohol can be overwhelming in cheap scents.</li>
            <li>The type of bathroom that&#x27;s clean</li>
            <li>I was instantly sold on the Bright Crystal.</li>
            <li>A delicate and delicious aroma.</li>
            <li>Pay more to get the real version else where.</li>
            <li>Whenever I&#x27;d go to a department store,  I&#x27;d spray myself head to toe with it because it became my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li>my girl friend loves it, and for sure its the real one.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s &amp;#34;inviting&amp;#34;... not over bearing, too sweet, or acrid or talcum-like oder.</li>
            <li>Well, I loved that scent when I tried it in the store ... when it arrived it didn&#x27;t smell quite the same, but maybe it was just an interaction with my skin ...</li>
            <li>all the way thanks again:-))))))</li>
            <li>it is the real deal. :-)</li>
            <li>perfume smell not bad</li>
            <li>It is very sweet, but light enough so it isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li>a lot alcohol came quickly and just like in the pictures</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery...</li>
            <li>Received quickly and product as decribed</li>

            <li>All I can say is ladies if you don&#x27;t have this Buy It&amp;#34;It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>Definately worth ordering from this seller</li>
            <li>but it is worth it...</li>
            <li>Because the scent is not overpowering and very clean, I don&#x27;t have to worry about it being too loud in an office setting.</li>
            <li>Just right.</li>
            <li>Nice... clean smelling,  a bit refreshing and subtle.  </li>
            <li>I think this smell blends well with my natural chemicals and smells great all day long.</li>
            <li>I like the new absolute better.</li>
            <li>sure you smelled this perfume before you make a purchase, apparently you cannot return  perfumes on amazon.</li>
            <li>I have wanted to own this perfume for a LONG time.</li>
            <li>Very classy, light aroma</li>
            <li>First time smells looks just alcohol and very light flower like rose/lotus smell, but I spray next day and it&#x27;s smell</li>
            <li>Very good deal for the price listed versus going to a department store and purchasing behind the beauty counter.</li>
            <li>Thank you for being exactly what you said you were.  </li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a fake scent.</li>
            <li>I bought this product for my mom on Mother&#x27;s Day and she instantly fell in love with the scent.</li>
            <li>The first maybe 15-20 sprays it did smell like rubbing alcohol</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT and will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>Thanks amazon!</li>
            <li>My first purchase of it seemed to be the &amp;#34;real thing.&amp;#34;  This one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Versace bright crystal has been my signature scent for a few years.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t pay more than $20 in future...</li>
            <li>And that is after spraying a pretty hefty amount on myself - like 10 sprays.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, but would not get it again because you have to put a lot on just to get it to last.</li>
            <li>I really like how this smells on my girlfriend!</li>
            <li>put on a few drops in the morning and BRIGHT CRYSTAL is with me all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and you saved a pretty penny</li>
            <li>One of my absolute favorites!</li>
            <li>Great smelling perfume that last a long time!</li>
            <li>BRIGHT CRYSTAL is a pink liquid that comes in a rectangular clear bottle with an oversized oval-cut ‚Äúcrystal‚Äù stopper.</li>
            <li>a couple of days later it was more mist like but still way too much for one spot on my skin.</li>
            <li>In the past I have used this Bright Crystal and I know how it smells and how it lasts.  </li>
            <li>To tell if it is really versace first off, their perfume sells for 100s of dollars a bottle Exp:Yellow crystal on the Versace website is the cheapest perfume at $110 a bottle.</li>
            <li>Subtle and sexy, love it</li>
            <li>CRYSTAL is like standing in a flower garden on a warm spring day and having a slight breeze blow just a hint of the garden&#x27;s aroma in your direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My bottle was not open, tampered with, or have a strong alcohol smell.</li>
            <li>This product is pure alcohol and it smells funky</li>
            <li>At first it squirted a steady stream,</li>
            <li>I was really excited about getting this perfume, but unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t smell strong, the smell fades away so fast that I feel I have to spray the whole bottle to be able to smell it.</li>
            <li>I also want everyone to no that this is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27; t have any concerns about it not being the real one.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a light floral scent that you can wear for any occasion (especially at the office), this is the perfume for you.</li>
            <li>The real deal.</li>
            <li>This is year two, and I am very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I sprayed it on myself and then came straight to amazon to get it at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>I go thru this way too fast, but I know it</li>
            <li>Also my sister in-law now wants some too.</li>
            <li>product is the real deal.</li>
            <li>but I really like it.</li>
            <li>My Wife absolutely loves this perfume.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky when it comes to fragrance.</li>
            <li>And came before I expected:)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the real thing...</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife and she absolutely loves it..</li>
            <li>I love Versace other brands</li>
            <li>I really like the crisp, clear smell this perfume has.</li>
            <li>One of my wife&#x27;s favorite perfumes and I paid about half of what it would cost in a department store.</li>
            <li>, Absolutely same thing jus different price smells astonishing</li>
            <li>The smell lasts for a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li>I love perfume and have been using 4 or five different ones that I alternate with</li>
            <li>High quality and the scent lasted all day.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be wearing this everyday to the office, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll receive tons of compliments.</li>
            <li>Some reviews are positive and maybe the got a good batch, but mine was definitely a knock off and not a good one at all.</li>
            <li>but I must say I stopped using the other ones because the Bright Crystal perfume is the only one I have ever had people comment about &amp;#34; especially men</li>
            <li>This is NOT what Bright Crystal is supposed to smell like, clearly a lot of alcohol has been added and very little of the actual perfume is in this bottle.</li>
            <li>Might be my new signature.</li>
            <li>My new fav.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a pretty spring/summer time fragrance.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume ever and it&#x27;s half the price!!</li>
            <li>Other perfumes I like are cool waters, Flowerbomb By Viktor &amp; Rolf , burberry.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife... who is a fifty something Asian woman... and very finicky about her body lotions and perfumes.  </li>
            <li>In fact she&#x27;s very slender and some products just don&#x27;t mix well with her personal body chemistry.  </li>
            <li>but I fixed it..</li>
            <li>Bought this for my sister, she&#x27;s in her early 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I really like this scent as well as Yellow Diamonds, also by Versace.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few different perfumes before and most of them have always worn off within an hour or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All day I felt VERY paranoid that I smelt like toilet water/bathroom ALL DAY and couldn&#x27;t wait to get home and shower</li>
            <li>It seems to last for a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li>It is long lasting too which is rare.</li>
            <li>The real one (that I got from Nordstrom smell stay all day long)</li>
            <li>Much larger bottle than the big name department store and much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Not the real thing, doesn&#x27;t last for the price, only have the name.</li>
            <li>I smelled the other first and then</li>
            <li>i start using it but dont last that long for the whole day..</li>
            <li>And the fact that I can get this large bottle for less than $60 bucks and one 1oz bottle is $50 at sephora</li>
            <li>- I can&#x27;t help but wonder if this is the REAL product, or a watered down version.  </li>
            <li>This perfume was a watered down or possibly completely fake version of Versace&#x27;s Bright Crystal.</li>

            <li> I would totally get another bottle of this as the smell is wonderful, however, it&#x27;s gone after 30 minutes max.</li>
            <li> This Versace perfume smell more like hairspray (alcohol ).  </li>

            <li> And a free lotion!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many fragrances but they never seem to be me.</li>
            <li> I love to wear it, but I don&#x27;t want to leave it on others after a handshake or a hug.</li>
            <li> Love to wear it during the day and night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller</li>
            <li> and I definitely got the best deal at amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Fresh scents and Versace&#x27; s Bright Crystal fell under that category.</li>
            <li> I love how this smells.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the perfume and my fianc&amp;eacute; bought it for me for my birthday.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> One of the best smelling fragrances next to Pleasures!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful scent and I will continue to wear it for a long time..</li>
            <li> was great, smooth transaction, and fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I totally agree with this seller, it was a very good product.</li>
            <li> Secondly, there are some very very very good knock offs out there.</li>
            <li> This is the real Versace Bright Crystal fragrance.  </li>
            <li> price was good &amp; fast shipping</li>
            <li> I always ask her what she wants because of thinking what smells good on the floor of Macy&#x27;s or Nordstrom on someone else does not translate to her.  </li>
            <li> It is a good product is 100% real</li>
            <li> price is good for the whole bottle</li>
            <li> Perhaps I got a faulty bottle, but I plan on giving it to a friend or family member since its a popular scent right now.</li>
            <li> To be fair, I could easily see this perfume giving people with more sensitive noses a headache.</li>
            <li> The smell is so clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li> I love how clean this perfume smells.</li>
            <li> It was so easy on Amazon to order this perfume.  </li>
            <li> Arrive very quickly</li>
            <li> This perfume is not as strong as the ones I have tried in the dept. stores.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love the sweet and seductive smell of this perfume.</li>
            <li> delivery was quick..:-)</li>
            <li> Very light, airy, citrusy, fresh scent.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> That was a nice unexpected surprise! :)</li>
            <li> This is fresh, and if I had to choose the prominent note - it would be grapefruit.</li>
            <li> I got a 80% filled in bottle.</li>
            <li> I can say it really does smell nice.  </li>
            <li> in the duty free</li>
            <li> The scent is ultra feminine and light.</li>
            <li> To tell if it is genuine look at the box.</li>
            <li> Made for an awesome gift, definitely the real thing.</li>
            <li> just got it today, and I was amazed at how fast it shipped, but most of all, I am amazed at how good and REAL it smells.</li>
            <li> i dont really use gucci perfume but the smell is great and very feminine..</li>
            <li> sample a lot of fragrance until I settle on one that I really love and right now</li>
            <li> Just make sure it is the right one because you won&#x27;t get a refund on this one.</li>
            <li> but not bad not too strong.</li>
            <li> Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Light, fresh scent that doesn&#x27;t arrive in the room before you do!  </li>
            <li> The smell is fresh and clean and I get lots of compliments on the way I smell!</li>
            <li> Amazing smell, not too strong, not so soft.</li>
            <li> excelente producto, 100% ORIGINAL</li>
            <li> so  was familiar with the fragrance&lt;br</li>
            <li> The original does not stay on me.</li>
            <li> Original perfume.</li>
            <li> you enjoy a light floral scent, I definitely recommend BRIGHT CRYSTAL by Versace.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Still worth it though!</li>
            <li> So worth it!</li>
            <li> Women don&#x27;t realize how much alcohol can be overwhelming in cheap scents.</li>
            <li> The type of bathroom that&#x27;s clean</li>
            <li> I was instantly sold on the Bright Crystal.</li>
            <li> A delicate and delicious aroma.</li>
            <li> Pay more to get the real version else where.</li>
            <li> Whenever I&#x27;d go to a department store,  I&#x27;d spray myself head to toe with it because it became my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li> my girl friend loves it, and for sure its the real one.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s &amp;#34;inviting&amp;#34;... not over bearing, too sweet, or acrid or talcum-like oder.</li>
            <li> Well, I loved that scent when I tried it in the store ... when it arrived it didn&#x27;t smell quite the same, but maybe it was just an interaction with my skin ...</li>
            <li> all the way thanks again:-))))))</li>
            <li> it is the real deal. :-)</li>
            <li> perfume smell not bad</li>
            <li> It is very sweet, but light enough so it isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li> a lot alcohol came quickly and just like in the pictures</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery...</li>
            <li> Received quickly and product as decribed</li>
            <li> Not too sweet, not too fresh.</li>
            <li> It smell Good and it stay on long.</li>
            <li> The product is not returnable because it is a hazardous flammable material or some crap, but amazon was awesome at customer service and they were able to help us out.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite and it is time for a new bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not to strong very feminine.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend buying perfume from amazon prime!!!</li>
            <li> It smells so good but doesn&#x27;t stay on for  very long!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is fresh, young, and lovely.</li>
            <li> All I can say is ladies if you don&#x27;t have this Buy It&amp;#34;It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Definately worth ordering from this seller</li>
            <li> but it is worth it...</li>
            <li> Because the scent is not overpowering and very clean, I don&#x27;t have to worry about it being too loud in an office setting.</li>
            <li> Just right.</li>
            <li> Nice... clean smelling,  a bit refreshing and subtle.  </li>
            <li> I think this smell blends well with my natural chemicals and smells great all day long.</li>
            <li> I like the new absolute better.</li>
            <li> sure you smelled this perfume before you make a purchase, apparently you cannot return  perfumes on amazon.</li>
            <li> I have wanted to own this perfume for a LONG time.</li>
            <li> Very classy, light aroma</li>
            <li> First time smells looks just alcohol and very light flower like rose/lotus smell, but I spray next day and it&#x27;s smell</li>
            <li> Very good deal for the price listed versus going to a department store and purchasing behind the beauty counter.</li>
            <li> Thank you for being exactly what you said you were.  </li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a fake scent.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my mom on Mother&#x27;s Day and she instantly fell in love with the scent.</li>
            <li> The first maybe 15-20 sprays it did smell like rubbing alcohol</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT and will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Thanks amazon!</li>
            <li> My first purchase of it seemed to be the &amp;#34;real thing.&amp;#34;  This one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Versace bright crystal has been my signature scent for a few years.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t pay more than $20 in future...</li>
            <li> And that is after spraying a pretty hefty amount on myself - like 10 sprays.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, but would not get it again because you have to put a lot on just to get it to last.</li>
            <li> I really like how this smells on my girlfriend!</li>
            <li> put on a few drops in the morning and BRIGHT CRYSTAL is with me all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and you saved a pretty penny</li>
            <li> One of my absolute favorites!</li>
            <li> Great smelling perfume that last a long time!</li>
            <li> BRIGHT CRYSTAL is a pink liquid that comes in a rectangular clear bottle with an oversized oval-cut ‚Äúcrystal‚Äù stopper.</li>
            <li> a couple of days later it was more mist like but still way too much for one spot on my skin.</li>
            <li> In the past I have used this Bright Crystal and I know how it smells and how it lasts.  </li>
            <li> To tell if it is really versace first off, their perfume sells for 100s of dollars a bottle Exp:Yellow crystal on the Versace website is the cheapest perfume at $110 a bottle.</li>
            <li> Subtle and sexy, love it</li>
            <li> CRYSTAL is like standing in a flower garden on a warm spring day and having a slight breeze blow just a hint of the garden&#x27;s aroma in your direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My bottle was not open, tampered with, or have a strong alcohol smell.</li>
            <li> This product is pure alcohol and it smells funky</li>
            <li> At first it squirted a steady stream,</li>
            <li> I was really excited about getting this perfume, but unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t smell strong, the smell fades away so fast that I feel I have to spray the whole bottle to be able to smell it.</li>
            <li> I also want everyone to no that this is the real deal.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27; t have any concerns about it not being the real one.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a light floral scent that you can wear for any occasion (especially at the office), this is the perfume for you.</li>
            <li> The real deal.</li>
            <li> This is year two, and I am very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> I sprayed it on myself and then came straight to amazon to get it at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> I go thru this way too fast, but I know it</li>
            <li> Also my sister in-law now wants some too.</li>
            <li> product is the real deal.</li>
            <li> but I really like it.</li>
            <li> My Wife absolutely loves this perfume.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky when it comes to fragrance.</li>
            <li> And came before I expected:)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the real thing...</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she absolutely loves it..</li>
            <li> I love Versace other brands</li>
            <li> I really like the crisp, clear smell this perfume has.</li>
            <li> One of my wife&#x27;s favorite perfumes and I paid about half of what it would cost in a department store.</li>
            <li> , Absolutely same thing jus different price smells astonishing</li>
            <li> The smell lasts for a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li> I love perfume and have been using 4 or five different ones that I alternate with</li>
            <li> High quality and the scent lasted all day.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be wearing this everyday to the office, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll receive tons of compliments.</li>
            <li> Some reviews are positive and maybe the got a good batch, but mine was definitely a knock off and not a good one at all.</li>
            <li> but I must say I stopped using the other ones because the Bright Crystal perfume is the only one I have ever had people comment about &amp;#34; especially men</li>
            <li> This is NOT what Bright Crystal is supposed to smell like, clearly a lot of alcohol has been added and very little of the actual perfume is in this bottle.</li>
            <li> Might be my new signature.</li>
            <li> My new fav.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a pretty spring/summer time fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume ever and it&#x27;s half the price!!</li>
            <li> Other perfumes I like are cool waters, Flowerbomb By Viktor &amp; Rolf , burberry.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife... who is a fifty something Asian woman... and very finicky about her body lotions and perfumes.  </li>
            <li> In fact she&#x27;s very slender and some products just don&#x27;t mix well with her personal body chemistry.  </li>
            <li> but I fixed it..</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sister, she&#x27;s in her early 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I really like this scent as well as Yellow Diamonds, also by Versace.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different perfumes before and most of them have always worn off within an hour or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All day I felt VERY paranoid that I smelt like toilet water/bathroom ALL DAY and couldn&#x27;t wait to get home and shower</li>
            <li> It seems to last for a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li> It is long lasting too which is rare.</li>
            <li> The real one (that I got from Nordstrom smell stay all day long)</li>
            <li> Much larger bottle than the big name department store and much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Not the real thing, doesn&#x27;t last for the price, only have the name.</li>
            <li> I smelled the other first and then</li>
            <li> i start using it but dont last that long for the whole day..</li>
            <li> And the fact that I can get this large bottle for less than $60 bucks and one 1oz bottle is $50 at sephora</li>
            <li> - I can&#x27;t help but wonder if this is the REAL product, or a watered down version.  </li>
            <li> This perfume was a watered down or possibly completely fake version of Versace&#x27;s Bright Crystal.</li>
            <li> I spent a very long time choosing a new signature scent in Macy&#x27;s</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not strong so the bottle seems to go down quickly</li>
            <li> Last a long time.</li>
            <li> Long lasting fragrance.very pleasing to the smell.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this perfume from AMAZON for a long time.</li>
            <li> It stays all day long.</li>
            <li> I have used this fragrance for long time</li>
            <li> That could be a plus or minus, depending on how long you want your frangrance to last.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money, the smell doesnt even seem to last an hour.</li>
            <li> and I got the same thing I would have got from Macy&#x27;s for half the price.</li>
            <li> Also the smell was lighter and a bit different than my previous purchase.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous because I saw some reviews about it possibly being a knock off...</li>
            <li> I had a little bit left in my bottle that I purchased at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> After cleaning the spout the scent came out as expected.</li>
            <li> It is just so fresh, and expensive smelling.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve been hesitating on buying this don&#x27;t waste another second.</li>
            <li> I wash a few days later.</li>
            <li> Ladies, not much is needed.</li>
            <li> Would absolutely NOT recommend.</li>
            <li> If pink had a smell, this is how it would smell.</li>
            <li> It was basically pink colored alcohol.</li>
            <li> I have read the other reviews and disagree.</li>
            <li> With first use, I think it might be fake.  </li>
            <li> It is excellent,more than expected!</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Ladies, please be careful when you order perfume!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!!</li>
            <li> It came a day earlier than expected and was at least $10.00 less than what it would cost else where.  </li>
            <li> It took a little longer than I wanted and expected</li>
            <li> My only complaint is I could not control the sprayer well.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Versace Crystal for at least 3 bottle, it doesn&#x27;t have the same texture.  </li>
            <li> I read some reviews that said it was watered down, but I don&#x27;t think it is at all</li>
            <li> I keep reordering this perfume from amazon every other month!</li>
            <li> Also, you&#x27;ll use less, because it won&#x27;t evaporate</li>
            <li> I have not found one review that said it was an odd smell.</li>
            <li> It arrived in less than two days from ordering it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly stronger than the others</li>
            <li> did some research on real v fake Versace perfumes, and I have to say that this is definitely the real thing.</li>
            <li> I ordered it, I started to worry that I just wasted almost $50 on a bad-smelling</li>
            <li> Initially I found my pump is broken</li>
            <li> Trying the perfume for the first time was painful, it smelled of syrup</li>
            <li> i can sniff this all day long and not get tired of it.</li>
            <li> I usually pay $80-90 at Macy&#x27;s</li>
            <li> , my boyfriends have been obsessed with smelling it on me, I get compliments from total strangers on the regs, and I usually stick with one for 1-3 years.</li>
            <li> I bought this after having the small tester.</li>
            <li> The name brand Versace perfume comes in a pink to baby pink ombre box with a textured Versace silver logo and words on box as well as a silver diamond patterned lid on box (attached is real very expensive perfume).</li>
            <li> It is juvenile and subtle.</li>
            <li> The reviews warned about this perfume being a knock off ,  I didn&#x27;t want to believe  Amazon would be dishonest about selling any of their products.  </li>
            <li> It was just very awkward because I had to explain to my fianc&amp;eacute; what happened and I felt guilty because he was so excited about the gift.</li>
            <li> It is watered down and scent is very weak.  </li>
            <li> It only took 6 days to arrive before Christmas during some very bad weather.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I ended up giving mine away too..  </li>
            <li> It was always too expensive, though.&lt;br</li>
            <li> self can&#x27;t go wrong wearing this</li>
            <li> I was WRONG.  </li>
            <li> WTF?</li>

            <li> Just got this recently - very disappointed in the strength</li>

            <li> Considering this was PRIME, i think that over 7 days for a prime item is horrible.  </li>

            <li> Thank you for being exactly what you said you were.  I love you dearly. ;-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been usung this parfume for last 4 years and it&#x27;s the best. Not too sweet, not too fresh. Just perfect. Can&#x27;t find anything better.</li>
            <li> I really like the crisp, clear smell this perfume has. To be fair, I could easily see this perfume giving people with more sensitive noses a headache. Either use in moderation or try a sample before purchasing it just to be safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, it is one of my all time favorite scents. It seems to last for a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li> Love it and the price was great.</li>
            <li> I really love the scent of this perfume.  It&#x27;s not to strong very feminine.  I also want everyone to no that this is the real deal.  It&#x27;s not a fake scent.</li>
            <li> Great price for a great product</li>
            <li> Every time I wear this fragrance people asks me what I&#x27;m wearing. I absolutely love it! It&#x27;s such a pretty spring/summer time fragrance.</li>
            <li> Nice light spring/summer perfume. Prefer the yellow diamond though.</li>
            <li> This was an awesome deal. One of my wife&#x27;s favorite perfumes and I paid about half of what it would cost in a department store.</li>
            <li> Best perfume ever! I love this and it&#x27;s all I wear, try it out!!!</li>
            <li> I have read the other reviews and disagree. I find the perfume to be beautiful. It is one of my favorites. It lasts for hours before I re-apply. I don&#x27; t have any concerns about it not being the real one. it&#x27;s beautiful. Have purchased twice and my friends love it on me.</li>
            <li> A delicate and delicious aroma.</li>
            <li> Amazing price and amazing quality!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a light floral scent that you can wear for any occasion (especially at the office), this is the perfume for you.</li>
            <li> Good Product, Good Service and Good Price.</li>
            <li> excelente producto, 100% ORIGINAL</li>
            <li> The real deal. I usually pay $80-90 at Macy&#x27;s and I got the same thing I would have got from Macy&#x27;s for half the price. I am very happy. I love this fragrance.. This and the yellow Versace is the best. Can&#x27;t wait to order more Versace</li>
            <li> Even though this perfume caused a skin reaction on me, I do miss the scent. My only complaint is I could not control the sprayer well. At first it squirted a steady stream, a couple of days later it was more mist like but still way too much for one spot on my skin. I smelled like I bathed in it. Perhaps I got a faulty bottle, but I plan on giving it to a friend or family member since its a popular scent right now.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, will shop again soon, Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> Thank You so much!!!&lt;br /&gt;Very good seller!&lt;br /&gt;Smells soooo good!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the sweet and seductive smell of this perfume. I bought this product for my mom on Mother&#x27;s Day and she instantly fell in love with the scent. She mentions that she&#x27;s been getting compliments ever since she started wearing it.</li>
            <li> Trying the perfume for the first time was painful, it smelled of syrup and I also smelled like syrup. I&#x27;m guessing glue may have gotten on the spout. After cleaning the spout the scent came out as expected. Very nice.</li>
            <li> I heard about it from a family friend so i had to order it. This is my favorite perfume EVER. My husband loves it too.</li>
            <li> Does not smell like the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; perfume like it claims to be. Pay more to get the real version else where. Not worth the money, the smell doesnt even seem to last an hour.</li>
            <li> Very classy, light aroma</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift for my mom and she loves it</li>
            <li> The first maybe 15-20 sprays it did smell like rubbing alcohol and now it smells like it should. If your gonna buy it, buy it for your self tho. Just incase you get one for someone and it smells like that</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the size of the product for the price.</li>
            <li> I call this my &amp;#34;signature&amp;#34; spray. I love everything about my Versace product! When I buy this in the stores Its $100 and was only $45 on amazon when I purchased it, Absolutely same thing jus different price smells astonishing lasts alllllllll day I love it!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful perfume! Nice, clean scent! Perfect for day or night and never gets old. I ordered this perfume (and this was the best price offered), and it came with a lotion too! That was a nice unexpected surprise! :)</li>
            <li> The smell is so clean and refreshing. The smell lasts for a decent amount of time. I reapply it once throughout the day. I Love it!</li>
            <li> I spent a very long time choosing a new signature scent in Macy&#x27;s (my last reg scent was Aqua di Gio). I LOVE this, my boyfriends have been obsessed with smelling it on me, I get compliments from total strangers on the regs, and I usually stick with one for 1-3 years. This is year two, and I am very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that some places describe it as floral, but I don&#x27;t know why. I hate floral scents. This is fresh, and if I had to choose the prominent note - it would be grapefruit. It is just so fresh, and expensive smelling. Women don&#x27;t realize how much alcohol can be overwhelming in cheap scents. Also, you&#x27;ll use less, because it won&#x27;t evaporate so quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is fresh, young, and lovely. A day or night scent. Definitely a you + crowd pleaser!</li>
            <li> Shipping was on time and price was great!&lt;br /&gt;Love it!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> my girlfriend and I love it.. very quick delivery!!</li>
            <li> Yes my daughter loved it</li>
            <li> Smells good; however, if you have allergies, I suggest you not buy it.  My son-in-law bought it for my daughter and noticed how his eyes would water and he would sneeze when she wore it.  She ended up giving it away.  My husband gave me a bottle of it for Christmas; it took me a while to realize that the reason I was sneezing and my eyes watering was because of the perfume; that&#x27;s when I found out that my son-in-law had reacted the same way.  Unfortunately, I ended up giving mine away too..  I haven&#x27;t had that reaction since.</li>
            <li> perfume smell not bad but I have lump of in my throat a lot alcohol came quickly and just like in the pictures</li>
            <li> Love it, wear it every day!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love Bright Crystals......I can&#x27;t see myself not having one around.  Best buy I have made in a while.</li>
            <li> My Wife, loves Versace and is very happy with her gift.</li>
            <li> With first use, I think it might be fake.  Keep using it for a week, I am sure it fake production.  I have been using this Versace Crystal for at least 3 bottle, it doesn&#x27;t have the same texture.  The smell of perfume is gone with in an hour.  The real one (that I got from Nordstrom smell stay all day long)</li>
            <li> Made for an awesome gift, definitely the real thing.</li>
            <li> I got a 80% filled in bottle. Also the smell was lighter and a bit different than my previous purchase. I have been buying this perfume from AMAZON for a long time. This time deeply disappointed.</li>
            <li> It came with a lotion that I wasn&#x27;t expecting so my friend received a gift set for Christmas and I didnt even know. Great price great value and my friend loved it!</li>
            <li> it was what it was supposed to be and smelled great</li>
            <li> My wife loves it. Which means I love it :P</li>
            <li> (She) loved the bottle, the fragrance, and felt a gift should have came with the bottle. She otherwise loved the purchase.</li>
            <li> price was good &amp; fast shipping</li>
            <li> delivery was quick..:-)</li>
            <li> My daughter was wanting me to purchase many items for her. I asked if she looked on Amazon. To our pleasant surprise she got what she wanted and I got a fair price for a nice product!</li>
            <li> Am I the only one that thinks this smells like a bathroom/toilet water? I tried it from a sampler and it smelled like a bathroom. The type of bathroom that&#x27;s clean but it&#x27;s like a public bathroom - that type of bathroom. All day I felt VERY paranoid that I smelt like toilet water/bathroom ALL DAY and couldn&#x27;t wait to get home and shower it was that bad to me. I have not found one review that said it was an odd smell. I don&#x27;t know if my nose is horrible or what, but I can&#x27;t deal with this scent.</li>
            <li> The smell is fresh and clean and I get lots of compliments on the way I smell! I love this! It stays on me all day and doesn&#x27;t wear off at the end of the day. I would recommend this to anyone! I read some reviews that said it was watered down, but I don&#x27;t think it is at all, I love it!! :)</li>
            <li> My wife is happy so that means it is an awesome product great price 100% satisfied, 100% real</li>
            <li> It was a gift for a female friend of mine. It smells great on her.</li>
            <li> This perfume was an amazing gift for my mom and she loves the scent! Versace is an amazing manufacturer. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this scent for 8 years. I love it!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect summery perfume! It is very sweet, but light enough so it isn&#x27;t overwhelming. Beautiful fragrance! The bottle is lovely too!</li>
            <li> I have wanted to own this perfume for a LONG time. Whenever I&#x27;d go to a department store,  I&#x27;d spray myself head to toe with it because it became my absolute favorite. It was always too expensive, though.&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to search through Amazon and lo and behold I found this &amp;#34;upper class&amp;#34; perfume for $47. Yes, it seemed too good to be true, but for e reason, I still decided to get it.&lt;br /&gt;After I ordered it, I started to worry that I just wasted almost $50 on a bad-smelling fake.&lt;br /&gt;I just got it today, and I was amazed at how fast it shipped, but most of all, I am amazed at how good and REAL it smells. The &amp;#34;staying power&amp;#34; is the same and so is the smell.&lt;br /&gt;I did some research on real v fake Versace perfumes, and I have to say that this is definitely the real thing. LOVE IT and will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Happy item was received quickly.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I love the smell, fair price</li>
            <li> Subtle and sexy, love it</li>
            <li> my girl friend loves it, and for sure its the real one.  for a amazing price... delivered on time. thank you</li>
            <li> This Versace is my favorite perfume.  I love the smell. reece@roadrunner.com. This is my third purchase of Crystal and will continue to use it. Love, love, love it.</li>
            <li> My wife loved it.  It arrived the next day.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife... who is a fifty something Asian woman... and very finicky about her body lotions and perfumes.  It came a day earlier than expected and was at least $10.00 less than what it would cost else where.  It not only was as advertised I can say it really does smell nice.  From my stance I really like it.  It&#x27;s &amp;#34;inviting&amp;#34;... not over bearing, too sweet, or acrid or talcum-like oder. Nice... clean smelling,  a bit refreshing and subtle.  I always ask her what she wants because of thinking what smells good on the floor of Macy&#x27;s or Nordstrom on someone else does not translate to her.  In fact she&#x27;s very slender and some products just don&#x27;t mix well with her personal body chemistry.  Off the top of my head I can&#x27;t compare it... but do know she also likes Beautiful perfume too.</li>
            <li> I love it! and will continue using it but it&#x27;s fade out after 2 hours :(&lt;br /&gt;Great price BTW. in the duty free it&#x27;s cost $80</li>
            <li> This is the real Versace Bright Crystal fragrance.  My bottle was not open, tampered with, or have a strong alcohol smell. I love how clean this perfume smells. I tried it out at Macy&#x27;s. I wanted to try a fendi  scent, but the salesman asked me to try Bright Crystal and another Versace scent. I smelled the other first and then Bright Crystal. I was instantly sold on the Bright Crystal. I sprayed it on myself and then came straight to amazon to get it at a fraction of the price. The bottle is huge! I&#x27;ll be wearing this everyday to the office, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll receive tons of compliments. Because the scent is not overpowering and very clean, I don&#x27;t have to worry about it being too loud in an office setting. Thanks amazon!</li>
            <li> great value for the price</li>
            <li> I simply love this perfume, I have tried this in the showroom so  was familiar with the fragrance&lt;br /&gt; Other perfumes I like are cool waters, Flowerbomb By Viktor &amp; Rolf , burberry. I hope you will get an idea of my taste in perfume.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you smelled this perfume before you make a purchase, apparently you cannot return  perfumes on amazon.</li>
            <li> I think I got the knock-off this time.  My first purchase of it seemed to be the &amp;#34;real thing.&amp;#34;  This one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume ever and it&#x27;s half the price!! Thank you amazon! I absolutely love it!! If you&#x27;ve been hesitating on buying this don&#x27;t waste another second. This stuff is perfect for spring and summer. :)</li>
            <li> Well, I loved that scent when I tried it in the store ... when it arrived it didn&#x27;t smell quite the same, but maybe it was just an interaction with my skin ... otherwise a good value</li>
            <li> Great price and speedy delivery.  Thank you for the great price I will be ordering it again and again for her birthday and Christmas.</li>
            <li> I totally agree with this seller, it was a very good product. Giving 5 star to this seller because the speed the handle my order and all the updates I receive from them during all the process. Recommend to my family and why not to my friends as well.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance. People compliment and ask me what I am wearing all the time! Can&#x27;t go wrong with this citrus perfume!</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my wife....she loved it!</li>
            <li> This perfume is not as strong as the ones I have tried in the dept. stores.  It is watered down and scent is very weak.  In the past I have used this Bright Crystal and I know how it smells and how it lasts.  Terribly disappointed.  I am thinking of returning it.</li>
            <li> It is a good product is 100% real</li>
            <li> Versace Bright Crystal is one of my favorite toilette.  It&#x27;s a perfect fragrance for the summertime.  It arrived in less than two days from ordering it.  The price was the cheapest that I have seen yet.  Loved it.</li>
            <li> this my first time I buy this brand, I LIKE it, very good smell.</li>
            <li> Lots of compliments. Might be my new signature. I go thru this way too fast, but I know it last bc I can smell it on my clothes bf I wash a few days later.</li>
            <li> It was so easy on Amazon to order this perfume.  The price was great and it came with hand lotion which I was not expecting!  It only took 6 days to arrive before Christmas during some very bad weather.  The product is great and I am very happy with this fragrance!  I will definitely be shopping with Amazon in the future.</li>
            <li> One of the most complimented fragrances ever!!! I&#x27;ve received numerous compliments on this perfume from both men and women!!! Ladies, not much is needed. A little goes a long way!! It&#x27;s the best!!</li>
            <li> Smells great! Would reccomend this product to anyone wanting a great smelling perfume! Would definaetly buy again! Love this product!</li>
            <li> It was great receiving my favorite perfume in the mail in a timely manner and I got a great price on  it!! Versace bright crystal has been my signature scent for a few years. It&#x27;s a great fresh scent and has a good staying power. I get compliments all the time when I wear this!</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous because I saw some reviews about it possibly being a knock off...I must say that it&#x27;s not the case and I can&#x27;t wait to make my next perfume purchase!</li>
            <li> Great for summer. Love the fragrance.</li>
            <li> excellent product,very happy with delivery time.</li>
            <li> GOREGOUS scent. My new fav.</li>
            <li> A favorite perfume of mine. High quality and the scent lasted all day. Very good deal for the price listed versus going to a department store and purchasing behind the beauty counter. Will repurchase.</li>
            <li> It is excellent,more than expected!</li>
            <li> I love it! It took a little longer than I wanted and expected but I love the perfume.</li>
            <li> Initially I found my pump is broken but I fixed it.. First time smells looks just alcohol and very light flower like rose/lotus smell, but I spray next day and it&#x27;s smell okay but not bad not too strong. Not long-lasting.. just okay.. I can&#x27;t pay more than $20 in future... I love Versace other brands but this is just okay.</li>
            <li> Great smelling perfume! And it lasts! This was an amazing price! Compared to department store prices, I got this at a GREAT AMAZING Price!!! Highly recommend buying perfume from amazon prime!!!</li>
            <li> Love love love this fragrance 5 star all the way thanks again:-))))))</li>
            <li> I love it! Tryed in sephora and found out the better price on Amazon. i was worried about all of the nagetive reviews of this fragrance, but it is an authentic one! Great price with good value. Lovely perfume for summertime!</li>
            <li> Beautiful. I received this fragrance as a gift some years back, and wanted to get it again. Just fabulous ! Thank you, Amazon.</li>
            <li> The smell of this perfume is heavenly</li>
            <li> Awesome No other can compare. Great smell. Last a long time. My friends says Omg what are you wearing? Excellent</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this. Was not expecting the lotion came with it too. Much larger bottle than the big name department store and much cheaper. This has become my favorite cologne from now on. Also my sister in-law now wants some too.</li>
            <li> Love this. Better price then a department store</li>
            <li> this is my favorite fragrance, so it&#x27;s awesome to get it at such a great price&lt;br /&gt;beats dept. stores anyday</li>
            <li> All I can say is ladies if you don&#x27;t have this Buy It&amp;#34;It&#x27;s worth every penny.It smell Good and it stay on long.I am ordering another don&#x27;t want to run out of this</li>
            <li> My fieancee LOVES this stuff, and frankly that&#x27;s all that matters.</li>
            <li> Great product! Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews I compared this in every way to department store purchase...product is the real deal. Love this fragrance for year-round wear!</li>
            <li> Excellent fragance, Very good price !!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this fragrance. It stays all day long.</li>
            <li> It is wonderful, my boyfriend loves it.</li>
            <li> The name speaks for it self can&#x27;t go wrong wearing this it smells so good</li>
            <li> Amazing smell, not too strong, not so soft. Just right. Been using this for about 5 yeass now. Tried different but always ended up coming back to this</li>
            <li> Not the real thing, doesn&#x27;t last for the price, only have the name.</li>
            <li> I would totally get another bottle of this as the smell is wonderful, however, it&#x27;s gone after 30 minutes max. I can still smell it on my wrists about 10 - 15 minutes later, but an hour later? Nada. Like it never existed. And that is after spraying a pretty hefty amount on myself - like 10 sprays. Oh well. On to the next.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume!!!</li>
            <li> The reviews warned about this perfume being a knock off ,  I didn&#x27;t want to believe  Amazon would be dishonest about selling any of their products.  I was WRONG.  This Versace perfume smell more like hairspray (alcohol ).  Extremely disappointed.  Would absolutely NOT recommend.</li>
            <li> love the smell an htrst</li>
            <li> Quick delivery...MMMM Smells Great!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife, she loves this fragrance and the way the bottle looks.  This added to her collection of Perfumes.</li>
            <li> Considering this was PRIME, i think that over 7 days for a prime item is horrible.  Its been 8 days and still nothing.  If mine is \\&quot;watered down\\&quot; like some say, its going back....that is if I ever get it.  STILL WAITING!  WTF?</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments when I wear it.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like the new absolute better. It&#x27;s stronger and lasts all day. The original does not stay on me.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Arrive very quickly</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sister, she&#x27;s in her early 20&#x27;s. She LOVES this scent and gets lots of compliments. It is long lasting too which is rare.</li>
            <li> I love perfume and have been using 4 or five different ones that I alternate with but I must say I stopped using the other ones because the Bright Crystal perfume is the only one I have ever had people comment about &amp;#34; especially men :) It&#x27;s a wonderful scent and I will continue to wear it for a long time..</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite fragrance. I feel so beautiful when I wear it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different perfumes before and most of them have always worn off within an hour or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one seems to last  ALL DAY. I love it! It&#x27;s slightly stronger than the others but I really like it.</li>
            <li> One of the best perfumes I&#x27;ve owned!</li>
            <li> This perfume was a watered down or possibly completely fake version of Versace&#x27;s Bright Crystal. I would not recommend this to anyone. I ended up just buying a set from Nordstrom that lasts all day and smells beautifully. It even came with a purse, travel size perfume, and a matching lotion. It was twice the price but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Got 3oz for the price of 1oz they charged at Nordstrom Rack. Smell wonderful, my better half loves Versace Bright Crystal.</li>
            <li> You get a lot for a good price.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.  Guys are always stopping me to say you smell so good! I keep reordering this perfume from amazon every other month!</li>
            <li> Original perfume. Great price! Lovely scent :)</li>
            <li> Just got this recently - very disappointed in the strength - I can&#x27;t help but wonder if this is the REAL product, or a watered down version.  I love the smell, but would not get it again because you have to put a lot on just to get it to last.</li>
            <li> Lovely scent.  Only problem it don&#x27;t stay on.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It is the only women&#x27;s perfume I have found that doesn&#x27;t give my fiance a headache.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite and it is time for a new bottle.</li>
            <li> Thank you! It arrived, looks and smells perfect! And a free lotion! Thank you for that! Great buy indeed! I&#x27;ll be back!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many fragrances but they never seem to be me. I think this smell blends well with my natural chemicals and smells great all day long. Must try!</li>
            <li> This is my signature scent at the best price out there and trust me, I looked.  The scent is ultra feminine and light. I always get compliments and my husband loves it on me. Definately worth ordering from this seller and it&#x27;s my third bottle .</li>
            <li> My Wife absolutely loves this perfume.  It arrived on time and the price was normal and the best part was that she didn&#x27;t know she was getting it for Christmas.  Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great smelling perfume that last a long time! Only downfall is the price!</li>
            <li> Given as a gift.....best price at Amazon......hope she likes it!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery great price.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery, great price, great product, will buy again when I run out</li>
            <li> This was a perfect gift for my mother. üòç</li>
            <li> Not overpowering.  Light, fresh scent that doesn&#x27;t arrive in the room before you do!  Heads up, it doesn&#x27;t last all day.  That could be a plus or minus, depending on how long you want your frangrance to last.  I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife for Valentine&#x27;s day. She said she couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between this and the one sold at Macy&#x27;s for double the price. It also came with a tube of lotion, which she really liked.</li>
            <li> I really like how this smells on my girlfriend! It is juvenile and subtle. If pink had a smell, this is how it would smell.</li>
            <li> Simply Exquisite !!! My wife loves it.</li>
            <li> Everything Perfect!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky when it comes to fragrance. I love to wear it, but I don&#x27;t want to leave it on others after a handshake or a hug. My fragrance needs to be subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sample a lot of fragrance until I settle on one that I really love and right now, BRIGHT CRYSTAL is what I put on each morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BRIGHT CRYSTAL is like standing in a flower garden on a warm spring day and having a slight breeze blow just a hint of the garden&#x27;s aroma in your direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put on a few drops in the morning and BRIGHT CRYSTAL is with me all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t fully describe a fragrance without including a very important aspect of the product--the bottle. BRIGHT CRYSTAL is a pink liquid that comes in a rectangular clear bottle with an oversized oval-cut ‚Äúcrystal‚Äù stopper. It looks nice on the counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you enjoy a light floral scent, I definitely recommend BRIGHT CRYSTAL by Versace.</li>
            <li> Beautiful fresh scent. Very light, airy, citrusy, fresh scent.&lt;br /&gt;I get alot of compliments on Bright Crystal !  Love to wear it during the day and night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller was great, smooth transaction, and fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about getting this perfume, but unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t smell strong, the smell fades away so fast that I feel I have to spray the whole bottle to be able to smell it. I tried to return it but amazon won&#x27;t take it back according to the rules stated online.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my wife. She loves it!.  Very good perfume!.</li>
            <li> Received quickly and product as decribed</li>
            <li> I have used this fragrance for long time and I definitely got the best deal at amazon.com.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells yummy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Fresh scents and Versace&#x27; s Bright Crystal fell under that category. I really like this scent as well as Yellow Diamonds, also by Versace. I highly recommend it. I get many complements which is always nice as well.</li>
            <li> Awesome price and it is the real deal. :-)</li>
            <li> Excellent! What a great price for this huge bottle!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this perfume for about 7 years.I do know how it&#x27;s suppose to smell, the real authentic Versace Bright Crystal. But this &amp;#34;Versace Bright Crystal&amp;#34; has nothing to do with the name. This product is pure alcohol and it smells funky&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, please be careful when you order perfume!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, great product. I love how this smells.</li>
            <li> To tell if it is really versace first off, their perfume sells for 100s of dollars a bottle Exp:Yellow crystal on the Versace website is the cheapest perfume at $110 a bottle. &amp;#34;Bright Crystal&amp;#34; goes for $178 for a 6.7oz bottle adn $90 for a 3oz. Needless to say you get what you payfor. Secondly, there are some very very very good knock offs out there. To tell if it is genuine look at the box. The name brand Versace perfume comes in a pink to baby pink ombre box with a textured Versace silver logo and words on box as well as a silver diamond patterned lid on box (attached is real very expensive perfume). It is also darker in color. I hope this helps others trying to figure out the origin of this fragrance. That being said if it smells good to you and you saved a pretty penny don&#x27;t be upset that it&#x27;s not Couture!</li>
            <li> This is the second bottled of this fragrance I have received...It is very light and a great summer wear...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not strong so the bottle seems to go down quickly but it is worth it...</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance and when I found it on Amazon for the price, it was a no brainer!  I don&#x27;t pay $100 anymore...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t rave enough about this perfume! One of my absolute favorites! I get compliments EVERYWHERE I go when I wear it! And the fact that I can get this large bottle for less than $60 bucks and one 1oz bottle is $50 at sephora makes me love this perfume even more! Definitely worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the perfume and my fianc&amp;eacute; bought it for me for my birthday. However, I was extremely disappointed with this product. It was basically pink colored alcohol. No scent whatsoever. I ended up getting sick because of the fumes. The product is not returnable because it is a hazardous flammable material or some crap, but amazon was awesome at customer service and they were able to help us out. It was just very awkward because I had to explain to my fianc&amp;eacute; what happened and I felt guilty because he was so excited about the gift. Some reviews are positive and maybe the got a good batch, but mine was definitely a knock off and not a good one at all.</li>
            <li> i am a perfume collector and a good friend of mine sent this perfume to me as a gift and i really loved.. i dont really use gucci perfume but the smell is great and very feminine.. i start using it but dont last that long for the whole day.. price is good for the whole bottle</li>
            <li> I bought this after having the small tester. This smells like 80% alcohol and literally turns my stomach when I put it on. This is NOT what Bright Crystal is supposed to smell like, clearly a lot of alcohol has been added and very little of the actual perfume is in this bottle. Buyer beware that this is a diluted version of the product.</li>
            <li> It smells AMAZING!! It&#x27;s an authentic Versace and it was the best price I could find anywhere!</li>
            <li> Only problem I have is I tried to cancel this order 3 times and guess it wasn&#x27;t possible to do.  I ordered the wrong item but my wife loves it.  Just make sure it is the right one because you won&#x27;t get a refund on this one.</li>
            <li> I love it. It got here quick and smells great!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Great!!! And came before I expected:)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume! It smells so good but doesn&#x27;t stay on for  very long! Still worth it though!</li>
            <li> I had a little bit left in my bottle that I purchased at Macy&#x27;s. this one was NOT the same! It&#x27;s not the real thing... No wonder it was so cheap!!!</li>
            <li> What is there to say, LOVE it!  Get a lot of complements, even from the hubby who seldom notices anything. :o)</li>
            <li> good product wife use it always and very happy wit it</li>
            <li> One of the best smelling fragrances next to Pleasures!</li>
            <li> Another keep sake. It&#x27;s excellence in it&#x27;s packaging a eye catcher and eye pleaser.It&#x27;s aroma is heavenly. Long lasting fragrance.very pleasing to the smell.</li>
            <li> I got this one for my girlfriend and she just loves it.</li>
            <li> great deal fasst shipping</li>
            <li> i can sniff this all day long and not get tired of it.</li>
