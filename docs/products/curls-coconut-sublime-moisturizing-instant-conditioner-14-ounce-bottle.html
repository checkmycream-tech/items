            <li>Smells great.</li>
            <li>Great moisturizer and conditioner.  </li>

            <li>Good price too.</li>
            <li>Of course, it smells absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>I love how great this product smells ( for those who love the smell of coconut).  </li>
            <li>The slip is really good and the smell is light not over powering.  </li>
            <li>I would first like to say that the seller in which I purchased this product from is great.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing, and detangles my hair easily.  </li>
            <li>Since using this conditioner and cleansing shampoo, my hair is softer and my curls look better.  </li>
            <li>It smells great, and i was really hopeful</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love all of your products.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found out about it.</li>
            <li>I did love the Curls Gel-les&#x27;c though.</li>
            <li>No complaints here.! :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a good product because it does add some moisture to my hair, it smells good, and it is natural.</li>
            <li>I found another brand which I like better</li>
            <li>Love the smell.  </li>
            <li>I have BSL, wavy, fine, Cherokee/German/Scot hair that breaks very easily.</li>
            <li>Smells great and leaves her hair sexy and soft.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hear soft and healthy shining never dray smells good and  moist all the time I love it</li>
            <li>I can only state that this product was great with MY hair.</li>
            <li>Even another type 4a/b person might not have the same great results.</li>
            <li>I have seen some great reviews about it and finally gave into purchasing it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled to find a product that keeps my hair moisturized and tangle free.</li>
            <li>Great cowash--smells organic and a little strange, but it treats your hair awesomely.</li>
            <li>Maybe using the first step will bring about more effectiveness of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is unique in that it is multi-textured (3C and 4A).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad other people have had good luck with this product, but it&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
            <li>I used it all up way too fast but was always pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Gives my hair a nice, soft feel after use.</li>
            <li>I must say it leaves my hair SUPER moist.</li>
            <li>It smells good (if you like the smell of coconut, which I do), it&#x27;s concentrated so only a small bit is needed, and it untangles and softens beautifully.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the quick response time!</li>
            <li>Do not buy the 14 ounce size for 20$ because you will not get your moneys worth.</li>
            <li>I was ROCKIN curls fresh out the shower with NO MANIPULATION or products...</li>
            <li>I received this product and initially concerned that it appeared a bit aged, but it works wonderfully on my hair.</li>
            <li>there are better products on the market to use and I will probably give it away to a young woman.</li>
            <li>My 3c/4a natural hair didn&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>I received my product in 3 days and the product was packaged nicely so that it would not spill open or leak!</li>
            <li>I use it right after washing and then again as my leave in.</li>
            <li>apple cider-ed it out of my hair and have gone back to using suave and my hair feels light and clean again</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing, it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair weighed down, and I also use it as a leave-in.</li>
            <li>I have ordered this twice, and getting ready to order it again.</li>
            <li>I would just like to say that I use a much cheaper conditioner my Tresseme</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t cost as much as Curls.</li>
            <li>They were also more uniform in appearance and needed much less leave in conditioner afterwards.</li>
            <li>This really lathers your hair and makes it feel soft.</li>
            <li>far as the conditioner goes, I don&#x27;t really care for it.</li>
            <li>When I leave it on hair for an hour, hair is very soft and manageable during rinse.</li>
            <li>My hair is fairly short, very thick, and kinky curly, with somewhat of a wavy pattern as well, so there&#x27;s a lot going on with my hair which might be the reason why it isn&#x27;t very effective on my hair.</li>
            <li>I have been natural for about 4 years now and this is the one product that I won&#x27;t go without!</li>
            <li>All were a huge waste of money.</li>
            <li>My hair was soft as butter.</li>
            <li>Having multi-textured hair, I never had soft, defined curls.</li>
            <li>After just once use, my hair was soft and shiny and my curls were defined and bouncy.</li>
            <li>I use this product to co-wash my natural hair.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone with curly hair, but especially to multi-ethnic girls.</li>
            <li>I am a white girl with tight spiral curls and my hair texture is fine.  </li>
            <li>This left my hair so soft and my curls were so defined that it frightened me.</li>
            <li>will, however, continue to use it and maybe mix in a little Argon oil or wheat germ oil to add a little more shine, moisture, shine, and suppleness to my hair.</li>
            <li>Products for \\&quot;normal\\&quot; hair tend to leave my hair dry, frizzy, and brittle while products for African American hair leave my hair with a greasy, dull buildup that forces me to have to shampoo way more than I should.</li>
            <li>My first go round</li>

            <li> My first go round</li>
            <li> I am Mexican/African American with very dry hair that is prone to breakage.</li>
            <li> M-Th, I section my wet hair and twist it and take the twists out for work the next day for neat waves, over the weekend i just towel dry and scrunch with my fingers for curls.</li>
            <li> It provides DEEP moisture without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> I tried using it this morning following Carol&#x27;s Daughter Black Vanilla Shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have tried Paul Mitchell, Mixed Chicks, Moroccan Oil, Carol&#x27;s Daughter, Deva Curl, Ouidad, and Shea Moisture, just to name a few.</li>
            <li> It makes it feel weighted down, waxy, and dry at the ends.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> After trying this product one time, I have thrown away all other conditioners.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re stationed in Hawaii and products for black hair care is hard to come by, I doubled up here on Amazon and can&#x27;t wait to get back to the mainland to replenish my stock.</li>
            <li> even a few flakes.</li>
            <li> I usually shampoo twice a week and condition everyday.  </li>
            <li> not sure that it will go in my HG category though.  </li>
            <li> so I have a hard time getting my hair thoroughly coated but now with sectioning and this conditioner</li>
            <li> BUT it&#x27;s not good for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have 4a type and very very thick hair</li>
            <li> However, don&#x27;t get this product confused with Curls:</li>
            <li> This has made it EXTREMELY difficult for me to find a product that works.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this one is another strike out.</li>
            <li> Using this product, my hair feels like it&#x27;s coated in wax and my scalp itches like crazy,</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since this was a miss, I&#x27;ve ordered this: [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> And the amount of hair that broke off was epically tragic.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent for 3c 4a curls. Great for detangling. I recommend this product. Do not buy the 14 ounce size for 20$ because you will not get your moneys worth. the smaller bottle for 8 ounces is 10$.</li>
            <li> Tons of slip. Smells great. A little goes a long way. Helps with detangling. Fan!</li>
            <li> I have type 4 a/b hair. I used this product to cowash. After trying this product one time, I have thrown away all other conditioners. This left my hair so soft and my curls were so defined that it frightened me. I have NEVER had a product define my curls like this. My hair was soft as butter. I was ROCKIN curls fresh out the shower with NO MANIPULATION or products...only cowashed with the CURLS COCONUT SUBLIME MOISTURIZING INSTANT CONDITIONER!!!! THIS STUFF IS DA BOMB. I can only state that this product was great with MY hair. Everyone&#x27;s hair is different. Even another type 4a/b person might not have the same great results. You have to make a decision to try,or not to try a product knowing that you may have different results.</li>
            <li> I am a white girl with tight spiral curls and my hair texture is fine.  Since using this conditioner and cleansing shampoo, my hair is softer and my curls look better.  There is also no frizz.  I have ordered this twice, and getting ready to order it again.</li>
            <li> I received this product and initially concerned that it appeared a bit aged, but it works wonderfully on my hair. Thanks for the quick response time!</li>
            <li> I would say this conditioner is a define staple. I have 4a type and very very thick hair so I have a hard time getting my hair thoroughly coated but now with sectioning and this conditioner I must say it leaves my hair SUPER moist. I use it right after washing and then again as my leave in. My first go round I used it all up way too fast but was always pleased with the results. I will be buying this again!</li>
            <li> It smells great, and i was really hopeful (here comes the but) BUT it&#x27;s not good for my hair. It makes it feel weighted down, waxy, and dry at the ends. i&#x27;ve used it for almost 3 weeks now. I usually shampoo twice a week and condition everyday.  M-Th, I section my wet hair and twist it and take the twists out for work the next day for neat waves, over the weekend i just towel dry and scrunch with my fingers for curls. Using this product, my hair feels like it&#x27;s coated in wax and my scalp itches like crazy, even a few flakes. Yuck! Doesn&#x27;t even curl well... I&#x27;ve quit using it for a week now and apple cider-ed it out of my hair and have gone back to using suave and my hair feels light and clean again and my scalp is not itching like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this was a miss, I&#x27;ve ordered this: [[ASIN:B000NPY0WG Shiseido Tsubaki Shining Conditioner with Tsubaki Oil EX - 550ml Pump Dispenser]]</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer and conditioner.  Smells amazing, and detangles my hair easily.  I believe this is the same as the Curls Coconut Curlada Conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. It smells good (if you like the smell of coconut, which I do), it&#x27;s concentrated so only a small bit is needed, and it untangles and softens beautifully.</li>
            <li> This conditioner rocks for curly haired girls.  I even use it instead of gel.  It smells unbelievably good!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love all of your products. I am so glad I found out about it. Recommend to everyone with curly hair</li>
            <li> This really lathers your hair and makes it feel soft. I might just make this one of my regular conditioners.</li>
            <li> Over rated product.  there are better products on the market to use and I will probably give it away to a young woman.</li>
            <li> My 3c/4a natural hair didn&#x27;t love it. I&#x27;m on Youtube (Chappy2468) so if my hair is similar to yours you may not either. I did love the Curls Gel-les&#x27;c though.</li>
            <li> Now this is a very good conditioner for my type 4 hair after shampooing with the curls cleansing cream. No complaints here.! :)</li>
            <li> I would first like to say that the seller in which I purchased this product from is great. I received my product in 3 days and the product was packaged nicely so that it would not spill open or leak! Thank you!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the conditioner goes, I don&#x27;t really care for it. The smell of it is just WONDERFUL. When I use it I want to just eat it! That&#x27;s just how good it smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every product does not work for everyone, and I kept this in mind when purchasing this product. I have seen some great reviews about it and finally gave into purchasing it. I would just like to say that I use a much cheaper conditioner my Tresseme, I get a 32 oz bottle and it does what this conditioner claims to do. Maybe using the first step will bring about more effectiveness of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a good product because it does add some moisture to my hair, it smells good, and it is natural. It&#x27;s just not what it&#x27;s ampted up to be, for ME. HOWEVER, everyone had different experiences, this is just my experience. My hair is fairly short, very thick, and kinky curly, with somewhat of a wavy pattern as well, so there&#x27;s a lot going on with my hair which might be the reason why it isn&#x27;t very effective on my hair. My hair is prone to dryness and this just does not cut it, sorry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will, however, continue to use it and maybe mix in a little Argon oil or wheat germ oil to add a little more shine, moisture, shine, and suppleness to my hair.</li>
            <li> Would not purchase again. I found another brand which I like better and it doesn&#x27;t cost as much as Curls.</li>
            <li> My wife uses about a thousand gallons of hair products a year.  This one is always a staple in her vast selection of moisturizer in our shower.  Smells great and leaves her hair sexy and soft.  Good price too.</li>
            <li> I am Mexican/African American with very dry hair that is prone to breakage. My hair is unique in that it is multi-textured (3C and 4A). This has made it EXTREMELY difficult for me to find a product that works. Products for \\&quot;normal\\&quot; hair tend to leave my hair dry, frizzy, and brittle while products for African American hair leave my hair with a greasy, dull buildup that forces me to have to shampoo way more than I should. I have tried Paul Mitchell, Mixed Chicks, Moroccan Oil, Carol&#x27;s Daughter, Deva Curl, Ouidad, and Shea Moisture, just to name a few. All were a huge waste of money. Let me say that Curls Coconut Sublime Conditioner blows them all out of the water. Though it is a bit pricey, you definitely get what you pay for. The ingredients are of excellent quality. No mineral oils or damaging fillers. It provides DEEP moisture without weighing my hair down. Of course, it smells absolutely amazing. Just using it as a daily conditioner, this product has literally transformed my hair. Having multi-textured hair, I never had soft, defined curls. Curls Coconut Sublime Conditioner changed that. After just once use, my hair was soft and shiny and my curls were defined and bouncy. They were also more uniform in appearance and needed much less leave in conditioner afterwards. I highly recommend this product to anyone with curly hair, but especially to multi-ethnic girls.</li>
            <li> Love the smell.  When I leave it on hair for an hour, hair is very soft and manageable during rinse.</li>
            <li> It drys my hair rather than moisturizing it. I don&#x27;t like it at all and will never buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have been natural for about 4 years now and this is the one product that I won&#x27;t go without! The smell is amazing, it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair weighed down, and I also use it as a leave-in. However, don&#x27;t get this product confused with Curls: Coconut Culada, I tried to substitute for the Sublime when I ran out and it was definitely not the same results. But keep in mind everyone&#x27;s hair is different and you may be opposite of me. We&#x27;re stationed in Hawaii and products for black hair care is hard to come by, I doubled up here on Amazon and can&#x27;t wait to get back to the mainland to replenish my stock.</li>
            <li> It makes my hear soft and healthy shining never dray smells good and  moist all the time I love it</li>
            <li> Great cowash--smells organic and a little strange, but it treats your hair awesomely.</li>
            <li> I love how great this product smells ( for those who love the smell of coconut).  I use this product to co-wash my natural hair.  Gives my hair a nice, soft feel after use.</li>
            <li> I have BSL, wavy, fine, Cherokee/German/Scot hair that breaks very easily. I&#x27;ve struggled to find a product that keeps my hair moisturized and tangle free. Unfortunately, this one is another strike out. I tried using it this morning following Carol&#x27;s Daughter Black Vanilla Shampoo. My hair was so tangled, I had to follow up with a deep conditioner just to get a comb through my hair. And the amount of hair that broke off was epically tragic. I&#x27;m glad other people have had good luck with this product, but it&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
            <li> I like this conditioner...not sure that it will go in my HG category though.  The slip is really good and the smell is light not over powering.  I would repurchase and keep it in my line up!</li>
