            <li>The best part is, my bangs still have some lift at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li>It is the best hair  product I have found.</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>I have never had hair that looked this great!!!  </li>
            <li>This is the best body boosting Hair Product Ever!!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m puzzled by some of the reviews I&#x27;ve read here; my experience with this product has been great.  </li>
            <li>It also makes my hair look great day one.</li>
            <li>According to my wife, this is a great product.  </li>
            <li>Bonus is that it smelled the best to me, of all the sprays, with a hint of rose.  </li>
            <li>I still don&#x27;t feel that it does a great deal for my hair...</li>
            <li>This product is remarkable because it gives my hair texture and  strand thickness.</li>
            <li>When my beloved Weightlifter was discontinued, I was told that this product took its place.</li>
            <li>I love spraying it on every day!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>i was so happy with it because it gave excellent body, not stiff or sticky like many on the shelf.  </li>
            <li>Very clean smelling!</li>
            <li>It looks great right then!</li>
            <li>to the Redken Body Full, my favorite things are: It smells so great.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and was recommended this product because I can&#x27;t volume.  </li>
            <li>however well into the next day, I realized that my hair STILL looked AND felt great!</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love that.</li>
            <li>It has many ingredients that I do not care to use including methylparaben.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff but it was taken of the market, so I am glad I found it on here.</li>
            <li>After towel drying, I used about 12 sprays and used my fingers to distribute it more evenly throughout my hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels fluffiest with this spray, so I&#x27;m getting more.  </li>
            <li>Wish it worked better</li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this helps to add some body and volume without overdoing it.</li>
            <li>For someone with fine hair, this product did not work well at all.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this adds volume so my style lasts and doesn&#x27;t flatten out.  </li>
            <li>I try almost every volumizing product there is ~ this one impresses me because its so light and doesn&#x27;t build up</li>
            <li>This is such a great product.  </li>
            <li>Like good, professional product.</li>
            <li>I never, well, rarely ever leave reviews, but after buying this product AND reading another reviewers post, I felt compelled!</li>
            <li>After styling, my hair was full of body, shiny but not greasy, bouncy, smooth, and touchable.  </li>
            <li>My hair is totally straight and very fine, like baby&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and really helps my fine hair have lift and volume.  </li>
            <li>that* different than my previously loved product</li>
            <li>but I can tell a difference when I don&#x27;t use the Body  Full Amplifier.</li>
            <li>I use all of the Redken Body Full products.  </li>
            <li>I have baby fine, very straight hair.</li>
            <li>Having about half the hair I used to have (I&#x27;m 45), I&#x27;ve resorted to trying about 20 different volumizing sprays and love this one the best.  </li>
            <li>I have thinner gray hair and these products are great without weighing down the hair.  </li>
            <li>This product is never greasy, never heavy, and doesn&#x27;t give me stringy hair; just thicker and pleasantly textured hair, not fuzzy and not heavy.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and it makes it look a lot fuller and always very shiny.</li>
            <li>Well, this is the only thing I totally liked.</li>
            <li>I will post on later, but this Redken Body Full is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I would rather pay more for tried and true products that deliver on their promises than cheaper brands that actually have damaged my hair.  </li>
            <li>In the past I&#x27;ve used Redken&#x27;s Body Full Weightlifter, and absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li>First I would like to start my review with what this product is...</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make it feel weighed down AT ALL but does give it this nice texture and fullness.</li>
            <li>it IS a great product for styling, and light enough to not drag your hair down.  </li>
            <li>For work, I use an iron to really curl the ends under, and my bangs.</li>
            <li>thanks AMAZON.</li>
            <li>I also really like how it doesn&#x27;t feel like I have product in my hair.  </li>
            <li>Much hair.</li>
            <li>It is advertised to \\&quot;plump &amp; prime fine or flat hair with all over fullness, adjustable lift &amp; lightweight conditioning with</li>
            <li>I live in dry mountain air and any volumizing moose I have tried to use dries it out even more.</li>
            <li>Like the other reviewer I thought, ok, it can&#x27;t be that different from the original product.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product and would absolutely give it as a gift.</li>
            <li>I gave this product a try last week when I found out another Redken product I&#x27;ve used for years (Redken Body Full Weightlifter Root Lift) had been discontinued.  </li>
            <li>This does what it promises and you can use less product and get better results.</li>
            <li>Luckily the salon took it back.</li>
            <li>BUT this price is WAY too high.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>For the record, I tried a lot of cheap stuff you can get at Walmart, and not too many expensive</li>
            <li>I have very fine, limp, color-treated, short hair that tends to be frizzy.  </li>
            <li>(yep, my hair is that fine) and use a metal round brush to curl the ends under.</li>
            <li>a soft touch feel.\\&quot;    </li>
            <li>In reading the product description, it seems to be really focused on the \\&quot;moisturizing\\&quot; features rather than the \\&quot;lifting/volumizing\\&quot; aspects, and frankly I&#x27;m looking for the latter.  </li>
            <li>I really need to stop wearing a ponytail, so I got a short haircut and tried out lots of things that promised to make my hair look fuller etc.</li>
            <li>this product is just as good but still difficult to find.</li>
            <li>I have FINE hair which has always been a problem; I could style and style, but within a short time my hair would inevitably return to being FLAT!!!  </li>
            <li>If you have baby fine hair that is limp, beware!</li>
            <li>I have stick straight, thin, baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m currently looking for a new alternative.</li>
            <li>I have never had a product that really gave me body without weighing down my hair.  </li>

            <li> I have never had a product that really gave me body without weighing down my hair.  </li>
            <li> It was completely weighed down and almost greasy.</li>
            <li> When I use it, I spray it on wet hair, focusing on the roots, then I actually spray some in my hands and get the ends.</li>
            <li> Numerous styling products, both salon and drugstore brands, had little effect and only drained my $$$.</li>
            <li> This works and has for a long time!</li>
            <li> This product made my hair dry and brittle.  </li>
            <li> When I leave my hair loose</li>
            <li> It weighed it down and instantly caused the hair to separate.  </li>
            <li> Then, I dry my hair with my head upside down</li>
            <li> This spray is not waxy or greasy, and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel stiff or tangled, nor does it  look flat (like it did when I used Aveda&#x27;s spray).</li>
            <li> THEN one evening, after my usual cut and color, I left the salon thinking that in a hour the body and volume would be gone ...</li>
            <li> I spray a few sprays at my roots before I blow dry and</li>
            <li> I literally could not even wear my hair down after I used it-</li>
            <li> It gives body to hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> have used about a week and seems to do what I want which is to lift my roots a little</li>
            <li> It made my hair limp, no volume, no plumping up or texture whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money here.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few years, recommended by my hairdresser.  </li>
            <li> Used a blow dryer and round brush and nothing.  </li>
            <li> I use it to tame the flyaway hair.</li>
            <li> After some hard lessons in the differences of quality and &amp;#34;getting</li>
            <li> All it does is weigh my hair down and makes it limp and look dirty.</li>
            <li> I got tired of paying the price for this product and went on to try cheaper products.  </li>
            <li> I had to pull it back in a clip, it was that dreadful.</li>
            <li> , right??\\&quot;  Wrong.</li>
            <li> Could be cheaper...can get it cheaper thru my hairdresser and no shipping and handling to pay,  helps when she is unable to find it for me</li>
            <li> I always wore it in a ponytail because it just looked awful any other way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy the difference in my hair the days when I use this, versus the days that I don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I hate wasting money on hair proucts that don&#x27;t do as they are advertised.</li>
            <li> I hate that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Awful, awful stuff.</li>
            <li> Well, it is AWFUL!</li>

            <li> I have fine hair and this helps to add some body and volume without overdoing it.</li>
            <li> Awful, awful stuff. I used to use Redken&#x27;s Weightlifter and when it was discontinued, I tried this. It is advertised to \\&quot;plump &amp; prime fine or flat hair with all over fullness, adjustable lift &amp; lightweight conditioning with a soft touch feel.\\&quot;    All it does is weigh my hair down and makes it limp and look dirty. I hate wasting money on hair proucts that don&#x27;t do as they are advertised. I want my money back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I never, well, rarely ever leave reviews, but after buying this product AND reading another reviewers post, I felt compelled! In the past I&#x27;ve used Redken&#x27;s Body Full Weightlifter, and absolutely loved it. I have stick straight, thin, baby fine hair. It&#x27;s about shoulder length. When my beloved Weightlifter was discontinued, I was told that this product took its place. Like the other reviewer I thought, ok, it can&#x27;t be that different from the original product. Well, it is AWFUL! It made my hair limp, no volume, no plumping up or texture whatsoever. It was completely weighed down and almost greasy. I literally could not even wear my hair down after I used it- I had to pull it back in a clip, it was that dreadful. Luckily the salon took it back. If you have baby fine hair that is limp, beware!</li>
            <li> I gave this product a try last week when I found out another Redken product I&#x27;ve used for years (Redken Body Full Weightlifter Root Lift) had been discontinued.  I thought to myself, \\&quot;Huh, this couldn&#x27;t possibly be *that* different than my previously loved product, right??\\&quot;  Wrong. Using this product was like putting vaseline in my hair.  It weighed it down and instantly caused the hair to separate.  By the end of the work day my hair looked like it hadn&#x27;t been washed in a week.  For someone with fine hair, this product did not work well at all.  In reading the product description, it seems to be really focused on the \\&quot;moisturizing\\&quot; features rather than the \\&quot;lifting/volumizing\\&quot; aspects, and frankly I&#x27;m looking for the latter.  I have not used this product since and I&#x27;m currently looking for a new alternative.</li>
            <li> I have FINE hair which has always been a problem; I could style and style, but within a short time my hair would inevitably return to being FLAT!!!  I was especially envious of anyone who achieved volume at the roots.  Numerous styling products, both salon and drugstore brands, had little effect and only drained my $$$. THEN one evening, after my usual cut and color, I left the salon thinking that in a hour the body and volume would be gone ... however well into the next day, I realized that my hair STILL looked AND felt great! I called my hairstylist to tell her that my hair had never looked or felt this way and that I had to know what she used.  THIS WAS IT.  I spray it on my roots and selectively around the crown of my head. I&#x27;ve used this product for over 4 months and recently bought my second bottle -- I won&#x27;t be without it.  P.S. I&#x27;m puzzled by some of the reviews I&#x27;ve read here; my experience with this product has been great.  This product is never greasy, never heavy, and doesn&#x27;t give me stringy hair; just thicker and pleasantly textured hair, not fuzzy and not heavy.</li>
            <li> First I would like to start my review with what this product is...it IS a great product for styling, and light enough to not drag your hair down.  I love this product.  BUT this price is WAY too high.  I have since found this product at a local beauty salon for $13 and change.  Don&#x27;t waste your money here.</li>
            <li> My hair is totally straight and very fine, like baby&#x27;s hair. I always wore it in a ponytail because it just looked awful any other way. Now that I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s I really need to stop wearing a ponytail, so I got a short haircut and tried out lots of things that promised to make my hair look fuller etc. Well, this is the only thing I totally liked. I did try another I will post on later, but this Redken Body Full is my favorite. For the record, I tried a lot of cheap stuff you can get at Walmart, and not too many expensive ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the Redken Body Full, my favorite things are: It smells so great. Not like fruit or perfume, but like that just-from-the-salon smell. Like good, professional product. I love spraying it on every day!  It also makes my hair look great day one. It adds fullness whether I use a curling iron or not. It doesn&#x27;t make it feel weighed down AT ALL but does give it this nice texture and fullness. When I use it, I spray it on wet hair, focusing on the roots, then I actually spray some in my hands and get the ends. Then, I dry my hair with my head upside down (yep, my hair is that fine) and use a metal round brush to curl the ends under. It looks great right then! For work, I use an iron to really curl the ends under, and my bangs. The best part is, my bangs still have some lift at the end of the day. I love that. Now, the next day, it still has some body! Not a ton, but some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product and would absolutely give it as a gift. Even if you only get it for the scent!! It&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> This product made my hair dry and brittle.  Cannot use it.</li>
            <li> I live in dry mountain air and any volumizing moose I have tried to use dries it out even more. This works and has for a long time! I have fine hair and it makes it look a lot fuller and always very shiny.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because EWG had rated it as a 0.  However, they must have erred in this rating.  It has many ingredients that I do not care to use including methylparaben.  Don&#x27;t buy this if you are trying to go with nontoxic cosmetics!</li>
            <li> Could be cheaper...can get it cheaper thru my hairdresser and no shipping and handling to pay,  helps when she is unable to find it for me</li>
            <li> It gives body to hair without weighing it down. It is the best hair  product I have found.I love it!</li>
            <li> I try almost every volumizing product there is ~ this one impresses me because its so light and doesn&#x27;t build up</li>
            <li> I love this stuff but it was taken of the market, so I am glad I found it on here.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few years, recommended by my hairdresser.  I have fine hair and this adds volume so my style lasts and doesn&#x27;t flatten out.  I wear my hair short, and don&#x27;t like it flat!&lt;br /&gt;Ordering thru amazon saves me time and money drIving to purchase.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have baby fine, very straight hair. This product is remarkable because it gives my hair texture and  strand thickness. I use a product for volume with it but I can tell a difference when I don&#x27;t use the Body  Full Amplifier. Great product!</li>
            <li> redken used to have a similar product in a spray bottle that seems to be discontinued,it was called \\&quot; body full\\&quot;. i was so happy with it because it gave excellent body, not stiff or sticky like many on the shelf.  when i could no longer find it i discovered the volume amplifier replacement. this product is just as good but still difficult to find. thanks AMAZON.</li>
            <li> This is such a great product.  Easy to use and really helps my fine hair have lift and volume.  I would strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> According to my wife, this is a great product.  Her review follows:  I have very fine, limp, color-treated, short hair that tends to be frizzy.  I have never had a product that really gave me body without weighing down my hair.  I bought this on the recommendation of my stylist.  After towel drying, I used about 12 sprays and used my fingers to distribute it more evenly throughout my hair.  Then, I applied my root lifter (Amplify brand).  After styling, my hair was full of body, shiny but not greasy, bouncy, smooth, and touchable.  I have never had hair that looked this great!!!  This is the best body boosting Hair Product Ever!!!  Thank You, Redken!!!</li>
            <li> I use all of the Redken Body Full products.  I have thinner gray hair and these products are great without weighing down the hair.  Highly recommend.  My daughter is a colorist and recommended all of this line of products.</li>
            <li> Having about half the hair I used to have (I&#x27;m 45), I&#x27;ve resorted to trying about 20 different volumizing sprays and love this one the best.  My hair is coarse and wavy in texture.  This spray is not waxy or greasy, and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel stiff or tangled, nor does it  look flat (like it did when I used Aveda&#x27;s spray). My hair feels fluffiest with this spray, so I&#x27;m getting more.  Bonus is that it smelled the best to me, of all the sprays, with a hint of rose.  Very clean smelling!</li>
            <li> I got tired of paying the price for this product and went on to try cheaper products.  After some hard lessons in the differences of quality and &amp;#34;getting what you pay for&amp;#34;, I&#x27;m back.  I would rather pay more for tried and true products that deliver on their promises than cheaper brands that actually have damaged my hair.  This does what it promises and you can use less product and get better results.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I spray a few sprays at my roots before I blow dry and it  lots o&#x27; volume.  It&#x27;s crazy the difference in my hair the days when I use this, versus the days that I don&#x27;t.  I also really like how it doesn&#x27;t feel like I have product in my hair.  I&#x27;ve tried mousses before and they gave me volume, but my hair felt heavy/gunky and I hate that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So volume. Much hair.</li>
            <li> have used about a week and seems to do what I want which is to lift my roots a little</li>
            <li> This product does not make me feel like my hair is amplifying. I use it to tame the flyaway hair. When I leave my hair loose I still don&#x27;t feel that it does a great deal for my hair...it doesn&#x27;t harm it tho either.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and was recommended this product because I can&#x27;t volume.  Well I still can&#x27;t get volume even with this and volumizing shampoo and conditioner. Used a blow dryer and round brush and nothing.  Wish it worked better</li>
