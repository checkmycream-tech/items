    <ol>
            <li>I am very proud for buying Philipps Sonicare.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Excellent product at a great price</li>
            <li>They use diamond clean head pictures to trick you into buying these...Don&#x27;t!!!</li>
            <li>Seems to do more harm than good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best price and quality I found so far.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li>I love Phillips products.</li>
            <li>You will forget the dentist when you buy it :)</li>
            <li>These are ok.  </li>
            <li>Do not buy this if you are expecting the real Philips Sonicare toothbrush replacement heads, however,they very kindly dealt with me to rectify the situation.</li>
            <li>Not as good as the real thing,</li>
            <li>This pack of replacement toothbrush heads are a great alternative to original which are far more expensive&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>I love the fact that I can keep my teeth and tongue clean with this brush.  </li>
            <li>They easily slide off while I&#x27;m brushing.</li>
            <li>They worked fine, but were stiffer bristles.</li>
            <li>Too Fine of a bristle</li>
            <li>Work great for first couple of brushes then not so much.</li>
            <li>time, I&#x27;ll be buying the genuine brush heads.</li>
            <li>this just fit for SONICARE brush standard，it is no name</li>
            <li>Of course cheap.  </li>
            <li>Yes they fit and work</li>
            <li>These work great for the specific toothbrushes we have.</li>
            <li>Now my teeth are clean, fresh and I feel better with myself.</li>
            <li>Actually cleans the plaque off my teeth BETTER than the manufacturers Brush Heads which cost $20+ more!</li>
            <li>I thought they were replacements for my diamond clean brush heads.</li>
            <li>Generic products are usually good as a way to save money but these guys just straight-up pop of the brush.</li>
            <li>i got generic brush heads that are not the diamond clean kind.</li>
            <li>My big play to save money ended up costing more, because I tossed these things out!</li>
            <li>Kind of gross considering Sonicare is kept in bathroom.</li>
            <li>The brush is far too soft to do any good.</li>
            <li>the price is right</li>
            <li>Inferior quality plastics cut up my gums and still don&#x27;t get my teeth clean like the real ones.</li>
            <li>I should have read the reviews first.</li>
            <li>My gums started bleeding after the first couple uses.</li>
            <li>They are OK, I like soft, but these are too soft.</li>
            <li>The positive reviews here must be lies.</li>
            <li>There is nothing positive about these.</li>
            <li>Seem to work fine but are not the actual Philips Sonicare HX6066/7 brush heads but rather</li>
            <li>Buy the real Philips Sonicare heads.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll probably use them for a week or two and then replace with genuine Philips that last a couple months each.</li>
            <li>Not the real deal.</li>
            <li>somewhat disappointed.bristles are not nearly as dense as original.</li>
            <li>And the Philips clear caps don&#x27;t really fit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are too soft and the bristles flatten out way too fast.</li>
            <li>The bristles are thinner, and as a result you get a very very soft brush.  </li>
            <li>These do fit the Philips Sonicare, but not very well - they don&#x27;t click in like the genuine DiamondClean heads do, and they&#x27;re hard to remove.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are too soft and they won&#x27;t stay on the brush.</li>
            <li>The bristles were too soft and completely ineffective.</li>
            <li>am surprised that Amazon is selling such an inferior product.</li>
            <li>Also did not fit right.</li>
            <li>There were very stiff and not of the same quality as the original I will be returning them.</li>
            <li>They really stick on the top of the tooth brush like they weren&#x27;t molded correctly (bad if you like to take yours off frequently).</li>

            <li> These do fit the Philips Sonicare, but not very well - they don&#x27;t click in like the genuine DiamondClean heads do, and they&#x27;re hard to remove.  Also, all the heads are identical and unmarked - not helpful for family members trying to work out whose brush is whose!&lt;br /&gt;Next time, I&#x27;ll be buying the genuine brush heads.</li>
            <li> I should have read the reviews first. I purchased based on price. The bristles are too soft and they won&#x27;t stay on the brush. Please do not buy these heads. Buy the real Philips Sonicare heads.</li>
            <li> The picture given is deceiving! Do not buy this if you are expecting the real Philips Sonicare toothbrush replacement heads, however,they very kindly dealt with me to rectify the situation.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  Actually cleans the plaque off my teeth BETTER than the manufacturers Brush Heads which cost $20+ more!</li>
            <li> Junk. Bristles wore out in 2 to 3 weeks. Brush started falling off of handle after 3 weeks. Base material was soft and attachment hole expanded.&lt;br /&gt;I am surprised that Amazon is selling such an inferior product.</li>
            <li> These are really awful.  The base of the brushes consistently pop off when you are trying to remove from the toothbrush handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not purchase these again.  They are poorly made</li>
            <li> Not genuine....crudity</li>
            <li> Generic products are usually good as a way to save money but these guys just straight-up pop of the brush. They don&#x27;t work. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> this just fit for SONICARE brush standard，it is no name brand。It‘s too soft，maybe bad for you teeth health！&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SEE PHOTO YOU WILL KNOW WHAT I MEANS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think The worst shopping experience, as well as the seller does not honest, false products！</li>
            <li> I did not realize that these brush heads don&#x27;t come with the usual plastic caps.  Kind of gross considering Sonicare is kept in bathroom. I would not order them again</li>
            <li> These are very hard to get onto your Sonicare and if you share yours with someone else and just change out the brush heads its very inconvenient for it to be so tough to get them on/off. Also, they do not come with covers like the Sonicare ones do. The brushes themselves are not as stiff as Sonicare.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite toothbrush heads. I love the fact that I can keep my teeth and tongue clean with this brush.  It&#x27;s the best price and quality I found so far.</li>
            <li> These are terrible.  The brush is far too soft to do any good.</li>
            <li> I love Phillips products. They have been around a long time so trust them. This pack of replacement toothbrush heads are a great alternative to original which are far more expensive&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and change&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product at a great price&lt;br /&gt;Recommended</li>
            <li> Not acceptable.  Of course cheap.  But, why spend all the money on the device then use the POS.  The bristles are thinner, and as a result you get a very very soft brush.  My big play to save money ended up costing more, because I tossed these things out!</li>
            <li> Do not buy! The positive reviews here must be lies. There is nothing positive about these. These are terrible compared to the Philips brushes. Yes these are way cheaper, but they are not worth it in any way. The bristles are too soft and feel really weird compared to Philips. They really stick on the top of the tooth brush like they weren&#x27;t molded correctly (bad if you like to take yours off frequently). And the Philips clear caps don&#x27;t really fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably use them for a week or two and then replace with genuine Philips that last a couple months each. These were not worth it at all. Skip!</li>
            <li> There were very stiff and not of the same quality as the original I will be returning them. They worked fine, but were stiffer bristles.</li>
            <li> The bristles were too soft and completely ineffective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these less than a week and I&#x27;m already on the second replacement head. They are too soft and the bristles flatten out way too fast. Don&#x27;t waste your money on these.</li>
            <li> somewhat disappointed.bristles are not nearly as dense as original.</li>
            <li> Same as the regular generic brush heads. They use diamond clean head pictures to trick you into buying these...Don&#x27;t!!!</li>
            <li> These are probably the worst brush refills I&#x27;ve ever bought. They easily slide off while I&#x27;m brushing. Yes they fit and work but you can put any strength or leverage into brushing or they will slip off. Very very very very very irritating. Don&#x27;t buy them! you&#x27; ve been warned!</li>
            <li> I recommend this item. Now my teeth are clean, fresh and I feel better with myself. I am very proud for buying Philipps Sonicare. You will forget the dentist when you buy it :)</li>
            <li> They are OK, I like soft, but these are too soft.</li>
            <li> Seems to do more harm than good. Inferior quality plastics cut up my gums and still don&#x27;t get my teeth clean like the real ones. You pay for what you get!</li>
            <li> These are generic not the name brand phillips.</li>
            <li> When they say generic they mean it. Bristles are really stiff. I disliked them but I guess you get what you pay for. Also did not fit right.</li>
            <li> These work great for the specific toothbrushes we have. However, I wish they were cheaper.</li>
            <li> the brush heads i received were not what is pictured. i got generic brush heads that are not the diamond clean kind. don&#x27;t waste your time!</li>
            <li> I purchased two packs. I thought they were replacements for my diamond clean brush heads. After about a week of use the base would come lose while i was in the middle of brushing my teeth. I would not recommend these brush heads and would like to return the two packs I purchased.</li>
            <li> Too Fine of a bristle and it is not the same as the head it is as advertised to replace. They also do not fit onto the Sonicare very well, but will work, just not well.</li>
            <li> Not the real deal. Don&#x27;t buy. My gums started bleeding after the first couple uses.</li>
            <li> Terrible product.  Bristles fell apart within days, whereas the brand name lasted for months.</li>
            <li> These are ok.  Not as good as the real thing,</li>
            <li> Seem to work fine but are not the actual Philips Sonicare HX6066/7 brush heads but rather generic substitutes probably made in China (although there is no indication where they are actually made).  Not complaining however as they do the job and the price is right but they should be represented as being  generic substitutes.</li>
            <li> Work great for first couple of brushes then not so much. Expensive</li>
            <li> I decided to try these instead of the Philips because of the price difference. These work but need to be replaced after a week or two, while the Philips heads last as long as three months. Here&#x27;s hoping for a competitor to come up with quality comparable to the Philips replacement heads . . . and perhaps one with a brush holder made of softer plastic!</li>
