            <li>Great price.</li>
            <li>After doing the math, this product is superior and a deal. ).</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>It is light weight, easy to put on, and feels wonderful.</li>
            <li>and I really liked it.  </li>
            <li>The consistency is nice</li>
            <li>Great arrived quickly</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn Eye Repair Cream for many years and am completely satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>I found this product at my facialist office, but she was charging $20.00 more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for many years.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Consistency of product is caulkier than it should be; I have used Dermalogica Intensive Eye Repair Cream for many years and never has it looked like this.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a flair up in 7 years, my skin looks the best out of all my friends, and a tube lasts me about 3 months (Drug store brands last about a month.</li>
            <li>Have used this product for several years and always find it excellent.</li>
            <li>The packaging just looks &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;, the tube was half-full, and it also has a strong odor with a not so creamy/liquid consistency.  </li>
            <li>The entire Dermalogica product line is great for skin.</li>
            <li>I have fair, sensitive skin and this eye cream is fantastic.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s original sealed box.</li>
            <li>üëçüëçüëçüëç I have been using dermologica products for last two years &amp; works so good</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t apply makeup over it without rubbing most of it off.</li>
            <li>quality, arrive quickly</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the cost.</li>
            <li>going back to Elizabeth Arden Ceramide Plump Perfect Eye Moisture Cream - at least it provides temporary improvement which the Dermalogica does not.</li>
            <li>the product itself is great, however my tube was only approximately half way full when it was supposed to be new from the seller.</li>
            <li>While the doctor&#x27;s treatment cleared up the issue, I needed to change my skin care routine to really solve the problem.</li>
            <li>No bells and whistles - this simple white tube contains a rich but light, unscented cream to keep the dryness away from your under-eye and eyelid areas.  </li>
            <li>It is not like an original Dermalogica eye cream tube, the plastic material is not in good quality, it is very thin.</li>
            <li>At the time, I was in my early 20 and eye care was not part of my routine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure that this product is either fake, tampered with, or expired (or all 3).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve developed allergies to makeup and this is the only product I can use for my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I like this product as it does provide a lot of moisture around my eyes but it does not dry.  </li>

            <li> It adds moisture to the skin while also providing a good base for concealers, eyeshadows, and other eye makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product from the Dermatologica counter at Ulta a few months back</li>

            <li> I love Dermalogica products, so I was extremely disappointed when I received this</li>

            <li> Tube looks slightly worn as if it had been tampered with.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure what this is, but I am certainly not putting it on my eyes, and am returning it.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;The seal was missing as well as half the product.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> Expensive, but you use only a bit - lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not particularly effective.  </li>
            <li> This eye cream is disappointing especially for its price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very unhappy.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product from the Dermatologica counter at Ulta a few months back and I really liked it.  When I ran out, I went ahead and ordered it off of Amazon instead of going to my local Ulta (Yay, Amazon Prime FTW).  I&#x27;m pretty sure that this product is either fake, tampered with, or expired (or all 3).  The packaging just looks &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;, the tube was half-full, and it also has a strong odor with a not so creamy/liquid consistency.  Not at all like the product I bought in-store at the official Dermatologica counter.  What a waste of money.  My advice is to order this from the official Dermatologica site or stop by your local Ulta.</li>
            <li> quality, arrive quickly</li>
            <li> The best, and one of the most affordable out there! The only eye cream I see that makes a difference!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn Eye Repair Cream for many years and am completely satisfied with it.  I also use other Dermalogica products .</li>
            <li> A must have for anyone over 40!</li>
            <li> Great price. I found this product at my facialist office, but she was charging $20.00 more. I found it on Amazon and it is a great product for the wrinkles around the eyes.!</li>
            <li> the product itself is great, however my tube was only approximately half way full when it was supposed to be new from the seller.</li>
            <li> The effect of cooling the eye area works wonders!  Love it!  Definitely worth the cost.</li>
            <li> The entire Dermalogica product line is great for skin. I&#x27;ve used it for many years.</li>
            <li> I love Dermalogica products, so I was extremely disappointed when I received this product.&lt;br /&gt;The seal was missing as well as half the product.&lt;br /&gt;Will not order from this company again...I&#x27;ll just pick it up in person from a store.</li>
            <li> I have improvement in the tissue around my eyes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve developed allergies to makeup and this is the only product I can use for my eyes.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Great arrived quickly</li>
            <li> üëçüëçüëçüëç I have been using dermologica products for last two years &amp; works so good &amp; now my husband also started using eye cream .</li>
            <li> The consistency is nice but it&#x27;s not particularly effective.  I&#x27;ve used it twice a day for over week and I notice no \\&quot;repair\\&quot; - neither temporary nor lasting. This eye cream is disappointing especially for its price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going back to Elizabeth Arden Ceramide Plump Perfect Eye Moisture Cream - at least it provides temporary improvement which the Dermalogica does not.</li>
            <li> Arrived in non-standard package (no Dermalogica box).  Tube looks slightly worn as if it had been tampered with.  Consistency of product is caulkier than it should be; I have used Dermalogica Intensive Eye Repair Cream for many years and never has it looked like this.  I&#x27;m not really sure what this is, but I am certainly not putting it on my eyes, and am returning it.</li>
            <li> No bells and whistles - this simple white tube contains a rich but light, unscented cream to keep the dryness away from your under-eye and eyelid areas.  Expensive, but you use only a bit - lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> The product is perfect but I have doubts to trust this seller. They send me the product without it&#x27;s original sealed box. Also the expiration date over is damaged, I can&#x27;t read it. It is not like an original Dermalogica eye cream tube, the plastic material is not in good quality, it is very thin. I doubt this may be used or expiration date is over. I think they fooled me. My boyfriend I bought this in NJ and didn&#x27;t controlled it, now I am in Istanbul, Turkey and I can not return it. I am very unhappy.</li>
            <li> I like this product as it does provide a lot of moisture around my eyes but it does not dry.  You really can&#x27;t apply makeup over it without rubbing most of it off.</li>
            <li> I have fair, sensitive skin and this eye cream is fantastic. The dry conditions of Southern California wreaked havoc on my skin and caused eczema flair ups on my eye lids.

I haven&#x27;t had a flair up in 7 years, my skin looks the best out of all my friends, and a tube lasts me about 3 months (Drug store brands last about a month. After doing the math, this product is superior and a deal. ). It adds moisture to the skin while also providing a good base for concealers, eyeshadows, and other eye makeup. I use it day and night along with Dermalogica spf 15 daily eye for days as my eye concealer/eye shadow primer and Dermalogica power firm at night for anti-aging. It is light weight, easy to put on, and feels wonderful.</li>
