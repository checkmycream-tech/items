    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Great concept but</li>
            <li>This is a great idea</li>
            <li>Pissed that they have discontinued a great product.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>, welcome, ladies and gentlemen!&lt;br /&gt;Holy</li>
            <li>Makes good memories</li>
            <li>I used it on legs, underarms and bikini line and loved it.</li>
            <li>A good product that I have been using for years.</li>
            <li>the nair cream works better for course hair on the legs great products tho.</li>
            <li>I also find it potentially hazardous because it can pose a fall risk.</li>
            <li>and my legs were SMOOTH!</li>
            <li>would be better if it worked.</li>
            <li>and I found that when I put it on my legs it burned and to top it off -</li>
            <li>Yes, it is better then the cucumber smelling Nair, and</li>
            <li>I ended up switching bathrooms so that I could shower safely.</li>
            <li>Granted it would take most of a can for everything</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found it because of that.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will buy more of it.</li>
            <li>other then that it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li>I thought since I was in Iraq that I should invest in a shaving cream that would be easy to remove hair.  </li>
            <li>It did not wash off as easy.</li>
            <li>When I went to wash it off I used a loofah as I was rinsing and the hair came off so easily</li>
            <li>This product works great for men&#x27;s back and chest hair.  </li>
            <li>Only con is it burns armpits but its great for legs</li>
            <li>No other product works as good as this stuff</li>
            <li>This sounded like a dream come true -</li>
            <li>the last bottle I used was really really good</li>
            <li>First I was excited about the idea of a spray</li>
            <li>I have to say that this is not a product worth spending money on.</li>
            <li>If you can handle a title discomfort the results are worth it.</li>
            <li>Right when i got in the shower it washed off</li>
            <li>a great product Sally....expected better from such a big big company like yours.</li>
            <li>After applying the product to the first leg, the tub was so slippery that I had to get out.</li>
            <li>Im really pleased with this product especially with summer coming !</li>
            <li>You have to wait a while, and then use hot water and rub it off.</li>
            <li>I first tried this product a couple years ago.  </li>
            <li>However, I was pleased to find out that this might be the ONLY hair remover that I&#x27;m not allergic to.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>It REALLY tried out my skin.</li>
            <li>Very upset its been discontinued.</li>
            <li>no matter how much I scrubbed.</li>
            <li>Yes, it did not drip, that&#x27;s the only thing true to the label.  </li>
            <li>It makes the tub/shower surface so slippery that it will present a fall risk even to a healthy, mobile individual.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money or time unless you like standing in the shower for 10 minutes barely being able to breathe for the smell, hoping it will work!</li>
            <li>I am normal sized 5&#x27;6\\&quot; and 135 lbs.</li>
            <li>, basically, this is a nice product because I&#x27;m not allergic to it, but there&#x27;s not enough and it doesn&#x27;t even last all that long.</li>
            <li>I was extremely disappointed, but luckily, my legs did not develop red irritation or bumps, as the other reviewers who experienced burning did, so I was able to shave my legs.   </li>
            <li>I didnt think it would work because it&#x27;s not thick like veet, but it surprised me.</li>
            <li>I bought this product at my local walmart with the intention of using it on my legs and bikini line but decided to just test it on my legs first to see how I reacted to it.</li>
            <li>first of all I can tell you the can only lasted for 2 times.</li>
            <li>First off, I wait the 3 minutes it tells you to and tested the removal in a small location on my leg, didn&#x27;t do anything, reapplied and waited the full 10 minutes before I showered it off as instructed.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR CASH.</li>
            <li>It really is not effective and the stench is so overwhelming</li>
            <li>and I could&#x27;t agree more with rest of the negative reviews...</li>
            <li>My legs, though burning, do feel soft and hairy.</li>
            <li>Now first, let me say that when I shave I have stubble about 24 hours or less afterwards and need to shave again every other day if I want to continuously have smooth legs.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product if you need a hair remover that is simple and not messy.</li>
            <li>However, the complete opposite occurred.  </li>
            <li>Okay I have extremely sensitive skin with coarse dark hair, I used to shave up until I got a mrsa infection on my leg from a razor ive been trying everything to find a product that removes hair, leaves my legs smooth and isnt too painful (and wont cause another mrsa problem)</li>
            <li>even the short, barely visible hairs did not get removed.</li>
            <li>At first I thought this might just be because I left it sitting too long, but after reading all the other reviews, I now know that&#x27;s not the answer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The spray is thick, with a mild stinging.</li>

            <li> The spray is thick, with a mild stinging.</li>
            <li> I have not had any problems with the Sally Hanson other than the only place I could find it was a local Dillons.  </li>
            <li> I have always hate having to shave all the time, and the application process for other hair removal creams was always way more effort than I was willing to put in.</li>
            <li> it was very hard to keep the tube straight and spray... and 3 minutes are not enough.</li>
            <li> I would rather take the extra time to apply the other hair removal creams or to shave.</li>
            <li> It burnt my legs and never removed a single hair.</li>
            <li> Yes, I accidentally sprayed some on my bathroom wall, but still, that&#x27;s not very much.</li>
            <li> It left patches of hair that were so glued down, they couldn&#x27;t be shaved off.</li>
            <li> After showering, I inspected my legs, and it seemed that the cream only took off about half the hair.</li>
            <li> Lastly, whatever it got off, grew back within 2 days so it was almost no better than shaving.  </li>
            <li> Overall, this product was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions - took off everthing, including my toe ring (bottle says to remove all jewelry), got in the shower, closed the door and started spraying away.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t burn, but I can definitely see how it could very painful and hazardous</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying, I&#x27;ve never felt so compelled to negatively review a  product, so this is my first negative review.</li>
            <li> I tested the product on a small area on the back of my ankle to ensure I would not have a reaction.</li>
            <li> And if, as the other reviews said, the hair began to grow again after two days, I would rather save the $8 every two days and go get my legs waxed.</li>
            <li> I had to turn my head in the other direction to breathe.</li>
            <li> I have arthritis, so I&#x27;m very careful in the tub and shower.</li>
            <li> Possibly due to holding can upside down?</li>
            <li> and the Steep price $9 is absolutely not worth it.</li>
            <li> I checked my legs out and saw lots of patches left over, some thick hair and some lighter hairs.</li>
            <li> The can doesn&#x27;t work if you use it upside down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very easy to do.</li>
            <li> It stinks the whole house out even with the door closed!</li>
            <li> and I smell a little stinky.</li>
            <li> It took a little hair off (about 5-10%) after the recommended 3+ minutes.</li>
            <li> but now I think it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I wish I bothered researching for a few minutes online before purchasing a Canister of Agony.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this one over the \\&quot;extra strength\\&quot; hair remover by Sally Hansen because the foam is quite thin, and it will slide off your leg.</li>
            <li> I have weird allergies and usually react to stuff marked hypoallergenic, so I was nervous about using this brand because I can&#x27;t use Sally Hansen makeup.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I like this product...</li>
            <li> The after feeling is slick and slimy.</li>
            <li> it was a blue one and said 3 minutes formula which did not smell as bad as this pink bottle</li>
            <li> Over the next couple days, when my skin got wet, the awful smell came back-</li>
            <li> a lot of fumes that it made it hard to breathe...</li>
            <li> The can is essentially one-use,  which is crazy for the price.</li>
            <li> The bottle didn&#x27;t say how thick the mouse should be.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product!!</li>
            <li> Do not buy, waste of money, and just about kills your skin!!</li>
            <li> Even when i lifted my leg up, a dangerous move since this product made the bathtub VERY slippery, the coverage was still mediocre - thin in some places, thick in others.</li>
            <li> Well, once you spray it, you can barely breathe it smells so bad.</li>
            <li> Sorry to have to smash this review but thumbs down!</li>
            <li> I lifted my arms up, so it wouldn&#x27;t rub off, and there was a terrible burning sensation on my right armpit.</li>
            <li> So I was highly disappointed, especially with the price.</li>
            <li> Thirdly it truly stinks and the smell takes forever to go away!</li>
            <li> Stung like crazy, smelt terrible, don&#x27;t try it in your basement, because the smell will stink up the whole floor even if you did it in your bathroom with a closed door.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving and everything I tried would leave my skin red, swollen and burnt.  </li>
            <li> This was really the worst product ever</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s worse is</li>
            <li> Also it smells sooo bad like chemicals and other harmful substances.</li>
            <li> Oh how wrong I was!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is so frustrating!   </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an expensive, one-use, burning lotion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Firstly this pink bottle item smells disgusting!</li>
            <li> stinks, tub gets slippery, it doesn&#x27;t do its job..</li>
            <li> The odor was unpleasant and lingered despite running an exhaust fan and disposing of or cleaning everything it touched.</li>
            <li> so unless you stand on your head, it&#x27;s impossible to press the spray button while holding can upright.  </li>
            <li> Then, the pain got so bad</li>
            <li> , it didnt smell too bad.</li>
            <li> Smells bad but who cares!</li>
            <li> It was the worst product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I used surgicream hair remover and it was terrible</li>
            <li> This is awful, and I will never buy it again.</li>
            <li> It smells terrible, burned my nipple, but the hair is all gone!</li>
            <li> This product smells terrible.</li>
            <li> Horrible item leaves hair, smells horrible and irritates skin at use.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It did not work for me at all.. even the short, barely visible hairs did not get removed. I regret buying this product. the can doesn&#x27;t spray well, and it doesn&#x27;t spray evenly.</li>
            <li> This sounded like a dream come true - I have always hate having to shave all the time, and the application process for other hair removal creams was always way more effort than I was willing to put in. When I saw the Spray-On, Shower-Off cream, it elimanated the idea of shaving and cumbersome application.   I tested the product on a small area on the back of my ankle to ensure I would not have a reaction. After 5 minutes, it came off with running water, and so did the hair. I waited 24 hours, and then did the rest of my legs. The bottle was only enough for one application on my legs, and I am a tiny girl, so it is not as if I had to use a lot. After 5 minutes, the pores on my legs began to tingle, so I took off the cream.   After showering, I inspected my legs, and it seemed that the cream only took off about half the hair. I was extremely disappointed, but luckily, my legs did not develop red irritation or bumps, as the other reviewers who experienced burning did, so I was able to shave my legs.   Overall, this product was a waste of money. I would rather take the extra time to apply the other hair removal creams or to shave. And if, as the other reviews said, the hair began to grow again after two days, I would rather save the $8 every two days and go get my legs waxed.</li>
            <li> Well, once you spray it, you can barely breathe it smells so bad. I sprayed it on my legs, and it was burning but I decided to take it like a man. My legs got rashy redness on them. Then, I sprayed it on my armpits, cause nobody likes the gray look you have on your pits after you shave. I decided to do it because it is supposed to dissolve the hair. I lifted my arms up, so it wouldn&#x27;t rub off, and there was a terrible burning sensation on my right armpit. Then, the pain got so bad, that I washed the stuff off and looked at my armpit and there was a bleeding crack in it. I washed it off my legs too after that and the hair was halfway gone, and halfway there still. Please do not get this product. The crack looks like a fault line and I call it my earthquake. Makes good memories but I have to avoid putting deodorant on it and I smell a little stinky. Yeah, it caused me problems, so there you go.</li>
            <li> It was the worst product I have ever used. It took a lot of spraying to cover my legs... a lot of fumes that it made it hard to breathe... it was very hard to keep the tube straight and spray... and 3 minutes are not enough. First I was excited about the idea of a spray but now I think it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> well I dont have course hair so I guess that&#x27;s why it worked for me. I sprayed my legs and left it on for 10 minutes. I didnt think it would work because it&#x27;s not thick like veet, but it surprised me. Right when i got in the shower it washed off and my legs were SMOOTH! the only thing i didnt like was the fact that it didnt give me the same finish my veet would have. Veet your legs feel well conditioned after, but the sally henson left my legs feeling like i needed to lotion them. other then that it&#x27;s a great product! I really like it.</li>
            <li> I thought since I was in Iraq that I should invest in a shaving cream that would be easy to remove hair.  However, the complete opposite occurred.  I still had to shave after I used the product.  It did not wash off as easy.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at my local walmart with the intention of using it on my legs and bikini line but decided to just test it on my legs first to see how I reacted to it. First off, I wait the 3 minutes it tells you to and tested the removal in a small location on my leg, didn&#x27;t do anything, reapplied and waited the full 10 minutes before I showered it off as instructed. Now first, let me say that when I shave I have stubble about 24 hours or less afterwards and need to shave again every other day if I want to continuously have smooth legs. This product left me stubble equivalent of 2 days of not shaving and itchy as heck and that was after the maximum 10 minutes of being on the skin. So I was highly disappointed, especially with the price. I don&#x27;t have a problem with the smell of these products and it sprayed well. Great concept but would be better if it worked.</li>
            <li> I have to say that this is not a product worth spending money on. The can says \\&quot;Last days longer than shaving\\&quot; which is a lie, because the hair grew back at the same pace as regular shaving would. Stung like crazy, smelt terrible, don&#x27;t try it in your basement, because the smell will stink up the whole floor even if you did it in your bathroom with a closed door. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product!! I would recommend  TRIA, a laser-type hair remover. To look further into it, go to triabeauty.com.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I like this product...the last bottle I used was really really good it was a blue one and said 3 minutes formula which did not smell as bad as this pink bottle one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually thought it would&#x27;ve been the SAME formula, with the packaging changed. Oh how wrong I was!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly this pink bottle item smells disgusting! and I found that when I put it on my legs it burned and to top it off - not all the hair was removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a great product Sally....expected better from such a big big company like yours. Sorry to have to smash this review but thumbs down!</li>
            <li> This is a great idea but that&#x27;s it! first of all I can tell you the can only lasted for 2 times. I am normal sized 5&#x27;6\\&quot; and 135 lbs. and to spray both legs well that was all that was in the can. Secondly, it never fully removed the hair and I left it on for 5 minutes plus. Thirdly it truly stinks and the smell takes forever to go away! Lastly, whatever it got off, grew back within 2 days so it was almost no better than shaving.  Don&#x27;t waste your money or time unless you like standing in the shower for 10 minutes barely being able to breathe for the smell, hoping it will work!</li>
            <li> I agree a lot with \\&quot;Raven L&#x27;s\\&quot; review.   I followed the instructions - took off everthing, including my toe ring (bottle says to remove all jewelry), got in the shower, closed the door and started spraying away.  1. The can doesn&#x27;t work if you use it upside down. And let&#x27;s FACE it people, legs are lower then our arms so unless you stand on your head, it&#x27;s impossible to press the spray button while holding can upright.  2. Coverage is splotchy. Possibly due to holding can upside down? Even when i lifted my leg up, a dangerous move since this product made the bathtub VERY slippery, the coverage was still mediocre - thin in some places, thick in others. The bottle didn&#x27;t say how thick the mouse should be.  3. Yes, it did not drip, that&#x27;s the only thing true to the label.  4. The chemical was quite toxic! I felt the fumes traveling up the shower and into my eyes. Literally, like peroxide rising up and burning my eyes a bit.  5. After 3min, it had no effect so i let it on for 8min. I have a bit thicker, coarser hair, figured it need it.  6. When i used the shower water to rinse it away, the mousse came off but HAIR AND CHEMICAL STAYED ON. I had to use a sponge with SOAP to remove the hair/chemical/residue and all! Without the sponge, meaning water alone, neighter the hair not the chemical would have gone away.  7. After i got out of the shower I needed body oil. It REALLY tried out my skin. It didn&#x27;t burn, but I can definitely see how it could very painful and hazardous if someone has open nicks or cuts. It would STING like a B****. You get it.  8. I checked my legs out and saw lots of patches left over, some thick hair and some lighter hairs. It&#x27;s like the spray picked and chose WHERE to burn the hair away. This is so frustrating!   9. My overall review - DO NOT WASTE YOUR CASH. Yes, it is better then the cucumber smelling Nair, and it once you use the sponge and soap it will rinse off in the shower, and unlike Nair it won&#x27;t leave lotion chunks. However, it does NOT deliver what is written on the bottle. and the Steep price $9 is absolutely not worth it.</li>
            <li> This product simply didn&#x27;t work. I used it per package directions, leaving it on the maximum 10 minutes. It damaged my leg hair, but didn&#x27;t remove any of it. The odor was unpleasant and lingered despite running an exhaust fan and disposing of or cleaning everything it touched. I also find it potentially hazardous because it can pose a fall risk. It instructs the user to apply it in the shower or tub. It makes the tub/shower surface so slippery that it will present a fall risk even to a healthy, mobile individual. I have arthritis, so I&#x27;m very careful in the tub and shower. After applying the product to the first leg, the tub was so slippery that I had to get out. I ended up switching bathrooms so that I could shower safely.</li>
            <li> This product works great for men&#x27;s back and chest hair.  I highly recommend this product if you need a hair remover that is simple and not messy.</li>
            <li> Okay I have extremely sensitive skin with coarse dark hair, I used to shave up until I got a mrsa infection on my leg from a razor ive been trying everything to find a product that removes hair, leaves my legs smooth and isnt too painful (and wont cause another mrsa problem) I used surgicream hair remover and it was terrible didnt even help the hair AND it burned. . I just bought this today sprayed it on before I turned the water on and let it sit for maybe 4 minutes, it didnt smell too bad. When I went to wash it off I used a loofah as I was rinsing and the hair came off so easily I couldnt believe it becaude nothing else works ! Im really pleased with this product especially with summer coming ! Id tell anyone of my friends to try it ! Definatly try it !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very easy to do. You have to wait a while, and then use hot water and rub it off. Some of it will come off with just the pressure of shower water, but some you have to rub off.</li>
            <li> Burns! Smells! My skin left swollen! Do not buy, waste of money, and just about kills your skin!! It stinks the whole house out even with the door closed!</li>
            <li> Love,love,love this stuff! Only con is it burns armpits but its great for legs and i can deal with that! Pissed that they have discontinued a great product. I have used this since it came out. Works great. Smells bad but who cares! I wash with soap and water again after using this and the smell is gone. Very upset its been discontinued. No other product works as good as this stuff</li>
            <li> I first tried this product a couple years ago.  I hate shaving and everything I tried would leave my skin red, swollen and burnt.  I have not had any problems with the Sally Hanson other than the only place I could find it was a local Dillons.  Now they are not carrying it either and I saw where it is discontinued.  I used it on legs, underarms and bikini line and loved it. Spray it on, then wait 3 minutes, jump in the shower and use a washcloth to rub it off.  Granted it would take most of a can for everything but the effects last longer than shaving and now my hair grows in sparse.</li>
            <li> Ever desired that feeling where all of your leg hair follicles are simultaneously on fire but you didn&#x27;t want to try some \\&quot;natural\\&quot; procedure, like waxing, but decided copious amounts of chemicals was truly the way you&#x27;ve envisioned since childhood?&lt;br /&gt;Then, welcome, ladies and gentlemen!&lt;br /&gt;Holy god...I wish I bothered researching for a few minutes online before purchasing a Canister of Agony. Everywhere burns. AGGGGHHHGGHGH.</li>
            <li> 1. The stench is unbearable. I just used this and the smell was wretched. I had to turn my head in the other direction to breathe. It took a little hair off (about 5-10%) after the recommended 3+ minutes. It really is not effective and the stench is so overwhelming I thought I was getting lightheaded in the shower.</li>
            <li> This was really the worst product ever and I could&#x27;t agree more with rest of the negative reviews...&lt;br /&gt;I wish there was an option to give 0 stars...&lt;br /&gt;It stinks, tub gets slippery, it doesn&#x27;t do its job..</li>
            <li> The spray is thick, with a mild stinging. Takes about 5-8 minutes to get all the hair. The only thing is that you have to dedicate one wash cloth just for rubbing the hair off. Once you used it, it smells for ever. I would recommend this one over the \\&quot;extra strength\\&quot; hair remover by Sally Hansen because the foam is quite thin, and it will slide off your leg.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying, I&#x27;ve never felt so compelled to negatively review a  product, so this is my first negative review. This is awful, and I will never buy it again. The can is essentially one-use,  which is crazy for the price. It burnt my legs and never removed a single hair. My legs, though burning, do feel soft and hairy. It&#x27;s an expensive, one-use, burning lotion. I would not recommend it at all.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well on course hair but the nair cream works better for course hair on the legs great products tho.</li>
            <li> It smells terrible, burned my nipple, but the hair is all gone! If you can handle a title discomfort the results are worth it. I was looking like an ape but now I look like a hairless cat!</li>
            <li> I got this product but didn&#x27;t use it and kept it in a drawer for a year or two. When my electric razor broke, I decided to try it. I have weird allergies and usually react to stuff marked hypoallergenic, so I was nervous about using this brand because I can&#x27;t use Sally Hansen makeup. However, I was pleased to find out that this might be the ONLY hair remover that I&#x27;m not allergic to. I&#x27;m so glad I found it because of that.&lt;br /&gt;However, here&#x27;s the problem. The can was only enough to do my calves and my pits. Yes, I accidentally sprayed some on my bathroom wall, but still, that&#x27;s not very much. What&#x27;s worse is I used it on Thursday night and by Monday morning I had noticeable hair growth again. At first I thought this might just be because I left it sitting too long, but after reading all the other reviews, I now know that&#x27;s not the answer.&lt;br /&gt;So, basically, this is a nice product because I&#x27;m not allergic to it, but there&#x27;s not enough and it doesn&#x27;t even last all that long. Quite a bummer.</li>
            <li> NOTE: This product was left on ten minutes. This product smells terrible. The after feeling is slick and slimy. It doesn&#x27;t remove hair efficiently. It left patches of hair that were so glued down, they couldn&#x27;t be shaved off. Where it didn&#x27;t leave patches,it left alot of stubble. Over the next couple days, when my skin got wet, the awful smell came back- no matter how much I scrubbed.</li>
            <li> I will buy more of it. It removes hair as described. A good product that I have been using for years.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all. Horrible item leaves hair, smells horrible and irritates skin at use. No hair came off after I used it as specified on the instructions. Also it smells sooo bad like chemicals and other harmful substances.</li>
