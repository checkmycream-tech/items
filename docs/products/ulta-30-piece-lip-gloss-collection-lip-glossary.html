            <li>Very nice selection of colors</li>
            <li>, it is good.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with my order.</li>
            <li>But again, it&#x27;s a nice lip gloss line and selection.</li>
            <li>the colors are even better looking in person .</li>
            <li>Please don&#x27;t try to remove it with a chemical and then put on more</li>
            <li>The colors are wonderful and I would definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li>But keep in mind that you are getting 30 and even though I haven&#x27;t used many of them I&#x27;ll admit that they are pretty nice lip glosses.</li>
            <li>So many fun colors.</li>
            <li>Small in size but perfect for your pocket.</li>
            <li>When I ask to use a bathroom to rinse my face with water maybe you could have something like a clean cloth to offer</li>
            <li>Colors are wonderful, I was sent with two missing, but got a refund right away after emailing the company.</li>
            <li>as described and shipped quickly</li>
            <li>They come very small but love all the colors!!!</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m happy with this purchase, the glosses are PERFECT for your makeup bags or to put in your pocket,, small enough and the case even comes with a plastic thing to help you pop the glosses out.</li>
            <li>The colors are nice but they were smaller than I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Love the colors...but they were smaller</li>
            <li>You see we all want to be pretty</li>
            <li>They are too small, but I do love the color selection!</li>
            <li>Ulta Ladies - when a client comes in and says she has very sensitive skin please believe her words.</li>
            <li>Although they are small as my pinky , i still love this set i likebhow</li>
            <li>I am willing to try but not if I am just going to be brushed off when I share my experiences with your products sold in the store.</li>
            <li>But I really like the set, and I don&#x27;t wear gloss daily so for me</li>
            <li>Please don&#x27;t put foundation and powder all over her face and then act surprised when it starts burning and itching.</li>
            <li>Then when you recommend another line and I go to a different lady, just to talk about my face reaction, please new lady don&#x27;t act so surprised that the makeup hurt my sensitive skin and say you &amp;#34;have never heard of anyone having a reaction before&amp;#34;.</li>

            <li> They&#x27;re half the size of an adult woman&#x27;s pinkie!)</li>
            <li> Although the bottles were only about as big as a half dallor, I sort of expected them to be  just a tinny bit bigger.</li>
            <li> so I dry my face instead of me fumbling around trying to get an industrial papertowel.</li>
            <li> I like the product, It gives a wide array of colors, and</li>
            <li> DO NOT PURCHASE IF YOURE ONLY GOING TO USE A FEW shades.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that if you wear lip gloss everyday, this may not be what ur looking for.</li>
            <li> it has a slight tint of color</li>
            <li> it comes with like a little scooper to get the lip gloss out .</li>
            <li> How could anyone not LOVE a 30 piece Ulta lip gloss selection.  </li>
            <li> These are extremely small in size, provides moisture</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had sample sizes of lip glosses before but these are extremely small (the size of a child&#x27;s pinkie.</li>
            <li> To small.  </li>
            <li> It was too small.</li>
            <li> Very small</li>
            <li> Not too thin and not too thick.</li>

            <li> They come very small but love all the colors!!!</li>
            <li> Bought these to fill bachlorette gift bags.. Very small but the quality is great. So many fun colors.</li>
            <li> I like the product, It gives a wide array of colors, and the color n feel on my lips are great. My only complaint is that if you wear lip gloss everyday, this may not be what ur looking for. The bottles are the sample size and maybe I missed that in the description. But I really like the set, and I don&#x27;t wear gloss daily so for me, it is good.</li>
            <li> the colors are even better looking in person . Although they are small as my pinky , i still love this set i likebhow it comes with like a little scooper to get the lip gloss out . I am very satisfied with my order.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve had sample sizes of lip glosses before but these are extremely small (the size of a child&#x27;s pinkie. They&#x27;re half the size of an adult woman&#x27;s pinkie!) But keep in mind that you are getting 30 and even though I haven&#x27;t used many of them I&#x27;ll admit that they are pretty nice lip glosses. Not too thin and not too thick. Would I buy again? No. But again, it&#x27;s a nice lip gloss line and selection.</li>
            <li> The colors are nice but they were smaller than I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Must have for every makeup artist starting out; these are tiny enough to give away as a bonus for bridesmaids, brides, or prom queens! Colors are wonderful, I was sent with two missing, but got a refund right away after emailing the company.</li>
            <li> Very nice selection of colors</li>
            <li> These are amazing!!! They are so tiny but there&#x27;s thirty of them and they last for hours so that makes up for it! DO NOT PURCHASE IF YOURE ONLY GOING TO USE A FEW shades.</li>
            <li> This is my second experience with burning on my face from Ulta products.  The lip gloss is not what did it but sometimes as a customer you are not heard and you have to keep speaking until you are heard.&lt;br /&gt;Dear Ulta Ladies - when a client comes in and says she has very sensitive skin please believe her words. Please don&#x27;t put foundation and powder all over her face and then act surprised when it starts burning and itching. Please don&#x27;t try to remove it with a chemical and then put on more that&#x27;s a different color. When I ask to use a bathroom to rinse my face with water maybe you could have something like a clean cloth to offer so I dry my face instead of me fumbling around trying to get an industrial papertowel. Then when you recommend another line and I go to a different lady, just to talk about my face reaction, please new lady don&#x27;t act so surprised that the makeup hurt my sensitive skin and say you &amp;#34;have never heard of anyone having a reaction before&amp;#34;. You see we all want to be pretty but some lady&#x27;s have skin that just doesn&#x27;t agree with some products and if we can&#x27;t wear one maybe we can wear another. I am willing to try but not if I am just going to be brushed off when I share my experiences with your products sold in the store.</li>
            <li> They are too small, but I do love the color selection!</li>
            <li> Although the bottles were only about as big as a half dallor, I sort of expected them to be  just a tinny bit bigger. Overall I&#x27;m happy with this purchase, the glosses are PERFECT for your makeup bags or to put in your pocket,, small enough and the case even comes with a plastic thing to help you pop the glosses out. The colors are wonderful and I would definitely purchase this product again.</li>
