            <li>The wife says this stuff is the best she&#x27;s tried for powdering all her various lady parts.</li>
            <li>Summer is here and I&#x27;ve been tapping into this lovely powder more and more as I wear shorts and skirts.</li>
            <li>Ladies Anti Monkey Butt is awesome!</li>
            <li>Funny name, good stuff.  </li>
            <li>The corn starch works as an amazing oil adsorbent, and I rarely have to re-apply any more powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since I was buying the powder to use in those places that tend to get sticky and sometimes irritated during the summer months, I thought this the perfect solution to keep dry, reduce friction, and soothe any rashiness that might occur.</li>
            <li>Best powder ever for keeping you dry!</li>
            <li>Those damn monkeys have ruined, some of the most important occasions of my life.</li>
            <li>Great for these old fannys that are irritated.  </li>
            <li>There are other unmentionable locations that I use this wonderful powdery potion.    </li>
            <li>It goes on really smoothly and does not fall on to your clothes.</li>
            <li>The scent is so light as to be undetectable...and with the feel of luxury.</li>
            <li>warm (particularly warm and humid) weather, most women can benefit from keeping the bra-line and the groin (at the leg folds) fresh and dry.</li>
            <li>This is the sweet lady-like (light) smell to my dreams.  </li>
            <li>This powder is smoothing, pleasant to use and does prevent chafing if used regularly.  </li>
            <li>It smells really nice and feels very soft when you use it.</li>
            <li>I now have a great paying job with a fortune 500 company and will be getting married next summer.</li>
            <li>I give it as gifts to my friends because I love it so much.</li>
            <li>At first, I thought this as just some sort of gag gift, but its a real useful body powder.</li>
            <li>Super silky feel</li>
            <li>The natural ingredients (very very fine cornstarch) and calamine powder (zinc oxide) are what my skin needed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Further, I prefer this powder to [[ASIN:B00A71EH2Y Fresh Breasts]], which is, IMHO a 4-star version of this type of product.</li>

            <li>Anti Monkey Butt is much better than baby powder</li>
            <li>I found the scent to be closer to \\&quot;pure constarch\\&quot; than anything else.  </li>

            <li>It is very understated.</li>
            <li>The powder has a light fresh fragrance and the actual powder is a light pink color.</li>
            <li>Fabulous stuff, not one chafed inner thigh yet!</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>I most frequently recommended an antifungal cream to treat any infection present, followed by a strict regimen of powder application to prevent recurrence.</li>
            <li>When I got to the proper shelf, I found that if I wanted any, I&#x27;d not only have to buy this ginormous container (about the size of a half-gallon of milk) but also make do with the store&#x27;s own brand.</li>

            <li>B001W4FKDU Anti Monkey Butt Powder, Original 6 oz]]</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Because of them I was ostracized in both High School and College.</li>
            <li>Its great for your sweaty and uncomfortable lady parts.</li>
            <li>It is the first product that has kept me dry through summer, stress, and hot flashes.</li>
            <li>Purchased for a trip to southern Africa, some of which was hot &amp; humid.  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasant aroma but not overwhelming: it would not interfere with any other  scent you may want to use.</li>
            <li>Not a fresh or clean scent.  </li>
            <li>but it really does actually work.</li>
            <li>My wife was near the head of the line when God was handing out lady parts.</li>
            <li>The good thing is that the calamine does not cause an uncomfortable burning sensation like some mentholated products do.</li>
            <li>I used it for something not typical or intended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to fellow female riders.</li>
            <li>It goes on of course SUPER PALE, but in as little as 20 minutes, any semblance of powder disappeared and my true complexion is all that came through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is anti friction powder and really makes you feel dry.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It also solved another major issue;</li>
            <li>day, I realized I was out of my normal face powder, and out of desperation, I started dusting on Lady Monkey Butt powder.</li>
            <li>When I practiced Women&#x27;s Health in New Orleans, I often saw, \\&quot;Monkey Boobs,\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I think it refers to skin irritation, usually fungal in nature, that arises from a prolonged moist state of skin, particularly in areas that don&#x27;t get too much air.</li>
            <li>Though I was thrilled that the product contained calamine, I was ever so slightly disappointed to give up the corn starch component that&#x27;s been my mainstay ever since I first moved to an area with a tropical</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m willing to forgo to save a few bucks.</li>
            <li>That said, the butt, per se, is not necessarily the female body part most affected by this affliction, but the skin affected certainly does take on the red angry appearance of a monkey&#x27;s butt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Keeps skin dry and silky smooth, even in areas where perspiration is the most annoying.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Ladies Anti Monkey Butt is awesome! It is the first product that has kept me dry through summer, stress, and hot flashes. It smells great, feels great and works!</li>
            <li> Thank goodness companies are making good options for us women who need medicated powder. This stuff works nicely with itchy, painful, and moisture-problem areas. It also smells nice and is lightly pink in color. The pink definitely made me smile and the labeling is awesome haha!</li>
            <li> This product smells really great and does help with chafing/irritated skin like it says it does. However, it cakes a lot after you have sweated and it&#x27;s a little gross. But overall an okay product because it works.</li>
            <li> I use this product on my kids after they have been swimming. It works great.  I also use it when I wear skirts and it makes life a lot better!</li>
            <li> My husband is a diabetic and get sores under his belly and groin area quickly in hot weather. The anti monkey butt powder prevents this. My son has psoriasis and gets sores easily in hot weather from sweat and the powder stops and or heals quickly. Greatest stuff they have ever used!!![[ASIN:B001W4FKDU Anti Monkey Butt Powder, Original 6 oz]]</li>
            <li> This powder is smoothing, pleasant to use and does prevent chafing if used regularly.  It has a pleasant aroma but not overwhelming: it would not interfere with any other  scent you may want to use. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> What can I say.  It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  Will keep on buying it.</li>
            <li> I spend a lot of time driving in the summer and things tend to get.... irritated. Since you cant really spend the day scratching where the sun doesn&#x27;t shine... this saves you ass, literally!</li>
            <li> This is the first product I have used that eliminated my chaffing completely. Every time I exercise, my thighs chaff badly. Not anymore!! It has a pleasant smell and it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> What is Monkey-Butt and who wouldn&#x27;t want to avoid it? I think it refers to skin irritation, usually fungal in nature, that arises from a prolonged moist state of skin, particularly in areas that don&#x27;t get too much air. When I practiced Women&#x27;s Health in New Orleans, I often saw, \\&quot;Monkey Boobs,\\&quot; the same type of irritation occurring under the bra line. I most frequently recommended an antifungal cream to treat any infection present, followed by a strict regimen of powder application to prevent recurrence. That said, the butt, per se, is not necessarily the female body part most affected by this affliction, but the skin affected certainly does take on the red angry appearance of a monkey&#x27;s butt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During warm (particularly warm and humid) weather, most women can benefit from keeping the bra-line and the groin (at the leg folds) fresh and dry. This powder is a great solution. Interestingly enough, it was suggested to me by Amazon when I last purchased, [[ASIN:B001ED1JQG Simone Chickenbone Chicken Poop Lip Junk]], as it appeared in the, \\&quot;Customers Who Viewed This Item Also Viewed,\\&quot; section. I was aghast, really, because the first time that I discovered this Anti-Monkey Butt Powder, I was also buying Chicken Poop Lip Junk. This is kismet, I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually buy all of my toiletry items at a particular Brick&amp;Mortar store, mostly because the store carries authentic high end salon products at deeply discounted prices. When I was last there (walking around with a tube of Chicken Poop Lip Junk in my basket), I was looking for some plain baby powder, but wanted the corn starch variety. When I got to the proper shelf, I found that if I wanted any, I&#x27;d not only have to buy this ginormous container (about the size of a half-gallon of milk) but also make do with the store&#x27;s own brand. No go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I continued to browse, I came upon this, [[ASIN:B001W4FKDU Anti Monkey Butt 06017 Pain and Itch Powder, 6 Ounce Calamine Powder]]. Since I was buying the powder to use in those places that tend to get sticky and sometimes irritated during the summer months, I thought this the perfect solution to keep dry, reduce friction, and soothe any rashiness that might occur. Though I was thrilled that the product contained calamine, I was ever so slightly disappointed to give up the corn starch component that&#x27;s been my mainstay ever since I first moved to an area with a tropical climate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I was overall satisfied with the results I got from [[ASIN:B001W4FKDU Anti Monkey Butt 06017 Pain and Itch Powder, 6 Ounce Calamine Powder]], you can imagine my delight when, while browsing my favorite market place, I came upon this Ladies version,[[ASIN:B0027JYB4I Anti Monkey Butt Lady Anti Friction Powder with Calamine Satin Smooth -- 6 oz]], which has a corn starch base! Though it may be purely psychological, I prefer the Ladies&#x27; version with Corn Starch after having tried both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further, I prefer this powder to [[ASIN:B00A71EH2Y Fresh Breasts]], which is, IMHO a 4-star version of this type of product. Fresh Breasts was perhaps slightly less effective than Anti-Monkey Butt, but primarily was downgraded because it is much more liquidy than expected (and therefore difficult and more time consuming to apply and allow to dry). I did a side-by-side comparison of these two products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, despite my adoration for the aforementioned Brick&amp;Mortar discount drug store, I must admit that Amazon&#x27;s price for this product trumps the store&#x27;s. The only drawback is that you miss the smirk on the cashier&#x27;s face when they eye your purchase choice, but it&#x27;s a pleasure I&#x27;m willing to forgo to save a few bucks.owder to use in those places that tend to get sticky and sometimes irritated during the summer months, I thought this the perfect solution to keep dry, reduce friction, and soothe any rashiness that might occur.

            <li> I had a bad allergic reaction to this powder &amp; had to be seen at the ER because it was so bad so be very careful when using this powder, it can cause serious damage like it did me &amp; it was very painful.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several months and it is fabulous. It eliminates chaffing and excess moisture from the inner thighs and the buttocks. It goes on really smoothly and does not fall on to your clothes. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> You know how it goes, they say if you are not those things then you can&#x27;t say them...well, I&#x27;m just one out of three now -  ha, ha.    Oh, how I have suff&#x27;ah&#x27;d!  I have used talc, that mediciney gold bottle, ice, etc.  The raw rubbed oozing locations from before are no more.    This is the sweet lady-like (light) smell to my dreams.  I have always loved calamine lotion, wished for pinkish talc, and desired the smooth \\&quot;swish swish\\&quot; of my legs.  There are other unmentionable locations that I use this wonderful powdery potion.    If you are even thinking of purchasing this and wonder if you will get the results you want then I would say TRY IT - seriously, I would be surprised if you didn&#x27;t get great results.  The other reviews were swaying me but it was the FREE SHIPPING that finally hooked me.  Gosh, this is now going to be my one and only!      TWO Anti-Monkey Butt Lady Anti Friction Powder with Calamine Up for me!!    P.S. - a smaller TRIAL SIZE would be a great NEXT PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> As a disabled equestrian who rides with a prosthetic leg, you should take it from me that this stuff really works.    I jump, ride dressage, barrel race, show competitive trail, the whole nine yards and my prosthesis rubs and tears at my skin at times. It can get very painful, specially at the posting trot and holding a two point for cross country! I would get off the horse with horrible sores and not be able to walk properly for a while, sometimes I would even miss lessons.    I got this product for christmas and its worked like a dream. I have less and less sores from riding and I can now ride longer. Its great because I can fully enjoy my lessons now. When I begin to get active in more sports I will continue to use this stuff.    Even if you&#x27;re able bodied, this would probably work great. No saddle sores, and no stirrup leather rubbing.    I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> All of my family members love it, including the kids.</li>
            <li> Calamine powder is an amazing thing. I used it for something not typical or intended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have suffered for YEARS from acne, and I have tried everything from medicated powders, Proactive, washing my makeup brushes weekly, even wearing NO makeup did NOTHING FOR IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day, I realized I was out of my normal face powder, and out of desperation, I started dusting on Lady Monkey Butt powder. It goes on of course SUPER PALE, but in as little as 20 minutes, any semblance of powder disappeared and my true complexion is all that came through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also solved another major issue; oiliness. I have always had oily skin, probably made worse by my daily attacks with chemicals and lotions to control the acne. The natural ingredients (very very fine cornstarch) and calamine powder (zinc oxide) are what my skin needed. The calamine powder reduces inflammation, and it actively kills bacteria and supports the skins immunity. The corn starch works as an amazing oil adsorbent, and I rarely have to re-apply any more powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember to wash your face nightly though if you use this method! Never go to bed with makeup on, and always change your pillow covers weekly, wash your makeup brushes just as often.</li>
            <li> I think most people buy this as a gag gift but it really does actually work. Plus it smells nice.</li>
            <li> Due to hormonal changes during breastfeeding, I would get hives during working caused by sweat out so this is the only product that would prevent it. Super silky feel</li>
            <li> Ah! Love this stuff! As many women do, I wear many hats that require hard work, and with that hard work comes, let&#x27;s be honest, sweat- runner, gardner, coach. teacher, mother of little ones...&lt;br /&gt;You do not know what you are missing until you try this! I used to use baby powder- never again!&lt;br /&gt;I also never leave the house in a dress/skirt without it on my thighs!&lt;br /&gt;My husband even started using it...until I ordered him the &amp;#34;non-lady&amp;#34; monkey butt!</li>
            <li> This powder smells wonderful and keeps the friction bumps at bay for those of us ladies with no thigh gap!</li>
            <li> Keeps the sweat and friction from causing rashes.  The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because it sticks to my hands and clothing and is tricky to wash off!  Otherwise, love it!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to fellow female riders. My recommended this product and I am so grateful he did. We rode approx. 240 miles; if it wasn&#x27;t for monkey butt I would&#x27;ve had issues. This is a must have!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this powder. It smells really nice and feels very soft when you use it. Its a great product.</li>
            <li> I got someone else&#x27;s reject. It was half used and had taped up the top. Couldn&#x27;t get the tape off and when I did it was all sticky and the powder stuck to it coming out. The bottle was about 1/2 used. Wouldn&#x27;t replace as I hadn&#x27;t opened the bag and contacted them in 30 days. Who knew it was going to be used? Will NOT purchase from this person again!</li>
            <li> I found the scent to be closer to \\&quot;pure constarch\\&quot; than anything else.  Not a fresh or clean scent.  The powder was VERY \\&quot;cakey.\\&quot;  I was even brushing chunks of it out of my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not impressive (to me)</li>
            <li> OMG, this product saved my life. For the majority of my life I have been plagued by monkey butt. Those damn monkeys have ruined, some of the most important occasions of my life. I mean who wants to date the girl, with monkeys coming out of her butt. Because of them I was ostracized in both High School and College. I had been unable to hold a job; I mean come on who wants to hire someone who has monkeys climbing out of their butt during important meetings. I ended up working low paying temporary jobs that I could do from home. I had no close friends, no possibility of getting married or ever having children. Then I found your product, within one week the monkeys had all packed up and moved on. I now have a great paying job with a fortune 500 company and will be getting married next summer. Without your product this would never have happened. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU...</li>
            <li> My wife was near the head of the line when God was handing out lady parts. Being amply endowed apparently has its downside though, and the hot, sticky summers of Southern Illinois cause uncomfortable sweating in all the wrong places. The wife says this stuff is the best she&#x27;s tried for powdering all her various lady parts. She likes the scent, the silky feel and the way this stuff prevents irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally hate powder of all kinds. The stuff gets everywhere... but that&#x27;s just me. The wife says \\&quot;give it five stars,\\&quot; and I say \\&quot;yes, dear\\&quot; and give it five stars. Happy wife, happy life. Five stars it is.</li>
            <li> Works great. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is anti friction powder and really makes you feel dry.  It removes any sticky feeling and lasts a long time too.  I like the smell.  It is very understated.</li>
            <li> I give it as gifts to my friends because I love it so much. Best powder ever.  I have used it for years.</li>
            <li> Funny name, good stuff.  Good price.  Great for gag gift that someone can use.  I would buy from this vender again.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought this as just some sort of gag gift, but its a real useful body powder. The powder has a light fresh fragrance and the actual powder is a light pink color. The powder soothes pretty quickly after application. Its great for your sweaty and uncomfortable lady parts. The good thing is that the calamine does not cause an uncomfortable burning sensation like some mentholated products do.</li>
            <li> use this product for horseback riding, biking, etc. Works as advertised with no side effects. Would definitely recommend and may buy some of the baby one for my grandbaby.</li>
            <li> Purchased for a trip to southern Africa, some of which was hot &amp; humid.  This eased chaffing in various body parts!</li>
            <li> Summer is here and I&#x27;ve been tapping into this lovely powder more and more as I wear shorts and skirts. Fabulous stuff, not one chafed inner thigh yet! Paired up with the Monostat Chafing Relief Powder-Gel, it&#x27;s a win win for the summer!</li>
            <li> This works and smells great. Perfect for humid weather like the South. I used this for clinicals where I was sweating up a storm and it worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> Great.  It is great in hot weather.  Keeps you dry and cool, can&#x27;t expect anything more.  don&#x27;t complaint anymore. Yep</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  Great for these old fannys that are irritated.  I have used it for years.  Also good for poison ivy.</li>
            <li> Best powder ever for keeping you dry! Anti Monkey Butt is much better than baby powder it feels so smooth and keeps you dry for hours.</li>
            <li> This powder is unequaled in all of powderdom. Keeps skin dry and silky smooth, even in areas where perspiration is the most annoying. Lady Anti Monkey Butt has no talc, a huge plus for those of us who avoid talc at all costs. Unlike other powders, it lasts and lasts after application. The scent is so light as to be undetectable...and with the feel of luxury. Girls, don&#x27;t be put off by the name.</li>
