    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is a great wetting solution!</li>
            <li>Both are very good...</li>
            <li>They are a great combo, and these wetting drops work great for adding comfort when I put my contacts in.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them for more than 30 years...and they were great....</li>
            <li>their solutions were the best by far...</li>
            <li>This is almost as good as Optimum WRW but get twice as much in each bottle so much better value.  </li>
            <li>Love the Lobob.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I use this in conjunction with the available Lobob cleaners.  </li>
            <li>THis is the solution you need to be comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Lobob&#x27;s re-wet solution is more like the old &#x27;Barnes-Hinds solution...which is not made any more...</li>
            <li>Smaller than expected but great to find this brand!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get Wetting solution in 2oz which is also useful for flushing eyes and wetting the plunger.  </li>
            <li>I typically use Optimum by Lobob for my gas permeable lenses.  </li>
            <li>I find it be effective and the equivalent of other wetting agents I have used, and at an affordable price.</li>
            <li>Best rewetting prior to hard lens insertion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing hard lenses for over 40 years and this product is about as good as Allergan&#x27;s Liquifilm which is no longer made.</li>
            <li>I can only use the more popular hard lens solution for about a month before it bothers me so much</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t been available until I saw it when looking for lens wetting solution recently.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for carrying this product.  </li>
            <li>Unlike many wetting solutions (including Lobob Optimum) which feel thick and a little sticky when you put your lenses inn, this feels as if you really were using bottled tears.  </li>
            <li>It makes my contacts very comfortable, plus doesn&#x27;t make them cloudy like some other solutions do!</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;fog\\&quot; my lenses after a few hours, as many solutions do.</li>
            <li>I have tried several different wetting solutions for hard contacts (necessary because I have keratoconus) and this is the best one.  </li>
            <li>It was unbearable for someone with sensitive eyes.  </li>
            <li>This product was considerably cheaper</li>
            <li>Surely I am one of the last hard contact lens wearers.  </li>
            <li>WORKS JUST FINE FOR THE HARD CONTACT LENSES.</li>
            <li>As far as I&#x27;m concerned, Lobob is the only solution which allows me to continue rgp lens wear.  </li>
            <li>Gives me clearer vision right off the bat than the usual ones found in stores.</li>

            <li> Due to allergies, Lobob is the only contact lens solution I can wear without getting itchy burning eyes and eyelids.  </li>
            <li> Lobob brand is expensive, but to save me the hassle that I had with other Gas Permeable lens cleaning, wetting, and soaking products, it&#x27;s worth all the extra dollars!</li>
            <li> Other products for gas permeable, multipurpose, etc just don&#x27;t work as well.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find this in the local stores now.</li>
            <li> May not bother the average person.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Boston for awhile and after a few hours, it started drying my lenses.  </li>
            <li> Lobob is hard to find in stores in Michigan.</li>
            <li> I have had problems finding wetting solutions for my hard contacts that didn&#x27;t either sting or burn.  </li>
            <li> It is impossible to find in the local stores.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Lobob&#x27;s re-wet solution is more like the old &#x27;Barnes-Hinds solution...which is not made any more...So between the two I prefer the re-wet solution over the standard wetting solution...Both are very good...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still wish Barnes Hinds was still in business...their solutions were the best by far...I&#x27;ve used them for more than 30 years...and they were great.... But sold out to other corporate raiders...</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.  It was recommended by my doctor, but I was using it even before that.  I&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li> This is a great wetting solution! It makes my contacts very comfortable, plus doesn&#x27;t make them cloudy like some other solutions do!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Boston for awhile and after a few hours, it started drying my lenses.  Love the Lobob.  It lasts for a long time.  I&#x27;ve been wearing hard lenses for over 40 years and this product is about as good as Allergan&#x27;s Liquifilm which is no longer made.</li>
            <li> Unlike many wetting solutions (including Lobob Optimum) which feel thick and a little sticky when you put your lenses inn, this feels as if you really were using bottled tears.  There is no discomfort on putting it in my eye and it doesn&#x27;t feel as if it bunks up your eye when you put your lenses in.</li>
            <li> Irritates my eyes.  It was unbearable for someone with sensitive eyes.  May not bother the average person. Not for me.</li>
            <li> This is almost as good as Optimum WRW but get twice as much in each bottle so much better value.  We keep a bottle of WRW around for those times when it is only solution that will work.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It cushions well without being too &amp;#34;goopy&amp;#34; like some wetting solutions.</li>
            <li> Hard to find this in the local stores now. Gives me clearer vision right off the bat than the usual ones found in stores.</li>
            <li> Surely I am one of the last hard contact lens wearers.  THis is the solution you need to be comfortable.  Other products for gas permeable, multipurpose, etc just don&#x27;t work as well.  Lobob is hard to find in stores in Michigan.</li>
            <li> I have used this product a number of years ago.  It hasn&#x27;t been available until I saw it when looking for lens wetting solution recently.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected but great to find this brand!</li>

            <li> I have had problems finding wetting solutions for my hard contacts that didn&#x27;t either sting or burn.  This is soothing &amp; makes it easier to wear the lens longer.</li>
            <li> Best rewetting prior to hard lens insertion.</li>
            <li> I typically use Optimum by Lobob for my gas permeable lenses.  This product was considerably cheaper so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I have noticed no difference between how this feels on my eyes and the more expensive product.  I will be buying this from now on.</li>
            <li> Due to allergies, Lobob is the only contact lens solution I can wear without getting itchy burning eyes and eyelids.  I can only use the more popular hard lens solution for about a month before it bothers me so much I have to either get Lobob, or stop wearing my contacts.  As far as I&#x27;m concerned, Lobob is the only solution which allows me to continue rgp lens wear.  Thanks Amazon for carrying this product.  It is impossible to find in the local stores.</li>
            <li> The brand my wife has always uses. She tried some others but returns to Lobob.</li>
            <li> I find it be effective and the equivalent of other wetting agents I have used, and at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> Item just as described--works well.</li>
            <li> My wife has used Lobob products for years. They even contacted us when I ordered this item they knew was being upgraded so that we could change our order if we wanted to. Delivery has been faster than promised, that&#x27;s a plus, too, as we were really low when I ordered the newer WRW.  I couldn&#x27;t get Wetting solution in 2oz which is also useful for flushing eyes and wetting the plunger.  I might get some simple saline solution for that purpose in the future.</li>
            <li> WORKS JUST FINE FOR THE HARD CONTACT LENSES.</li>
