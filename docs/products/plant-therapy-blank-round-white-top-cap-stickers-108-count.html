            <li> Exactly what I needed for the tops of roller bottles!</li>
            <li> Cheap. Came in the mail all crumbled up and doesn&#x27;t even stick to the bottles. They keep peeling off. Not worth $6. Maybe $1.</li>
            <li> Works perfect on my essential oils bottles and helps to keep the in order.</li>

            <li> These work perfectly with my smaller bottles that I have.</li>
            <li> Bought these labels because I have essential oils in a box just for the oils. The problem I have is that I have to take each bottle out of the box to see what the name is on the bottle. These lifesaver tabs make it easy to just open the box and read the label and grab the bottle I want. It saves me a lot of time..Great idea.</li>
            <li> These blank labels are perfect for my sample bottles of essential oils!!😊😊😊</li>
