            <li>Till the the soap is ok.</li>
            <li>Good soap, smells good doesn&#x27;t lather much but does clean....</li>
            <li>Seba med has a very clean smell and feel.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really strong.</li>
            <li>i love it for my face too, light and clean.</li>
            <li>, it makes my whole bathroom smell amazing...</li>
            <li>I purchased this soap free product to help manage severe eczema.  </li>
            <li>and my doctor had recommended I use soap free products.</li>
            <li>This soap feels so clean when using it.  </li>
            <li>I love, love, love the way this soap-free cleanser bar smells, and I really like how soft my skin feels after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li>Right?!</li>
            <li>He cannot stand to have it near his face, but he told me my arms and face smell nice after I use it.  </li>
            <li>The smell is really clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>it does fade quickly after the shower</li>
            <li>And, when ever I feel my scalp &amp; hair need a quick pick me up</li>
            <li>The soap works well, but the smell is pretty overbearing!  </li>
            <li>Now, if a product clears up your skin, and makes you skin silky soft, and people proclaim they will not simply live without this bar - it must be good!</li>
            <li>This and Aveeno lotion help calm dowm my eczema.</li>
            <li>Worth giving it a try.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and always has many pocks on it.</li>
            <li>Well, the silky soft feeling others were talking about, it is true!</li>
            <li>We first found this in 2011 in Heidelberg, Germany.</li>
            <li>like taking hot baths and for some time now</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I will admit I was sitting and just rubbing my arm in disbelief howsoft and silky</li>
            <li>the shampoo has a strong perfume smell, and this soap has the same smell.</li>
            <li>My grandson as an infant had very patchy dry skin and even the Doctor remarked to my daughter to use more lotion.  </li>
            <li>I was perplexed, well, I thought, every 28 days a new layer, or something in that manner, but this was happening more and more often, everyday in the end, and when it was happening that often, and all over my body, I finally took action.</li>
            <li>If we can go into space, surly there must be something you can get clean with and not dry out a layers of skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I needed something gentle.</li>
            <li>also, it doesn&#x27;t remove waterproof sunscreen very well.</li>
            <li>She uses it on her psoriasis and says it really helps.</li>
            <li>At the same time, how can you get clean without soap?</li>
            <li>The biggest problem with facial cleaners is that it&#x27;s all about finding the right thing that your skin will agree with (e.g., some people just use body soap to wash their faces!).</li>
            <li>Furthermore, yesterday, for the first time in months, I stepped out of the shower and no dead skin is rubbing off... anywhere?</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>My son, who also has sensitive skin says the smell of this cleanser bar really stings his nose.  </li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to  soap</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>How revolting my old soap/ cleansing products look to me now!</li>
            <li>I thought I was soft before!</li>
            <li>Met my expectations completely.</li>
            <li>So, not everybody in our house can use this stuff; some of us are sensitive to it.</li>
            <li>however, I did like the sebamed body wash and that took off the sunscreen on the first soap down and lathered very well.</li>
            <li>Cheap, expensive, unconventional, tested and untested - I still do like using my blue light by Tria though...</li>
            <li>When my husband comes in from a long sweaty day of work this soap on his scalp is very healing.</li>
            <li>My husband has sensitive skin and this is the only soap that he has found that works for him.</li>
            <li>Too perfumey and its hard to feel clean when there is no lather.</li>
            <li>For whatever reason, this soap is extremely gentle for people with sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t dry out my face like how some other facial cleansers might.     </li>
            <li>as far as skin balance goes I have not used it long enough to see a diffrence....</li>
            <li>A little too much .....</li>
    </ol>

            <li> In the past, prior to my finding out about this soap, I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of stuff, from things like ProActive to even more expensive brands that were imported from France which I cannot remember the name of.</li>
            <li> I even dry faster</li>
            <li> I had to soap down several times to take the sunscreen off.</li>
            <li> It has a very heavy scent which was unexpected.</li>
            <li> I have been using soap all my life, old habits die hard.</li>
            <li> life - pry it from my cold dead hands - Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but it left my skin unclean and the very little lather is not acceptable.</li>
            <li> What convinced me were other peoples reviews...</li>
            <li> I thought I too should contribute to the raving SebaMed reviewers, because I too am converted, and the world should know about this bar, so they can stop buying the other garbage products.</li>
            <li> Although the bar is a little expensive, it worth each penny.</li>
            <li> Hands down - swear on my mamas</li>
            <li> after using this bar for less than a week, I am thinking to myself: How could I use soap?</li>
            <li> plus, my skin feels drier but less drier than dove soap.</li>
            <li> I would step out and as I am drying myself I am also rubbing off dead skin.</li>
            <li> So, I will not use this product again and will continue my search for a sensitive skin cleansing product that does not make my skin worse!</li>
            <li> What a mess!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not sure how to explain it.</li>
            <li> this is the only thing that doesn&#x27;t make me itch like crazy every time I shower.</li>
            <li> The worst part for me was that it caused itchy rashes on my skin - something I am trying to prevent with soap free products.</li>
            <li> They almost look sad...</li>
            <li> sorry that i had to give this a 1 star</li>
            <li> After using Seba for around 3 months, they won&#x27;t appear crazily like before.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> stopped problems immediately. Great smell. Recommended by dermatologist during shingles issue. Will use ongoing. looks like each bar will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Met my expectations completely. I am highly satisfied with this product.The product was shipped in good condition and I got it on time too.</li>
            <li> My grandson as an infant had very patchy dry skin and even the Doctor remarked to my daughter to use more lotion.  A nurse I work with recommended Sebamed and it is great.  No medicine smell, lathers nicely.  My grandchildren are 5 and 7 and still use it.  Worth giving it a try.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I&#x27;ve used this product for about 5 years now. I intend to use it for the rest of my life.     In the past, prior to my finding out about this soap, I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of stuff, from things like ProActive to even more expensive brands that were imported from France which I cannot remember the name of. Nothing worked for my face and it would always cause irritation and sometimes more acne. For whatever reason, this soap is extremely gentle for people with sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t dry out my face like how some other facial cleansers might.     All in all, if you&#x27;ve got acne problems and you&#x27;ve tried literally EVERYTHING, or find that you get irritations from your current facial cleaners, give this bar-soap a try. I&#x27;d recommend using one entire bar-soap through before coming to a conclusion of whether it works for you or not. The biggest problem with facial cleaners is that it&#x27;s all about finding the right thing that your skin will agree with (e.g., some people just use body soap to wash their faces!).</li>
            <li> My husband has sensitive skin and this is the only soap that he has found that works for him. We first found this in 2011 in Heidelberg, Germany. My husband has been using it ever since, and has had NO SKIN RASHES since!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! Hands down - swear on my mamas life - pry it from my cold dead hands - Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like taking hot baths and for some time now I would step out and as I am drying myself I am also rubbing off dead skin. I was perplexed, well, I thought, every 28 days a new layer, or something in that manner, but this was happening more and more often, everyday in the end, and when it was happening that often, and all over my body, I finally took action. I have heard that soap was drying, but what is the alternative? Olive oil cleansing? But all over my body?! What a mess! Need a better way! If we can go into space, surly there must be something you can get clean with and not dry out a layers of skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By some happenstance, which is beyond me, I stumbled upon this cleansing bar and thought Germans know their stuff! Lets try it... At the same time, how can you get clean without soap? Right?! I have been using soap all my life, old habits die hard. What convinced me were other peoples reviews... Now, if a product clears up your skin, and makes you skin silky soft, and people proclaim they will not simply live without this bar - it must be good! And guess what? IT IS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I thought I too should contribute to the raving SebaMed reviewers, because I too am converted, and the world should know about this bar, so they can stop buying the other garbage products. And oh, I have had them all! Cheap, expensive, unconventional, tested and untested - I still do like using my blue light by Tria though...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after using this bar for less than a week, I am thinking to myself: How could I use soap? How revolting my old soap/ cleansing products look to me now! They almost look sad... Furthermore, yesterday, for the first time in months, I stepped out of the shower and no dead skin is rubbing off... anywhere? I even dry faster it seems... The first time I used it, I will admit I was sitting and just rubbing my arm in disbelief howsoft and silky my skin felt. I thought I was soft before! :) Well, the silky soft feeling others were talking about, it is true! No lotion or soap compares!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the way this bar smells, it makes my whole bathroom smell amazing... Thus, goodby soap! We had a good run...</li>
            <li> I purchased this soap free product to help manage severe eczema.  The soap works well, but the smell is pretty overbearing!  I will use up the bars, but will probably will probably try something else.</li>
            <li> Feel good after showers. My skin is sensitive and always has many pocks on it. After using Seba for around 3 months, they won&#x27;t appear crazily like before. Most pocks disappear. Although the bar is a little expensive, it worth each penny.</li>
            <li> I have eczema on my hands and realized any product with harsh chemicals really aggravates my skin. I wash my hand ALOT throughout the day so I needed something gentle. This does not aggravate my eczema at all no matter how many times I use it in one day. This and Aveeno lotion help calm dowm my eczema. I absolutely love it. Wish I could find this on a shelf somewhere. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This soap feels so clean when using it.  The smell is really clean and fresh.  When I use this regularly my acne is under control.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> i bought this because i use the sebamed shampoo and i&#x27;m happy with it. the shampoo has a strong perfume smell, and this soap has the same smell. it&#x27;s really strong. it does fade quickly after the shower but i kinda don&#x27;t like the fragrance. anyways, i bought this bar soap after reading the reviews, but it doesn&#x27;t lather at all. it&#x27;ll produce some lather after the bar is \\&quot;wetter\\&quot;. i&#x27;m not sure how to explain it. it takes time to lather up with this bar soap, so my showers take longer. i don&#x27;t like that. plus, my skin feels drier but less drier than dove soap. also, it doesn&#x27;t remove waterproof sunscreen very well. I had to soap down several times to take the sunscreen off. again, longer showers that i would like to avoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m sorry that i had to give this a 1 star but it left my skin unclean and the very little lather is not acceptable. I rather use body wash that doesn&#x27;t lather than non-lathering bar soap. i use the rest of the soap as hand soap. however, I did like the sebamed body wash and that took off the sunscreen on the first soap down and lathered very well.</li>
            <li> My second order alonmg with the bath wash. Stopped my constant itching.&lt;br /&gt;I will order again when this order runs out.</li>
            <li> I use the liquid, my hubby and daughter-in-law uses the bar. She uses it on her psoriasis and says it really helps. I am very sensitive to  soap this is the only thing that doesn&#x27;t make me itch like crazy every time I shower.</li>
            <li> Best Cleansing Bar ever used: clean, oil control,soft. affordable price, even better than those $30 cleaner, going to use it forever</li>
            <li> Great product....Doctor recommend</li>
            <li> This is the BEST.  I won&#x27;t leave home without it for fear of what else could end up on my face!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended it and I don&#x27;t buy anything else for my face.  Plus I have gifted it to people that suffer from acne the way I used to and on the first wash you can feel the difference!!!!! Awesome!!!!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product. I have very sensitive skin and my doctor had recommended I use soap free products. I thought this cleansing bar would be perfect for me. It has a very heavy scent which was unexpected. The worst part for me was that it caused itchy rashes on my skin - something I am trying to prevent with soap free products. So, I will not use this product again and will continue my search for a sensitive skin cleansing product that does not make my skin worse!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love the way this soap-free cleanser bar smells, and I really like how soft my skin feels after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  My son, who also has sensitive skin says the smell of this cleanser bar really stings his nose.  He cannot stand to have it near his face, but he told me my arms and face smell nice after I use it.  So, not everybody in our house can use this stuff; some of us are sensitive to it.</li>
            <li> Too perfumey and its hard to feel clean when there is no lather. I would&lt;br /&gt;not purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> Seba med has a very clean smell and feel. No residue. When my husband comes in from a long sweaty day of work this soap on his scalp is very healing. i love it for my face too, light and clean. And, when ever I feel my scalp &amp; hair need a quick pick me up i get my hands all soapy and wash my hair with it, very nice and clean, a bit of conditioner and my scalp feels rejuvenated.&lt;br /&gt;Hope you&#x27;ll enjoy!</li>
            <li> Good soap, smells good doesn&#x27;t lather much but does clean.... Price $4.00 a bar? A little too much .....kirks soap almost as good but priced better.......as far as skin balance goes I have not used it long enough to see a diffrence.... Stay tuned...</li>
            <li> I have just begun using this soap.  I will up grade my review as my eczema improves.  Till the the soap is ok.</li>
            <li> I learned about Sebamed products in Germany, and bought the soap there several years ago.  It&#x27;s still wonderful, and I&#x27;m glad I can get it here.  It&#x27;s clean-smelling and refreshing, great for face and body both, and my favorite for the shower.</li>
