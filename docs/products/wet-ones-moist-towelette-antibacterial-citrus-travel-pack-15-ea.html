            <li>sometimes comes open--not the best to keep in your purse</li>
            <li>Perfect for every day and for going over seas.</li>
            <li>They are the best cleansing hand wipes I have ever used !&lt;</li>
            <li>They smell great and don&#x27;t leave your hands sticky.  </li>
            <li>Great size to throw into my bag or car.</li>
            <li>Everything that is great always gets discountinued.</li>
            <li>The scent is very nice.  </li>
            <li>These are the perfect size and the added quantity makes it that much more desirable.</li>
            <li>Perfect product, better than using hand sanitizer.</li>
            <li>Works great for quick hand cleaning and smells great.</li>
            <li>Great for that quick cleanup needed on my granddaughter.  </li>
            <li>Love the convenience of just throwing a pack in my purse or diaper bag.</li>
            <li>I will be buying this product more often.</li>
            <li>I love these wipes and I use them a lot</li>
            <li>so I like to buy them in bulk as they are no always easy to find at the stores I shop at.</li>
            <li>I especially keep a pack handy if we&#x27;re on vacation, at a concert, or at some kind of festival/fair.</li>
            <li>It has a nice clean scent, and comes in handy when I travel (hotel remote controls, keyboards, light switches, etc.).</li>
            <li>scent is a little strong but fairly pleasant&lt;br /&gt;Package</li>
            <li>Great little wipes for travel and camping.</li>
            <li>I love having wipes handy in my car for cleaning my hands if I can&#x27;t wash them in a restroom, or for cleaning them if they get messy while we&#x27;re out.</li>
            <li>Exactly what we needed.</li>
            <li>I love having a pack of these in my car next to my seat.  </li>
            <li>My hands feel SO clean, &amp; never dried out.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve come in handy when my husband had to change our tire and his hands were black and greasy</li>
            <li>Love this product for the car and at work, but this 15 pack is NOT economical.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t live without them!</li>
            <li>I really like the small of this product -- more coconut than citrus.  </li>
            <li>When I rafted through Alaska, these comprised my nightly &amp;#34;bath,&amp;#34; and as far as I know, did the job of keeping me fresh enough to keep around.</li>
            <li>My only complaint about these is the company stopped making the wet ones BIG ONES in this citrus flavor - which is by FAR the best scent.  </li>
            <li>They held up very well without drying out so quickly as some other wet wipes do.</li>
            <li>And they are handy, small enough to go almost everywhere, and stay moist for a long time.</li>

            <li> Product as advertised</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without them!</li>
            <li> Love the convenience of just throwing a pack in my purse or diaper bag. Use them everyday with my little ones toys, hands, etc.</li>
            <li> Exactly what we needed. Use these often for hiking.</li>
            <li> I love having wipes handy in my car for cleaning my hands if I can&#x27;t wash them in a restroom, or for cleaning them if they get messy while we&#x27;re out. I especially keep a pack handy if we&#x27;re on vacation, at a concert, or at some kind of festival/fair. They&#x27;ve come in handy when my husband had to change our tire and his hands were black and greasy afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Convenient&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;This scent is a little strong but fairly pleasant&lt;br /&gt;Package sometimes comes open--not the best to keep in your purse</li>
            <li> We keep these in our diaper bag for wiping hands, faces, and tables/chairs.  I really like the small of this product -- more coconut than citrus.  And they are handy, small enough to go almost everywhere, and stay moist for a long time.</li>
            <li> We took these on a recent trip to Virginia.  They held up very well without drying out so quickly as some other wet wipes do.</li>
            <li> We purchased these to include in the care packages that we make for the homeless. It has been extrememly difficult to find travel pack wipes in quantities more than 10/per package. These are the perfect size and the added quantity makes it that much more desirable.</li>
            <li> I use these all the time, especially when I travel.  It has a nice clean scent, and comes in handy when I travel (hotel remote controls, keyboards, light switches, etc.).</li>
            <li> Love this product for the car and at work, but this 15 pack is NOT economical.  Retailers sell it as a 20 piece package at the same or cheaper price  I won&#x27;t be buying these on Amazon a second time.  I should have done the math before I purchased.</li>
            <li> Perfect product, better than using hand sanitizer. I will be buying this product more often.</li>
            <li> Perfect for every day and for going over seas.</li>
            <li> Loves there things. Use regularly. No need to pay drug store packet prices.</li>
            <li> I love having a pack of these in my car next to my seat.  They smell great and don&#x27;t leave your hands sticky.

            <li> They are the best cleansing hand wipes I have ever used !&lt;br /&gt;B. Read</li>
            <li> Great little wipes for travel and camping. When I rafted through Alaska, these comprised my nightly &amp;#34;bath,&amp;#34; and as far as I know, did the job of keeping me fresh enough to keep around.</li>
            <li> Used these wipes on our recent trip to Disneyworld.  Great for that quick cleanup needed on my granddaughter.  The scent is very nice.  Ordered a case for future trips.</li>
            <li> Works great for quick hand cleaning and smells great. Great size to throw into my bag or car.</li>
            <li> I use these all day everyday.  Shopping cart handles, after picking up dog poop, before eating in restaurants.  My hands feel SO clean, &amp; never dried out.  My only complaint about these is the company stopped making the wet ones BIG ONES in this citrus flavor - which is by FAR the best scent.  The other sent (in red pack) smells too overpowering &amp; too chemical-y.  Everything that is great always gets discountinued.</li>
            <li> I love these wipes and I use them a lot so I like to buy them in bulk as they are no always easy to find at the stores I shop at. No complaints here!</li>
