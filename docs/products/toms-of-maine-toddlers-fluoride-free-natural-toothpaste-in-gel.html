    <ol>
            <li>/&gt;It has an excellent dispensing system that prevents the toothpaste to streaming out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The taste is (evidently) great, and so he looks forward to brushing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a great training toothpaste.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is a win for our toddler, who loves to brush teeth.</li>
            <li>Happy with this product.</li>
            <li>a great day and shop wisely.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste has a pleasant (not overpowering) fruity taste.</li>
            <li>It does a good job cleaning</li>
            <li>You want to know feel good about what you are putting in/on your body, and Tom&#x27;s does a great job of creating products that are safe and effective for your family.</li>
            <li>I liked this toothpaste and the fact that it was &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; was what drew me in.</li>
            <li>The kids liked it, too.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I didn&#x27;t like the taste either.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is nice for kids who can&#x27;t rinse and spit well (we don&#x27;t want them swallowing fluoride).</li>
            <li>But if you want to try making your own toothpaste, read on...</li>
            <li>my opinion, it did not do the best cleaning job on my 3 year old&#x27;s teeth.</li>
            <li>safe?</li>
            <li>The packaging is cute for toddlers</li>
            <li>We love Tom&#x27;s of Maine toothpaste and have used it for our kids for years.</li>
            <li>so it is safe for children under 2 who haven&#x27;t learned to spit out toothpaste yet.</li>
            <li>(my kids love grapes).</li>
            <li>I looked on another site and saw that it is considered safe although it is classified as a skin irritant by the National Library of Medicine HazMap.</li>
            <li>for the taste, I would describe it as more like grapefruit than grapes.</li>

            <li>The kids love it and are eager to brush their teeth.</li>
            <li>so I think we are getting more valuable brushing time.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is packaged well with an appealing picture in front.</li>
            <li>(Some of the Tom&#x27;s toothpastes do have flouride, so be sure to read the ingredients list)  </li>
            <li>My boys love it.  </li>
            <li>sure it&#x27;s food</li>
            <li>/&gt;-or-&lt;br /&gt;10-15 drops of liquid stevia (this is my preference, but make sure it&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I figured they&#x27;d use this more</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li>The point is to get kids used to the habit of brushing at an early age, and it&#x27;s done a great job at that.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a great, healthy option for children.</li>
            <li>When we go to the dentist ourselves or have a surgical procedure, we could easily skip the anesthetic.  </li>
            <li>It is easy for kids to squeeze.</li>
            <li>This product is very gentle with a nice fruity flavor.</li>
            <li>My favorite brand of Stevia is Sweet Leaf (available on Amazon, about $10 for a 4oz bottle).</li>
            <li>The mild fruit flavor is more like a mild grape flavor which most kids will like</li>
            <li>so we used fluoride free paste for years.</li>
            <li>The texture and tube make for convenient dispensing and brushing, and the cute gator on the tube is a fun addition.</li>
            <li>but it brings me back to my youth, and I&#x27;m happy to report my daughter likes it.</li>
            <li>I do like the fact that it&#x27;s fluoride free</li>
            <li>They are natural and you can rest assured that it&#x27;s good for your baby.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re often buying toddler toothpaste for my 2 year old, so it&#x27;s nice to be able to get some to try out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, I would have loved this as a gum cleaner when my kids were under 18 months old</li>
            <li>/&gt;Things that might be useful to know about this toothpaste is it is gluten free, fluoride free, safe if swallowed, no artificial flavors, doesn&#x27;t foam up when using.</li>
            <li>I am probably more sensitive than many people</li>
            <li>I am probably more sensitive than many people</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is safe if swallowed, which is a real must for something like this as of course, it will get swallowed up like candy.</li>
            <li>Thanks to this taste I am able to get some tooth brushing done.</li>
            <li>Let me back up and tell you what&#x27;s good about this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>But children will swallow anything sweet, won&#x27;t they?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it is overly sweet.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant taste and is free of fluoride, which little kids shouldn&#x27;t use.  </li>
            <li>This is great product for teaching your little one to brush their teeth without worrying about what they might be swallowing.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s not artificial, which I like.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We are currently using Branam Natural Tooth Gel http://www.amazon.com/Branam-Oral-Health-Natural-Xylitol/dp/B007ZXXPU2 and it has worked great with my daughter.</li>
            <li>so much so he slurps it and wants more.  </li>
            <li>give the ingredients 5-stars - fluoride-free and no artificial colors or preservatives.</li>
            <li>love that it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li>it might be just the ticket to help them develop good brushing habits starting at a very young age.</li>
            <li>Tom&#x27;s toddler&#x27;s toothpaste is a great option for small children.  </li>
            <li>I feel good about this product even for my little one.  </li>
            <li>All toddler toothpastes are fluoride free because toddlers swallow the toothpaste (and swallowing fluoride causes discoloration of a child&#x27;s still forming adult teeth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although considered safe by the FDA, I read elsewhere that in the European Union it is classified as toxic or harmful when used &amp;#34;around the mouth.&amp;#34; And according to Wikipedia, benzyl alcohol is toxic to neonates (newborns).</li>
            <li>As with most things, I asked her to try it again a couple days later</li>
            <li>Just like Orajel, it is a clear fluoride free gel.</li>
            <li>I wish the smell wasn&#x27;t so cloyingly sweet, as I&#x27;d prefer taste buds develop in the normal range of sweetness.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried all sorts of fluoride-free toothpaste, and the kids have generally been fine with them.  </li>
            <li>In fact, it pretty much takes a fire, explosion, or risk of immediate electrocution to get us worked up these days.  </li>
            <li>and I wouldn&#x27;t use this toothpaste on any kid that had a full set of 20 teeth in or was eating adult</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t foam up like normal toothpaste, which is good because I can see that foam going all over their little clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Tom&#x27;s of Maine Toddlers toothpaste is easy to screw open and apply to a toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly care for the clear gel and mild, almost sweet flavor, but if you have very young kids</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also happy it has less additives regular toothpaste has.</li>
            <li>Cast iron and stainless steel,</li>
            <li>Mission accomplished, and five stars given.</li>
            <li>My niece has been using this for a while and seems to really like</li>
            <li>If I were to let him, he&#x27;d eat the whole tube of it.</li>
            <li>but they don&#x27;t like that one as much as the Colgate Watermelon one.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Toothpaste isn&#x27;t really needed at all.</li>
            <li>While I get that toothpaste for toddlers should be semi-sweet to get them to like it, this is a bit much.</li>
            <li>It also tastes very artificial.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My son (age two) really likes the flavor,</li>
            <li>They are using it, but they don&#x27;t really like it.</li>
            <li>(If you aren&#x27;t aware of the problem with fluoride toothpaste for children, read the small print on popular brands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of Tom&#x27;s of  Maine products and love this toothpaste for my daughter, who so far has expressed no problems with it.  </li>
            <li>My kids like unique flavors like berry or orange, not the traditional mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the ingredients but the flavor is just... odd.  </li>
            <li>This toothpaste leaves a fairly strong, bitter aftertaste.</li>
            <li>I have used other all-natural and mainstream commercial brands and this one is right toward the top of our favorites.</li>
            <li>After surviving 3 toddlers everyday for years now, the rest is pretty easy.</li>
            <li>Considering it&#x27;s being used on our 2 year old, we can&#x27;t get too much feedback from her on what she thinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We&#x27;d recently tried out some Tom&#x27;s regular children&#x27;s toothpaste that my 8 and 5 year old absolutely love, so we thought we&#x27;d try this out.</li>
            <li>Tom&#x27;s toothpaste is non-toxic, has no preservatives or artificial flavors, gluten and has a pleasant taste although personally I don&#x27;t think anything tastes as good as Colgate which my family used, but unfortunately Colgate includes a controversial ingredient, Triclosan, which is linked to liver and inhalation toxicity.</li>
            <li>G Tom&#x27;s of Maine Fluoride Free Children&#x27;s Toothpaste, Silly Strawberry, 4.2-Ounce (Pack of 3)]] was not an immediate hit from a taste standpoint, but the kids have grown to be OK with it.  </li>
            <li>My 6 year old isn&#x27;t a huge fan of the taste but likes that it doesn&#x27;t lather as much as other toothpastes.  </li>
            <li>The paste is clear (pretty normal for toddler toothpaste), and this one has the advertised mixed berry flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For example, I find the packaging pretty wasteful - the tube is only 1.75oz, and they come in a box.</li>
            <li>/&gt;1/2 tsp fine sea salt (or less,</li>
            <li>The tube is easy to use and the paste thin enough that it&#x27;s easy to squeeze out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure that it cleans as well as the adult toothpaste made by Kiss My Face either (and that tastes better too, I might add).</li>
            <li>Overall, it seems to work and be enjoyed, and be safer than other major brands.</li>
            <li>I mistakenly ordered Tom&#x27;s toddler toothpaste thinking it was for adults but not to waste anything I have been using it and its fine and won&#x27;t harm you or your toddler.</li>
            <li>This Mild Fruit from Tom&#x27;s, on the other hand, was an immediate hit.  </li>
            <li>This toothpaste is a clear and colorless lightweight gel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this to anybody trying to get a young kid to learn to brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fluoride-free so young children won&#x27;t get fluorosis from it.</li>
            <li>Here they are: Glycerin, PDO, water, hydrated silica, xylitol, benzyl alcohol, carrageenan, natural flavor, and citric acid.</li>
            <li>It has a soft fruit flavor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also took a look at the ingredients since this is suppose to be so natural and saw that it has carrageenan in it, which causes digestive problems, inflammation and has had a correlation to cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The berry flavor is sweeter than adult toothpaste which should appeal to children and encourage them to brush their teeth.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ll stick to Toms natural toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got two young boys, 4 to 7.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s about as good as it gets, unfortunately.</li>
            <li>Our kids are a little too big for this toddler&#x27;s toothpaste, but we got it at a very special price and decided to try it just</li>
            <li>The tube is small, almost sample size, and has a twist off lid and its easy to keep clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is however hard to find all natural brands without xylitol (Dr. Mercola&#x27;s toothpaste is one that I found, but probably too strong a taste for children).  </li>
            <li>actually don&#x27;t mind it all that much, but I do have to admit it&#x27;s near the bottom of the list (natural or otherwise) of toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried in recent years.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does not really &amp;#34;foam&amp;#34;, but that does not naturally happen, so I am cool with that.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried several of the Tom&#x27;s natural toothpastes, including this one for toddlers, and generally like their products and product philosophy a lot.</li>
            <li>But personally, I would not give this product to a young child.rageenan &amp;#34;triggers gastrointestinal tract inflammation or contributes to tumor promotion.&amp;#34; And while the evidence is inconclusive, I question putting this ingredient in a product for toddlers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But personally, I would not give this product to a young child.</li>
            <li>She is currently 2 years old.</li>
            <li>Converting over to this toothpaste was no problem, my 23 month old son didn&#x27;t even notice a difference as we brushed his</li>
            <li>and I dislike the overly sugary big kid and adult options.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderfully clean formula that my baby likes and doesn&#x27;t worry me and a little (a pea-sized amount, if that) goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the little extra dough in my book.</li>
            <li>He transitioned to this brand/flavor with no complaint; he&#x27;s too young to ask but we couldn&#x27;t tell that he noticed a difference from the previous brand.</li>
            <li>Beyond that, I can only point out that word natural is frequently used very loosely in advertising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Beyond that, I can only point out that word natural is frequently used very loosely in advertising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My children were so excited to get a cute crocodile tube of toothpaste just for themselves, but they hate the flavor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s training toothpaste, so for safety reasons it has no fluoride, or a lot of other ingredients that would normally go in toothpaste but which you don&#x27;t want a kid to eat.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Tom&#x27;s toddler&#x27;s toothpaste is a great option for small children.  </li>
            <li> I feel good about this product even for my little one.  </li>
            <li> All toddler toothpastes are fluoride free because toddlers swallow the toothpaste (and swallowing fluoride causes discoloration of a child&#x27;s still forming adult teeth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although considered safe by the FDA, I read elsewhere that in the European Union it is classified as toxic or harmful when used &amp;#34;around the mouth.&amp;#34; And according to Wikipedia, benzyl alcohol is toxic to neonates (newborns).</li>
            <li> As with most things, I asked her to try it again a couple days later</li>
            <li> Just like Orajel, it is a clear fluoride free gel.</li>
            <li> I wish the smell wasn&#x27;t so cloyingly sweet, as I&#x27;d prefer taste buds develop in the normal range of sweetness.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried all sorts of fluoride-free toothpaste, and the kids have generally been fine with them.  </li>
            <li> In fact, it pretty much takes a fire, explosion, or risk of immediate electrocution to get us worked up these days.  </li>
            <li> and I wouldn&#x27;t use this toothpaste on any kid that had a full set of 20 teeth in or was eating adult</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t foam up like normal toothpaste, which is good because I can see that foam going all over their little clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Tom&#x27;s of Maine Toddlers toothpaste is easy to screw open and apply to a toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly care for the clear gel and mild, almost sweet flavor, but if you have very young kids</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also happy it has less additives regular toothpaste has.</li>
            <li> Cast iron and stainless steel,</li>
            <li> Mission accomplished, and five stars given.</li>
            <li> My niece has been using this for a while and seems to really like</li>
            <li> If I were to let him, he&#x27;d eat the whole tube of it.</li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t like that one as much as the Colgate Watermelon one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Toothpaste isn&#x27;t really needed at all.</li>
            <li> While I get that toothpaste for toddlers should be semi-sweet to get them to like it, this is a bit much.</li>
            <li> It also tastes very artificial.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My son (age two) really likes the flavor,</li>
            <li> They are using it, but they don&#x27;t really like it.</li>
            <li> (If you aren&#x27;t aware of the problem with fluoride toothpaste for children, read the small print on popular brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Tom&#x27;s of  Maine products and love this toothpaste for my daughter, who so far has expressed no problems with it.  </li>
            <li> My kids like unique flavors like berry or orange, not the traditional mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the ingredients but the flavor is just... odd.  </li>
            <li> This toothpaste leaves a fairly strong, bitter aftertaste.</li>
            <li> I have used other all-natural and mainstream commercial brands and this one is right toward the top of our favorites.</li>
            <li> After surviving 3 toddlers everyday for years now, the rest is pretty easy.</li>
            <li> Considering it&#x27;s being used on our 2 year old, we can&#x27;t get too much feedback from her on what she thinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We&#x27;d recently tried out some Tom&#x27;s regular children&#x27;s toothpaste that my 8 and 5 year old absolutely love, so we thought we&#x27;d try this out.</li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s toothpaste is non-toxic, has no preservatives or artificial flavors, gluten and has a pleasant taste although personally I don&#x27;t think anything tastes as good as Colgate which my family used, but unfortunately Colgate includes a controversial ingredient, Triclosan, which is linked to liver and inhalation toxicity.</li>
            <li> G Tom&#x27;s of Maine Fluoride Free Children&#x27;s Toothpaste, Silly Strawberry, 4.2-Ounce (Pack of 3)]] was not an immediate hit from a taste standpoint, but the kids have grown to be OK with it.  </li>
            <li> My 6 year old isn&#x27;t a huge fan of the taste but likes that it doesn&#x27;t lather as much as other toothpastes.  </li>
            <li> The paste is clear (pretty normal for toddler toothpaste), and this one has the advertised mixed berry flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For example, I find the packaging pretty wasteful - the tube is only 1.75oz, and they come in a box.</li>
            <li> /&gt;1/2 tsp fine sea salt (or less,</li>
            <li> The tube is easy to use and the paste thin enough that it&#x27;s easy to squeeze out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that it cleans as well as the adult toothpaste made by Kiss My Face either (and that tastes better too, I might add).</li>
            <li> Overall, it seems to work and be enjoyed, and be safer than other major brands.</li>
            <li> I mistakenly ordered Tom&#x27;s toddler toothpaste thinking it was for adults but not to waste anything I have been using it and its fine and won&#x27;t harm you or your toddler.</li>
            <li> This Mild Fruit from Tom&#x27;s, on the other hand, was an immediate hit.  </li>
            <li> This toothpaste is a clear and colorless lightweight gel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this to anybody trying to get a young kid to learn to brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fluoride-free so young children won&#x27;t get fluorosis from it.</li>
            <li> Here they are: Glycerin, PDO, water, hydrated silica, xylitol, benzyl alcohol, carrageenan, natural flavor, and citric acid.</li>
            <li> It has a soft fruit flavor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also took a look at the ingredients since this is suppose to be so natural and saw that it has carrageenan in it, which causes digestive problems, inflammation and has had a correlation to cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The berry flavor is sweeter than adult toothpaste which should appeal to children and encourage them to brush their teeth.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ll stick to Toms natural toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got two young boys, 4 to 7.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s about as good as it gets, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Our kids are a little too big for this toddler&#x27;s toothpaste, but we got it at a very special price and decided to try it just</li>
            <li> The tube is small, almost sample size, and has a twist off lid and its easy to keep clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is however hard to find all natural brands without xylitol (Dr. Mercola&#x27;s toothpaste is one that I found, but probably too strong a taste for children).  </li>
            <li> actually don&#x27;t mind it all that much, but I do have to admit it&#x27;s near the bottom of the list (natural or otherwise) of toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried in recent years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does not really &amp;#34;foam&amp;#34;, but that does not naturally happen, so I am cool with that.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried several of the Tom&#x27;s natural toothpastes, including this one for toddlers, and generally like their products and product philosophy a lot.</li>
            <li> But personally, I would not give this product to a young child.rageenan &amp;#34;triggers gastrointestinal tract inflammation or contributes to tumor promotion.&amp;#34; And while the evidence is inconclusive, I question putting this ingredient in a product for toddlers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But personally, I would not give this product to a young child.</li>
            <li> She is currently 2 years old.</li>
            <li> Converting over to this toothpaste was no problem, my 23 month old son didn&#x27;t even notice a difference as we brushed his</li>
            <li> and I dislike the overly sugary big kid and adult options.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderfully clean formula that my baby likes and doesn&#x27;t worry me and a little (a pea-sized amount, if that) goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the little extra dough in my book.</li>
            <li> He transitioned to this brand/flavor with no complaint; he&#x27;s too young to ask but we couldn&#x27;t tell that he noticed a difference from the previous brand.</li>
            <li> Beyond that, I can only point out that word natural is frequently used very loosely in advertising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Beyond that, I can only point out that word natural is frequently used very loosely in advertising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My children were so excited to get a cute crocodile tube of toothpaste just for themselves, but they hate the flavor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s training toothpaste, so for safety reasons it has no fluoride, or a lot of other ingredients that would normally go in toothpaste but which you don&#x27;t want a kid to eat.</li>
            <li> My 6 and 8 year olds are extremely picky about toothpaste flavors and have tried nearly all children toothpastes in grocery stores.  </li>
            <li> It is a great training toothpaste and the taste isn&#x27;t half bad.  </li>
            <li> Also, the price is a bit high for such a small serving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is produced in several ways; the method involving corn is conversion &amp;#34;from corn syrup effected by a genetically modified strain of E. coli.&amp;#34; That&#x27;s not very</li>
            <li> And since multiple kids didn&#x27;t I&#x27;ll have to go with an average rating.</li>
            <li> and I found this terribly bitter.</li>
            <li> and I found this terribly bitter.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t one that works for more than a month or two and then sticks worse than any broken Teflon pan - and you will find THOUSANDS of &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; reviews, and not one of them is</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m just not sure it&#x27;s definitely not going to appeal to everyone.</li>
            <li> but they both are not interested in it.  </li>
            <li> the other ingredients?</li>
            <li> The tube is a small size so that children can actually squeeze it themselves.  </li>
            <li> Our nerves were worn down years ago.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not the safest place to shop any longer, many reviews are illegally made or just wrong.</li>
            <li> The Tom&#x27;s is slightly less expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The big negative for all Tom&#x27;s of Maine&#x27;s non fluoride toothpaste is the addition of xylitol as a sweetener, which is a waste product from the wood pulp industry that contains toxins.  </li>
            <li> It just took the little ones a couple of days to wrap their brains around it.</li>
            <li> While I like the idea of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;fluoride-free&amp;#34;, my little girl did not like the taste of this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> It has a little bit of a fruity taste.</li>
            <li> I like the small tubes, which are easier for little ones to handle.  </li>
            <li> It was slightly bitter and left an unpleasant after taste.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The ingredients on the box are listed in small type that I cannot read</li>
            <li> in small jar (with lid) with 3-4 tbsp water (until paste</li>
            <li> /&gt;Furthermore, this product contains &amp;#34;no artificial flavors, sweeteners, preservatives or dyes&amp;#34; and also &amp;#34;no gluten, propylene glycol, sodium lauryl sulfate.&amp;#34; However, it does contain ingredients from corn and possibly birch, so persons with allergies to one or both of those will want to avoid it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I looked it up in Wikipedia and found that it is commonly used as an industrial chemical.</li>
            <li> one critique is this is an extremely runny formula that almost makes the aformentioned measuring difficult.  </li>
            <li> Seriously.  </li>
            <li> While this isn&#x27;t made for their age group I tried it because they hate the minty bigger kid flavors</li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t ever try to tell anyone here the prices are out of whack and that there are dangerous ingredients in the products S O L D  H E R E...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not the safest place to shop any longer, many reviews are illegally made or just wrong. Example? Ok. Want a Ceramic pan? There isn&#x27;t one that works for more than a month or two and then sticks worse than any broken Teflon pan - and you will find THOUSANDS of &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; reviews, and not one of them is the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hmmm? So complain but don&#x27;t offer solution? Not me, NOT ever! Nonstick pan safe? Cast iron and stainless steel, the latter for acidics and LODGE is the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have a great day and shop wisely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s training toothpaste, so for safety reasons it has no fluoride, or a lot of other ingredients that would normally go in toothpaste but which you don&#x27;t want a kid to eat. The point is to get kids used to the habit of brushing at an early age, and it&#x27;s done a great job at that. The tube is easy to use and the paste thin enough that it&#x27;s easy to squeeze out. So, our two-year-old likes to open it and put the toothpaste on for himself. The taste is (evidently) great, and so he looks forward to brushing. Mission accomplished, and five stars given. I&#x27;d recommend this to anybody trying to get a young kid to learn to brush.</li>
            <li> I liked this toothpaste and the fact that it was &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; was what drew me in. The kids liked it, too. It does not really &amp;#34;foam&amp;#34;, but that does not naturally happen, so I am cool with that. It just took the little ones a couple of days to wrap their brains around it. I recommend this to moms and dads that are concerned with all of the yuck that comes in regular toothpastes. It&#x27;s worth the little extra dough in my book.</li>
            <li> I love the ingredients but the flavor is just... odd.  I&#x27;m not sure that it cleans as well as the adult toothpaste made by Kiss My Face either (and that tastes better too, I might add). The packaging is cute for toddlers but I&#x27;m just not sure it&#x27;s definitely not going to appeal to everyone.</li>
            <li> My niece has been using this for a while and seems to really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has an excellent dispensing system that prevents the toothpaste to streaming out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is safe if swallowed, which is a real must for something like this as of course, it will get swallowed up like candy. And it does smell and taste like candy. But it&#x27;s not artificial, which I like. It doesn&#x27;t foam up like normal toothpaste, which is good because I can see that foam going all over their little clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great training toothpaste. Bravo for creating this.</li>
            <li> How do you assess a toddler toothpaste after using it for a month? I have no clue. I can say one thing - my toddler LOVES the taste of it. If I were to let him, he&#x27;d eat the whole tube of it. Thanks to this taste I am able to get some tooth brushing done. He doesn&#x27;t like the process of brusing, but he will open his moth for the paste. So, I guess, we like it.</li>
            <li> My 6 and 8 year olds are extremely picky about toothpaste flavors and have tried nearly all children toothpastes in grocery stores.  I wanted to give this a try as well even though it&#x27;s made for a different age range.  I thought my girls would like the fruit flavor but they both are not interested in it.  My oldest responded with, &amp;#34;yuck&amp;#34;.  My 6 year old isn&#x27;t a huge fan of the taste but likes that it doesn&#x27;t lather as much as other toothpastes.  My children would prefer the Tom&#x27;s Strawberry Toothpaste over this but they don&#x27;t like that one as much as the Colgate Watermelon one.  Still trying to find one that they will both use, that cleans well, and doesn&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
            <li> We love Tom&#x27;s of Maine toothpaste and have used it for our kids for years. This product is very gentle with a nice fruity flavor. There is no fluoride so it is safe for children under 2 who haven&#x27;t learned to spit out toothpaste yet. My kids didn&#x27;t spit well until they were 4-5 so we used fluoride free paste for years.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of Tom&#x27;s of Maine products. They are natural and you can rest assured that it&#x27;s good for your baby. The mild fruit flavor is more like a mild grape flavor which most kids will like (my kids love grapes). It does a good job cleaning and you don&#x27;t have to worry about the Fluoride.&lt;br /&gt;My personal favorite is the Silly Strawberry flavor though.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is a win for our toddler, who loves to brush teeth. He transitioned to this brand/flavor with no complaint; he&#x27;s too young to ask but we couldn&#x27;t tell that he noticed a difference from the previous brand. I like that there are no added colors. The texture and tube make for convenient dispensing and brushing, and the cute gator on the tube is a fun addition.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste has a pleasant (not overpowering) fruity taste. All toddler toothpastes are fluoride free because toddlers swallow the toothpaste (and swallowing fluoride causes discoloration of a child&#x27;s still forming adult teeth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My children have no preference between this and Orajel. The Tom&#x27;s is slightly less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toothpaste isn&#x27;t really needed at all.</li>
            <li> Let me back up and tell you what&#x27;s good about this toothpaste. It&#x27;s fluoride-free so young children won&#x27;t get fluorosis from it. (If you aren&#x27;t aware of the problem with fluoride toothpaste for children, read the small print on popular brands. It warns against letting children swallow it. But children will swallow anything sweet, won&#x27;t they?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, this product contains &amp;#34;no artificial flavors, sweeteners, preservatives or dyes&amp;#34; and also &amp;#34;no gluten, propylene glycol, sodium lauryl sulfate.&amp;#34; However, it does contain ingredients from corn and possibly birch, so persons with allergies to one or both of those will want to avoid it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients on the box are listed in small type that I cannot read so I went to the manufacturer&#x27;s website. Here they are: Glycerin, PDO, water, hydrated silica, xylitol, benzyl alcohol, carrageenan, natural flavor, and citric acid. Wait! What&#x27;s PDO? Well, Tom&#x27;s says it&#x27;s made from corn, a a further look shows that PDO is 1,3 propanediol and is sourced from fermented corn sugar. I looked on another site and saw that it is considered safe although it is classified as a skin irritant by the National Library of Medicine HazMap. I was still uneasy about this ingredient so I looked it up in Wikipedia and found that it is commonly used as an industrial chemical. It is produced in several ways; the method involving corn is conversion &amp;#34;from corn syrup effected by a genetically modified strain of E. coli.&amp;#34; That&#x27;s not very comforting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the other ingredients? Well, benzyl alcohol can cause allergic reactions in some people. Although considered safe by the FDA, I read elsewhere that in the European Union it is classified as toxic or harmful when used &amp;#34;around the mouth.&amp;#34; And according to Wikipedia, benzyl alcohol is toxic to neonates (newborns). And then there&#x27;s carrageenan, a recent topic of controversy on some websites. As for the scientists, studies disagree as to whether carrageenan &amp;#34;triggers gastrointestinal tract inflammation or contributes to tumor promotion.&amp;#34; And while the evidence is inconclusive, I question putting this ingredient in a product for toddlers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom&#x27;s of Maine is a respected brand. It has been a subsidiary of Colgate-Palmolive since 2006. Beyond that, I can only point out that word natural is frequently used very loosely in advertising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the taste, I would describe it as more like grapefruit than grapes. I am probably more sensitive than many people and I found this terribly bitter. No doubt some children like it. But personally, I would not give this product to a young child.rageenan &amp;#34;triggers gastrointestinal tract inflammation or contributes to tumor promotion.&amp;#34; And while the evidence is inconclusive, I question putting this ingredient in a product for toddlers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom&#x27;s of Maine is a respected brand.

            <li> We had been using strawberry Tom&#x27;s with the kids, but when our local store stopped carrying it, I hopped on Amazon to find some.  When I saw this, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  The kids love it and are eager to brush their teeth.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re often buying toddler toothpaste for my 2 year old, so it&#x27;s nice to be able to get some to try out. We&#x27;d recently tried out some Tom&#x27;s regular children&#x27;s toothpaste that my 8 and 5 year old absolutely love, so we thought we&#x27;d try this out. Considering it&#x27;s being used on our 2 year old, we can&#x27;t get too much feedback from her on what she thinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just for kicks, I&#x27;ve tried it. The paste is clear (pretty normal for toddler toothpaste), and this one has the advertised mixed berry flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely toothpaste. Seems to work. My daughter enjoys brushing her teeth, which is what we&#x27;re aiming for at this age.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is a clear and colorless lightweight gel. It has a soft fruit flavor. I cant put my finger on it but it brings me back to my youth, and I&#x27;m happy to report my daughter likes it. I have used other all-natural and mainstream commercial brands and this one is right toward the top of our favorites. The tube is small, almost sample size, and has a twist off lid and its easy to keep clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothpaste does not foam but my daughter doesn&#x27;t seem to mind. She likes to use it, and does not seem in a rush to finish so I think we are getting more valuable brushing time.</li>
            <li> This is a non-foaming gel mouth cleaner for the younger toddlers. I emphasis non-foaming because that threw me off a bit. Toddlers are actually kids from 1-4 years and I wouldn&#x27;t use this toothpaste on any kid that had a full set of 20 teeth in or was eating adult meals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, it did not do the best cleaning job on my 3 year old&#x27;s teeth. I do like the fact that it&#x27;s fluoride free but I prefer to use the  Tom&#x27;s toothpaste that&#x27;s fluoride-free and meant for adults.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I would have loved this as a gum cleaner when my kids were under 18 months old</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is packaged well with an appealing picture in front. That&#x27;s about as good as it gets, unfortunately. I tried to have my daughter brush with this. She is currently 2 years old. After taking it, she made a face, and ended up spitting it all out. I decided to take a dab and try it out and it is overly sweet. While I get that toothpaste for toddlers should be semi-sweet to get them to like it, this is a bit much. It also tastes very artificial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also took a look at the ingredients since this is suppose to be so natural and saw that it has carrageenan in it, which causes digestive problems, inflammation and has had a correlation to cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are currently using Branam Natural Tooth Gel http://www.amazon.com/Branam-Oral-Health-Natural-Xylitol/dp/B007ZXXPU2 and it has worked great with my daughter.</li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s toddler&#x27;s toothpaste is a great option for small children.  The tube is a small size so that children can actually squeeze it themselves.  The berry flavor is sweeter than adult toothpaste which should appeal to children and encourage them to brush their teeth.  My son (age two) really likes the flavor, so much so he slurps it and wants more.  I also appreciate a child&#x27;s toothpaste without fluoride which is a toxic poison and doesn&#x27;t even promote dental health.  The big negative for all Tom&#x27;s of Maine&#x27;s non fluoride toothpaste is the addition of xylitol as a sweetener, which is a waste product from the wood pulp industry that contains toxins.  It is however hard to find all natural brands without xylitol (Dr. Mercola&#x27;s toothpaste is one that I found, but probably too strong a taste for children).  Overall this is a great, healthy option for children.</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s time to brush teeth at a household with twin 3-year-old girls and a 5-year-old boy, the circus begins!  We&#x27;ve tried all sorts of fluoride-free toothpaste, and the kids have generally been fine with them.  The Tom&#x27;s Silly Strawberry toothpaste [[ASIN:B0044XHG5G Tom&#x27;s of Maine Fluoride Free Children&#x27;s Toothpaste, Silly Strawberry, 4.2-Ounce (Pack of 3)]] was not an immediate hit from a taste standpoint, but the kids have grown to be OK with it.  This Mild Fruit from Tom&#x27;s, on the other hand, was an immediate hit.  The kids seemed to be snacking at the sink, rather than brushing their teeth, and I think the tube lasted a week.  Seriously.  But when you are a harried parent of 3 toddlers, this sort of behavior seems like no big deal.  In fact, it pretty much takes a fire, explosion, or risk of immediate electrocution to get us worked up these days.  Our nerves were worn down years ago.  When we go to the dentist ourselves or have a surgical procedure, we could easily skip the anesthetic.  After surviving 3 toddlers everyday for years now, the rest is pretty easy.</li>
            <li> We have plenty of flouride in the water we drink, so we want to stay away from any extra flouride in our toothpastes. We&#x27;ve tried several of the Tom&#x27;s natural toothpastes, including this one for toddlers, and generally like their products and product philosophy a lot. (Some of the Tom&#x27;s toothpastes do have flouride, so be sure to read the ingredients list)  Our kids are a little too big for this toddler&#x27;s toothpaste, but we got it at a very special price and decided to try it just so we&#x27;d know what it&#x27;s like.  I don&#x27;t particularly care for the clear gel and mild, almost sweet flavor, but if you have very young kids it might be just the ticket to help them develop good brushing habits starting at a very young age.</li>
            <li> While I like the idea of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;fluoride-free&amp;#34;, my little girl did not like the taste of this toothpaste. As with most things, I asked her to try it again a couple days later and she still said she didn&#x27;t like it. To be honest, I didn&#x27;t like the taste either. It was slightly bitter and left an unpleasant after taste.</li>
            <li> The kids like brushing with this.  It has a pleasant taste and is free of fluoride, which little kids shouldn&#x27;t use.  I like the small tubes, which are easier for little ones to handle.  Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Tom&#x27;s of  Maine products and love this toothpaste for my daughter, who so far has expressed no problems with it.  This is a wonderfully clean formula that my baby likes and doesn&#x27;t worry me and a little (a pea-sized amount, if that) goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one critique is this is an extremely runny formula that almost makes the aformentioned measuring difficult.  Your toddler probably won&#x27;t mind the consistency, but I&#x27;d prefer something a bit thicker.</li>
            <li> I mistakenly ordered Tom&#x27;s toddler toothpaste thinking it was for adults but not to waste anything I have been using it and its fine and won&#x27;t harm you or your toddler. Tom&#x27;s toothpaste is non-toxic, has no preservatives or artificial flavors, gluten and has a pleasant taste although personally I don&#x27;t think anything tastes as good as Colgate which my family used, but unfortunately Colgate includes a controversial ingredient, Triclosan, which is linked to liver and inhalation toxicity. So I&#x27;ll stick to Toms natural toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Happy with this product. My grandson likes it which is a big plus. I&#x27;m also happy it has less additives regular toothpaste has.</li>
            <li> I was using Orajel training toothpaste for my toddler but I thought I would give this a try. Just like Orajel, it is a clear fluoride free gel. It has a little bit of a fruity taste. Converting over to this toothpaste was no problem, my 23 month old son didn&#x27;t even notice a difference as we brushed his teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things that might be useful to know about this toothpaste is it is gluten free, fluoride free, safe if swallowed, no artificial flavors, doesn&#x27;t foam up when using.</li>
            <li> The Tom&#x27;s of Maine Toddlers toothpaste is easy to screw open and apply to a toothbrush.  My boys love it.  I wish the smell wasn&#x27;t so cloyingly sweet, as I&#x27;d prefer taste buds develop in the normal range of sweetness.  Overall, it seems to work and be enjoyed, and be safer than other major brands.</li>
            <li> We like Tom&#x27;s of Maine products. This toothpaste is nice for kids who can&#x27;t rinse and spit well (we don&#x27;t want them swallowing fluoride). It is gelatinous, so it doesn&#x27;t foam up. It is without dyes. It is easy for kids to squeeze.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste leaves a fairly strong, bitter aftertaste. My children were so excited to get a cute crocodile tube of toothpaste just for themselves, but they hate the flavor. Mommy hates it too - she won&#x27;t touch it. Looks like Daddy is stuck with it! So that&#x27;s 3 1/2 votes against the flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually don&#x27;t mind it all that much, but I do have to admit it&#x27;s near the bottom of the list (natural or otherwise) of toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried in recent years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give the ingredients 5-stars - fluoride-free and no artificial colors or preservatives. However, I do think that Toms of Maine products have gone downhill a bit ever since being bought out by Colgate-Palmolive. For example, I find the packaging pretty wasteful - the tube is only 1.75oz, and they come in a box. Also, the price is a bit high for such a small serving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I don&#x27;t *hate* the product or anything like that - if my kids didn&#x27;t dislike the taste, I might be tempted to buy it once in a while. But if you want to try making your own toothpaste, read on...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve been experimenting with homemade toothpaste, same basic ingredients at Toms of Maine. But they key is, you can flavor it yourself and it doesn&#x27;t have the aftertaste.  You can make about 5oz for 25¢ (which is 97% cheaper). It does take some experimentation, try different flavors of liquid Stevia instead or oil extracts. Here&#x27;s the recipe if you want to try:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/2 cup baking soda&lt;br /&gt;1/2 tsp fine sea salt (or less, optional)&lt;br /&gt;Mix in small jar (with lid) with 3-4 tbsp water (until paste consistency)&lt;br /&gt;Flavoring:&lt;br /&gt;5-8 drops essential oil (peppermint, spearmint, etc - make sure it&#x27;s food grade)&lt;br /&gt;-or-&lt;br /&gt;10-15 drops of liquid stevia (this is my preference, but make sure it&#x27;s alcohol-free)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* My favorite brand of Stevia is Sweet Leaf (available on Amazon, about $10 for a 4oz bottle). My kids like unique flavors like berry or orange, not the traditional mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
            <li> You want to know feel good about what you are putting in/on your body, and Tom&#x27;s does a great job of creating products that are safe and effective for your family. I feel good about this product even for my little one.  It is a great training toothpaste and the taste isn&#x27;t half bad.  This is great product for teaching your little one to brush their teeth without worrying about what they might be swallowing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got two young boys, 4 to 7. While this isn&#x27;t made for their age group I tried it because they hate the minty bigger kid flavors and I dislike the overly sugary big kid and adult options. I figured they&#x27;d use this more but I was wrong. They are using it, but they don&#x27;t really like it. This is my second type of Tom&#x27;s toothpaste and both weren&#x27;t well received. (I also bought regular kids version.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it&#x27;s natural. I just don&#x27;t get why the kids don&#x27;t like it. And since multiple kids didn&#x27;t I&#x27;ll have to go with an average rating. It&#x27;s OK but it&#x27;s definitely not for everyone.</li>
            <li> My baby likes to brush her teeth with this.</li>
