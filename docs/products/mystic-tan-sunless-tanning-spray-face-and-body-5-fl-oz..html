            <li>Great for a medium finish.</li>

            <li>Perfect golden brown!</li>
            <li>Love this self tanner!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried ALOT of self tanners and besudes LORAC self-tantalizer which makes you smell sexy like chocolate and is applied with a fuzzy mitt---this spray tan from mystic is bomb!  </li>
            <li>If you tan easily I think it will work great for you.  </li>
            <li>My tan lasts a week and looks amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>alreayd said it, but the spray on this can is amazing.</li>
            <li>and I get nice coverage.</li>
            <li>Tanning salons sell body washes with no mineral oils, or get one of your own with NO MINERAL OIL.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very very fine mist so very easy to get even..</li>
            <li>Mystic is by FAR the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I love it because it is amazing for touchups, and does not streak.</li>
            <li>I have liked bath and body sunless spray, but this one is probably my favorite.</li>
            <li>Although I end up lighter than when getting sprayed at the salon it still works great and is great for last minute.</li>
            <li>I have tried many self tanners &amp; this works the best by far for me</li>
            <li>It sprays on nice and fine.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I want to be able to wear shorts as the weather gets nicer</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never left a review before but this sunless tanning spray is awesome!</li>
            <li>pleased with purchase</li>
            <li>I would have to check to compare the ounces though, as I can&#x27;t be sure.</li>
            <li>but I get more more than one application</li>
            <li>It probably works better for some than others depending on your skin tone.  </li>
            <li>It works best on my face and arms, but my legs never get the same color, no matter what I do.</li>
            <li>It does have more of a reddish-brown color on my skin versus some that look orange, yellow-y, or greenish.</li>
            <li>And the color is even and beautiful and natural.  </li>
            <li>I love it and find it easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This product gave me a nice color but a color that faded quickly after about three days.  </li>
            <li>If you need a quick tan, this will work for you nicely.</li>
            <li>Got a much better price, delivered to my home for free.  </li>
            <li>So so easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>Originally bought in the tanning salon and loved it so much I went looking on the web.  </li>
            <li>The spray is always fine and even.  </li>
            <li>I have used the product 3 times now and it is fabulous.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so light</li>
            <li>but if you have an important event and need to look tan</li>
            <li>I wear a light coat to work without a problem.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my a gorgeous natural looking bronze.</li>
            <li>I loved that if I wanted a little more color \\&quot;that</li>
            <li>pretty sure it was a bait and switch, and certainly wasnt ethical to charge more than listed.</li>
            <li>Great on your face for a natural light or deep tan.</li>
            <li>Thats a shame because the product is amazing, easy to control the depth of the shade and has no residual smell, which every other self tanner does.</li>
            <li>So, I guess it&#x27;s not for everybody but worth the try</li>
            <li>but it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>tends to make you look less vibrant and youthful, and I get a nice warm glow..</li>
            <li>Sprays nicely, doesn&#x27;t smell like traditional tanning spray.  </li>
            <li>I use it at bedtime right before I go to sleep, that way</li>
            <li>I apply right after showering &amp; once</li>
            <li>cover your feet and hands thickly with lotion or wear bobby socks that cover most of your feet then after spraying finely mist top of your feet with toes and bottom drenched in lotion..</li>
            <li>Just make sure your skin is clean and dry, a scrub before use helps.  </li>
            <li>it is a huge rip off because i can get a professional spray tan in my neighborhood for $17-$25.</li>
            <li>Exfoliating first is also mandatory.</li>
            <li>I finally found a sunless spray that I love.  </li>
            <li>but when the color did develop it was a pretty honey brown (not orange in anyway).  </li>
            <li>This was my first time using a spray tan and saw the positive review about this product</li>
            <li>Had my doubts about this one going by the other reviews but ended up loving it.</li>
            <li>Really dries out the skin.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I really didn&#x27;t get much color</li>
            <li>It will allow you to give youself a full body tan without doing acrobatics in the bathroom or having to walk around the house naked for 20 minutes while it dries.  </li>
            <li>The color seemed fine initially but had darkened considerably by the end of the night.</li>
            <li>However, it does produce a nice, natural looking tan within a few hours.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommened this if you like sprays and not lotions.  </li>
            <li>Definitely do not spray on before a hot yoga class!</li>
            <li>It looks natural with my real tan as well.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I refuse to use a tanning bed, but I live in a state</li>
            <li>It looks very natural.</li>
            <li>It looks natural, not orange</li>
            <li>Jergens has an all natural hydrating lotion at walmart for 5 bucks that works and does not take off your tan.</li>
            <li>This seemed to work ok, at least while it would let me spray product.  </li>
            <li>Worked the same as the products in the tanning salon, but much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>Gives a completely even color without looking unnatural or orange.</li>
            <li>Also arrived way before expected, thanks!</li>
            <li>, I actually get natural &amp; darker color from this than when I went to the salon mystic booth.  </li>
            <li>It takes a little practice getting the spray on right, but I can use it on my face and arms, legs, everywhere.  </li>
            <li>It does not dry out my skin.</li>

            <li> , I actually get natural &amp; darker color from this than when I went to the salon mystic booth.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little practice getting the spray on right, but I can use it on my face and arms, legs, everywhere.  </li>
            <li> It does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I was my face 3 hours after application and use my regular facial skin care before spraying and after so that my face isn&#x27;t too dark, because I&#x27;m 41 years old and darker on the face</li>
            <li> I worked with a small area until I got the feel of the spray volume and how much is needed.</li>
            <li> I usually put on late in the day the day before I want a nice tan and then in the morning do a little touch up if I missed something.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I spent the same at the salon booth for 1 visit</li>
            <li> By the time the can was only 2/3 empty, it wouldn&#x27;t spray out anymore product!  </li>
            <li> Spray on as evenly as you can and don&#x27;t let clothes touch your skin until dry.  </li>
            <li> so your skin is hydrated, but dry off.</li>
            <li> I always blended with a dry washcloth to avoid streaks or splotches.</li>
            <li> It smells like all the others and it makes my skin really dry.</li>
            <li> Wish I had just got it from the same source, but its getting harder and harder to find.</li>
            <li> It is also a much much smaller can than the one I usually get, which is $37.</li>
            <li> In other words it was probably my error</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t streak or turn your skin orange like other products.</li>
            <li> Now this new bottle has broken almost immediately.</li>
            <li> this keeps your feet from getting too dark.</li>
            <li> This self tanner is not that dark</li>
            <li> Now after asking a friend to come over and spray me and running out half way through</li>
            <li> w/very little sun.  </li>
            <li> there&#x27;s little chance of getting liquid on my skin.</li>
            <li> Dont dress for at least 20 min and wear loose clothing.</li>
            <li> What a WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
            <li> but it is not light either.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the right color and doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell.  </li>
            <li> The only down fall is that its so expensive.  </li>
            <li> This product is impossible to apply by yourself and only lasted me 1 1/2 tans so at $38</li>
            <li> I am going to look ridiculous this weekend.</li>
            <li> Even though product was left in the bottle, it became impossible to get it out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> but I hate looking so WHITE.  </li>
            <li> hope this lightens up very quickly, not happy with the color.</li>
            <li> They haven&#x27;t used it because they find it difficult even though I have showed them over and over how to use it.  </li>
            <li> Very frustrating.</li>
            <li> There were some streaks making the foot look dirty rather than tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I would be afraid to try it and end up with streaks:(</li>
            <li> and i had ugly streaks</li>
            <li> WONDERING WHY IT&#x27;S SO HARD TO FIND!!!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve probably tried every sunless tanning product under the sun (no pun intended...lol, I crack myself up). Mystic is by FAR the best I&#x27;ve ever used. Not orange at all, even coverage, effortless to use. Can&#x27;t live without it. Even good for the face.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It works and is easy to use, best self-tanner spray I have found.  I also bought the value set with the prep and post products.  Never use them, I use just the spray.  Just make sure your skin is clean and dry, a scrub before use helps.  Spray on as evenly as you can and don&#x27;t let clothes touch your skin until dry.  I usually put on late in the day the day before I want a nice tan and then in the morning do a little touch up if I missed something.  I love it and find it easy to use.  I bought this also for my mom and my aunts to prep for a cruise.  They haven&#x27;t used it because they find it difficult even though I have showed them over and over how to use it.  So, I guess it&#x27;s not for everybody but worth the try in case it is for you.  I used to go to the tan salon to get sprayed.  Although I end up lighter than when getting sprayed at the salon it still works great and is great for last minute. And great for the face.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent sunless tanning product!  I refuse to use a tanning bed, but I live in a state w/very little sun.  I want to be able to wear shorts as the weather gets nicer but I hate looking so WHITE.  This product is the answer.  It takes a little practice getting the spray on right, but I can use it on my face and arms, legs, everywhere.  It looks natural, not orange and I get nice coverage. I know it seems a bit pricey but it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I work at a tanning salon that has the Mystic booth, and we are about to carry the spray. I love it because it is amazing for touchups, and does not streak. It looks natural with my real tan as well.</li>
            <li> Somewhat colors your skin if you apply it about ten times.  Really dries out the skin.  I would never buy this again.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  So so easy to apply.  And the color is even and beautiful and natural.  No fuss and looks great!  Excellent product!</li>
            <li> This was my first time using a spray tan and saw the positive review about this product so I gave it a try. I sprayed this on my legs after my morning shower, and looked like it was going to streak. The color seemed fine initially but had darkened considerably by the end of the night. There were some streaks making the foot look dirty rather than tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this lightens up very quickly, not happy with the color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never left a review before but this sunless tanning spray is awesome! my skin is brown, not orange. It looks very natural. I worked with a small area until I got the feel of the spray volume and how much is needed. Great product!!</li>
            <li> This product is impossible to apply by yourself and only lasted me 1 1/2 tans so at $38 it is a huge rip off because i can get a professional spray tan in my neighborhood for $17-$25. Now after asking a friend to come over and spray me and running out half way through I am going to look ridiculous this weekend.</li>
            <li> I have used the product 3 times now and it is fabulous. Leaves my a gorgeous natural looking bronze. Even on my face. I was my face 3 hours after application and use my regular facial skin care before spraying and after so that my face isn&#x27;t too dark, because I&#x27;m 41 years old and darker on the face tends to make you look less vibrant and youthful, and I get a nice warm glow.. After using the product, I shower 6 hours later and the color lasts 5 to 6 days. You need to exfoliate, shower so your skin is hydrated, but dry off. Then spray. Dont dress for at least 20 min and wear loose clothing. I cover my hair when spraying to then after 5-7 hours I can rinse off if I want and then dress. Dont use any lotions or body washes that contain ANY Mineral oil.. Jergens has an all natural hydrating lotion at walmart for 5 bucks that works and does not take off your tan. Tanning salons sell body washes with no mineral oils, or get one of your own with NO MINERAL OIL. My tan lasts a week and looks amazing. It does not dry out my skin. It&#x27;s also very very fine mist so very easy to get even.. cover your feet and hands thickly with lotion or wear bobby socks that cover most of your feet then after spraying finely mist top of your feet with toes and bottom drenched in lotion.. this keeps your feet from getting too dark. Exfoliating first is also mandatory.</li>
            <li> This seemed to work ok, at least while it would let me spray product.  By the time the can was only 2/3 empty, it wouldn&#x27;t spray out anymore product!  What a WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
            <li> I finally found a sunless spray that I love.  It&#x27;s the right color and doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell.  The only down fall is that its so expensive.  I have liked bath and body sunless spray, but this one is probably my favorite.</li>
            <li> This product gave me a nice color but a color that faded quickly after about three days.  It took about five hours to show color but when the color did develop it was a pretty honey brown (not orange in anyway).  I think the answer is to reapply every three days to keep the color.</li>
            <li> Worked the same as the products in the tanning salon, but much cheaper.  I will likely buy again when needed.</li>
            <li> I used to go to the spray tanning booth, but this product I do not have too! Its amazing!! Perfect golden brown!</li>
            <li> pleased with purchase</li>
            <li> Amazing. Buy it now!!!</li>
            <li> Love this self tanner! Gives a completely even color without looking unnatural or orange. Also arrived way before expected, thanks!</li>
            <li> The reason I was replacing my former bottle of mystic tan was because the spray mechanism is faulty. Even though product was left in the bottle, it became impossible to get it out of the bottle. Now this new bottle has broken almost immediately. Very frustrating. b</li>
            <li> Had my doubts about this one going by the other reviews but ended up loving it. The spray on it comes it just like a must, just be careful.around the knees and elbows!</li>
            <li> Great for a medium finish. This self tanner is not that dark but it is not light either. It sprays on nice and fine. I always blended with a dry washcloth to avoid streaks or splotches. I use it at bedtime right before I go to sleep, that way there&#x27;s little chance of getting liquid on my skin. Anywhere liquid will touch your skin after applying this you will have a white spot.  Definitely do not spray on before a hot yoga class!</li>
            <li> I bought this from this vendor because it was shown on sale for $25. I was charged $33+ when I got the invoice. It is also a much much smaller can than the one I usually get, which is $37. I would have to check to compare the ounces though, as I can&#x27;t be sure. Wish I had just got it from the same source, but its getting harder and harder to find. Thats a shame because the product is amazing, easy to control the depth of the shade and has no residual smell, which every other self tanner does. Dont use this vendor though--pretty sure it was a bait and switch, and certainly wasnt ethical to charge more than listed. This can is also only about 7 inches tall, so dont be fooled by the picture.</li>
            <li> The color is great, I&#x27;m using it for my face and neck at it looks wonderful however, i tryed it on my legs and i had ugly streaks, it was its color tinted but it&#x27;s so light i can&#x27;t see it at all.  In other words it was probably my error but if you have an important event and need to look tan I would be afraid to try it and end up with streaks:(</li>
            <li> I have tried many self tanners &amp; this works the best by far for me, I actually get natural &amp; darker color from this than when I went to the salon mystic booth.  It is pricey but I get more more than one application &amp; I spent the same at the salon booth for 1 visit &amp; I really didn&#x27;t get much color &amp; I had the darker solution.  It probably works better for some than others depending on your skin tone.  If you tan easily I think it will work great for you.  I plan on purchasing another bottle when this one is done. I apply right after showering &amp; once a week is plenty to maintain a beautiful tan</li>
            <li> Mystic tan blows away any tanning product youve ever used!! It doesn&#x27;t streak or turn your skin orange like other products. Great on your face for a natural light or deep tan. Best product on market</li>
            <li> I used Mystic Tan on and off over the last two years. It smells like all the others and it makes my skin really dry. However, it does produce a nice, natural looking tan within a few hours. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that you cannot build color with it. It works best on my face and arms, but my legs never get the same color, no matter what I do. If you need a quick tan, this will work for you nicely.</li>
            <li> Originally bought in the tanning salon and loved it so much I went looking on the web.  Got a much better price, delivered to my home for free.  Sprays nicely, doesn&#x27;t smell like traditional tanning spray.  I wear a light coat to work without a problem.  Never bothered my sensative skin.  Even my picky husband likes it. Perfecto!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried ALOT of self tanners and besudes LORAC self-tantalizer which makes you smell sexy like chocolate and is applied with a fuzzy mitt---this spray tan from mystic is bomb!  The spray is always fine and even.  I loved that if I wanted a little more color \\&quot;that day\\&quot; I could just iightly spray my face , chest and arms and give myself that color boost when needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I alreayd said it, but the spray on this can is amazing. It will allow you to give youself a full body tan without doing acrobatics in the bathroom or having to walk around the house naked for 20 minutes while it dries.  I would highly recommened this if you like sprays and not lotions.  It does have more of a reddish-brown color on my skin versus some that look orange, yellow-y, or greenish.</li>
            <li> Crushes the rest. WONDERING WHY IT&#x27;S SO HARD TO FIND!!!! PLEASE put it back in stores like Ulta &amp; Sephora!!!!</li>
