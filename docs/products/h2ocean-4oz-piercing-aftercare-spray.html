            <li>Good,</li>
            <li>My piercer said he has never had a customer with a good experience from this product.</li>
            <li>Worked as good as if you were buying it in the piercing shop</li>
            <li>I ordered this stuff as soon as I could because of all the good reviews.</li>
            <li>really good for navel piercings.</li>
            <li>This is good stuff.  </li>
            <li>my  nose piercing is feeling soooo good.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, good stuff.</li>
            <li>Ask any GOOD piercer and they will NOT recommend it.</li>
            <li>It was really good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good spray...</li>
            <li>My daughter uses this for her ears and it&#x27;s a really good product.</li>
            <li>Yes, the saline solution is good, and the method of cleaning a piercing by spraying it is convenient and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good Product.</li>
            <li>and i discovered this good stuff.</li>
            <li>I felt this was a good product for cleaning my piercings.</li>
            <li>This is a good product.</li>
            <li>but the can itself was in Good condition.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s a good sign.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really good</li>
            <li>I bought a really good 18k nose stud and a can of this stuff</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>Good price too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best to spray lightly on a sterile cotton swab &amp; apply that way because the spray goes everywhere, they may want to change the dispenser.</li>
            <li>arrived on time, seems to be working good.</li>
            <li>I also loved spraying this where i had an ingrown nail to wash away from bacteria.</li>
            <li>but this is a good way to go for cleaning inbetween soakings.  </li>
            <li>This spray isn&#x27;t really good for infections though.</li>
            <li>It swelled and became infected within four days (granted I wasn&#x27;t taking good care of it</li>
            <li>This has been a really good product for taking care of my belly button piercing..</li>
            <li>I LOVED IT.</li>
            <li>I have always loved this spray.</li>
            <li>so I looked online and saw that Neosporin was a good product to use</li>
            <li>I bought this because I read really good reviews.</li>
            <li>This is the best sea salt solution i have tried, and came right on time!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great and so easy!</li>
            <li>Came in quickly and on time and my ears healed up perfectly!</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and was in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>i love this stuff it works great for any piercing any time and its good for an anti-bacterial for your face.</li>
            <li>I love love love this!!!</li>
            <li>all a great product on everything :)</li>
            <li>The ocean spray has kept it in top shape, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li>However, I immidiately purchased this once I was pierced from the shop because Ive heard so many great reviews on it...</li>
            <li>Great for me, because I plan on ordering some more.</li>
            <li>I knew better than to use their solution (or go there at all lol)</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with the product.  </li>
            <li>Glad for the price, lol.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and have used it before and was working great for a couple days</li>
            <li>Works great, better than alcohol, hydrogen peroxide.</li>
            <li>the spray and that you use it more than once over trying to keep a shot glass on your neck works great</li>
            <li>I was very pleased to receive my order in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li>Made me so much more comfortable during the healing process!!!</li>
            <li>It feels very refreshing and your piercing will love it!</li>

            <li>This product is completely amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing with healing piercings.</li>
            <li>I had seen all of the amazing reviews claiming how it has \\&quot;healed their infection\\</li>
            <li>This product worked amazing for me.</li>
            <li>Amazing spray!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plus It&#x27;s a lot easier then making your own sea salt soaks too.  </li>
            <li>it now the came color as my skin amd healing so nicely.</li>
            <li>Works well, but warm water from the sink and some $1.50 salt from Walmart works just as well.</li>
            <li>so I was thrilled when this arrived in the mail.</li>
            <li>Instead of making your own sea-salt mix and then applying it with cotton swabs or</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone with any kind of body piercing.</li>
            <li>Could I make my own substitute?</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really the best to use.</li>
            <li>and you know won&#x27;t do your warm seat salt soaks,</li>
            <li>and I believe it is making my piercing heal fast and great!</li>
            <li>Even though the instructions say use it from 3-6 times a day I still use my salt water mixture for my septum piercing, but this is nice for when I&#x27;m in a rush in the morning</li>
            <li>I was told to do warm salt water soaks 3 times a day...</li>
            <li>With that kind of investment, I needed to ensure that this piercing would keep.</li>
            <li>Then I happened upon H2Ocean&#x27;s Aftercare Spray; read great reviews on it from multiple sites, found the best price here on Amazon, and bought it.</li>
            <li>No discomfort, no swelling, no oozing of any kind.</li>
            <li>help alot with my piercing and would tell any one that have piercing you must have this bottle in handy.</li>
            <li>You will save a lot of money by just making your own sea salt solution.</li>
            <li>So problems of any kind</li>
            <li>I like to make my own salt water solutions</li>
            <li>Thanks for an awesome product!</li>
            <li>I have a triple forward helix, and trying to mix up my own sea salt solution and get it on my piercings without giving myself swimmer&#x27;s ear was a PAIN.</li>
            <li>All you have to do to make your own H2Ocean is heat up 8 oz. of water in your microwave and then stir in 1/4 tsp of sea salt.</li>
            <li>I soaked my ears in warm salt water once a day and then sprayed this throughout the day</li>
            <li>I also used this to make an aspirin paste which I placed on my nice every night.</li>
            <li>Yes you can make your own saltwater and put it in a spray bottle, but it is not sterile.</li>
            <li>Before I bought this spray, I cleaned my ear piercings with warm water &amp; sea salt.</li>
            <li>Save your money &amp; just make your own cleaning solution.</li>
            <li>After getting pierced, the piercer offered me H2Ocean or said that I could just do my own sea salt soaks.  </li>
            <li>and I was making my own salt water solution.</li>
            <li>Helped when I pierced my own ears.</li>
            <li>I have heard so many good things about this product</li>
            <li>and it also contains Lysozyme which is effective in healing.</li>
            <li>warm compresses</li>
            <li>it was healing nicely and then just started deteriorating.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s one of those products i like to keep handy in my bathroom medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li>so spend the money clown! lmao</li>
            <li>I like to use it after a nice shower.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re piercing gets infected, you should be soaking it in warm salt water, which you should mix yourself using salt and distilled water.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my rook piecing and it seems to be healing quite nicely.</li>
            <li>It also feels nice on the piercing.</li>

            <li>Amazing just make sure to have a paper towel for the drips</li>
            <li>I started going to a professional piercing place for my navel and lip piercing, and my piercer states that this is the best product on the market.</li>
            <li>H2Ocean is by far the best product for tats and piercings.  </li>
            <li>the price on here was good with free ship.</li>
            <li>This product works ok but honestly, it is WAY overpriced.</li>
            <li>I recommended this stuff to my brother who is very experienced with piercings, and he&#x27;s surprised at how well this works.</li>
            <li>Other than that, works great and is very nice!</li>
            <li>I heard this stuff was great for fresh piercings.</li>
            <li>this product is awesome fast healing time and the price was great fast delivery</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also much more effective.  </li>
            <li>Nice to be able to just squirt this on it.</li>
            <li>This product is the best thing i have tried so far for my belly peircing.</li>
            <li>Better than making my own sea salt soaks.</li>
            <li>Awesome product!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this on my 4-week old rook piercing in conjunction with Provon soap and it works wonders.</li>
            <li>so far, everything works perfectly.</li>
            <li>I bought this stuff because a friend recommended it to me and it cleared up my infection very quickly!</li>
            <li>So easy with the spray as well!</li>
            <li>I received it quickly, everything was like it should be, and it done an amazing job!</li>
            <li>I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the best for cleaning belly piercings for sure, even helps clear up infected ones!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to use this because I read really good reviews on it  </li>
            <li>I was excited to get this because of all the good reviews, but it did not work for my belly piercing.</li>
            <li>soak a q tip in it and then clean my barbells then spray each side of each piercing for good measure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and i took good care to clean it with the cleaning solution from the piercer but</li>
            <li>It has a really good &#x27;clean&#x27; feel to it.</li>
            <li>H2Ocean is a great product; it helped my piercing heal very fast.</li>
            <li>This was great when I first got it but without dropping it or anything the nozzle just stopped working, I don&#x27;t know why.</li>
            <li>I still do the hot sea salt soaks, but this is a great supplement if you are in a hurry.</li>
            <li>The first 2 days the piercings felt great,</li>
            <li>From the first use it worked great on my nose piercing,  </li>
            <li>The piercings are healing beautifully and much faster than they would be otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>really great for quick cleaning and easy to use</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use compared to making your own sea salt mixture yourself.</li>
            <li>Although I can make my own, it is easy to just spray some on a q-tip</li>
            <li>all it needs is a quick spray and your good.</li>
            <li>Timely shipping, free shipping, quality product, what more can you ask?!</li>
            <li>Have bought this many times and will forever be a loyal fan!!</li>
            <li>It cleared up the persistent lymph on an older piercing and has helped my freshest piercing heal beautifully from day one.</li>
            <li>This soothing and healing spray works great for new body piercings,and any residual soreness after changing out a piercing!!</li>
            <li>They were prompt, pleasant and courteous and sent me a brand new can without charge!</li>
            <li>Glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>I wanted to make sure my piercings that I got were</li>
            <li>Love both and wouldrecommend either/both to others with piercings.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this stuff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well on its way to a healthy healing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This spray is awesome, but is not a substitute for antibiotics or medical treatment if your piercing is severely infected</li>
            <li>Many people will say this is just a \\&quot;glorified salt water spray,\\&quot; and the truth is...</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been the most agonizing one I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>JUST MAKE SURE</li>
            <li>ON THE PIERCING WILL HAVE YOU WASTING MOST OF IT.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and will always use it for all my piercings.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>In my opinion it has healed my piercings better and faster.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>so I still have much more healing time to deal with, and I will continue to use this.</li>
            <li>I got my naval pierced and it healed okay with the sea salt soaks.</li>
            <li>After I researched it and found a safe place, I decided to do it.</li>
            <li>Just spray and go :).</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love H2Ocean.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>it works well for sore throats and stuffy noses too! :)</li>
            <li>All in all my favorite</li>
            <li>After a week, my piercing started to look better</li>
            <li>:) I know its just a spray can of H20 and salt</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll need more bottles of this stuff, I pair this with sea salt soaks</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>im not so sure about that.</li>
            <li>But im still satisfied with it...</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think there is anything better.</li>
            <li>You should also check why so many of us gave 1 star.</li>
            <li>Noticed my piercings getting better within days of using this.</li>
            <li>For me it has done a better job helping heal nipple piercings than salt water soaks and washing with Provon.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you follow all the steps to healing a piercing not just using a cleaner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only thing I use for my nose piercing and it works great!</li>
            <li>The seller sent me all the directions and more.</li>

            <li>It was recommended to me by my piercer and I&#x27;m glad I went with it.</li>
            <li>I got a monroe, and this is way more convenient than mixing up batches of salt water and dabbing on a piercing.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure doctors/piercers would say NOT to do that, but I did anyway.</li>
            <li>Big bottle is great value!!</li>
            <li>IT MAKES MY NIPPLE PIERCINGS FEEL SO MUCH BETTER.</li>
            <li>I love this product and recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li>Got to get more already.</li>
            <li>I love love love the H2Ocean spray.</li>
            <li>I got my most pierced almost three weeks</li>
            <li>I have several piercings and this is the best aftercare I have ever found.</li>
            <li>Ships fast and works great.</li>
            <li>My piercing has improved, thats for sure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this on both my piercings, but since my ear is a lot more finicky</li>
            <li>I am so glad I bought this.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s more sanitary.</li>
            <li>There are alternatives, but I have been using this product for many many years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it before and it cleans better than anything.</li>
            <li>so i thought it would be okay to order again</li>
            <li>Once I stopped using this stuff, my ear looked and felt a million times better.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>But this works much better than either of those.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am really glad I bought this.</li>
            <li>This stuff is magic.</li>
            <li>This one was a much better bargain.</li>
            <li>But it made me feel better to have something beside just &#x27;Water and soup&#x27;</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>but u recently got my nipples pierced and the pierced suggested this product and my piercings have been healing wonderfully!</li>
            <li>I used it for more  </li>
            <li>but I have been so satisfied I was compelled to write one.</li>
            <li>As soon as I stopped using this product, I was better off.</li>
            <li>is like magic within about 3 days after using it my piercing didn&#x27;t hurt</li>
            <li>Great spray, I highly recommend it !</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>it works great for all peircings , I recommend getting a 4oz bottle though because you go through it relatively fast.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t love this product anymore.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I love H2Ocean</li>
            <li>I love it though and just think I got unlucky.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>It was ok.</li>
            <li>The saline solution that I was making myself was more soothing than this.</li>
            <li>The top did not work to spray</li>
            <li>I WILL BUY MORE FROM THESE GUYS</li>
            <li>I love that it can be sprayed on so you don&#x27;t have to do the dreaded, time-consuming salt soaks.</li>
            <li>I WISH TGE BOTTLES CAME WITH MORE.</li>
            <li>left Works wonderfully!</li>
            <li>Great product thanks.</li>
            <li>So after reading many of the reviews I was sold.</li>
            <li>Glad I took the recommendations of people online; this product has helped my ears heal after TWO YEARS of troublesome piercings.</li>
            <li>I had an irritated piercing, and after using this, my belly was better in 2 days.</li>
            <li>I have ordered 2 more cans from here for backups.</li>
            <li>Okay, it&#x27;s been 5 weeks since I had the cartilage pierced.</li>
            <li>I love H2Ocean Salt Water Spray and always have a bottle on hand, just in case.</li>
            <li>After 24 hours with H2Ocean, my ear is so much better.</li>
            <li>the spray made me feel more assured that my piercing would heal better/safely.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s refreshing and doesn&#x27;t sting</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s pressurized.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too sure about it</li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>In my opinion it helps speed up the healing process, but I&#x27;m sure it differs from person to person of course.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t make my belly button piercing any better.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I am 100% satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I also love this product.</li>
            <li>More pricey but ey, this product which is salt water based makes a difference.</li>
            <li>Thinking about ordering more.</li>
            <li>But i used this once just now and they are feeling so much better.</li>
            <li>Nothing fishy here :)</li>
            <li>going to check that out for sure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used H2Ocean to heal most of my piercings and I love it.</li>
            <li>love the product&lt;br /&gt;came</li>
            <li>I had more of the product in the can</li>
            <li>With some creative help on YouTube, I was able to get it to work.</li>
            <li>it felt fantastic!</li>

            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I wish I had been able to use it like I wanted to.</li>
            <li>But that wasn&#x27;t till 3 days after the latest day</li>
            <li>A more targeted delivery system would be preferred.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>but it is getting much more better</li>
            <li>After 2 months I started noticing two bubbles one on the top inside &amp; one at the bottom.</li>
            <li>I want to remove my piercing if it didn&#x27;t get better.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this for the duration of my healing process :)</li>
            <li>At most, it sort of dribbles out a drop at a time.</li>
            <li>My piercings feel much better :)</li>
            <li>Love using h2ocean, just got two piercing in my ear.</li>
            <li>Much better.</li>
            <li>I bought some of this stuff, after seeing many reviews stating it was the &#x27;miracle spray for piercings&#x27;.</li>
            <li>absolutely LOVE it.</li>
            <li>love the product&lt;br /&gt;fast</li>
            <li>Love this spray.  </li>
            <li>Love that I am not getting added bacteria touch my ear.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this aftercare spray.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to combat several infections with this product, and would recommend it to anyone looking for an awesome piercing aftercare solution.</li>
            <li>But the piercing that healed the best was my most recently upper ear, and I chalk it up to this product.</li>
            <li>I also took a piece of cotton and rolled it around the top of my piercing</li>
            <li>I have the top of my cartilage pierced</li>
            <li>Worked great on my neck piercing it really helped it heal faster.</li>
            <li>Totally satisfied.</li>
            <li>This stuff has been magic for my nose.  </li>
            <li>totally satisfied :)</li>
            <li>Love this stuff</li>
            <li>I love it  </li>
            <li>If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re most concerned about, or maybe even just convenience, give this stuff a shot. :)</li>
            <li>Its recommended my many of my piercing artists and when used with antimicrobial sope it keeps away infection.</li>
            <li>Use 5-6 times a day :)</li>
            <li>Would have gotten more stars if you get more product for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve ran out of this within a month, I have been using regular contact saline &amp; its wonderful!!  </li>
            <li>This is actually the best aftercare I have ever tried!</li>
            <li>I love it ...</li>
            <li>I love this spray.</li>
            <li>What I notice most is my year-old tragus piercing keeps getting what I assume to be a keloid inside my ear</li>
            <li>Am glad I did</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite refreshing to the skin and keeps crud away.</li>
            <li>Works way better than just mixing salt in saline solution.</li>
            <li>I have many piercings.</li>
            <li>They felt SO much better</li>
            <li>I began using H2Ocean more often instead of the soap</li>
            <li>and walmart was able to exchange without a problem.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s better to &amp;#34;bother&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>&quot; I was very excited to see this and decided to go for it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice efficient way to ensure your piercing stays clean.</li>
            <li>Anyone can make there own saline solution, but when you need your daughter to clean her piercing, this works.</li>
            <li>It helps the healing process and keeps everything nice and clean.</li>
            <li>Get a gallon of distilled water and a clean up, pour it into said cup, add seasalt and put in the microwave until warm then place over your piercing.</li>
            <li>it keeps everything nice and clean and infection-free while also helping with pain/throbbing and allowing my holes to adjust.</li>
            <li>&quot; I did some reading up of my own and found h2ocean, I live in the UK so shipping was fairly pricey</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product, very soothing and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I digress, this spray is great to travel with in between soaks and washes, easy to carry in your purse, very sanitary as it stays in the can.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s works pretty good.</li>
            <li>I have used H2Ocean on all my piercings based on the recommendation of my piercer and I must say this stuff is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, super effective, an overall great purchase!  </li>
            <li>So I ordered the large size and it really soothes &amp; cleans the areas wonderfully!</li>
            <li>Still, it works great and helps ease and speed up the healing process for newly pierced areas.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just saline, but works great to help heal new piercings.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also using it on a new nose piercing, which is healing great with no discomfort whatsoever.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for cleaning a new piercing and for cleaning when you change your jewelry.</li>
            <li>This is a great cleaning product for my new piercings.  </li>
            <li>Found out about product from tattoo artist and used for a new piercing, in which it worked great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much more efficient and easy to use.</li>
            <li>With this product, the spray has a concentrated spray that is effective in cleansing the piercing area with an adequate amount of solution.</li>
            <li>The coldness may not feel as nice as the warm soak, but it&#x27;s so much easier to do</li>
            <li>Keep the piercing feeling clean through recovery!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see myself ever needing something else to clean my piercings, wish I could give this 10 stars!</li>
            <li>but it aslo treats many other things like ravor burn and acne kudoos to h2ocean for your amazing product!!!!</li>
            <li>I was running low on the product anyways, so I reordered, but despite my best efforts to keep the piercing/area clean, my ear stayed infected for over a month.</li>
            <li>/crusty&#x27;s and keeping piercing&#x27;s clean and healthy :-)</li>
            <li>This is a great product I always use it for all my piercings I have 22 and this stuff healed them all and fast too I also use it to clean my piercings</li>
            <li>It has kept his pierced area clean and healthy &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>If you need to keep a piercing clean or get some extra gunk off at the end of the day, this is one of the best products to use.</li>
            <li>Spray even with a nice fine mist and feels full.</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews, which says something about this amazing product.</li>
            <li>If they work anywhere near as well as this product I will be a happy camper.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not about to spend $11 every 3 weeks on something that really didn&#x27;t seem to do too much good anyway.</li>
            <li>Good product; goes fast.</li>
            <li>It leaves the piercing feeling nice, and fresh.</li>
            <li>Good price and fast delievery</li>
            <li>After the first bottle I ended up buying 2 more bottles because it worked so well!</li>
            <li>Best part, as other reviews have expressed, is that you can literally just spray and go.</li>
            <li>but it just feels refreshing and clean.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and effective. :)</li>
            <li>I love using H2ocean to clean my piercings.</li>

            <li>It keeps my piercings healthy and clean.</li>
            <li>I was also sure to clean the inside of my nose well, with the H2Ocean spray.</li>
            <li>It leaked out the side and made the product get used up very quickly.</li>
            <li>make&#x27;s it easy to put in now nipple rings</li>
            <li>I travel a lot and sometimes soaking my piercings isn&#x27;t  so easy when you are on the go.</li>
            <li>This should really be called Magical Mist or something because it&#x27;s truly amazing.</li>
            <li>Very quick delivery, it was here faster</li>
            <li>Easy.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy it unless your piercing is easy to spray, though.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I found it for such a great price on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Well after i would clean them, i wouldnt be able to move them at all without pain around the hole.</li>

            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-cleaned away debris easily and thoroughly</li>
            <li>my order had came very quickly without any problems</li>
            <li>of course, it&#x27;d not as good as an actual, warm sea salt soak.</li>

            <li>Arrived on time and worked on my piercing just fine.</li>

            <li>sometimes it was perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>I got my industrial piercing everything was fine until my bf kept hitting it.</li>
            <li>GREAT for nose piercings, and pretty much any piercing.</li>
            <li>I noticed the difference quickly, and now, after 2 weeks, the swelling is almost gone!</li>

            <li>I love this stuff so much!</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this for my belly ring and then started to use this for my tragus</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty pleased</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve used this on all 7 of my piercings as well as my stretched eats and they&#x27;ve been doing great.</li>
            <li>I was so excited</li>
            <li>It does a great job of cooling and soothing freshly stretched lobes.</li>
            <li>Love this so much!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li>exactly what i was looking for .. heals piercings like magic</li>
            <li>I got this stuff originally from the shop where I got my triple helix done, but when I ran out I wanted to have something to clean up makeup from the area.</li>
            <li>By day 4 my right nipple is becoming increasingly sore.</li>
            <li>I use it to help clean my navel piercing.</li>
            <li>So I started using H2O to keep it clean and help it fully heal.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m using this to clean it because I don&#x27;t want another ear infection.</li>
            <li>It keeps it clean though.</li>
            <li>I use it for a week after I change my jewelry to keep it clean and avoid any irritation switching the jewelry out</li>
            <li>I had my cartilage pierced about 8 months ago, and the lady who pierced my ear recommended that I purchase H2ocean to clean my ear.</li>
            <li>The scabbing is all gone and it feels clean and well-moisturized.  </li>
            <li>Keeps your piercings clean.</li>
            <li>I got my belly button pierced a couple of months ago and this product keeps it clean, even after a sweaty exercise.</li>
            <li>It sped up the healing process and kept the pierced area clean.</li>
            <li>A bit more time consuming, but much better for people like me with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>After one month, I just clean 3 times a day with H2ocean.</li>
            <li>THEN WIPE THEM CLEAN WITH A QTIP</li>
            <li>This is convenient in the sense that I don&#x27;t have to whip out a cotton pad or a q tip to clean my ear</li>
            <li>Use it every day to clean my piercing.</li>
            <li>After a week or two, my piercing was clean, and i didnt have to worry about infection.</li>
            <li>I bought this just to help keep the area clean.  </li>
            <li>Now I just clean my piercing twice a day with the spray.</li>
            <li>If you had to pop that pimple, then you have to clean it afterward.</li>
            <li>I got this to help keep my bellybutton ring clean during the day when I couldn&#x27;t do salt water soaks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the H2Ocean and it&#x27;s helped to clean and soothe the piercings without drying them out.</li>
            <li>and ive just used a sea salt and water mixture to clean them.</li>
            <li>Kept them clean.</li>
            <li>I was told to do this by my friends who also have their navels pierced and used those products to keep it clean.</li>
            <li>I KNOW this product will keep my piercing clean and will help it heal correctly.  </li>
            <li>I just got my septum pierced, so I spray it on a cotton swab and clean my piercing that way.</li>
            <li>My daughter uses this for cleaning her piercings and it keeps her clean and helps with the healing process.</li>
            <li>so I looked up ways to clean my piercing</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and at a decent price.</li>
            <li>After reading how many positive reviews there were, I just had to give it a shot as I was just going to let my helix close and get it re-pierced.</li>
            <li>This is by far the most easy and efficient piercing care product available anywhere.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I took care of the would before scar tissue could appear--I have seen people with large keloids or hypertrophic scars on their noses from trauma along the nose stud that didn&#x27;t heal correctly.</li>
            <li>I felt a difference right away from this to the gel that I was given by the piercing place!</li>
            <li>I was using a saline solution to clean my nose piercing and it got really infected (I guess working as a bartender and forgetting you have it in then touching your nose doesn&#x27;t help).</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who wants to keep there piercings clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>It really works well, but I don&#x27;t like the sprayer top; its like a mist spray I have a nostril piercing, and I use q-tips to clean it.</li>
            <li>Since money is kind of tight, I decided to go the cheap route and do my own soaks.  </li>
            <li>I certainly recommend this for anyone who has got fresh piercings, it&#x27;s so easy to use!</li>
            <li>This is a great product for new piercings and anything else you want to clean out naturally.</li>
            <li>Just to be safe, when I got my nipples pierced, I made my own mixture of dead sea salt and water, soaked a rag and kept them on my nips (cheaper route but the spray is more convenient).</li>
            <li>I Love this , really helps ..</li>
            <li>Last time I bought this product, it was good.</li>
            <li>Could always make your our mixture, but this is good if you don&#x27;t have enough time to or need it for piercings you can&#x27;t soak with a shotglass</li>
            <li>I really would love to say it helped my ear</li>
            <li>The bottle is completely full and there&#x27;s no way to get it to spray.</li>
            <li>To buy something you can never only look at how good it is and those 5 star comments.</li>
            <li>A very practical item, glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>many thanks</li>
            <li>Its still full but nothing will come out.</li>
            <li>I got a full body wax</li>
            <li>Love it, works very well helps with healing process</li>
            <li>Salt and water works a million times better and is much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Its soothing and cool to the skin.  </li>
            <li>When they have their bogo 50% off sale, it equals out to about the same price, so either way is good.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re wondering how much you&#x27;re going to have to buy, I&#x27;ve found that thorough cleaning for 3 weeks has taken most of the 4 oz bottle.  </li>
            <li>We have used H2ocean for over 10 years with the same good healing results every time.</li>
            <li>Love this product, came really fast</li>
            <li>Its reallly good, i would like a bigger spray</li>
            <li>I love this product it made my healing process so much faster</li>
            <li>It is a great product if you have pain and redness near your new piercing.</li>
            <li>what have you (and in the process not being very sterile), all you have to do is pop off the top and spray and you&#x27;re guaranteed a quick sterile cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After coming here, to Amazon, I quickly found out it had several good reviews.</li>
            <li>All the reviews I read make it sound like it worked right away and would get rid of the bump around the hole.</li>
            <li>and I tend to get hot and sweaty easily.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this if you have new piercings, or just want a good product to clean your piercings with.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>I am currently using this spray to help clean and heal my earlobe piercings and navel piercing and so far so good!</li>
            <li>i love this product and would definitely order a lot more , i love piercings and this will help clean new piercings and reduce the pain in pierced area , this work for me</li>
            <li>or on my body if i want to clean a freshly scratched scab.</li>
            <li>and i still use it to keep area feeling clean and fresh</li>
            <li>My tragus piercing got super irritated and inflamed 2 weeks after having it done.</li>
            <li>Nothing healed my nose as quickly as this; it even heals keloids rather quickly.</li>
            <li>I actually bought this from hot topic (but Amazon is probably cheaper) but this stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>Helped to heal my nipples quickly and ease the burn of my industrial.</li>
            <li>Works the same, great product, I use it for my nose ring and sometimes for my belly button ring when it wants to be a Butt.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really care for it, but it seems like it&#x27;d be really great and efficient if it actually worked for me!</li>
            <li>does it&#x27;s quick to use for the nose</li>
            <li>, my lip however is healing rather quickly.</li>
            <li>It healed quickly and without incident.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>It helped get rid of some redness that I had around my piercing quickly.</li>
            <li>I have never had ear piercings heal so quickly.</li>
            <li>If you have a gold earring it heals quickly.</li>
            <li>H2Ocean healed my nose piercing quickly.  </li>
            <li>It came quickly, and the bottle was factory sealed.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t burn and helps quickly heal.</li>
            <li>Immensely helps reduce healing process, therefore I&#x27;m confident that I am able to change my bar in two months.</li>
            <li>It came quickly and had no problems with my order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will definitely recommend this product to a friend or whom ever decides to get a piercing b/c this works the best over regular sea salt soaks.</li>
            <li>The shipping was quick and the product worked.</li>
            <li>It is super convenient, so you can carry it along with you during the day in case the piercing flares up.</li>
            <li>So soothing and my piercing healed so quickly.</li>
            <li>the product and the shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle, cleans effectively, doesn&#x27;t irritate, i like that it comes in a spray can; that makes it very convenient for on the go</li>
            <li>I love the H2Ocean spray, hence the 5 stars, but the particular 4oz</li>
            <li>It soothes and treats any mild irritation or infection.</li>
            <li>Definetly recommend my navel piercing healed quickly 😃</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best on the market and to save you some hard earned cash the smart thing to do if you know your surly going for a piercing I would purchase this product in advanced</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone with a new piercing or infected piercing because it&#x27;s so easy to use and SUPER sterile!</li>
            <li>I have had little to no crusties to clean and it looks great.</li>
            <li>Now my belly button piercing finally it healed fine!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a smoker, and generally it takes longer for any piercing/wound to heal, but with this it&#x27;s doing amazingly well.</li>
            <li>My piercings have healed very fast after using this!</li>
            <li>It took about 2 days for my ear to become swollen, purple, producing puss, and very hot.</li>
            <li>So I am very pleased with the actual spray..</li>
            <li>But overall, i am VERY pleased with H2Ocean Piercing Spray.</li>
            <li>But it is also available at Hot Topic.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Really helps to keep them clean and infection free.</li>
            <li>It is easy and fast to apply, soaks in quick and does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>I love to use this for my newly pierced tragus&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Also, there were no &amp;#34;crusties&amp;#34; around the barbells like most new piercings create.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this and would recommend to anyone with new piercings.</li>
            <li>I used to live in Miami and nothing healed a wound or even a piercing better than running into the ocean, so we shall see.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommended for belly button piercings because it is much easier to use compared to the salt water mixture in a cup.  </li>
            <li>I also do regular cleanse soaks, but this is perfect for cleaning it in rushed mornings, or tiering nights after a long day.</li>
            <li>Fast, easy piercing care that I can carry around with me.</li>
            <li>Makes it so much easier to keep my piercings clean, it doesn&#x27;t hurt and I really do think it makes them heal better.</li>
            <li>so I can clean during the day because my rook is still pretty new and needs to be cleaned more than once</li>
            <li>Thanks for nothing !!</li>
            <li>I bought this because I ran out of the saline wound wash that I originally bought from my piercer when I first got my conch pierced.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice anything significant at first.</li>
            <li>And these are results after the first day!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>Plus at hot topic these are $20 so definately recommended!</li>
            <li>But I did as instructed, and cleaned them 4 times a day with this spray and by the second day they were so much better!</li>
            <li>And I must say this really worked!!</li>
            <li>The spray was easy to use and it helped my fresh piercing heal much faster.</li>
            <li>This is an absolute must have for fresh piercings and the shipment was very quick.</li>
            <li>I am so happy because it came right after I emptied out the other can!</li>
            <li>After getting my forward helix pierced and being instructed to clean it twice a day with hot water and salt (salt wash)</li>
            <li>This is awesome...had an industrial piercing and this has really helped to heal it up quickly !</li>
            <li>and i still currently use it, i have very sensitive skin and have had great success with this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for cleaning little cuts and scrapes.</li>
            <li>I experienced just when moving the piercing a little bit ---</li>
            <li>H2ocean may be good initially, since the piercing is usually sensitive, but I wasn&#x27;t really interested in spending $10 every two months to keep my piercing clean!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to say this will cure it, but I have seen a significant positive difference in how it looks.</li>
            <li>After reading all of the positive reviews I was excited to try this product.</li>
            <li>There really wasn&#x27;t an area of skin that was bump free.</li>
            <li>and wow it made a huge difference!</li>
            <li>recommend this to everyone with fresh piercings.&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>
            <li>/smelling fresh.</li>
            <li>and  now I use it just for the fun of it.</li>
            <li>He told me just to keep soaking it with my sea salt mixed with warm water.  </li>
            <li>Laugh at them.  </li>
            <li>While waiting for this to arrive, I was soaking my ear in sea salt and that helped, but this method is not nearly as messy and works much better for the pain and inflammation.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth 5 stars.</li>
            <li>At most of the professional piercing shops I&#x27;ve been pierced at, this product is always just included with the price of the piercing.</li>
            <li>only thing I really liked about H2Ocean was the convenience of the spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick to Provon.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s completely healed and better than ever.</li>
            <li>I credit this spray for having none of my piercings getting infected so far despite working at a restaurant. :)</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to everyone with fresh piercings</li>
            <li>when you&#x27;re at the stage where you still need to do warm seat salt soaks bit you keep &amp;#34;forgetting&amp;#34; because the newness of your piercing is gone and you&#x27;re over it, or just for regular cleaning.</li>
            <li>This stuff is totally worth getting if you&#x27;ve got any healing issues.</li>
            <li>My tragus piercing is a year old and still hasn&#x27;t fully healed, but I&#x27;ve been using this product on it for about three months and it looks and feels better every day.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth buying the 2 bottle pack</li>
            <li>Much better off with tea tree oil which is a natural antiseptic.</li>
            <li>This is a great product to clear your piercing when you recently got it or for preventive maintenance.</li>
            <li>Never be reckless with a fresh piercing just because it seems fine)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would say it is worth it if you have a piercing that&#x27;s bothering you, but be warned you may get a bottle that leaks.</li>
            <li>(my daughter would swear by it) and I find it&#x27;s a product worth paying for.</li>
            <li>I just wish it was available in a bigger size.... and u won&#x27;t be able to tell wen</li>
            <li>Later, I got it redone and used Blarex Wound Wash Saline on it, which did heal it quite nicely, but it took longer</li>
            <li>I used it along with regular seasalt soaks in a cup of warm water.</li>
            <li>IT WAS WORTH EVERY CENT.  </li>
            <li>After reading all the reviews, I decided to get this because everyone said it was worth the hype.</li>
            <li>but I think it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>The 4 oz can lasts me about a month&#x27;s worth of use.  </li>
            <li>can I received got a &amp;#34;rattle&amp;#34; in the can after about a weeks worth of use.  </li>
            <li>It is worth the price for me.</li>
            <li>make sure to use a decent moisturizer after each use, as the salt has a potential to be drying, but otherwise I find it to be very gently and pretty effective.</li>
            <li>Perfect for times you&#x27;re too lazy to make a warm salt soak from scratch, which means less skipping out on morning cleans or</li>
            <li>First, let me say this is NOT a bad product, it just wasn&#x27;t right for ME.  </li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>It came to me within 3-5 business days which was pretty quick.</li>
            <li>My nose healed super fast with this!</li>
            <li>It certainly helped keep the piercing clean</li>
            <li>but it certainly helped clean it and soothe any irritation.</li>
            <li>My belly button ring got infected and this product cleared it right up, like literally in a day.</li>
            <li>and it took the redness right away</li>
            <li>I had one can get &amp;#34;gummed&amp;#34; up from salt deposits in the nozzle, but I called H2Ocean and they sent me a replacement right away.</li>
            <li>If your piercing isn&#x27;t healed right after using this for awhile, the piercing wasn&#x27;t pierced correctly.</li>
            <li>healed it right up.</li>
            <li>I used this right after I got my industrial piercing done</li>
            <li>I got my nose pierced a while ago, and it got infected right away.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Vet said to keep using it and it healed her right up in two weeks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll tell you right now</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>It cleans any crust you may have right off.</li>
            <li>I got an industrial done about two months ago and right after the piercing session, my ear was burning.</li>
            <li>in my right ear to match.</li>
            <li>This stuff worked well right off the bat by reducing pain and redness.</li>
            <li>It did not, however, stop the infection in my right one which eventually led to me taking them out.</li>
            <li>I looked online and tried all these home remedies of sea salt and water, but I never seemed to get the proportions right.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this on amazon and got it in the mail right away.</li>
            <li>Now I didn&#x27;t notice much right away like everyone else</li>
            <li>It clears the redness and itching right away.</li>
            <li>This makes things so much easier when having to clean my piercing.</li>
            <li>This makes my piercing feel clean and is helping it heal much faster.</li>
            <li>Now that the whole infectious ordeal is over, I just use it to keep them clean.</li>
            <li>Use with Q-tips to gently and safely clean any deposits on jewelry.  </li>
            <li>I have learned to not move the piercing and just clean gently around it.</li>
            <li>So much easier to keep a piercing clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only ever used this (and recomended hand soaps) to clean any of my piercings and this keeps them very clean.</li>
            <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t have all the properties of a good old hot sea salt soak, which breaks down the crusts and opens the capillaries, thus allowing a better oxygenation (and a faster healing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Great for the lazy at heart.</li>
            <li>my ear was perfectly normal and pain free.</li>
            <li>It is the only thing I have found that is easy to use and cleans my piercings well!</li>
            <li>I thought it would be a little bigger but Great!</li>
            <li>i had to contact the manufacturer and thank god they sent me a new one for free.</li>
            <li>I got the product super fast</li>
            <li>It also shipped super fast to me.</li>
            <li>Prior to purchasing this product, I have heard lots about how great it was but had already bought a generic saline spray from the place that I got pierced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A few days in and pus was gone, and a week or two later they were perfectly healed.</li>
            <li>They quickly got very infected.  </li>
            <li>About two days after I&#x27;d accidentally got my nose stud caught on the fibers of a washcloth (while washing my face) a HUGE bump developed right beside the piercing.</li>
            <li>Very soothing and worth the price right after a piercing.</li>
            <li>about 8 months very much is used.</li>
            <li>Pierce this 2 has a very reasonable price, and does not charge a fortune for shipping, so</li>
            <li>This spray is super easy to use, I just spray a little on a cotton swab, and just clean around the stud before bed and in the morning, and then I&#x27;m done!</li>
            <li>Every time I get a new piecing I make sure to be stocked up on h2ocean this stuff makes the healing process so much more comfortable and fast with little to no compilations</li>
            <li>I also put a little tea tree oil on my piercings for good measure.</li>
            <li>A little squirt three times a day feels good and encourages healing.</li>
            <li>leaks a little but over all good.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stress enough how important it is to keep your piercings clean</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and cooling and works well to keep my piercing clean without using any harsh cleaners.</li>
            <li>The seller shipped the product in very fast - much faster than Amazon!</li>
            <li>It does not burn or sting, but keeps new piercings clean and soothed.</li>
            <li>A staple for any new piercing or just keeping existing piercings clean.</li>
            <li>I use this to clean my new septum piercing about 2-3 times a day.</li>
            <li>If you have a new piercing I recommend buying this to clean them.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, I&#x27;m only bummed this wasn&#x27;t around 17 years ago when I started getting piercings.</li>
            <li>Got item pretty fast!</li>
            <li>I pierced my cartilage, and it was healing well at first.</li>
            <li>It makes a difference in a matter of a day or two is all, and if your piercing beings to show signs of infection, you simply need to spray it a couple times before it looks okay again.</li>
            <li>ESPECIALLY if your piercing is supposed to take more than two months to heal (otherwise, buy the smaller version, because you probably won&#x27;t need any more).  </li>
            <li>When I first ordered this product I bought it exactly from the Company, not from Amazon and it never gave me any problem whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got it for such a cheaper price than in store</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!!</li>
            <li>if I don&#x27;t have time to wash my piercing before my first class of the morning.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t feel like it was cleaning it well enough, but its ok for any piercing care</li>
            <li>I Plan to get more future piercings</li>
            <li>When I first got my piercings I followed my piercers directions to the T.</li>
            <li>This spray really helped belly button piercing when it was fresh.</li>
            <li>nozzle broke the first time I tried to use it</li>
            <li>I was really upset!</li>
            <li>It would not spray after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>After going to my piercer and asking for advice, which was \\&quot;use Tea Tree Oil and hot salty water\\</li>
            <li>My first time purchasing this</li>
            <li>Came on time fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I bought H2Ocean from Hot Topic the day after I got my navel piercing</li>
            <li>Bought this as an aftercare product for my first time getting my ears pierced.</li>
            <li>Yes, it works better IMO than regular sea salt rinses.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Like many people, I had a gross bump on my piercing that just wouldn&#x27;t go away...</li>
            <li>I knew it was straight to the h2ocean I go!</li>
            <li>Used the first (1.5 oz) bottle from the piercing parlor before I was totally healed, within 2 days I knew I had to get more.</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re consistent and patient it&#x27;ll work for you.</li>
            <li>This was my first  not counting</li>
            <li>Went to use it for the first time and the sprayer was defective/stuck.  </li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t end up being charged a bomb at your local piercer shop. :-)</li>
            <li>and I wish had got this stuff when I first got them pierced.</li>
            <li>This is the BEST stuff to use when trying to heal a piercing, and its usually fairly expensive.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The spray cap stopped working after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Sea salt soaks worked the first time around</li>
            <li>After one day of using this product, the bumps are significantly reduced and the redness is nearly nonexistent!</li>
            <li>I got a third hole pierced in my ears at a reputable pavilion in a nearby mall.</li>
            <li>This made my ear a lot more irritated and I only used it twice a day.</li>
            <li>This is difficult to find at a piercing store, and to find the 4oz can, so ordering online is the best way to purchase.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does exactly as it says: It cleans the piercing &amp; the jewelry &amp; dissolves crusted lymph fluid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first time they never had an issue.</li>
            <li>:) I would recommend it for anyone with piercings, ears, nose, lip, and especially belly!</li>
            <li>After the first use my ear became swollen.  </li>
            <li>Worked really well on my piercing!</li>
            <li>I really needed this stuff for my industrial piercing!</li>
            <li>Works pretty well.</li>
            <li>It really helps in the healing process a lot faster!</li>
            <li>I was interested in it and read some reviews.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re always sore when I wake up first thing anyway.</li>
            <li>H2Ocean works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Really works!</li>
            <li>I like using this product in between salt water soaks--however, I find that when use the spray 3-4x a day and do the salt water soak only once (before bed), my Tragus is more tender versus when I do the salt water soaks 2-3x a day and don&#x27;t use the spray.</li>
            <li>and my nipples are healing really fast!</li>
            <li>I got a cheap upper lobe piercing (first mistake) after I had gotten my first two holes with no pain and no bad after effects.</li>
            <li>first week I had it</li>
            <li>Because I have an auto-immune disease I take forever to heal in the first place, but as you may or may not know, cartilage takes forever and</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to this a year ago when I had some ear piercings done.</li>
            <li>The first week that I used it it did help with the itching.</li>
            <li>I ended up doing a regular sea salt soak and then the rook began to feel better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll last A LOT longer and better than the h2ocean</li>
            <li>I had used this product before, I just needed more of it and didn&#x27;t know where to get it locally.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using h2ocean for several years now, I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>now I used this stuff when I first got them pierced &amp; never have had a problem until now,</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li>My piercing healing up pretty well</li>
            <li>first used it three times a day during the first couple weeks, then twice a day.</li>
            <li>but I was willing to try anything to rid of the hideous bump</li>
            <li>At first, I was making a sea salt flush (recipe given to me by the place where I pierced my nose) and antibacterial soap.</li>
            <li>Over the years I have had many facial piercings (nostril, septum, snakebites, vertical labret).  </li>
            <li>I did make sure that I sprayed my piercing on a daily basis with it.</li>
            <li>My first can that I ordered was defective, so I contacted the seller.</li>
            <li>My pierce heals pretty well in 2</li>
            <li>Bought this for my brother after he got his first piercing.</li>
            <li>Within a month the bottled clogged up from all the salt and it created more problems with my tragus piercing then just regular cleaning.</li>
            <li>I recently got something repierced and healing it this time using this spray has been SO much better.</li>
            <li>I found I wasn&#x27;t using it consistently b/c</li>
            <li>Nozzle doesn&#x27;t clog, consistent spray stream.</li>
            <li>When I got it, it obviously hadn&#x27;t been tested to make sure it worked before being shipped out.</li>
            <li>I got this to use while gauging my ears since I have lost many, many ear piercings to infection in the past.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After the FIRST day of using it (as directed)</li>
            <li>and I really like it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard of these kinds of bottles getting clogged after repeated use, but not being clogged upon the first attempted use.</li>
            <li>When I first received the product it worked like a charm; however after about a month the spray broke and I couldn&#x27;t use the rest of it.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>the product worxed good but the can clogged after a few uses and we had to run under hot water and d1g wth a p1n</li>
            <li>My piercings definitely heal faster and look better since I have been using this.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this stuff since day one, spraying it on about 4x a day the first week</li>
            <li>my ear started feeling and looking better by the next evening.  </li>
            <li>This is our family&#x27;s first choice for piercing care.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve compared this to standard wound-wash saline, and this works so much better.</li>
            <li>I wish I had started using H2ocean when I first got my piercings -- it really does work wonders!</li>
            <li>I must admit this hurt the first week I tried it.</li>
            <li>And since the can isn&#x27;t too big, I can carry it with me and spray it as needed! :)</li>
            <li>The product arrived in a timely manner and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I used it forever ago when I had my piercings first done</li>
            <li>DOES EXACTLY</li>
            <li>It did help heal my belly button piercing, HOWEVER I found that Witch Hazel actually works better.</li>
            <li>Okay so I recently bought this spray because I got my cartilage pierced</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the hot water and sea salt soak but bending my head over a cup wasn&#x27;t working for me.</li>
            <li>The only reason this works is because it eliminates you actually touching your ear, all you do is spray and go.</li>
            <li>I suggest you go to walmart and buy an empty spray bottle and sea salt, boil the water and add a lot of sea salt and put it in the spray bottle and you have you&#x27;re own h20cean spray</li>
            <li>If you are thinking about getting this product, try Neosporin first.</li>
            <li>bought this again after my first one ran out.</li>
            <li>will be buying in the future :)</li>
            <li>let others touch the cool new piercing/drag it through landfills.  </li>
            <li>I got it fairly fast and tried using it right out if the box but to my surprise it would not spray.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who is getting new piercings and also for anyone who wants to keep their current piercings clean :)</li>
            <li>Other than that, I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s amazing, but it&#x27;s sterile and salt water, so it lives up to my expectations.</li>
            <li>Bought it originally to help clear up an infected ear lobe after a stretch and it worked for that.</li>
            <li>Over the years with all my other piercing I&#x27;ve used Morton ionized salt with warm water.</li>
            <li>The reason I&#x27;m giving it one star is because of the price &amp; unlike the warm water &amp; sea salt, this completely dried out my ears leaving it kind of flaky with dry skin.</li>
            <li>and I need something reliable and natural to clean it with.</li>
            <li>it healed it extremely fast and will be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use, you just spray it on and let it air dry.  </li>
            <li>I was thinking about piercing my nose, I was really worried about possible infection, so I did my research and found that H2Ocean is the most trusted aftercare spray.  </li>
            <li>You need to make sure the spray is not replacing regular gentle cleaning with an anti-microbial soap.</li>
            <li>The first few days I was using hot salt soaks, but those were kind if a pain and pretty impractical.</li>
            <li>I stumbled upon this product while searching for quality nose ring and read some of the overwhelmingly positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done this for all of my piercings and have had completely positive results.</li>
            <li>This is great but..... not a good value for the price.</li>
            <li>duh :P  </li>
            <li>this product it helped it heal pretty fast.</li>
            <li>I used it on my tragus piercing for a while when I didn&#x27;t have ready access to sea salt and hot water.</li>
            <li>It does run out fast but it is a much easier alternative!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had pretty much no redness</li>
            <li>Go-to aftercare for piercings; pretty basic and does the job, as long as you are good with up-keep.</li>
            <li>The other piercing healed beautifully and stays clean with a few sprays every now and then.</li>
            <li>It gets in there without making a huge mess and makes it sooooo much easier to clean my piercings!</li>
            <li>This only lasted me through my 2nd month with many more months to go, until my piercing is completely healed.  </li>
            <li>Upon reading the reviews I decided to try this instead of buying more of the other product, especially since this was a better value and seemed to do wonders for healing piercings.</li>
            <li>It has helped clear up my tragus piercing tremendously.</li>
            <li>Not only do the crusts go away, but it makes it easy to remove because they don&#x27;t seem to harden with this product.  </li>
            <li>Ever since I started using this product I see my piercings heal a little quickly and prevent them from getting infected for which I love.</li>
            <li>Tee tree oil peroxide alcohol certain cleansers and nothing worked</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say for certain if this helped.</li>
            <li>and this is the large spray can.</li>
            <li>If you just got a brand new piercing, this is the product you need!!</li>
            <li>I previously bought this product from the tattoo shop where I got my eyebrow pierced, and it worked GREAT on it and my bellybutton piercing (which was starting to swell).</li>
            <li>It is a gentle stream and yet strong enough to get rid of the crusties.</li>
            <li>I went back to the piercer, and he told me it was probably torn by accidentally sleeping on it, and that it would heal up just fine.</li>
            <li>ago.&lt;br /&gt;The antibacterial soap my piercer gave me worked fine when he did my conch last year, but a week into my nose piercing aftercare</li>
            <li>One note, it&#x27;s main ingredient is derived from eggs, so if you&#x27;re allergic to them, don&#x27;t use it!</li>
            <li>I mainly use this product for razor bumps!</li>
            <li>So I very highly recommend this product for any body with nipple piercings.</li>
            <li>and you can really get up into those crevasses without moving or touching your nose/the piercing at all, (which is a must in those first two weeks due to how sore you&#x27;ll</li>
            <li>and i know keeping new piercings clean is vital to preventing infections.</li>
            <li>I used this spray every day just as the directions say and they healed up nicely and the piercings didn&#x27;t even really get itchy except a few times when I soaked them in sea salt.</li>
            <li>So much easier than a saltwater rinse</li>
            <li>It cleaned my nose piercing really well</li>
            <li>healing my piercing really good(:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Anyone who has a nose piercing knows how much of a pain that is.  </li>
            <li>It took to much time and was just an inconvenience.  </li>
            <li>I was not convinced it would make so much of a difference, but purchased it any way.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It helps so much and makes healing so much quicker and easier.</li>
            <li>I purchased it not thinking it would do much within three days of using it it</li>
            <li>Much easier to use.</li>
            <li>and I have been submerging my whole ear in salt water</li>
            <li>It works well and does its job very well.  </li>
            <li>Found this and figured I could do no worse than I was doing.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t changed much in a month</li>
            <li>I really wanted a belly button peircing</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so much easier using this versus a sea salt soak.</li>
            <li>This product really helped to reduce the swelling and pain.</li>
            <li>but its so much easier to use than making one urself</li>
            <li>Worked well my piercing was very agitated and this stuff helped with cleaning it out.</li>
            <li>It wouldn&#x27;t spray or do really anything.</li>
            <li>salt soaks weren&#x27;t doing much to help.</li>
            <li>So for the price you don&#x27;t get that much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very convenient.</li>
            <li>Much easier than having to do a sea salt soak</li>
            <li>but wow was it worth it,</li>
            <li>this spray makes the process MUCH faster.</li>
            <li>Highly reccommend it!</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t really help you heal</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>really works.</li>
            <li>Its easy, it really keeps your piercing clean, and eliminates any dried discharge.</li>
            <li>Maybe I overused it, but it didn&#x27;t really help my piercing.</li>
            <li>fix the problem ring up to heal fast for my nose</li>
            <li>and I was very worried about infection setting in.</li>
            <li>This stuff works wonders fast...</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>but I purchase too much after I got my belly button pierced.</li>
            <li>This product really works wonders and takes away redness and swelling and that itchy feeling you get afterwards.</li>
            <li>I continue to highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It came really fast and was just as described.</li>
            <li>Much faster than using sea salt solution and comparable to sea salt soaking it for 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>I have had issues with ear piercing infections my whole life...</li>
            <li>thank you so much.</li>
            <li>Despite my cleaning them twice a day with the cleaning solution provided at the time of piercing, I was headed straight for infection-ville.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>The spray is very soothing if a pierced ear gets irritated.</li>
            <li>Fast service.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I know everyone&#x27;s experience can vary, but I just want to let people know that there can be very adverse reactions to using this product.</li>
            <li>I did spray some on a cotton ball and use it on my face for my acne, it didn&#x27;t seem to help it much</li>
            <li>This is a product to use when ur in need of some fast healing.</li>
            <li>It is very convenient when I am at work or school because I can&#x27;t always make a sea salt soak.</li>
            <li>Really helps with swelling/infections in piercings.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast and the bottle came ready to use.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even describe how much pain I was in this stuff</li>
            <li>This makes cleaning your piercings so much easier.</li>
            <li>Please get this because it really does work.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I have always found that if you want to get a real feel for people&#x27;s opinions of products, amazon.com is the place to go.</li>
            <li>I tried doing at home sea salt soaks to see if this was really just overpriced seas salt soaks and my piercing got infected within a week (go figure).</li>
            <li>My piercing heal fast and they never, ever get infected.</li>
            <li>and he was very stern on nothing else..</li>
            <li>and it made it heal much faster than it was just using sea salt as a cleanser.</li>
            <li>This product does not work very well at all.</li>
            <li>Use this for my ear piercings and it is very convenient.</li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s only around 15 bucks at the shop for a 4oz bottle, I&#x27;m just a cheap skate).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>I absolutely would get this and use it for anytime</li>
            <li>It cleans my ears very well</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product and seller!</li>
            <li>very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used this on my septum piercing and it has really helped with the healing process...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s healing up really well.</li>
            <li>With this spray, it makes the job much easier...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost healed and h2ocean spray has really smoothed out the process.&lt;br /&gt;NOTE</li>
            <li>think my helix has healed much faster than my navel and definitly faster than my earlobes.  </li>
            <li>It heals the piercing very well.</li>
            <li>Healed my cartilage piercing very well using it 2 times a day.</li>
            <li>the itching is gone not so much crust either.</li>
            <li>Thanks H2ocean.</li>
            <li>I used this product a whole 2 days before it stopped spraying.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>What really draws me to this product is how it sprays.</li>
            <li>I really hope I can get another bottle because I have tried the product</li>
            <li>My piercing healed so fast</li>
            <li>Very convenient.  </li>
            <li>so I recommend this product it is really helpful</li>
            <li>and I just didn&#x27;t want to do the whole soaking in water &amp; sea salt.</li>
            <li>It got really sore</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>works very well, if your ear has gotten infected.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, if you&#x27;re looking to stretch your ears - this is highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, but when I got the product it didn&#x27;t have a hole in spray nozzle</li>
            <li>but I went through the whole bottle in 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li>I had been purchasing this locally, at a much steeper cost.  </li>
            <li>However, you didn&#x27;t have much to do with this product except to deliver it to my doorstep.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worth the $9 you pay by far.</li>
            <li>Highly, highly, HIGHLY recommend!  </li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>and it still was swollen but not so much sore</li>
            <li>Cleans piercings really well and fast.</li>
            <li>This spray really helped heal my piercings</li>
            <li>It helped heal my belly button &amp; helix piercings very well.</li>
            <li>Self pierce a lot and really convenient.</li>
            <li>Helped heal my nose piercing fast 😃awesome product.</li>
            <li>The product is great, but the bottle was shipped to me with a broken nozzle, so I can&#x27;t even use it.</li>
            <li>My piercings weren&#x27;t infected, but they were still very swollen and sore.</li>
            <li>therefore much cleaner than using anything else.</li>
            <li>This product is very convenient.</li>
            <li>If I forget to use this stuff when I&#x27;m busy with life, the heat comes back along with more pus.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Before I ordered this I was using sea salt water, it was effective but so messy &amp; time consuming.</li>
            <li>My only gripe (if I can call it that), is if you have extremely sensitive skin, make sure to use this product along with jewelry that is titanium or niobium or else it won&#x27;t heal</li>
            <li>I had really high hopes for this stuff, as my ears are super sensitive</li>
            <li>This stuff really helped clear a stubborn infection in my ear right up, and made cleaning my ear a breeze.</li>
            <li>For the first time ever a new piercing has not got infected.</li>
            <li>* right off&amp;#34; too my old piercing duder and looked to others for advice..</li>
            <li>Amazing product not harsh on skin like other piercing cleaners</li>
            <li>My nipples were extremely sore and sensitive to any touch, even my own t-shirt and swollen a bit.</li>
            <li>After a few days my piercings were better with minimal effort -- perfect for a somewhat lazy girl like myself.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s fine and back to normal now.</li>
            <li>For the first few days after piercing my nose I used a saline solution and it was going great, there was minimal swelling and no redness or signs of infection.</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s not refillable or reusable as any other spriting device, I&#x27;m glad it won&#x27;t wind up in the garbage when I&#x27;m done with it.</li>
            <li>It made my irritated ears feel normal over night!</li>
            <li>I started using this stuff on my infected nose piercing and it significantly reduced my giant bump.</li>
            <li>First, understand that I have had my navel pierced a total of 4 times; the last being the most succesful one with the help of this product.</li>
            <li>This product is unusable if the spray bottle doesn&#x27;t work, and as you can see from other reviews here, many of these products are defective.</li>
            <li>I use it for cleaning my piercing but noticed it can be used for many other things too.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very small amount, but it&#x27;s good for on-the-go sanitation.</li>
            <li>i really liked this product because it&#x27;s quick and simple especially if you are short on time!</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t been red, it remains clean, and hasn&#x27;t been infected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would definitely keep this stuff around even if your piercing has already healed just to keep the area clean.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used this for ear piercings yet, but did use it to clean up an open wound my husband had gotten.</li>
            <li>I still use the spray, especially before and after running- whether I&#x27;m wearing earrings or not- just to keep the healed piercing clean.</li>
            <li>Keeps them clean without having to wash them multiple times per day.</li>
            <li>I had some &amp;#34;hidden&amp;#34; piercings and used this to clean it multiple times a day.</li>
            <li>I was instructed to clean them twice a day with regular saline solution, which I did diligently.</li>
            <li>The snug piercing that I have can take up to a year to heal and I have had my piercing for 3 months now and use H2Ocean about once every 3rd day to clean it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been in love with this stuff ever since the first time i bought it at my tattoo shop a few years ago.</li>
            <li>I also had surgery recently and used it to clean the incision sites.</li>
            <li>I spray it on a Q Tip and clean the outside and the inside</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s actually helping it heal instead of just keeping it clean.  </li>
            <li>This spray is so unbelievably easy to use, just spritz it on and let it air dry.</li>
            <li>It also does help tone down any itching you might have through the initial healing and does a good job of cleaning/drawing out crusties.</li>
            <li>By Monday there was significant swelling of the right ear, visible redness, and extreme sensitivity to touch.</li>
            <li>(I had experienced some minor resistance to plain sea salt before with a rook piercing)</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t last very long and is kind of overpriced for what it is.</li>
            <li>I finally gave up and switched to a mild tea tree solution and my ears are much happier.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this on and off over the years for my piercings, it works really well in cleaning and reducing swelling caused by inflammation and also reduces the size of the bumps that normally pops u when you have a cartilage piercing.</li>
            <li>I spray a bit of this stuff on, and literally within minutes my ears aren&#x27;t hot anymore, and the pain almost completely vanishes.</li>
            <li>That didn&#x27;t work and now I am left with a full can of h2ocea.</li>
            <li>Because I&#x27;m lazy and can&#x27;t be bothered to make my own solution.</li>
            <li>They were healing perfectly until I had a misfortunate accident and tugged one dermal a little too hard while scratching in the area.</li>
            <li>So after more research, I found this refined Emu Oil through Desert Palms Emu Ranch LLC that The Piercing Bible swears by online to treat dryness without clogging the piercing or infecting it as other oils do, and it has done wonders!</li>
            <li>This is a must have for new nose piercings!</li>
            <li>I got this for my new belly button piercing and it has worked so well!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now healed up and wearing my new earrings after my 6 weeks was up!</li>
            <li>I think this is a must if yo have a new piercing!</li>
            <li>In addition to my helix, I  have been using it on my new Tragus as well as my snug to reduce inflammation and it&#x27;s truly a miracle product!</li>
            <li>I get a new piercing from here on out!</li>
            <li>I have an industrial and it is hard to clean easily</li>
            <li>H2Ocean is much easier to use on a new ear piercing-</li>
            <li>I like the product, I&#x27;ve found it very convenient on the go for new or upset</li>
            <li>The cleansing and healing process made it so much easier to maintain my new piercings because of He Ocean Piercing Aftercare.</li>
            <li>Really recommend this product to anyone with a new piercing</li>
            <li>It really gets the job done quite well, cleans up the gunk and soothes those throbbing new piercings.</li>
            <li>It is cooling to tender new piercings and promotes fast healing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied, they&#x27;ve seemed to fix their issues from previous bottles that the sprayer would pop off...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use, and it arrived faster than I expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently got a nose piercing and for the first couple of months it did fine but later on as I began to touch it</li>
            <li>Although, you shouldn&#x27;t make it your main source for cleaning.</li>
            <li>All the classic signs of infection.</li>
            <li>This actually works to help heal your piercings quickly.</li>
            <li>This product is really good at cleaning the surface of the skin like removing dead skin and such.  </li>
            <li>A day or two after I started using it a big red bump appeared around the top of the piercing, and was bleeding.</li>
            <li>clean it with this, let it dry, then gently massage the bump with tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>I still wash my piercing with soap in the shower, but my main piercing care is h2ocean.</li>
            <li>I am currently planning more piercings once my nipples heal and will definitely stock up on H2Ocean for all of them.</li>
            <li>It is a simple way to get your saline solution quickly.</li>
            <li>Easy and simple cleaning, no other products need to be used along with it.</li>
            <li>and, I kid you not, after one day use the inflammation went down a great deal and the skin is not as dark as it was before the use of this product.</li>
            <li>That really made me miss my old H2Ocean!</li>
            <li>It has really helped my infection, it&#x27;s almost completely gone!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to mess with cotton balls now :)</li>
            <li>I like this better actually because it saves me the trouble of having to boil water and mix the soap and wait for it to cool</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I bought it direct from H2Ocean&#x27;s website for a brand new piercing and had no problems.</li>
            <li>Most of those slow down the healing process and aren&#x27;t as effective with infections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used this stuff for 4 of my piercings and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone with piercings</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this spray to anyone considering any type of piercings.</li>
            <li>i would highly recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product and it was cheaper getting it off amazon than from my shop.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY Reccomnd</li>
            <li>the price is way to high when you can use saline solution for a cupple dollors.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest to anyone who is planning on getting pierced, to have this on hand.</li>
            <li>Highly reccommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend helps heal piercings</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but I still highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a high pressure spray that gets into the piercing hole.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product to anyone that gets something pierced.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this spray.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this after reading all the 5 star reviews, but after one use, my tragus piercing felt prickly and swelled up for a day or two.</li>
            <li>but I decided to stick to it since is a highly recommend product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and will purchase again.</li>
            <li>This product does everything it says in it&#x27;s description as long as you adhere to the directions and do not over clean your piercing.</li>
            <li>I use this to clean my stretched ears and septum piercing.</li>
            <li>It was very cooling and soothing at first, but about an hour after, my piercing were swollen, dry, and hot.</li>
            <li>Also, if you tend to be allergic to certain metals and your ear piercings get infected, use this to clear the infection up.</li>
            <li>I had a new stud that caused the dreaded &amp;#34;bump&amp;#34; on my piercing, I&#x27;m assuming it was the metal quality, and after changing the stud and using this spray regularly I healed quickly and scar-free.</li>
            <li>A week ago, I got my cartilage pierced and was recommended the H2Ocean -- WOW!!</li>
            <li>When my more healed piercings get irritated, I spray them with a little of this and it soothes the dryness and irritation.</li>
            <li>Saltwater is a natural wound cleanser, so it only makes sense to bottle purified saltwater to clean piercing sites.</li>
            <li>I had my belly button pierced almost 2 years ago and was told to use the old antibacterial soap and neosporin trick to clean it -- in 2 weeks, it was swollen and infected, big time.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t sting, helps the piercings heal, and is extremely convenient and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I used normal saline till I got this, however H2Ocean is much better getting the little crustys off of the jewelry.</li>
            <li>but I blame weather its so hot in here and its a lil difficult to clean it many time at day cause of my work</li>
            <li>which is a lot and kind of hard.</li>
            <li>I am using it on my new piercings, a couple that I am stretching and on my five year olds new earings!</li>
            <li>I will use this for at least the 5 remaining months of healing time, if not longer, amazing product.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping it would clear up my infected nose piercing, it didn&#x27;t help me at all, maybe it helped others.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for those complicated piercings (rooks, dermals, etc.)</li>
            <li>No where near as much pain.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, my ears are feeling great now</li>
            <li>My piercings had always been very &amp;#34;pus-y&amp;#34;, hot, and irritated, and lasted YEARS until I finally removed them.</li>
            <li>I created my own saline solution with sea salt that the piercer provided, but lately it hasn&#x27;t been working.</li>
            <li>and then when i found out that saline soluting aka contact solution dose the exact same thing i felt very ripped off.</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m aware I could probably make a reasonable facsimile of this product for pennies on the dollar, I keep coming back to Amazon for it.  </li>
            <li>It last a long time and is so important to have!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many piercings done but always have trouble with healing.</li>
            <li>H2Ocean is pretty much the only thing that has ever worked for me.</li>
            <li>&amp; you don&#x27;t have to mix it fresh daily.</li>
            <li>My piercing also did better when I sprayed some on a cotton ball and held the cotton ball on the piercing for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>So while I&#x27;ve had good experience with this product in the past, I can&#x27;t say whether or not it would work for multiple purposes because of the crappy packaging.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been 2 days and my piercing is completely normal now.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>I purchased this spray and used it and within a few days it felt sooo much better.</li>
            <li>This is more for use when you&#x27;re traveling, or just to have a small clean-up whenever you need it and don&#x27;t have time to do a real thorough cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product does help though, and especially for a fresh piercing, I would recommend it.</li>
            <li>For the most part it&#x27;s not a huge deal, but when traveling/moving it&#x27;s a pain to have to worry about whether or not something will make it spray off in my bag.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone with a new piercing or for someone to purchase before getting a piercing.</li>
            <li>As someone with five piercings and some of them in high maintenance areas believe me when I tell you that this is a mist have for new piercings.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone getting a new piercing.</li>
            <li>H2Ocean is fantastic at clearing up minor irritations on old piercings and for cleaning new piercings.</li>
            <li>Helped heal my two new piercings about 3 weeks quicker than normal soap and water would.</li>
            <li>shipping was a little much, but everything was fine and came on time.</li>
            <li>had my left tragus &amp; right conch done on a Friday night.</li>
            <li>It sprays on easily and cools down the burn of your newly pierced site.  </li>
            <li>This is cheap, sterile, and extremely well-produced.  </li>
            <li>Good price and arrived a little sooner than expected.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone who is newly pierced .</li>
            <li>No brainer for new piercings&lt;br /&gt;Must</li>
            <li>and it was brand new as it said.</li>
            <li>cause it might close my new piercing.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone getting a new piercing.</li>
            <li>One of my new piercing regimens i swear by.</li>
            <li>Used this to heal my new wrist peircing.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>Every time I get a new piercing at a tattoo shop, they always recomend this.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone with a new naval piercing... or any type of piercing.</li>
            <li>I had a lot of swelling in my new ear piercings and it hurt to even touch my ear.</li>
            <li>I bought some for my lady and her new piercings</li>
            <li>and I get no pain in newly pierced ears.  </li>
            <li>I just got two new piercings and have ordered another bottle for them.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product every time I get a new piercing or on anything I can use this product on.</li>
            <li>I cleaned my new piercing 3 or 4 times a day for 2 days.</li>
            <li>I have now been using it on my new nose piercing with no problems.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any new acne pop up either...</li>
            <li>Used it on 4 new piercings (R &amp; L tragus, L rook, R conch).</li>
            <li>This is a MUST HAVE for anyone with a new nose piercing.</li>
            <li>so I couldn&#x27;t return it and wait for a new one to come.</li>
            <li>For me it&#x27;s lasted through 3 new piercings.</li>
            <li>I spray some of this on a couple Q-tips, wipe around all the exposed areas of my new piercing, then I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li>I finished it and needed a new one.</li>
            <li>If you have a new piercing this is a must.</li>
            <li>H2Ocean works so well on healing up your new piercings or any piercing infections.</li>
            <li>(I have a new industrial).  </li>
            <li>I have been using it to take care of my new ear piercing</li>
            <li>I gauged my helix (top of ear) from 18 to 16 a month after I got my snug and the earring was very tight but it didn&#x27;t swell.</li>
            <li>gold plated my piercing became inflamed with this huge pump at the back and pus exiting both the front and back or the piercing site.</li>
            <li>i had a bump on my nose piercing for a long time and now it is pretty much gone</li>
            <li>I spray it every 4 or 5 hours (and wash it with soap for sensitive skin 1-2 times a day) and plan on lessening that to 2-3 times a day in a few weeks when it has healed more.  </li>
            <li>She was religiously preparing sea salt soaks with warm water, using a glass to soak her ear - time-consuming and messy.  </li>
            <li>It was infected and very sensitive for months after I had my piercing.</li>
            <li>Progress has only continued, so I&#x27;m very pleased that for me H2Ocean actually helped to cure an active infection.</li>
            <li>You should pair this with tea tree oil simply because it&#x27;s a salt solution  and can dry out the area pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>It really does wonders for any piercing, as it healed a small tear in my ear VERY quickly.</li>
            <li>I usually put it on a cotton ball and rub it on my nose piercing to keep it clean (which I don&#x27;t need to do much more, since the piercing has completely healed, but I needed it often during the first few months).</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use it right away with my first anchor piercing, and it took over 2 weeks for the redness and swelling to go down.</li>
            <li>Spray it on 4 times a day, however, if you have a piercing infection, spray it every hour or so and it will clear the irritation in just one day!</li>
            <li>I have used this for numerous piercings and it helps them heal so much faster !</li>
            <li>H2Ocean definitely works, but I can&#x27;t say it works better than any other sterile saline solution.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also using it to help heal a deep wound from having my first anchor piercing removed.</li>
            <li>The removal left me with a big crater below my collarbone and the H2Ocean is significantly speeding along the healing process.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>Well first off I ordered 3 bottles, for some reason they could only send two</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually about to buy another bottle because i&#x27;ve just been using it so much!</li>
            <li>and it was completely gone!</li>
            <li>After 3 DAYS my ear was completely healed!</li>
            <li>The entire bottle emptied on first spray.  </li>
            <li>I got double nostril piercings 3 months ago - didn&#x27;t have any issues for the first month and then the dreaded bumps appeared.</li>
            <li>just 1-2 spray of this a day for like 3 days and BOOM no more infection, just silky healthy skin</li>
            <li>so my next can I will probably get at a pierced or hot topic store</li>
            <li>Despite following all of the instructions I was given, it still managed to get pretty swollen and infected.  </li>
            <li>Sooo, I went to the local mall and procured some from Hot Topic.</li>
            <li>I use this spray in between daily washes with hot water and dial gold.</li>
            <li>I use to use regular backing spray that you can purchase at Walmart, so this was my first time trying it out.</li>
            <li>Completely helped to heal my piercing!</li>
            <li>I have over 10 different piercings and this has never failed me.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say if it works or not since I&#x27;m using it as a precaution only, but I haven&#x27;t had any infection issues in the first couple stretches</li>
            <li>This is my second can, my first one was the travel size.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised!</li>
            <li>On my first one I used the regular soap cleaning method and after two years it never would heal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time I used H2Ocean spray, I purchased it because my job was hiking 8 hours a day in the woods of the Central Cascades.  </li>
            <li>So just be aware, you are definitely going to have to be replenishing it when your piercing is healing.</li>
            <li>and it was only sore for the first week.</li>
            <li>The spray is pretty solid.</li>
            <li>Now I only use antibacterial soap on my piercings once while I&#x27;m taking a hot shower and use H2Ocean during the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>Product arrived on time, as described, in new condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product for new piercings as well as old ones.</li>
            <li>It does come out in a pretty big mist, so in order for me to put it on my ears without getting it all over my face, I just spray quite a bit on the ends of q-tips (enough to where it&#x27;s dripping wet) and I clean the ear hole/jewelry really well.</li>
            <li>Bought for a new naval piercing and was healed completely in about a month.</li>
            <li>I thought I had a badly infected dermal and after a few consist days of this product and q-tip cleansing I was able to break away any build up around the stud without irritating the area more and it&#x27;s doing great now!</li>
            <li>The only thing to be aware of is sometimes the product clogs because of its natural properties.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s the aerosol, but it comes out slightly cool which helps if the piercing feels hot.</li>
            <li>Ears healed pretty fast and no real issues.</li>
            <li>This spray helps to clean them and when they were still new and hurting, it also helped them to hurt a bit less.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t have any terrible pain during &amp; right after piercing but they were a bit tender the first couple of days but H2Ocean really works to clean, soothe &amp; heal, I plan to use it for minor cuts and I hear it&#x27;s great for minor acne as well.</li>
            <li>and I still have more than half the bottle left.</li>
            <li>not even sure if it&#x27;s still producing discharge, it seems completely healed (however, its probably not fully healed and I fully intend to continue cleaning it daily and not change jewelry for another two and a half months or so.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried some other piercing sprays but what I love about this one is how long it lasts.</li>
            <li>It was good, but since its a spray, it got a little messy</li>
            <li>I use this here and there because I kept getting nose ring infections and thought this could clear it up.</li>
            <li>I thought I was in the clear.</li>
            <li>But so far no swelling and the puss and discharge is at a bare minimum (completely normal).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my navel pierced 2 times previously and used hydrogen peroxide and rubbing alcohol to clean it.</li>
            <li>It seems to be doing the job really well, my belly button piercing looks almost completely healed on the outside.</li>
            <li>Helps clear away crusties and soothes when piercing is irritated (helps soothe my hypertrophic scarring).  </li>
            <li>My 2 month old nose piercing was bleeding and oozing after I got a Biore nose strip stuck to it.</li>
            <li>I researched a lot and figured that I shouldn&#x27;t be using an anti-bacterial near the area</li>
            <li>and the irritation has almost completely disappeared.  </li>
            <li>Salt water soaks and cleanings have been used in piercing care for longer than anyone can trace back and they really help the healing process.</li>
            <li>For the first three ear piercings I never had an issue as long as I washed with salt water every once in a while</li>
            <li>/&gt;About a year after I got my nipple pierced it start to show early signs of infection (think I changed the ring before it was fully healed)</li>
            <li>OR ELSE SPRAYING DIRECTLY</li>
            <li>I really am surprised to see all the 5-star ratings.</li>
            <li>I like to lay on my back, spray it and let my belly button fill up with it and then gently move the jewelry and swish it around while reading for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>When I pierced my ears (for both sets of holes), they were very sore for a couple weeks and kept getting crusty and gross.  </li>
            <li>I have extremly sensitive skin, but I have not had one infection while using H20cean.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t get much easier than spray several times a day.</li>
            <li>The toner cost about $3 and will last much longer.</li>
            <li>It will not likely cause anyone any sort of irritation, its extremely gentle.</li>
            <li>I got my cartilage pierced over a year ago and after about 8 months of the piercing it was starting to get really red,itchy, and sore.</li>
            <li>H2Ocean gives me the natural sea salt solution in a to go container.</li>
            <li>My piercing was really irritated and red and sea</li>
            <li>Had my nose pierced twice, both times a nose bump developed.</li>
            <li>within 24 hours my keloid had completely vanished and redness reduced.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve so far never had an infection or inflammation at all.</li>
            <li>My septum ring was really flaky and red druing healing.</li>
            <li>maybe i was just cleaning it too much or not enough</li>
            <li>I guess I must just have sensitive skin and the added things in this</li>
            <li>My nose piercing is over 5 years old, but I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>then my piercing healed completely.</li>
            <li>, I felt a loud pop and the hole almost shut conpletely and began to ooze a yellowy-liquid.</li>
            <li>is very convenient to carry in your purse/ etc, and is simple to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was such a fast delivery ...</li>
            <li>Within 3 days my ears were completely healed.</li>
            <li>About 3 cans of this will completely heal a piercing.</li>
            <li>So I headed straight back to the tattoo shop to buy another</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t change it still listening to my piercer, but the skin around the piercing is completely healed and no puss.</li>
            <li>if you use it regularly it can really relieve redness and sensitivity of the piercing</li>
            <li>I had no trouble with the product and my piercing did not get infected.</li>
            <li>It completely lost pressure so now I have to just stick a q-tip in the hole where the nozzle used to be.</li>
            <li>After recently getting my nipple pierced the antibacterial soap wasn&#x27;t doing much when it came to cleaning and preventing infection.</li>
            <li>Again, H2Ocean fixed my ear in 3-4 days.</li>
            <li>However when I received it after purchasing from Amazon, the bottle was completely sealed.</li>
            <li>As in the nozzle that is supposed to spray was completely sealed and I couldn&#x27;t even make a hole in it to get it to work.</li>
            <li>stuff really kept me going, and hopefully I&#x27;m not jinxing it by saying my cartilage is finally healed!  </li>
            <li>SO FAR</li>
            <li>I must be sensitive to an ingredient in this or something, though.</li>
            <li>Knowing that it&#x27;s natural and used for healing.</li>
            <li>gentle spray, carry it in my deep purse, and will use this from now on.</li>
            <li>Seems to work well so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product all over my face for the treatment &amp; prevention of mild-moderate adult acne.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>My 5 year old likes this on his skinned knees or &amp;#34;boo-boo&#x27;s&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Natural.</li>
            <li>It so soothing and cooled the natural inflammation that occurred with  my cartilage ear piercing.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s taking forever to heal completely n after using H2Ocean</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend it, its also much cheaper on Amazon than in stores.</li>
            <li>All natural and has natural enzymes to help with the healing process in addition to the sea salt.  </li>
            <li>Now about the product H2ocean spray, I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 days so far</li>
            <li>However, I recently developed in an infection in one of my piercings and wanted to try this product to see if it would help clear up the infection.</li>
            <li>Much easier that doing a total soak in salt water.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my 9 year old&#x27;s pierced ears, which we had done at a professional piercing place and they recommended this product.</li>
            <li>Actually, my teenage daughter uses this product and really loves it.</li>
            <li>My cartilage piercing started to sting and burn, and after a day it had completely swollen up and was covered with discharge.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, i DO NOT RECOMMEND you purchase this.</li>
            <li>This spray has even made some of my old bumbs go</li>
            <li>I got my navel pierced nearly 3 weeks ago</li>
            <li>This product does really well externally, BUT if you have jewelry that your body is rejecting, you&#x27;ll end up taking the piercing out.</li>
            <li>I completely abide by this stuff for piercings.</li>
            <li>this was delivered fast and i used it for a forward helix piercing i had gotten, because it started to form keloids, but a week later they were gone!!</li>
            <li>I liked the actual formula but the spray bottle completed stopped working after only using it a few times.</li>
            <li>I had my nose pierced for nearly four years in a shop that wasn&#x27;t the most hygienic to say the least.</li>
            <li>think the H2Ocean is a good product, but its healing abilities are questionable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use (I usually just sprayed some on a q-tip or sprayed it directly where I needed it).</li>
            <li>By this morning it is almost back to a normal size!  </li>
            <li>I used it for about 3 days and the piercing was back to normal!</li>
            <li>I have been diagnosed with a very mild psoriasis - just small patch about the size of a silver dollar.</li>
            <li>Since my helix usually gets infected easily I was in dire need of a care product that would help prevent that.</li>
            <li>and I just need to spray a little on and clean it.</li>
            <li>(I get really close to the q-tip and spray a slow stream until saturated) and then clean my nose piercing.</li>
            <li>additionally, on older piercings that were sensitive, it&#x27;s eliminated the sensitivity so I can put piercings back in them!</li>
            <li>To top it off, even when the canister feels empty and theres &#x27;nothing left&#x27;, it still goes a really long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone that has a tricky to clean ear piercing, and anyone that is having trouble getting their piercing to heal.</li>
            <li>Use it everyday to clean my nose piercing.</li>
            <li>Actually made my belly button piercing a bit more irritated than usual.</li>
            <li>Two weeks later, the third one, which I hadn&#x27;t used for years, now feels like the first 2 which I have used since I was a teen-no pain at all.</li>
            <li>About 2 days later, my ear lobes were throbbing, sore, hot, swollen and red.</li>
            <li>I sprayed this on 6 times a day for the first month, then 2 times a day for the second month, and now in the third month I use about every 2-3 days.</li>
            <li>I had a 14 inch gage in my left ear since I&#x27;m older</li>
            <li>Much more than just a plain sea salt solution!!</li>
            <li>There is a little redness right around the jewelry, but it is only visible when I unscrew the top of my navel ring; I think the redness is also due to the fact that the piercing is only 3 days old.  </li>
            <li>I only have done a sea salt soak about 3x since the piercing, and I clean it in the shower every other day with antibacterial hand soap (dial.)</li>
            <li>SOMETHING SO HIGHLY AND BUY FOR A SECOND TIME</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has any piercings new or old.</li>
            <li>I totally reccomend this to everyone with a piercing, New or old.</li>
            <li>I used this on all manners of piercings when I was younger and ordered it for my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s new ear piercings as well.</li>
            <li>this works really well as long as you use as directed (no less than 3-6 times per day)</li>
            <li>but it really goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I used this about a week ago when it showed signs of infection and after a couple of days it was back to normal.</li>
            <li>my lymph nodes are back to normal.</li>
            <li>I got an industrial in my right ear about 2 and a half months ago, and I obtained a small bottle of this and was told to use it to help my new piercing heal and stay clean.</li>
            <li>Definitely a must have for new piercings.</li>
            <li>I used this with new piercings and still use it occasionally when they&#x27;re healed.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product to anyone with a new piercing.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has new piercings.</li>
            <li>and I would definitely recomend it to anyone with a new piercing.</li>
            <li>I will update further on the new bottle.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to anyone who would like to take care of their new piercing.</li>
            <li>i would recommend this to people who recently got a new piercing .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier than mixing your own solution and trying to awkwardly soak it for 5-10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>The piercing only hurts if I accidentally role onto it in the middle of the night, and even then it doesn&#x27;t hurt too much.  </li>
            <li>After a couple days of use, using it 2-3 times a day the small infection is pretty much gone</li>
            <li>The only negative thing I have to say about the product is that It leaks from the top.</li>
            <li>have a nice full bottle, but no way to get use of it. :(</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s not refillable or reusable as any other spriting device, I&#x27;m glad it won&#x27;t wind up in the garbage when I&#x27;m done with it.ted by the metal container since it&#x27;s actually packaged in a small bag inside the can, and that the whole thing is recyclable.</li>
            <li>(ya know, in case you didn&#x27;t trust the 60-something other people that told you so ;)  )</li>
            <li>When I first pierced my cartilage, it became extremely infected and sore</li>
            <li>This product saved my piercings, after even a day there was a major improvement.</li>
            <li>Every other day, I&#x27;ll do a sea salt soak (get a Dixie cup &amp; fill it up with hot water, add some table sea salt &amp; soak the area with the piercing for a minute or two) for a month.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my low 40&#x27;s, and when I was a teen, I had my ears pierced 3 times, and have usually only used the first two piercings.</li>
            <li>My body peircings quickly healed in less than 2 months!</li>
            <li>bought this and started using it twice a day at first, then once every other or two, my piercings have cleared up,</li>
            <li>Well my ears feel fine, unless I do something silly like smack myself really hard, and they seem to already be mostly healed!</li>
            <li>But after literally only 3 days of using this stuff, it&#x27;s almost completely gone!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used this on my year old microdermals that like getting infected once in a while, my new nip piercings, as well as my stretched ears.</li>
            <li>I still HIGHLY recommend doing a saline SOAK during at least the first week of a new body piercing (nipples, bellybutton, etc.)</li>
            <li>Very little pus comes out now and then (part of the healing process) but clean it with the spray and there won&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
            <li>unfortunately, there is NONE (Trust me!), but I think it&#x27;s a great item to give a try in your daily cleansing routine.</li>
            <li>It cleans the area, makes it less crusty, and this is gross, but it gets all of the icky stuff out from the inside which is really good for healing.  </li>
            <li>When I got my belly button pierced, the piercer said to use antibacterial soap to clean it, which made the area really red, and I knew hydrogen peroxide was too harsh.</li>
            <li>I went to get them re-stretched after they tried to heal on me and the guy re-pierced them instead, right next to the other holes.</li>
            <li>I have a little irritation, but I think that&#x27;s just do to the jewelry, I am very sensitive to all kinds of metals, even pure gold&#x27;s and silvers.</li>
            <li>I recently went on a trip for a long weekend and found it very convenient.</li>
            <li>My daily routine is showering twice a day with Dial Antibacterial Body Wash, clean my piercing with H2Ocean Aftercare Spray (following with a slight water cleaning)</li>
            <li>I had tried different things to clear up my pierced ears, but nothing worked.  </li>
            <li>only used it once or twice and everything after that was clear</li>
            <li>All natural and definitely the way to go.</li>
            <li>I kept thinking that I wished I could soak it in salt water, but the risk of infection would increase, so I finally started looking specifically for a natural salt water (not saline) type cleanser.</li>
            <li>(Which i don&#x27;t get why people made such a big fuss about that, it will literally go straight back on with no problem...)</li>
            <li>been using this product for almost the entire duration of my piercings healing process so far, and it&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>By the third day, ALL signs of irritation and infection were COMPLETELY gone.</li>
            <li>Even though a simple sea salt soak would accomplish essentially the same thing, H2Ocean just makes it so much easier to apply.</li>
            <li>its still there, but hopefully in the near future it will be gone.</li>
            <li>When the piercing bump is completely gone I will only be using h2oceanspray.</li>
            <li>When I came across this product, I really didn&#x27;t mind spending a few bucks to get my ear to feel normal again.</li>
            <li>Saline Solution works better to me than this, &amp; when my belly ring got infected it seemed like it made it worse .</li>
            <li>I only gave four stars because somehow I managed to get the most annoying can with a leaky top.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of expensive</li>
            <li>After the first 36 hours, I noticed the swelling was down.</li>
            <li>By the positive reviews I figured it would help, but I never imagined it would make such a big difference in such a short amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I started using the H2Ocean spray just hours after my new microdermal anchor piercing (which is now 3 days old) and there is absolutely no redness or swelling.</li>
            <li>For months I had been trying to get rid of the bumps on the back of my cartilage piercing through various methods (aspirin, new jewelry, salt) with no avail.</li>
            <li>This is what I use to clean my industrial piercing everyday and when I ordered it I had just enough left thy should</li>
            <li>My ear no longer looks infected - no redness, no pain, the bump is gone, now has very minimal normal clear discharge and the swelling has drastically reduced.</li>
            <li>Three days after the first usage, the swelling was almost entirely gone, was no longer warm to the touch, and no longer so painful that cleaning it requires a gag and some oxycodone.</li>
            <li>&amp; I healed so much faster than I had expected to!</li>
            <li>I recommend this product for hard to clean piercings.</li>
            <li>If there is any crusting take a q-tip with a little bit of the solution and VERY gently swab around the area to remove it.</li>
            <li>I remember my piercer telling me that H2Ocean was good because it has a thing in it called Lysozymes which actually eat away at bad bacteria and infection and act like a barrier for the new piercing while it is healing.</li>
            <li>My new piercings felt hot only about a week or so, and this stuff stops the heat, excessive swelling, and pain.</li>
            <li>I have my nose pierced for 3 months now and will continue to use this at least once or twice a month to maintain a clean area.</li>
            <li>I like to clean my piercings  at least once a week.</li>
            <li>Does taste a little funny though, but gets job done.</li>
            <li>The first time, I got them pierced at Claire&#x27;s and used the little saline solution thing they gave me.  </li>
            <li>This is the exact same product for much less.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Elayne Angel&#x27;s The Piercing Bible recommended a saline solution and that really helped, but it felt wasteful to make a cup of the stuff when I only needed enough to wet a q-tip (and storing it long-term just seemed unsanitary)</li>
            <li>(I wasn&#x27;t that consistent after a few weeks).</li>
            <li>After the first few uses, the caps fell off BOTH bottles that I ordered.  </li>
            <li>I never had trouble with my first lobe piercing (got when I was 5)</li>
            <li>I began cleaning it with antibacterial soap and hot water which did help (along with antibiotics) but it dried my ear out a bit.</li>
            <li>I will buy again, good price other places its expensive.</li>
            <li>Immediately after spraying it on, I felt as if my whole ear had been cooled down.</li>
            <li>The swelling has gone down and there isn&#x27;t as much discharge.</li>
            <li>It is more expensive than plain sterile saline, but it is absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li>I used it often, the first two days, and I didn&#x27;t have less pain, but on the 3rd and 4th day, I started noticing a big difference.</li>
            <li>For me it has cleared up major swelling, major infection, and minor pain with this piercing since I got it!</li>
            <li>Doing a little soak made even the pain lessen along with healing any irritations I might have had from minor bumps to my fresh piercing.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>, there is new pink skin underneath.</li>
            <li>I usually spray it on right before bed.</li>
            <li>Other than that, highly recommend for all piercings.</li>
            <li>Your piercing will hurt less and feel as if healing much faster.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This will only help up clear minor things.</li>
            <li>that has helped IMMENSELY with calming the area down &amp; really promoting healing.</li>
            <li>I would like to write a good review for this product but when it arrived I was unable to use it because the spray nozzle was damaged and the canister was leaking every time I pushed down on the nozzle.</li>
            <li>Using this spray also soothes painful piercings when they&#x27;re still new and warm.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had several piercings over the years and never hand any heal half as fast as they do using this product.  </li>
            <li>Before I bought this I was using wound wash from CVS, and it really did the same thing for half the cost for double the solution.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use any other product for new piercings.</li>
            <li>And I used it for other new piercing I got as well.</li>
            <li>Even while using this, I still recommend washing your piercing every other day while it is new to prevent infection.</li>

            <li> I loved the product and  how it is healing my belly piercing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good stuff.  </li>
            <li> This spray does a good job at drawing out any discharge.</li>
            <li> Definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li> Loved this stuff.</li>
            <li> its a good product</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me, don&#x27;t underestimate the power of a good ol&#x27; fashioned sea salt soak and a q-tip.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard that it&#x27;s a good product, though, just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Good,</li>
            <li> My piercer said he has never had a customer with a good experience from this product.</li>
            <li> Worked as good as if you were buying it in the piercing shop</li>
            <li> I ordered this stuff as soon as I could because of all the good reviews.</li>
            <li> really good for navel piercings.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff.  </li>
            <li> my  nose piercing is feeling soooo good.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, good stuff.</li>
            <li> Ask any GOOD piercer and they will NOT recommend it.</li>
            <li> It was really good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good spray...</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this for her ears and it&#x27;s a really good product.</li>
            <li> Yes, the saline solution is good, and the method of cleaning a piercing by spraying it is convenient and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good Product.</li>
            <li> and i discovered this good stuff.</li>
            <li> I felt this was a good product for cleaning my piercings.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.</li>
            <li> but the can itself was in Good condition.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s a good sign.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really good</li>
            <li> I bought a really good 18k nose stud and a can of this stuff</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Good price too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best to spray lightly on a sterile cotton swab &amp; apply that way because the spray goes everywhere, they may want to change the dispenser.</li>
            <li> arrived on time, seems to be working good.</li>
            <li> I also loved spraying this where i had an ingrown nail to wash away from bacteria.</li>
            <li> but this is a good way to go for cleaning inbetween soakings.  </li>
            <li> This spray isn&#x27;t really good for infections though.</li>
            <li> It swelled and became infected within four days (granted I wasn&#x27;t taking good care of it</li>
            <li> This has been a really good product for taking care of my belly button piercing..</li>
            <li> I LOVED IT.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this spray.</li>
            <li> so I looked online and saw that Neosporin was a good product to use</li>
            <li> I bought this because I read really good reviews.</li>
            <li> This is the best sea salt solution i have tried, and came right on time!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great and so easy!</li>
            <li> Came in quickly and on time and my ears healed up perfectly!</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and was in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff it works great for any piercing any time and its good for an anti-bacterial for your face.</li>
            <li> I love love love this!!!</li>
            <li> all a great product on everything :)</li>
            <li> The ocean spray has kept it in top shape, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li> However, I immidiately purchased this once I was pierced from the shop because Ive heard so many great reviews on it...</li>
            <li> Great for me, because I plan on ordering some more.</li>
            <li> I knew better than to use their solution (or go there at all lol)</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with the product.  </li>
            <li> Glad for the price, lol.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and have used it before and was working great for a couple days</li>
            <li> Works great, better than alcohol, hydrogen peroxide.</li>
            <li> the spray and that you use it more than once over trying to keep a shot glass on your neck works great</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to receive my order in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li> Made me so much more comfortable during the healing process!!!</li>
            <li> It feels very refreshing and your piercing will love it!</li>

            <li> This product is completely amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing with healing piercings.</li>
            <li> I had seen all of the amazing reviews claiming how it has \\&quot;healed their infection\\</li>
            <li> This product worked amazing for me.</li>
            <li> Amazing spray!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus It&#x27;s a lot easier then making your own sea salt soaks too.  </li>
            <li> it now the came color as my skin amd healing so nicely.</li>
            <li> Works well, but warm water from the sink and some $1.50 salt from Walmart works just as well.</li>
            <li> so I was thrilled when this arrived in the mail.</li>
            <li> Instead of making your own sea-salt mix and then applying it with cotton swabs or</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone with any kind of body piercing.</li>
            <li> Could I make my own substitute?</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really the best to use.</li>
            <li> and you know won&#x27;t do your warm seat salt soaks,</li>
            <li> and I believe it is making my piercing heal fast and great!</li>
            <li> Even though the instructions say use it from 3-6 times a day I still use my salt water mixture for my septum piercing, but this is nice for when I&#x27;m in a rush in the morning</li>
            <li> I was told to do warm salt water soaks 3 times a day...</li>
            <li> With that kind of investment, I needed to ensure that this piercing would keep.</li>
            <li> Then I happened upon H2Ocean&#x27;s Aftercare Spray; read great reviews on it from multiple sites, found the best price here on Amazon, and bought it.</li>
            <li> No discomfort, no swelling, no oozing of any kind.</li>
            <li> help alot with my piercing and would tell any one that have piercing you must have this bottle in handy.</li>
            <li> You will save a lot of money by just making your own sea salt solution.</li>
            <li> So problems of any kind</li>
            <li> I like to make my own salt water solutions</li>
            <li> Thanks for an awesome product!</li>
            <li> I have a triple forward helix, and trying to mix up my own sea salt solution and get it on my piercings without giving myself swimmer&#x27;s ear was a PAIN.</li>
            <li> All you have to do to make your own H2Ocean is heat up 8 oz. of water in your microwave and then stir in 1/4 tsp of sea salt.</li>
            <li> I soaked my ears in warm salt water once a day and then sprayed this throughout the day</li>
            <li> I also used this to make an aspirin paste which I placed on my nice every night.</li>
            <li> Yes you can make your own saltwater and put it in a spray bottle, but it is not sterile.</li>
            <li> Before I bought this spray, I cleaned my ear piercings with warm water &amp; sea salt.</li>
            <li> Save your money &amp; just make your own cleaning solution.</li>
            <li> After getting pierced, the piercer offered me H2Ocean or said that I could just do my own sea salt soaks.  </li>
            <li> and I was making my own salt water solution.</li>
            <li> Helped when I pierced my own ears.</li>
            <li> I have heard so many good things about this product</li>
            <li> and it also contains Lysozyme which is effective in healing.</li>
            <li> warm compresses</li>
            <li> it was healing nicely and then just started deteriorating.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s one of those products i like to keep handy in my bathroom medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> so spend the money clown! lmao</li>
            <li> I like to use it after a nice shower.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re piercing gets infected, you should be soaking it in warm salt water, which you should mix yourself using salt and distilled water.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my rook piecing and it seems to be healing quite nicely.</li>

            <li> I started going to a professional piercing place for my navel and lip piercing, and my piercer states that this is the best product on the market.</li>
            <li> H2Ocean is by far the best product for tats and piercings.  </li>
            <li> the price on here was good with free ship.</li>
            <li> This product works ok but honestly, it is WAY overpriced.</li>
            <li> I recommended this stuff to my brother who is very experienced with piercings, and he&#x27;s surprised at how well this works.</li>
            <li> Other than that, works great and is very nice!</li>
            <li> I heard this stuff was great for fresh piercings.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s also much more effective.  </li>
            <li> Nice to be able to just squirt this on it.</li>
            <li> This product is the best thing i have tried so far for my belly peircing.</li>
            <li> Better than making my own sea salt soaks.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this on my 4-week old rook piercing in conjunction with Provon soap and it works wonders.</li>
            <li> so far, everything works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff because a friend recommended it to me and it cleared up my infection very quickly!</li>
            <li> So easy with the spray as well!</li>
            <li> I received it quickly, everything was like it should be, and it done an amazing job!</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the best for cleaning belly piercings for sure, even helps clear up infected ones!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to use this because I read really good reviews on it  </li>
            <li> I was excited to get this because of all the good reviews, but it did not work for my belly piercing.</li>
            <li> soak a q tip in it and then clean my barbells then spray each side of each piercing for good measure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and i took good care to clean it with the cleaning solution from the piercer but</li>
            <li> It has a really good &#x27;clean&#x27; feel to it.</li>
            <li> H2Ocean is a great product; it helped my piercing heal very fast.</li>
            <li> This was great when I first got it but without dropping it or anything the nozzle just stopped working, I don&#x27;t know why.</li>
            <li> I still do the hot sea salt soaks, but this is a great supplement if you are in a hurry.</li>
            <li> The first 2 days the piercings felt great,</li>
            <li> From the first use it worked great on my nose piercing,  </li>
            <li> The piercings are healing beautifully and much faster than they would be otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> really great for quick cleaning and easy to use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use compared to making your own sea salt mixture yourself.</li>
            <li> Although I can make my own, it is easy to just spray some on a q-tip</li>
            <li> all it needs is a quick spray and your good.</li>
            <li> Timely shipping, free shipping, quality product, what more can you ask?!</li>
            <li> Have bought this many times and will forever be a loyal fan!!</li>
            <li> It cleared up the persistent lymph on an older piercing and has helped my freshest piercing heal beautifully from day one.</li>
            <li> This soothing and healing spray works great for new body piercings,and any residual soreness after changing out a piercing!!</li>
            <li> They were prompt, pleasant and courteous and sent me a brand new can without charge!</li>
            <li> Glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to make sure my piercings that I got were</li>
            <li> Love both and wouldrecommend either/both to others with piercings.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well on its way to a healthy healing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This spray is awesome, but is not a substitute for antibiotics or medical treatment if your piercing is severely infected</li>
            <li> Many people will say this is just a \\&quot;glorified salt water spray,\\&quot; and the truth is...</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been the most agonizing one I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> JUST MAKE SURE</li>
            <li> ON THE PIERCING WILL HAVE YOU WASTING MOST OF IT.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and will always use it for all my piercings.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> In my opinion it has healed my piercings better and faster.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> so I still have much more healing time to deal with, and I will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> I got my naval pierced and it healed okay with the sea salt soaks.</li>
            <li> After I researched it and found a safe place, I decided to do it.</li>
            <li> Just spray and go :).</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I love H2Ocean.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> it works well for sore throats and stuffy noses too! :)</li>
            <li> All in all my favorite</li>
            <li> After a week, my piercing started to look better</li>
            <li> :) I know its just a spray can of H20 and salt</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll need more bottles of this stuff, I pair this with sea salt soaks</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> im not so sure about that.</li>
            <li> But im still satisfied with it...</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think there is anything better.</li>
            <li> You should also check why so many of us gave 1 star.</li>
            <li> Noticed my piercings getting better within days of using this.</li>
            <li> For me it has done a better job helping heal nipple piercings than salt water soaks and washing with Provon.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you follow all the steps to healing a piercing not just using a cleaner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only thing I use for my nose piercing and it works great!</li>
            <li> The seller sent me all the directions and more.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I love this product and would recommend to everyone I know</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It was recommended to me by my piercer and I&#x27;m glad I went with it.</li>
            <li> I got a monroe, and this is way more convenient than mixing up batches of salt water and dabbing on a piercing.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure doctors/piercers would say NOT to do that, but I did anyway.</li>
            <li> Big bottle is great value!!</li>
            <li> IT MAKES MY NIPPLE PIERCINGS FEEL SO MUCH BETTER.</li>
            <li> I love this product and recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Got to get more already.</li>
            <li> I love love love the H2Ocean spray.</li>
            <li> I got my most pierced almost three weeks</li>
            <li> I have several piercings and this is the best aftercare I have ever found.</li>
            <li> Ships fast and works great.</li>
            <li> My piercing has improved, thats for sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on both my piercings, but since my ear is a lot more finicky</li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s more sanitary.</li>
            <li> There are alternatives, but I have been using this product for many many years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it before and it cleans better than anything.</li>
            <li> so i thought it would be okay to order again</li>
            <li> Once I stopped using this stuff, my ear looked and felt a million times better.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> But this works much better than either of those.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am really glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic.</li>
            <li> This one was a much better bargain.</li>
            <li> But it made me feel better to have something beside just &#x27;Water and soup&#x27;</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> but u recently got my nipples pierced and the pierced suggested this product and my piercings have been healing wonderfully!</li>
            <li> I used it for more  </li>
            <li> but I have been so satisfied I was compelled to write one.</li>
            <li> As soon as I stopped using this product, I was better off.</li>
            <li> is like magic within about 3 days after using it my piercing didn&#x27;t hurt</li>
            <li> Great spray, I highly recommend it !</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> it works great for all peircings , I recommend getting a 4oz bottle though because you go through it relatively fast.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t love this product anymore.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> I love H2Ocean</li>
            <li> I love it though and just think I got unlucky.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff</li>
            <li> It was ok.</li>
            <li> The saline solution that I was making myself was more soothing than this.</li>
            <li> The top did not work to spray</li>
            <li> I WILL BUY MORE FROM THESE GUYS</li>
            <li> I love that it can be sprayed on so you don&#x27;t have to do the dreaded, time-consuming salt soaks.</li>
            <li> I WISH TGE BOTTLES CAME WITH MORE.</li>
            <li> left Works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> Great product thanks.</li>
            <li> So after reading many of the reviews I was sold.</li>
            <li> Glad I took the recommendations of people online; this product has helped my ears heal after TWO YEARS of troublesome piercings.</li>
            <li> I had an irritated piercing, and after using this, my belly was better in 2 days.</li>
            <li> I have ordered 2 more cans from here for backups.</li>
            <li> Okay, it&#x27;s been 5 weeks since I had the cartilage pierced.</li>
            <li> I love H2Ocean Salt Water Spray and always have a bottle on hand, just in case.</li>
            <li> After 24 hours with H2Ocean, my ear is so much better.</li>
            <li> the spray made me feel more assured that my piercing would heal better/safely.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s refreshing and doesn&#x27;t sting</li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s pressurized.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too sure about it</li>
            <li> I love this stuff</li>
            <li> In my opinion it helps speed up the healing process, but I&#x27;m sure it differs from person to person of course.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t make my belly button piercing any better.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I am 100% satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I also love this product.</li>
            <li> More pricey but ey, this product which is salt water based makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Thinking about ordering more.</li>
            <li> But i used this once just now and they are feeling so much better.</li>
            <li> Nothing fishy here :)</li>
            <li> going to check that out for sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used H2Ocean to heal most of my piercings and I love it.</li>
            <li> love the product&lt;br /&gt;came</li>
            <li> I had more of the product in the can</li>
            <li> With some creative help on YouTube, I was able to get it to work.</li>
            <li> it felt fantastic!</li>
            <li> It feels refreshing</li>
            <li> It better not happen again.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this product and recommend it to anyone for piercing aftercare.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> and I wish I had been able to use it like I wanted to.</li>
            <li> But that wasn&#x27;t till 3 days after the latest day</li>
            <li> A more targeted delivery system would be preferred.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> but it is getting much more better</li>
            <li> After 2 months I started noticing two bubbles one on the top inside &amp; one at the bottom.</li>
            <li> I want to remove my piercing if it didn&#x27;t get better.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this for the duration of my healing process :)</li>
            <li> At most, it sort of dribbles out a drop at a time.</li>
            <li> My piercings feel much better :)</li>
            <li> Love using h2ocean, just got two piercing in my ear.</li>
            <li> Much better.</li>
            <li> I bought some of this stuff, after seeing many reviews stating it was the &#x27;miracle spray for piercings&#x27;.</li>
            <li> absolutely LOVE it.</li>
            <li> love the product&lt;br /&gt;fast</li>
            <li> Love this spray.  </li>
            <li> Love that I am not getting added bacteria touch my ear.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this aftercare spray.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to combat several infections with this product, and would recommend it to anyone looking for an awesome piercing aftercare solution.</li>
            <li> But the piercing that healed the best was my most recently upper ear, and I chalk it up to this product.</li>
            <li> I also took a piece of cotton and rolled it around the top of my piercing</li>
            <li> I have the top of my cartilage pierced</li>
            <li> Worked great on my neck piercing it really helped it heal faster.</li>
            <li> Totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> This stuff has been magic for my nose.  </li>
            <li> totally satisfied :)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff</li>
            <li> I love it  </li>
            <li> If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re most concerned about, or maybe even just convenience, give this stuff a shot. :)</li>
            <li> Its recommended my many of my piercing artists and when used with antimicrobial sope it keeps away infection.</li>
            <li> Use 5-6 times a day :)</li>
            <li> Would have gotten more stars if you get more product for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve ran out of this within a month, I have been using regular contact saline &amp; its wonderful!!  </li>
            <li> This is actually the best aftercare I have ever tried!</li>
            <li> I love it ...</li>
            <li> I love this spray.</li>
            <li> What I notice most is my year-old tragus piercing keeps getting what I assume to be a keloid inside my ear</li>
            <li> Am glad I did</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite refreshing to the skin and keeps crud away.</li>
            <li> Works way better than just mixing salt in saline solution.</li>
            <li> I have many piercings.</li>
            <li> They felt SO much better</li>
            <li> I began using H2Ocean more often instead of the soap</li>
            <li> and walmart was able to exchange without a problem.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s better to &amp;#34;bother&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> &quot; I was very excited to see this and decided to go for it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice efficient way to ensure your piercing stays clean.</li>
            <li> Anyone can make there own saline solution, but when you need your daughter to clean her piercing, this works.</li>
            <li> It helps the healing process and keeps everything nice and clean.</li>
            <li> Get a gallon of distilled water and a clean up, pour it into said cup, add seasalt and put in the microwave until warm then place over your piercing.</li>
            <li> it keeps everything nice and clean and infection-free while also helping with pain/throbbing and allowing my holes to adjust.</li>
            <li> &quot; I did some reading up of my own and found h2ocean, I live in the UK so shipping was fairly pricey</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, very soothing and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I digress, this spray is great to travel with in between soaks and washes, easy to carry in your purse, very sanitary as it stays in the can.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s works pretty good.</li>
            <li> I have used H2Ocean on all my piercings based on the recommendation of my piercer and I must say this stuff is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, super effective, an overall great purchase!  </li>
            <li> So I ordered the large size and it really soothes &amp; cleans the areas wonderfully!</li>
            <li> Still, it works great and helps ease and speed up the healing process for newly pierced areas.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just saline, but works great to help heal new piercings.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also using it on a new nose piercing, which is healing great with no discomfort whatsoever.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for cleaning a new piercing and for cleaning when you change your jewelry.</li>
            <li> This is a great cleaning product for my new piercings.  </li>
            <li> Found out about product from tattoo artist and used for a new piercing, in which it worked great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much more efficient and easy to use.</li>
            <li> With this product, the spray has a concentrated spray that is effective in cleansing the piercing area with an adequate amount of solution.</li>
            <li> The coldness may not feel as nice as the warm soak, but it&#x27;s so much easier to do</li>
            <li> Keep the piercing feeling clean through recovery!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see myself ever needing something else to clean my piercings, wish I could give this 10 stars!</li>
            <li> but it aslo treats many other things like ravor burn and acne kudoos to h2ocean for your amazing product!!!!</li>
            <li> I was running low on the product anyways, so I reordered, but despite my best efforts to keep the piercing/area clean, my ear stayed infected for over a month.</li>
            <li> /crusty&#x27;s and keeping piercing&#x27;s clean and healthy :-)</li>
            <li> This is a great product I always use it for all my piercings I have 22 and this stuff healed them all and fast too I also use it to clean my piercings</li>
            <li> It has kept his pierced area clean and healthy &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> If you need to keep a piercing clean or get some extra gunk off at the end of the day, this is one of the best products to use.</li>
            <li> Spray even with a nice fine mist and feels full.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, which says something about this amazing product.</li>
            <li> If they work anywhere near as well as this product I will be a happy camper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not about to spend $11 every 3 weeks on something that really didn&#x27;t seem to do too much good anyway.</li>
            <li> Good product; goes fast.</li>
            <li> It leaves the piercing feeling nice, and fresh.</li>
            <li> Good price and fast delievery</li>
            <li> After the first bottle I ended up buying 2 more bottles because it worked so well!</li>
            <li> Best part, as other reviews have expressed, is that you can literally just spray and go.</li>
            <li> but it just feels refreshing and clean.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle and effective. :)</li>

            <li> make&#x27;s it easy to put in now nipple rings</li>
            <li> I travel a lot and sometimes soaking my piercings isn&#x27;t  so easy when you are on the go.</li>
            <li> This should really be called Magical Mist or something because it&#x27;s truly amazing.</li>
            <li> Very quick delivery, it was here faster</li>
            <li> Easy.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it unless your piercing is easy to spray, though.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I found it for such a great price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Well after i would clean them, i wouldnt be able to move them at all without pain around the hole.</li>

            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-cleaned away debris easily and thoroughly</li>
            <li> my order had came very quickly without any problems</li>
            <li> of course, it&#x27;d not as good as an actual, warm sea salt soak.</li>

            <li> , I believe everything is healing just fine</li>
            <li> My ear was fine with using H2ocean for about two months before it got infected.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I could tell it was healed fine on the inside, but the area around the piercing was still red/irritated</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and worked on my piercing just fine.</li>
            <li> Within a week, it was fine.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s also pretty effective for light infections.</li>

            <li> I love this stuff so much!</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this for my belly ring and then started to use this for my tragus</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty pleased</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve used this on all 7 of my piercings as well as my stretched eats and they&#x27;ve been doing great.</li>
            <li> I was so excited</li>
            <li> It does a great job of cooling and soothing freshly stretched lobes.</li>
            <li> Love this so much!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li> exactly what i was looking for .. heals piercings like magic</li>
            <li> I got this stuff originally from the shop where I got my triple helix done, but when I ran out I wanted to have something to clean up makeup from the area.</li>
            <li> By day 4 my right nipple is becoming increasingly sore.</li>
            <li> I use it to help clean my navel piercing.</li>
            <li> So I started using H2O to keep it clean and help it fully heal.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m using this to clean it because I don&#x27;t want another ear infection.</li>
            <li> It keeps it clean though.</li>
            <li> I use it for a week after I change my jewelry to keep it clean and avoid any irritation switching the jewelry out</li>
            <li> I had my cartilage pierced about 8 months ago, and the lady who pierced my ear recommended that I purchase H2ocean to clean my ear.</li>
            <li> The scabbing is all gone and it feels clean and well-moisturized.  </li>
            <li> Keeps your piercings clean.</li>
            <li> I got my belly button pierced a couple of months ago and this product keeps it clean, even after a sweaty exercise.</li>
            <li> It sped up the healing process and kept the pierced area clean.</li>
            <li> A bit more time consuming, but much better for people like me with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> After one month, I just clean 3 times a day with H2ocean.</li>
            <li> THEN WIPE THEM CLEAN WITH A QTIP</li>
            <li> This is convenient in the sense that I don&#x27;t have to whip out a cotton pad or a q tip to clean my ear</li>
            <li> Use it every day to clean my piercing.</li>
            <li> After a week or two, my piercing was clean, and i didnt have to worry about infection.</li>
            <li> I bought this just to help keep the area clean.  </li>
            <li> Now I just clean my piercing twice a day with the spray.</li>
            <li> If you had to pop that pimple, then you have to clean it afterward.</li>
            <li> I got this to help keep my bellybutton ring clean during the day when I couldn&#x27;t do salt water soaks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the H2Ocean and it&#x27;s helped to clean and soothe the piercings without drying them out.</li>
            <li> and ive just used a sea salt and water mixture to clean them.</li>
            <li> Kept them clean.</li>
            <li> I was told to do this by my friends who also have their navels pierced and used those products to keep it clean.</li>
            <li> I KNOW this product will keep my piercing clean and will help it heal correctly.  </li>
            <li> I just got my septum pierced, so I spray it on a cotton swab and clean my piercing that way.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this for cleaning her piercings and it keeps her clean and helps with the healing process.</li>
            <li> so I looked up ways to clean my piercing</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and at a decent price.</li>
            <li> After reading how many positive reviews there were, I just had to give it a shot as I was just going to let my helix close and get it re-pierced.</li>
            <li> This is by far the most easy and efficient piercing care product available anywhere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I took care of the would before scar tissue could appear--I have seen people with large keloids or hypertrophic scars on their noses from trauma along the nose stud that didn&#x27;t heal correctly.</li>
            <li> I felt a difference right away from this to the gel that I was given by the piercing place!</li>
            <li> I was using a saline solution to clean my nose piercing and it got really infected (I guess working as a bartender and forgetting you have it in then touching your nose doesn&#x27;t help).</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who wants to keep there piercings clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> It really works well, but I don&#x27;t like the sprayer top; its like a mist spray I have a nostril piercing, and I use q-tips to clean it.</li>
            <li> Since money is kind of tight, I decided to go the cheap route and do my own soaks.  </li>
            <li> I certainly recommend this for anyone who has got fresh piercings, it&#x27;s so easy to use!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for new piercings and anything else you want to clean out naturally.</li>
            <li> Just to be safe, when I got my nipples pierced, I made my own mixture of dead sea salt and water, soaked a rag and kept them on my nips (cheaper route but the spray is more convenient).</li>
            <li> I Love this , really helps ..</li>
            <li> Last time I bought this product, it was good.</li>
            <li> Could always make your our mixture, but this is good if you don&#x27;t have enough time to or need it for piercings you can&#x27;t soak with a shotglass</li>
            <li> I really would love to say it helped my ear</li>
            <li> The bottle is completely full and there&#x27;s no way to get it to spray.</li>
            <li> To buy something you can never only look at how good it is and those 5 star comments.</li>
            <li> A very practical item, glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> many thanks</li>
            <li> Its still full but nothing will come out.</li>
            <li> I got a full body wax</li>
            <li> Love it, works very well helps with healing process</li>
            <li> Salt and water works a million times better and is much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Its soothing and cool to the skin.  </li>
            <li> When they have their bogo 50% off sale, it equals out to about the same price, so either way is good.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re wondering how much you&#x27;re going to have to buy, I&#x27;ve found that thorough cleaning for 3 weeks has taken most of the 4 oz bottle.  </li>
            <li> We have used H2ocean for over 10 years with the same good healing results every time.</li>
            <li> Love this product, came really fast</li>
            <li> Its reallly good, i would like a bigger spray</li>
            <li> I love this product it made my healing process so much faster</li>
            <li> It is a great product if you have pain and redness near your new piercing.</li>
            <li> what have you (and in the process not being very sterile), all you have to do is pop off the top and spray and you&#x27;re guaranteed a quick sterile cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After coming here, to Amazon, I quickly found out it had several good reviews.</li>
            <li> All the reviews I read make it sound like it worked right away and would get rid of the bump around the hole.</li>
            <li> and I tend to get hot and sweaty easily.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this if you have new piercings, or just want a good product to clean your piercings with.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> I am currently using this spray to help clean and heal my earlobe piercings and navel piercing and so far so good!</li>
            <li> i love this product and would definitely order a lot more , i love piercings and this will help clean new piercings and reduce the pain in pierced area , this work for me</li>
            <li> or on my body if i want to clean a freshly scratched scab.</li>
            <li> and i still use it to keep area feeling clean and fresh</li>
            <li> My tragus piercing got super irritated and inflamed 2 weeks after having it done.</li>
            <li> Nothing healed my nose as quickly as this; it even heals keloids rather quickly.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this from hot topic (but Amazon is probably cheaper) but this stuff is amazing!</li>

            <li> I love the H2Ocean spray, hence the 5 stars, but the particular 4oz</li>
            <li> It soothes and treats any mild irritation or infection.</li>
            <li> Definetly recommend my navel piercing healed quickly 😃</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best on the market and to save you some hard earned cash the smart thing to do if you know your surly going for a piercing I would purchase this product in advanced</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone with a new piercing or infected piercing because it&#x27;s so easy to use and SUPER sterile!</li>
            <li> I have had little to no crusties to clean and it looks great.</li>
            <li> Now my belly button piercing finally it healed fine!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a smoker, and generally it takes longer for any piercing/wound to heal, but with this it&#x27;s doing amazingly well.</li>
            <li> My piercings have healed very fast after using this!</li>
            <li> It took about 2 days for my ear to become swollen, purple, producing puss, and very hot.</li>
            <li> So I am very pleased with the actual spray..</li>
            <li> But overall, i am VERY pleased with H2Ocean Piercing Spray.</li>
            <li> But it is also available at Hot Topic.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Really helps to keep them clean and infection free.</li>
            <li> It is easy and fast to apply, soaks in quick and does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I love to use this for my newly pierced tragus&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Also, there were no &amp;#34;crusties&amp;#34; around the barbells like most new piercings create.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this and would recommend to anyone with new piercings.</li>
            <li> I used to live in Miami and nothing healed a wound or even a piercing better than running into the ocean, so we shall see.</li>
            <li> Strongly recommended for belly button piercings because it is much easier to use compared to the salt water mixture in a cup.  </li>
            <li> I also do regular cleanse soaks, but this is perfect for cleaning it in rushed mornings, or tiering nights after a long day.</li>
            <li> Fast, easy piercing care that I can carry around with me.</li>
            <li> Makes it so much easier to keep my piercings clean, it doesn&#x27;t hurt and I really do think it makes them heal better.</li>
            <li> so I can clean during the day because my rook is still pretty new and needs to be cleaned more than once</li>
            <li> Thanks for nothing !!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I ran out of the saline wound wash that I originally bought from my piercer when I first got my conch pierced.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice anything significant at first.</li>
            <li> And these are results after the first day!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Plus at hot topic these are $20 so definately recommended!</li>
            <li> But I did as instructed, and cleaned them 4 times a day with this spray and by the second day they were so much better!</li>
            <li> And I must say this really worked!!</li>
            <li> The spray was easy to use and it helped my fresh piercing heal much faster.</li>
            <li> This is an absolute must have for fresh piercings and the shipment was very quick.</li>
            <li> I am so happy because it came right after I emptied out the other can!</li>
            <li> After getting my forward helix pierced and being instructed to clean it twice a day with hot water and salt (salt wash)</li>
            <li> This is awesome...had an industrial piercing and this has really helped to heal it up quickly !</li>
            <li> and i still currently use it, i have very sensitive skin and have had great success with this product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for cleaning little cuts and scrapes.</li>
            <li> I experienced just when moving the piercing a little bit ---</li>
            <li> H2ocean may be good initially, since the piercing is usually sensitive, but I wasn&#x27;t really interested in spending $10 every two months to keep my piercing clean!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to say this will cure it, but I have seen a significant positive difference in how it looks.</li>
            <li> After reading all of the positive reviews I was excited to try this product.</li>
            <li> There really wasn&#x27;t an area of skin that was bump free.</li>
            <li> and wow it made a huge difference!</li>
            <li> recommend this to everyone with fresh piercings.&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>
            <li> /smelling fresh.</li>
            <li> and  now I use it just for the fun of it.</li>
            <li> He told me just to keep soaking it with my sea salt mixed with warm water.  </li>
            <li> Laugh at them.  </li>
            <li> While waiting for this to arrive, I was soaking my ear in sea salt and that helped, but this method is not nearly as messy and works much better for the pain and inflammation.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth 5 stars.</li>
            <li> At most of the professional piercing shops I&#x27;ve been pierced at, this product is always just included with the price of the piercing.</li>
            <li> only thing I really liked about H2Ocean was the convenience of the spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick to Provon.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s completely healed and better than ever.</li>
            <li> I credit this spray for having none of my piercings getting infected so far despite working at a restaurant. :)</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to everyone with fresh piercings</li>
            <li> when you&#x27;re at the stage where you still need to do warm seat salt soaks bit you keep &amp;#34;forgetting&amp;#34; because the newness of your piercing is gone and you&#x27;re over it, or just for regular cleaning.</li>
            <li> This stuff is totally worth getting if you&#x27;ve got any healing issues.</li>
            <li> My tragus piercing is a year old and still hasn&#x27;t fully healed, but I&#x27;ve been using this product on it for about three months and it looks and feels better every day.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth buying the 2 bottle pack</li>
            <li> Much better off with tea tree oil which is a natural antiseptic.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to clear your piercing when you recently got it or for preventive maintenance.</li>
            <li> Never be reckless with a fresh piercing just because it seems fine)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would say it is worth it if you have a piercing that&#x27;s bothering you, but be warned you may get a bottle that leaks.</li>
            <li> (my daughter would swear by it) and I find it&#x27;s a product worth paying for.</li>
            <li> I just wish it was available in a bigger size.... and u won&#x27;t be able to tell wen</li>
            <li> Later, I got it redone and used Blarex Wound Wash Saline on it, which did heal it quite nicely, but it took longer</li>
            <li> I used it along with regular seasalt soaks in a cup of warm water.</li>
            <li> IT WAS WORTH EVERY CENT.  </li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews, I decided to get this because everyone said it was worth the hype.</li>
            <li> but I think it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> The 4 oz can lasts me about a month&#x27;s worth of use.  </li>
            <li> can I received got a &amp;#34;rattle&amp;#34; in the can after about a weeks worth of use.  </li>
            <li> It is worth the price for me.</li>
            <li> make sure to use a decent moisturizer after each use, as the salt has a potential to be drying, but otherwise I find it to be very gently and pretty effective.</li>
            <li> Perfect for times you&#x27;re too lazy to make a warm salt soak from scratch, which means less skipping out on morning cleans or</li>
            <li> First, let me say this is NOT a bad product, it just wasn&#x27;t right for ME.  </li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> It came to me within 3-5 business days which was pretty quick.</li>
            <li> My nose healed super fast with this!</li>
            <li> It certainly helped keep the piercing clean</li>
            <li> but it certainly helped clean it and soothe any irritation.</li>
            <li> My belly button ring got infected and this product cleared it right up, like literally in a day.</li>
            <li> and it took the redness right away</li>
            <li> I had one can get &amp;#34;gummed&amp;#34; up from salt deposits in the nozzle, but I called H2Ocean and they sent me a replacement right away.</li>
            <li> If your piercing isn&#x27;t healed right after using this for awhile, the piercing wasn&#x27;t pierced correctly.</li>
            <li> healed it right up.</li>
            <li> I used this right after I got my industrial piercing done</li>
            <li> I got my nose pierced a while ago, and it got infected right away.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Vet said to keep using it and it healed her right up in two weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll tell you right now</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> It cleans any crust you may have right off.</li>
            <li> I got an industrial done about two months ago and right after the piercing session, my ear was burning.</li>
            <li> in my right ear to match.</li>
            <li> This stuff worked well right off the bat by reducing pain and redness.</li>
            <li> It did not, however, stop the infection in my right one which eventually led to me taking them out.</li>
            <li> I looked online and tried all these home remedies of sea salt and water, but I never seemed to get the proportions right.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this on amazon and got it in the mail right away.</li>
            <li> Now I didn&#x27;t notice much right away like everyone else</li>
            <li> It clears the redness and itching right away.</li>
            <li> This makes things so much easier when having to clean my piercing.</li>
            <li> This makes my piercing feel clean and is helping it heal much faster.</li>
            <li> Now that the whole infectious ordeal is over, I just use it to keep them clean.</li>
            <li> Use with Q-tips to gently and safely clean any deposits on jewelry.  </li>
            <li> I have learned to not move the piercing and just clean gently around it.</li>
            <li> So much easier to keep a piercing clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only ever used this (and recomended hand soaps) to clean any of my piercings and this keeps them very clean.</li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t have all the properties of a good old hot sea salt soak, which breaks down the crusts and opens the capillaries, thus allowing a better oxygenation (and a faster healing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Great for the lazy at heart.</li>
            <li> my ear was perfectly normal and pain free.</li>
            <li> It is the only thing I have found that is easy to use and cleans my piercings well!</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a little bigger but Great!</li>
            <li> i had to contact the manufacturer and thank god they sent me a new one for free.</li>
            <li> I got the product super fast</li>
            <li> It also shipped super fast to me.</li>
            <li> Prior to purchasing this product, I have heard lots about how great it was but had already bought a generic saline spray from the place that I got pierced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A few days in and pus was gone, and a week or two later they were perfectly healed.</li>
            <li> They quickly got very infected.  </li>
            <li> About two days after I&#x27;d accidentally got my nose stud caught on the fibers of a washcloth (while washing my face) a HUGE bump developed right beside the piercing.</li>
            <li> Very soothing and worth the price right after a piercing.</li>
            <li> about 8 months very much is used.</li>
            <li> Pierce this 2 has a very reasonable price, and does not charge a fortune for shipping, so</li>
            <li> This spray is super easy to use, I just spray a little on a cotton swab, and just clean around the stud before bed and in the morning, and then I&#x27;m done!</li>
            <li> Every time I get a new piecing I make sure to be stocked up on h2ocean this stuff makes the healing process so much more comfortable and fast with little to no compilations</li>
            <li> I also put a little tea tree oil on my piercings for good measure.</li>
            <li> A little squirt three times a day feels good and encourages healing.</li>
            <li> leaks a little but over all good.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stress enough how important it is to keep your piercings clean</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and cooling and works well to keep my piercing clean without using any harsh cleaners.</li>
            <li> The seller shipped the product in very fast - much faster than Amazon!</li>
            <li> It does not burn or sting, but keeps new piercings clean and soothed.</li>
            <li> A staple for any new piercing or just keeping existing piercings clean.</li>
            <li> I use this to clean my new septum piercing about 2-3 times a day.</li>
            <li> If you have a new piercing I recommend buying this to clean them.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I&#x27;m only bummed this wasn&#x27;t around 17 years ago when I started getting piercings.</li>
            <li> Got item pretty fast!</li>
            <li> I pierced my cartilage, and it was healing well at first.</li>
            <li> It makes a difference in a matter of a day or two is all, and if your piercing beings to show signs of infection, you simply need to spray it a couple times before it looks okay again.</li>
            <li> ESPECIALLY if your piercing is supposed to take more than two months to heal (otherwise, buy the smaller version, because you probably won&#x27;t need any more).  </li>
            <li> When I first ordered this product I bought it exactly from the Company, not from Amazon and it never gave me any problem whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got it for such a cheaper price than in store</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!!</li>
            <li> if I don&#x27;t have time to wash my piercing before my first class of the morning.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t feel like it was cleaning it well enough, but its ok for any piercing care</li>
            <li> I Plan to get more future piercings</li>
            <li> When I first got my piercings I followed my piercers directions to the T.</li>
            <li> This spray really helped belly button piercing when it was fresh.</li>
            <li> nozzle broke the first time I tried to use it</li>
            <li> I was really upset!</li>
            <li> It would not spray after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> After going to my piercer and asking for advice, which was \\&quot;use Tea Tree Oil and hot salty water\\</li>
            <li> My first time purchasing this</li>
            <li> Came on time fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I bought H2Ocean from Hot Topic the day after I got my navel piercing</li>
            <li> Bought this as an aftercare product for my first time getting my ears pierced.</li>
            <li> Yes, it works better IMO than regular sea salt rinses.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Like many people, I had a gross bump on my piercing that just wouldn&#x27;t go away...</li>
            <li> I knew it was straight to the h2ocean I go!</li>
            <li> Used the first (1.5 oz) bottle from the piercing parlor before I was totally healed, within 2 days I knew I had to get more.</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re consistent and patient it&#x27;ll work for you.</li>
            <li> This was my first  not counting</li>
            <li> Went to use it for the first time and the sprayer was defective/stuck.  </li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t end up being charged a bomb at your local piercer shop. :-)</li>
            <li> and I wish had got this stuff when I first got them pierced.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST stuff to use when trying to heal a piercing, and its usually fairly expensive.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> The spray cap stopped working after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Sea salt soaks worked the first time around</li>
            <li> After one day of using this product, the bumps are significantly reduced and the redness is nearly nonexistent!</li>
            <li> I got a third hole pierced in my ears at a reputable pavilion in a nearby mall.</li>
            <li> This made my ear a lot more irritated and I only used it twice a day.</li>
            <li> This is difficult to find at a piercing store, and to find the 4oz can, so ordering online is the best way to purchase.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does exactly as it says: It cleans the piercing &amp; the jewelry &amp; dissolves crusted lymph fluid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first time they never had an issue.</li>
            <li> :) I would recommend it for anyone with piercings, ears, nose, lip, and especially belly!</li>
            <li> After the first use my ear became swollen.  </li>
            <li> Worked really well on my piercing!</li>
            <li> I really needed this stuff for my industrial piercing!</li>
            <li> Works pretty well.</li>
            <li> It really helps in the healing process a lot faster!</li>
            <li> I was interested in it and read some reviews.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re always sore when I wake up first thing anyway.</li>
            <li> H2Ocean works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Really works!</li>
            <li> I like using this product in between salt water soaks--however, I find that when use the spray 3-4x a day and do the salt water soak only once (before bed), my Tragus is more tender versus when I do the salt water soaks 2-3x a day and don&#x27;t use the spray.</li>
            <li> and my nipples are healing really fast!</li>
            <li> I got a cheap upper lobe piercing (first mistake) after I had gotten my first two holes with no pain and no bad after effects.</li>
            <li> first week I had it</li>
            <li> Because I have an auto-immune disease I take forever to heal in the first place, but as you may or may not know, cartilage takes forever and</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this a year ago when I had some ear piercings done.</li>
            <li> The first week that I used it it did help with the itching.</li>
            <li> I ended up doing a regular sea salt soak and then the rook began to feel better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll last A LOT longer and better than the h2ocean</li>
            <li> I had used this product before, I just needed more of it and didn&#x27;t know where to get it locally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using h2ocean for several years now, I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> now I used this stuff when I first got them pierced &amp; never have had a problem until now,</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li> My piercing healing up pretty well</li>
            <li> first used it three times a day during the first couple weeks, then twice a day.</li>
            <li> but I was willing to try anything to rid of the hideous bump</li>
            <li> At first, I was making a sea salt flush (recipe given to me by the place where I pierced my nose) and antibacterial soap.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have had many facial piercings (nostril, septum, snakebites, vertical labret).  </li>
            <li> I did make sure that I sprayed my piercing on a daily basis with it.</li>
            <li> My first can that I ordered was defective, so I contacted the seller.</li>
            <li> My pierce heals pretty well in 2</li>
            <li> Bought this for my brother after he got his first piercing.</li>
            <li> Within a month the bottled clogged up from all the salt and it created more problems with my tragus piercing then just regular cleaning.</li>
            <li> I recently got something repierced and healing it this time using this spray has been SO much better.</li>
            <li> I found I wasn&#x27;t using it consistently b/c</li>
            <li> Nozzle doesn&#x27;t clog, consistent spray stream.</li>
            <li> When I got it, it obviously hadn&#x27;t been tested to make sure it worked before being shipped out.</li>
            <li> I got this to use while gauging my ears since I have lost many, many ear piercings to infection in the past.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the FIRST day of using it (as directed)</li>
            <li> and I really like it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard of these kinds of bottles getting clogged after repeated use, but not being clogged upon the first attempted use.</li>
            <li> When I first received the product it worked like a charm; however after about a month the spray broke and I couldn&#x27;t use the rest of it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> the product worxed good but the can clogged after a few uses and we had to run under hot water and d1g wth a p1n</li>
            <li> My piercings definitely heal faster and look better since I have been using this.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff since day one, spraying it on about 4x a day the first week</li>
            <li> my ear started feeling and looking better by the next evening.  </li>
            <li> This is our family&#x27;s first choice for piercing care.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve compared this to standard wound-wash saline, and this works so much better.</li>
            <li> I wish I had started using H2ocean when I first got my piercings -- it really does work wonders!</li>
            <li> I must admit this hurt the first week I tried it.</li>
            <li> And since the can isn&#x27;t too big, I can carry it with me and spray it as needed! :)</li>
            <li> The product arrived in a timely manner and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I used it forever ago when I had my piercings first done</li>
            <li> DOES EXACTLY</li>
            <li> It did help heal my belly button piercing, HOWEVER I found that Witch Hazel actually works better.</li>
            <li> Okay so I recently bought this spray because I got my cartilage pierced</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the hot water and sea salt soak but bending my head over a cup wasn&#x27;t working for me.</li>
            <li> The only reason this works is because it eliminates you actually touching your ear, all you do is spray and go.</li>
            <li> I suggest you go to walmart and buy an empty spray bottle and sea salt, boil the water and add a lot of sea salt and put it in the spray bottle and you have you&#x27;re own h20cean spray</li>
            <li> If you are thinking about getting this product, try Neosporin first.</li>
            <li> bought this again after my first one ran out.</li>
            <li> will be buying in the future :)</li>
            <li> let others touch the cool new piercing/drag it through landfills.  </li>
            <li> I got it fairly fast and tried using it right out if the box but to my surprise it would not spray.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who is getting new piercings and also for anyone who wants to keep their current piercings clean :)</li>
            <li> Other than that, I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s amazing, but it&#x27;s sterile and salt water, so it lives up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> Bought it originally to help clear up an infected ear lobe after a stretch and it worked for that.</li>
            <li> Over the years with all my other piercing I&#x27;ve used Morton ionized salt with warm water.</li>
            <li> The reason I&#x27;m giving it one star is because of the price &amp; unlike the warm water &amp; sea salt, this completely dried out my ears leaving it kind of flaky with dry skin.</li>
            <li> and I need something reliable and natural to clean it with.</li>
            <li> it healed it extremely fast and will be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use, you just spray it on and let it air dry.  </li>
            <li> I was thinking about piercing my nose, I was really worried about possible infection, so I did my research and found that H2Ocean is the most trusted aftercare spray.  </li>
            <li> You need to make sure the spray is not replacing regular gentle cleaning with an anti-microbial soap.</li>
            <li> The first few days I was using hot salt soaks, but those were kind if a pain and pretty impractical.</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon this product while searching for quality nose ring and read some of the overwhelmingly positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done this for all of my piercings and have had completely positive results.</li>
            <li> This is great but..... not a good value for the price.</li>
            <li> duh :P  </li>
            <li> this product it helped it heal pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I used it on my tragus piercing for a while when I didn&#x27;t have ready access to sea salt and hot water.</li>
            <li> It does run out fast but it is a much easier alternative!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had pretty much no redness</li>
            <li> Go-to aftercare for piercings; pretty basic and does the job, as long as you are good with up-keep.</li>
            <li> The other piercing healed beautifully and stays clean with a few sprays every now and then.</li>
            <li> It gets in there without making a huge mess and makes it sooooo much easier to clean my piercings!</li>
            <li> This only lasted me through my 2nd month with many more months to go, until my piercing is completely healed.  </li>
            <li> Upon reading the reviews I decided to try this instead of buying more of the other product, especially since this was a better value and seemed to do wonders for healing piercings.</li>
            <li> It has helped clear up my tragus piercing tremendously.</li>
            <li> Not only do the crusts go away, but it makes it easy to remove because they don&#x27;t seem to harden with this product.  </li>
            <li> Ever since I started using this product I see my piercings heal a little quickly and prevent them from getting infected for which I love.</li>
            <li> Tee tree oil peroxide alcohol certain cleansers and nothing worked</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say for certain if this helped.</li>
            <li> and this is the large spray can.</li>
            <li> If you just got a brand new piercing, this is the product you need!!</li>
            <li> I previously bought this product from the tattoo shop where I got my eyebrow pierced, and it worked GREAT on it and my bellybutton piercing (which was starting to swell).</li>
            <li> It is a gentle stream and yet strong enough to get rid of the crusties.</li>
            <li> I went back to the piercer, and he told me it was probably torn by accidentally sleeping on it, and that it would heal up just fine.</li>
            <li> ago.&lt;br /&gt;The antibacterial soap my piercer gave me worked fine when he did my conch last year, but a week into my nose piercing aftercare</li>
            <li> One note, it&#x27;s main ingredient is derived from eggs, so if you&#x27;re allergic to them, don&#x27;t use it!</li>
            <li> I mainly use this product for razor bumps!</li>
            <li> So I very highly recommend this product for any body with nipple piercings.</li>
            <li> and you can really get up into those crevasses without moving or touching your nose/the piercing at all, (which is a must in those first two weeks due to how sore you&#x27;ll</li>
            <li> and i know keeping new piercings clean is vital to preventing infections.</li>
            <li> I used this spray every day just as the directions say and they healed up nicely and the piercings didn&#x27;t even really get itchy except a few times when I soaked them in sea salt.</li>
            <li> So much easier than a saltwater rinse</li>
            <li> It cleaned my nose piercing really well</li>
            <li> healing my piercing really good(:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Anyone who has a nose piercing knows how much of a pain that is.  </li>
            <li> It took to much time and was just an inconvenience.  </li>
            <li> I was not convinced it would make so much of a difference, but purchased it any way.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It helps so much and makes healing so much quicker and easier.</li>
            <li> I purchased it not thinking it would do much within three days of using it it</li>
            <li> Much easier to use.</li>
            <li> and I have been submerging my whole ear in salt water</li>
            <li> It works well and does its job very well.  </li>
            <li> Found this and figured I could do no worse than I was doing.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t changed much in a month</li>
            <li> I really wanted a belly button peircing</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so much easier using this versus a sea salt soak.</li>
            <li> This product really helped to reduce the swelling and pain.</li>
            <li> but its so much easier to use than making one urself</li>
            <li> Worked well my piercing was very agitated and this stuff helped with cleaning it out.</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t spray or do really anything.</li>
            <li> salt soaks weren&#x27;t doing much to help.</li>
            <li> So for the price you don&#x27;t get that much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very convenient.</li>
            <li> Much easier than having to do a sea salt soak</li>
            <li> but wow was it worth it,</li>
            <li> this spray makes the process MUCH faster.</li>
            <li> Highly reccommend it!</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t really help you heal</li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> really works.</li>
            <li> Its easy, it really keeps your piercing clean, and eliminates any dried discharge.</li>
            <li> Maybe I overused it, but it didn&#x27;t really help my piercing.</li>
            <li> fix the problem ring up to heal fast for my nose</li>
            <li> and I was very worried about infection setting in.</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders fast...</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> but I purchase too much after I got my belly button pierced.</li>
            <li> This product really works wonders and takes away redness and swelling and that itchy feeling you get afterwards.</li>
            <li> I continue to highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It came really fast and was just as described.</li>
            <li> Much faster than using sea salt solution and comparable to sea salt soaking it for 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have had issues with ear piercing infections my whole life...</li>
            <li> thank you so much.</li>
            <li> Despite my cleaning them twice a day with the cleaning solution provided at the time of piercing, I was headed straight for infection-ville.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> The spray is very soothing if a pierced ear gets irritated.</li>
            <li> Fast service.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I know everyone&#x27;s experience can vary, but I just want to let people know that there can be very adverse reactions to using this product.</li>
            <li> I did spray some on a cotton ball and use it on my face for my acne, it didn&#x27;t seem to help it much</li>
            <li> This is a product to use when ur in need of some fast healing.</li>
            <li> It is very convenient when I am at work or school because I can&#x27;t always make a sea salt soak.</li>
            <li> Really helps with swelling/infections in piercings.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast and the bottle came ready to use.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even describe how much pain I was in this stuff</li>
            <li> This makes cleaning your piercings so much easier.</li>
            <li> Please get this because it really does work.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I have always found that if you want to get a real feel for people&#x27;s opinions of products, amazon.com is the place to go.</li>
            <li> I tried doing at home sea salt soaks to see if this was really just overpriced seas salt soaks and my piercing got infected within a week (go figure).</li>
            <li> My piercing heal fast and they never, ever get infected.</li>
            <li> and he was very stern on nothing else..</li>
            <li> and it made it heal much faster than it was just using sea salt as a cleanser.</li>
            <li> This product does not work very well at all.</li>
            <li> Use this for my ear piercings and it is very convenient.</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s only around 15 bucks at the shop for a 4oz bottle, I&#x27;m just a cheap skate).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> I absolutely would get this and use it for anytime</li>
            <li> It cleans my ears very well</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product and seller!</li>
            <li> very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used this on my septum piercing and it has really helped with the healing process...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s healing up really well.</li>
            <li> With this spray, it makes the job much easier...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost healed and h2ocean spray has really smoothed out the process.&lt;br /&gt;NOTE</li>
            <li> think my helix has healed much faster than my navel and definitly faster than my earlobes.  </li>
            <li> It heals the piercing very well.</li>
            <li> Healed my cartilage piercing very well using it 2 times a day.</li>
            <li> the itching is gone not so much crust either.</li>
            <li> Thanks H2ocean.</li>
            <li> I used this product a whole 2 days before it stopped spraying.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> What really draws me to this product is how it sprays.</li>
            <li> I really hope I can get another bottle because I have tried the product</li>
            <li> My piercing healed so fast</li>
            <li> Very convenient.  </li>
            <li> so I recommend this product it is really helpful</li>
            <li> and I just didn&#x27;t want to do the whole soaking in water &amp; sea salt.</li>
            <li> It got really sore</li>
            <li> Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> works very well, if your ear has gotten infected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, if you&#x27;re looking to stretch your ears - this is highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, but when I got the product it didn&#x27;t have a hole in spray nozzle</li>
            <li> but I went through the whole bottle in 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> I had been purchasing this locally, at a much steeper cost.  </li>
            <li> However, you didn&#x27;t have much to do with this product except to deliver it to my doorstep.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worth the $9 you pay by far.</li>
            <li> Highly, highly, HIGHLY recommend!  </li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> and it still was swollen but not so much sore</li>
            <li> Cleans piercings really well and fast.</li>
            <li> This spray really helped heal my piercings</li>
            <li> It helped heal my belly button &amp; helix piercings very well.</li>
            <li> Self pierce a lot and really convenient.</li>
            <li> Helped heal my nose piercing fast 😃awesome product.</li>
            <li> The product is great, but the bottle was shipped to me with a broken nozzle, so I can&#x27;t even use it.</li>
            <li> My piercings weren&#x27;t infected, but they were still very swollen and sore.</li>
            <li> therefore much cleaner than using anything else.</li>
            <li> This product is very convenient.</li>
            <li> If I forget to use this stuff when I&#x27;m busy with life, the heat comes back along with more pus.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before I ordered this I was using sea salt water, it was effective but so messy &amp; time consuming.</li>
            <li> My only gripe (if I can call it that), is if you have extremely sensitive skin, make sure to use this product along with jewelry that is titanium or niobium or else it won&#x27;t heal</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes for this stuff, as my ears are super sensitive</li>
            <li> This stuff really helped clear a stubborn infection in my ear right up, and made cleaning my ear a breeze.</li>
            <li> For the first time ever a new piercing has not got infected.</li>
            <li> * right off&amp;#34; too my old piercing duder and looked to others for advice..</li>
            <li> Amazing product not harsh on skin like other piercing cleaners</li>
            <li> My nipples were extremely sore and sensitive to any touch, even my own t-shirt and swollen a bit.</li>
            <li> After a few days my piercings were better with minimal effort -- perfect for a somewhat lazy girl like myself.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s fine and back to normal now.</li>
            <li> For the first few days after piercing my nose I used a saline solution and it was going great, there was minimal swelling and no redness or signs of infection.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s not refillable or reusable as any other spriting device, I&#x27;m glad it won&#x27;t wind up in the garbage when I&#x27;m done with it.</li>
            <li> It made my irritated ears feel normal over night!</li>
            <li> I started using this stuff on my infected nose piercing and it significantly reduced my giant bump.</li>
            <li> First, understand that I have had my navel pierced a total of 4 times; the last being the most succesful one with the help of this product.</li>
            <li> This product is unusable if the spray bottle doesn&#x27;t work, and as you can see from other reviews here, many of these products are defective.</li>
            <li> I use it for cleaning my piercing but noticed it can be used for many other things too.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very small amount, but it&#x27;s good for on-the-go sanitation.</li>
            <li> i really liked this product because it&#x27;s quick and simple especially if you are short on time!</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t been red, it remains clean, and hasn&#x27;t been infected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would definitely keep this stuff around even if your piercing has already healed just to keep the area clean.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used this for ear piercings yet, but did use it to clean up an open wound my husband had gotten.</li>
            <li> I still use the spray, especially before and after running- whether I&#x27;m wearing earrings or not- just to keep the healed piercing clean.</li>
            <li> Keeps them clean without having to wash them multiple times per day.</li>
            <li> I had some &amp;#34;hidden&amp;#34; piercings and used this to clean it multiple times a day.</li>
            <li> I was instructed to clean them twice a day with regular saline solution, which I did diligently.</li>
            <li> The snug piercing that I have can take up to a year to heal and I have had my piercing for 3 months now and use H2Ocean about once every 3rd day to clean it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been in love with this stuff ever since the first time i bought it at my tattoo shop a few years ago.</li>
            <li> I also had surgery recently and used it to clean the incision sites.</li>
            <li> I spray it on a Q Tip and clean the outside and the inside</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s actually helping it heal instead of just keeping it clean.  </li>
            <li> This spray is so unbelievably easy to use, just spritz it on and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> It also does help tone down any itching you might have through the initial healing and does a good job of cleaning/drawing out crusties.</li>
            <li> By Monday there was significant swelling of the right ear, visible redness, and extreme sensitivity to touch.</li>
            <li> (I had experienced some minor resistance to plain sea salt before with a rook piercing)</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t last very long and is kind of overpriced for what it is.</li>
            <li> I finally gave up and switched to a mild tea tree solution and my ears are much happier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on and off over the years for my piercings, it works really well in cleaning and reducing swelling caused by inflammation and also reduces the size of the bumps that normally pops u when you have a cartilage piercing.</li>
            <li> I spray a bit of this stuff on, and literally within minutes my ears aren&#x27;t hot anymore, and the pain almost completely vanishes.</li>
            <li> That didn&#x27;t work and now I am left with a full can of h2ocea.</li>
            <li> Because I&#x27;m lazy and can&#x27;t be bothered to make my own solution.</li>
            <li> They were healing perfectly until I had a misfortunate accident and tugged one dermal a little too hard while scratching in the area.</li>
            <li> So after more research, I found this refined Emu Oil through Desert Palms Emu Ranch LLC that The Piercing Bible swears by online to treat dryness without clogging the piercing or infecting it as other oils do, and it has done wonders!</li>
            <li> This is a must have for new nose piercings!</li>
            <li> I got this for my new belly button piercing and it has worked so well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now healed up and wearing my new earrings after my 6 weeks was up!</li>
            <li> I think this is a must if yo have a new piercing!</li>
            <li> In addition to my helix, I  have been using it on my new Tragus as well as my snug to reduce inflammation and it&#x27;s truly a miracle product!</li>
            <li> I get a new piercing from here on out!</li>
            <li> I have an industrial and it is hard to clean easily</li>
            <li> H2Ocean is much easier to use on a new ear piercing-</li>
            <li> I like the product, I&#x27;ve found it very convenient on the go for new or upset</li>
            <li> The cleansing and healing process made it so much easier to maintain my new piercings because of He Ocean Piercing Aftercare.</li>
            <li> Really recommend this product to anyone with a new piercing</li>
            <li> It really gets the job done quite well, cleans up the gunk and soothes those throbbing new piercings.</li>
            <li> It is cooling to tender new piercings and promotes fast healing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied, they&#x27;ve seemed to fix their issues from previous bottles that the sprayer would pop off...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use, and it arrived faster than I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently got a nose piercing and for the first couple of months it did fine but later on as I began to touch it</li>
            <li> Although, you shouldn&#x27;t make it your main source for cleaning.</li>
            <li> All the classic signs of infection.</li>
            <li> This actually works to help heal your piercings quickly.</li>
            <li> This product is really good at cleaning the surface of the skin like removing dead skin and such.  </li>
            <li> A day or two after I started using it a big red bump appeared around the top of the piercing, and was bleeding.</li>
            <li> clean it with this, let it dry, then gently massage the bump with tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> I still wash my piercing with soap in the shower, but my main piercing care is h2ocean.</li>
            <li> I am currently planning more piercings once my nipples heal and will definitely stock up on H2Ocean for all of them.</li>
            <li> It is a simple way to get your saline solution quickly.</li>
            <li> Easy and simple cleaning, no other products need to be used along with it.</li>
            <li> and, I kid you not, after one day use the inflammation went down a great deal and the skin is not as dark as it was before the use of this product.</li>
            <li> That really made me miss my old H2Ocean!</li>
            <li> It has really helped my infection, it&#x27;s almost completely gone!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to mess with cotton balls now :)</li>
            <li> I like this better actually because it saves me the trouble of having to boil water and mix the soap and wait for it to cool</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I bought it direct from H2Ocean&#x27;s website for a brand new piercing and had no problems.</li>
            <li> Most of those slow down the healing process and aren&#x27;t as effective with infections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this stuff for 4 of my piercings and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone with piercings</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this spray to anyone considering any type of piercings.</li>
            <li> i would highly recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product and it was cheaper getting it off amazon than from my shop.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY Reccomnd</li>
            <li> the price is way to high when you can use saline solution for a cupple dollors.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest to anyone who is planning on getting pierced, to have this on hand.</li>
            <li> Highly reccommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend helps heal piercings</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but I still highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a high pressure spray that gets into the piercing hole.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product to anyone that gets something pierced.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this spray.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this after reading all the 5 star reviews, but after one use, my tragus piercing felt prickly and swelled up for a day or two.</li>
            <li> but I decided to stick to it since is a highly recommend product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This product does everything it says in it&#x27;s description as long as you adhere to the directions and do not over clean your piercing.</li>
            <li> I use this to clean my stretched ears and septum piercing.</li>
            <li> It was very cooling and soothing at first, but about an hour after, my piercing were swollen, dry, and hot.</li>
            <li> Also, if you tend to be allergic to certain metals and your ear piercings get infected, use this to clear the infection up.</li>
            <li> I had a new stud that caused the dreaded &amp;#34;bump&amp;#34; on my piercing, I&#x27;m assuming it was the metal quality, and after changing the stud and using this spray regularly I healed quickly and scar-free.</li>
            <li> A week ago, I got my cartilage pierced and was recommended the H2Ocean -- WOW!!</li>
            <li> When my more healed piercings get irritated, I spray them with a little of this and it soothes the dryness and irritation.</li>
            <li> Saltwater is a natural wound cleanser, so it only makes sense to bottle purified saltwater to clean piercing sites.</li>
            <li> I had my belly button pierced almost 2 years ago and was told to use the old antibacterial soap and neosporin trick to clean it -- in 2 weeks, it was swollen and infected, big time.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t sting, helps the piercings heal, and is extremely convenient and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I used normal saline till I got this, however H2Ocean is much better getting the little crustys off of the jewelry.</li>
            <li> but I blame weather its so hot in here and its a lil difficult to clean it many time at day cause of my work</li>
            <li> which is a lot and kind of hard.</li>
            <li> I am using it on my new piercings, a couple that I am stretching and on my five year olds new earings!</li>
            <li> I will use this for at least the 5 remaining months of healing time, if not longer, amazing product.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping it would clear up my infected nose piercing, it didn&#x27;t help me at all, maybe it helped others.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for those complicated piercings (rooks, dermals, etc.)</li>
            <li> No where near as much pain.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, my ears are feeling great now</li>
            <li> My piercings had always been very &amp;#34;pus-y&amp;#34;, hot, and irritated, and lasted YEARS until I finally removed them.</li>
            <li> I created my own saline solution with sea salt that the piercer provided, but lately it hasn&#x27;t been working.</li>
            <li> and then when i found out that saline soluting aka contact solution dose the exact same thing i felt very ripped off.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m aware I could probably make a reasonable facsimile of this product for pennies on the dollar, I keep coming back to Amazon for it.  </li>
            <li> It last a long time and is so important to have!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many piercings done but always have trouble with healing.</li>
            <li> H2Ocean is pretty much the only thing that has ever worked for me.</li>
            <li> &amp; you don&#x27;t have to mix it fresh daily.</li>
            <li> My piercing also did better when I sprayed some on a cotton ball and held the cotton ball on the piercing for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> So while I&#x27;ve had good experience with this product in the past, I can&#x27;t say whether or not it would work for multiple purposes because of the crappy packaging.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 2 days and my piercing is completely normal now.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> I purchased this spray and used it and within a few days it felt sooo much better.</li>
            <li> This is more for use when you&#x27;re traveling, or just to have a small clean-up whenever you need it and don&#x27;t have time to do a real thorough cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product does help though, and especially for a fresh piercing, I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> For the most part it&#x27;s not a huge deal, but when traveling/moving it&#x27;s a pain to have to worry about whether or not something will make it spray off in my bag.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone with a new piercing or for someone to purchase before getting a piercing.</li>
            <li> As someone with five piercings and some of them in high maintenance areas believe me when I tell you that this is a mist have for new piercings.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone getting a new piercing.</li>
            <li> H2Ocean is fantastic at clearing up minor irritations on old piercings and for cleaning new piercings.</li>
            <li> Helped heal my two new piercings about 3 weeks quicker than normal soap and water would.</li>
            <li> shipping was a little much, but everything was fine and came on time.</li>
            <li> had my left tragus &amp; right conch done on a Friday night.</li>
            <li> It sprays on easily and cools down the burn of your newly pierced site.  </li>
            <li> This is cheap, sterile, and extremely well-produced.  </li>
            <li> Good price and arrived a little sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who is newly pierced .</li>
            <li> No brainer for new piercings&lt;br /&gt;Must</li>
            <li> and it was brand new as it said.</li>
            <li> cause it might close my new piercing.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone getting a new piercing.</li>
            <li> One of my new piercing regimens i swear by.</li>
            <li> Used this to heal my new wrist peircing.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Every time I get a new piercing at a tattoo shop, they always recomend this.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone with a new naval piercing... or any type of piercing.</li>
            <li> I had a lot of swelling in my new ear piercings and it hurt to even touch my ear.</li>
            <li> I bought some for my lady and her new piercings</li>
            <li> and I get no pain in newly pierced ears.  </li>
            <li> I just got two new piercings and have ordered another bottle for them.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product every time I get a new piercing or on anything I can use this product on.</li>
            <li> I cleaned my new piercing 3 or 4 times a day for 2 days.</li>
            <li> I have now been using it on my new nose piercing with no problems.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any new acne pop up either...</li>
            <li> Used it on 4 new piercings (R &amp; L tragus, L rook, R conch).</li>
            <li> This is a MUST HAVE for anyone with a new nose piercing.</li>
            <li> so I couldn&#x27;t return it and wait for a new one to come.</li>
            <li> For me it&#x27;s lasted through 3 new piercings.</li>
            <li> I spray some of this on a couple Q-tips, wipe around all the exposed areas of my new piercing, then I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> I finished it and needed a new one.</li>
            <li> If you have a new piercing this is a must.</li>
            <li> H2Ocean works so well on healing up your new piercings or any piercing infections.</li>
            <li> (I have a new industrial).  </li>
            <li> I have been using it to take care of my new ear piercing</li>
            <li> I gauged my helix (top of ear) from 18 to 16 a month after I got my snug and the earring was very tight but it didn&#x27;t swell.</li>
            <li> gold plated my piercing became inflamed with this huge pump at the back and pus exiting both the front and back or the piercing site.</li>
            <li> i had a bump on my nose piercing for a long time and now it is pretty much gone</li>
            <li> I spray it every 4 or 5 hours (and wash it with soap for sensitive skin 1-2 times a day) and plan on lessening that to 2-3 times a day in a few weeks when it has healed more.  </li>
            <li> She was religiously preparing sea salt soaks with warm water, using a glass to soak her ear - time-consuming and messy.  </li>
            <li> It was infected and very sensitive for months after I had my piercing.</li>
            <li> Progress has only continued, so I&#x27;m very pleased that for me H2Ocean actually helped to cure an active infection.</li>
            <li> You should pair this with tea tree oil simply because it&#x27;s a salt solution  and can dry out the area pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> It really does wonders for any piercing, as it healed a small tear in my ear VERY quickly.</li>
            <li> I usually put it on a cotton ball and rub it on my nose piercing to keep it clean (which I don&#x27;t need to do much more, since the piercing has completely healed, but I needed it often during the first few months).</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it right away with my first anchor piercing, and it took over 2 weeks for the redness and swelling to go down.</li>
            <li> Spray it on 4 times a day, however, if you have a piercing infection, spray it every hour or so and it will clear the irritation in just one day!</li>
            <li> I have used this for numerous piercings and it helps them heal so much faster !</li>
            <li> H2Ocean definitely works, but I can&#x27;t say it works better than any other sterile saline solution.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also using it to help heal a deep wound from having my first anchor piercing removed.</li>
            <li> The removal left me with a big crater below my collarbone and the H2Ocean is significantly speeding along the healing process.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> Well first off I ordered 3 bottles, for some reason they could only send two</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually about to buy another bottle because i&#x27;ve just been using it so much!</li>
            <li> and it was completely gone!</li>
            <li> After 3 DAYS my ear was completely healed!</li>
            <li> The entire bottle emptied on first spray.  </li>
            <li> I got double nostril piercings 3 months ago - didn&#x27;t have any issues for the first month and then the dreaded bumps appeared.</li>
            <li> just 1-2 spray of this a day for like 3 days and BOOM no more infection, just silky healthy skin</li>
            <li> so my next can I will probably get at a pierced or hot topic store</li>
            <li> Despite following all of the instructions I was given, it still managed to get pretty swollen and infected.  </li>
            <li> Sooo, I went to the local mall and procured some from Hot Topic.</li>
            <li> I use this spray in between daily washes with hot water and dial gold.</li>
            <li> I use to use regular backing spray that you can purchase at Walmart, so this was my first time trying it out.</li>
            <li> Completely helped to heal my piercing!</li>
            <li> I have over 10 different piercings and this has never failed me.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say if it works or not since I&#x27;m using it as a precaution only, but I haven&#x27;t had any infection issues in the first couple stretches</li>
            <li> This is my second can, my first one was the travel size.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised!</li>
            <li> On my first one I used the regular soap cleaning method and after two years it never would heal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time I used H2Ocean spray, I purchased it because my job was hiking 8 hours a day in the woods of the Central Cascades.  </li>
            <li> So just be aware, you are definitely going to have to be replenishing it when your piercing is healing.</li>
            <li> and it was only sore for the first week.</li>
            <li> The spray is pretty solid.</li>
            <li> Now I only use antibacterial soap on my piercings once while I&#x27;m taking a hot shower and use H2Ocean during the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time, as described, in new condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product for new piercings as well as old ones.</li>
            <li> It does come out in a pretty big mist, so in order for me to put it on my ears without getting it all over my face, I just spray quite a bit on the ends of q-tips (enough to where it&#x27;s dripping wet) and I clean the ear hole/jewelry really well.</li>
            <li> Bought for a new naval piercing and was healed completely in about a month.</li>
            <li> I thought I had a badly infected dermal and after a few consist days of this product and q-tip cleansing I was able to break away any build up around the stud without irritating the area more and it&#x27;s doing great now!</li>
            <li> The only thing to be aware of is sometimes the product clogs because of its natural properties.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s the aerosol, but it comes out slightly cool which helps if the piercing feels hot.</li>
            <li> Ears healed pretty fast and no real issues.</li>
            <li> This spray helps to clean them and when they were still new and hurting, it also helped them to hurt a bit less.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t have any terrible pain during &amp; right after piercing but they were a bit tender the first couple of days but H2Ocean really works to clean, soothe &amp; heal, I plan to use it for minor cuts and I hear it&#x27;s great for minor acne as well.</li>
            <li> and I still have more than half the bottle left.</li>
            <li> not even sure if it&#x27;s still producing discharge, it seems completely healed (however, its probably not fully healed and I fully intend to continue cleaning it daily and not change jewelry for another two and a half months or so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried some other piercing sprays but what I love about this one is how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> It was good, but since its a spray, it got a little messy</li>
            <li> I use this here and there because I kept getting nose ring infections and thought this could clear it up.</li>
            <li> I thought I was in the clear.</li>
            <li> But so far no swelling and the puss and discharge is at a bare minimum (completely normal).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my navel pierced 2 times previously and used hydrogen peroxide and rubbing alcohol to clean it.</li>
            <li> It seems to be doing the job really well, my belly button piercing looks almost completely healed on the outside.</li>
            <li> Helps clear away crusties and soothes when piercing is irritated (helps soothe my hypertrophic scarring).  </li>
            <li> My 2 month old nose piercing was bleeding and oozing after I got a Biore nose strip stuck to it.</li>
            <li> I researched a lot and figured that I shouldn&#x27;t be using an anti-bacterial near the area</li>
            <li> and the irritation has almost completely disappeared.  </li>
            <li> Salt water soaks and cleanings have been used in piercing care for longer than anyone can trace back and they really help the healing process.</li>
            <li> For the first three ear piercings I never had an issue as long as I washed with salt water every once in a while</li>
            <li> /&gt;About a year after I got my nipple pierced it start to show early signs of infection (think I changed the ring before it was fully healed)</li>
            <li> OR ELSE SPRAYING DIRECTLY</li>
            <li> I really am surprised to see all the 5-star ratings.</li>
            <li> I like to lay on my back, spray it and let my belly button fill up with it and then gently move the jewelry and swish it around while reading for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> When I pierced my ears (for both sets of holes), they were very sore for a couple weeks and kept getting crusty and gross.  </li>
            <li> I have extremly sensitive skin, but I have not had one infection while using H20cean.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get much easier than spray several times a day.</li>
            <li> The toner cost about $3 and will last much longer.</li>
            <li> It will not likely cause anyone any sort of irritation, its extremely gentle.</li>
            <li> I got my cartilage pierced over a year ago and after about 8 months of the piercing it was starting to get really red,itchy, and sore.</li>
            <li> H2Ocean gives me the natural sea salt solution in a to go container.</li>
            <li> My piercing was really irritated and red and sea</li>
            <li> Had my nose pierced twice, both times a nose bump developed.</li>
            <li> within 24 hours my keloid had completely vanished and redness reduced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve so far never had an infection or inflammation at all.</li>
            <li> My septum ring was really flaky and red druing healing.</li>
            <li> maybe i was just cleaning it too much or not enough</li>
            <li> I guess I must just have sensitive skin and the added things in this</li>
            <li> My nose piercing is over 5 years old, but I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> then my piercing healed completely.</li>
            <li> , I felt a loud pop and the hole almost shut conpletely and began to ooze a yellowy-liquid.</li>
            <li> is very convenient to carry in your purse/ etc, and is simple to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was such a fast delivery ...</li>
            <li> Within 3 days my ears were completely healed.</li>
            <li> About 3 cans of this will completely heal a piercing.</li>
            <li> So I headed straight back to the tattoo shop to buy another</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t change it still listening to my piercer, but the skin around the piercing is completely healed and no puss.</li>
            <li> if you use it regularly it can really relieve redness and sensitivity of the piercing</li>
            <li> I had no trouble with the product and my piercing did not get infected.</li>
            <li> It completely lost pressure so now I have to just stick a q-tip in the hole where the nozzle used to be.</li>
            <li> After recently getting my nipple pierced the antibacterial soap wasn&#x27;t doing much when it came to cleaning and preventing infection.</li>
            <li> Again, H2Ocean fixed my ear in 3-4 days.</li>
            <li> However when I received it after purchasing from Amazon, the bottle was completely sealed.</li>
            <li> As in the nozzle that is supposed to spray was completely sealed and I couldn&#x27;t even make a hole in it to get it to work.</li>
            <li> stuff really kept me going, and hopefully I&#x27;m not jinxing it by saying my cartilage is finally healed!  </li>
            <li> SO FAR</li>
            <li> I must be sensitive to an ingredient in this or something, though.</li>
            <li> Knowing that it&#x27;s natural and used for healing.</li>
            <li> gentle spray, carry it in my deep purse, and will use this from now on.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product all over my face for the treatment &amp; prevention of mild-moderate adult acne.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old likes this on his skinned knees or &amp;#34;boo-boo&#x27;s&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Natural.</li>
            <li> It so soothing and cooled the natural inflammation that occurred with  my cartilage ear piercing.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s taking forever to heal completely n after using H2Ocean</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend it, its also much cheaper on Amazon than in stores.</li>
            <li> All natural and has natural enzymes to help with the healing process in addition to the sea salt.  </li>
            <li> Now about the product H2ocean spray, I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 days so far</li>
            <li> However, I recently developed in an infection in one of my piercings and wanted to try this product to see if it would help clear up the infection.</li>
            <li> Much easier that doing a total soak in salt water.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my 9 year old&#x27;s pierced ears, which we had done at a professional piercing place and they recommended this product.</li>
            <li> Actually, my teenage daughter uses this product and really loves it.</li>
            <li> My cartilage piercing started to sting and burn, and after a day it had completely swollen up and was covered with discharge.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, i DO NOT RECOMMEND you purchase this.</li>
            <li> This spray has even made some of my old bumbs go</li>
            <li> I got my navel pierced nearly 3 weeks ago</li>
            <li> This product does really well externally, BUT if you have jewelry that your body is rejecting, you&#x27;ll end up taking the piercing out.</li>
            <li> I completely abide by this stuff for piercings.</li>
            <li> this was delivered fast and i used it for a forward helix piercing i had gotten, because it started to form keloids, but a week later they were gone!!</li>
            <li> I liked the actual formula but the spray bottle completed stopped working after only using it a few times.</li>
            <li> I had my nose pierced for nearly four years in a shop that wasn&#x27;t the most hygienic to say the least.</li>
            <li> think the H2Ocean is a good product, but its healing abilities are questionable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use (I usually just sprayed some on a q-tip or sprayed it directly where I needed it).</li>
            <li> By this morning it is almost back to a normal size!  </li>
            <li> I used it for about 3 days and the piercing was back to normal!</li>
            <li> I have been diagnosed with a very mild psoriasis - just small patch about the size of a silver dollar.</li>
            <li> Since my helix usually gets infected easily I was in dire need of a care product that would help prevent that.</li>
            <li> and I just need to spray a little on and clean it.</li>
            <li> (I get really close to the q-tip and spray a slow stream until saturated) and then clean my nose piercing.</li>
            <li> additionally, on older piercings that were sensitive, it&#x27;s eliminated the sensitivity so I can put piercings back in them!</li>
            <li> To top it off, even when the canister feels empty and theres &#x27;nothing left&#x27;, it still goes a really long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone that has a tricky to clean ear piercing, and anyone that is having trouble getting their piercing to heal.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday to clean my nose piercing.</li>
            <li> Actually made my belly button piercing a bit more irritated than usual.</li>
            <li> Two weeks later, the third one, which I hadn&#x27;t used for years, now feels like the first 2 which I have used since I was a teen-no pain at all.</li>
            <li> About 2 days later, my ear lobes were throbbing, sore, hot, swollen and red.</li>
            <li> I sprayed this on 6 times a day for the first month, then 2 times a day for the second month, and now in the third month I use about every 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> I had a 14 inch gage in my left ear since I&#x27;m older</li>
            <li> Much more than just a plain sea salt solution!!</li>
            <li> There is a little redness right around the jewelry, but it is only visible when I unscrew the top of my navel ring; I think the redness is also due to the fact that the piercing is only 3 days old.  </li>
            <li> I only have done a sea salt soak about 3x since the piercing, and I clean it in the shower every other day with antibacterial hand soap (dial.)</li>
            <li> SOMETHING SO HIGHLY AND BUY FOR A SECOND TIME</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has any piercings new or old.</li>
            <li> I totally reccomend this to everyone with a piercing, New or old.</li>
            <li> I used this on all manners of piercings when I was younger and ordered it for my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s new ear piercings as well.</li>
            <li> this works really well as long as you use as directed (no less than 3-6 times per day)</li>
            <li> but it really goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I used this about a week ago when it showed signs of infection and after a couple of days it was back to normal.</li>
            <li> my lymph nodes are back to normal.</li>
            <li> I got an industrial in my right ear about 2 and a half months ago, and I obtained a small bottle of this and was told to use it to help my new piercing heal and stay clean.</li>
            <li> Definitely a must have for new piercings.</li>
            <li> I used this with new piercings and still use it occasionally when they&#x27;re healed.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product to anyone with a new piercing.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has new piercings.</li>
            <li> and I would definitely recomend it to anyone with a new piercing.</li>
            <li> I will update further on the new bottle.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anyone who would like to take care of their new piercing.</li>
            <li> i would recommend this to people who recently got a new piercing .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier than mixing your own solution and trying to awkwardly soak it for 5-10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> The piercing only hurts if I accidentally role onto it in the middle of the night, and even then it doesn&#x27;t hurt too much.  </li>
            <li> After a couple days of use, using it 2-3 times a day the small infection is pretty much gone</li>
            <li> The only negative thing I have to say about the product is that It leaks from the top.</li>
            <li> have a nice full bottle, but no way to get use of it. :(</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s not refillable or reusable as any other spriting device, I&#x27;m glad it won&#x27;t wind up in the garbage when I&#x27;m done with it.ted by the metal container since it&#x27;s actually packaged in a small bag inside the can, and that the whole thing is recyclable.</li>
            <li> (ya know, in case you didn&#x27;t trust the 60-something other people that told you so ;)  )</li>
            <li> When I first pierced my cartilage, it became extremely infected and sore</li>
            <li> This product saved my piercings, after even a day there was a major improvement.</li>
            <li> Every other day, I&#x27;ll do a sea salt soak (get a Dixie cup &amp; fill it up with hot water, add some table sea salt &amp; soak the area with the piercing for a minute or two) for a month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my low 40&#x27;s, and when I was a teen, I had my ears pierced 3 times, and have usually only used the first two piercings.</li>
            <li> My body peircings quickly healed in less than 2 months!</li>
            <li> bought this and started using it twice a day at first, then once every other or two, my piercings have cleared up,</li>
            <li> Well my ears feel fine, unless I do something silly like smack myself really hard, and they seem to already be mostly healed!</li>
            <li> But after literally only 3 days of using this stuff, it&#x27;s almost completely gone!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this on my year old microdermals that like getting infected once in a while, my new nip piercings, as well as my stretched ears.</li>
            <li> I still HIGHLY recommend doing a saline SOAK during at least the first week of a new body piercing (nipples, bellybutton, etc.)</li>
            <li> Very little pus comes out now and then (part of the healing process) but clean it with the spray and there won&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
            <li> unfortunately, there is NONE (Trust me!), but I think it&#x27;s a great item to give a try in your daily cleansing routine.</li>
            <li> It cleans the area, makes it less crusty, and this is gross, but it gets all of the icky stuff out from the inside which is really good for healing.  </li>
            <li> When I got my belly button pierced, the piercer said to use antibacterial soap to clean it, which made the area really red, and I knew hydrogen peroxide was too harsh.</li>
            <li> I went to get them re-stretched after they tried to heal on me and the guy re-pierced them instead, right next to the other holes.</li>
            <li> I have a little irritation, but I think that&#x27;s just do to the jewelry, I am very sensitive to all kinds of metals, even pure gold&#x27;s and silvers.</li>
            <li> I recently went on a trip for a long weekend and found it very convenient.</li>
            <li> My daily routine is showering twice a day with Dial Antibacterial Body Wash, clean my piercing with H2Ocean Aftercare Spray (following with a slight water cleaning)</li>
            <li> I had tried different things to clear up my pierced ears, but nothing worked.  </li>
            <li> only used it once or twice and everything after that was clear</li>
            <li> All natural and definitely the way to go.</li>
            <li> I kept thinking that I wished I could soak it in salt water, but the risk of infection would increase, so I finally started looking specifically for a natural salt water (not saline) type cleanser.</li>
            <li> (Which i don&#x27;t get why people made such a big fuss about that, it will literally go straight back on with no problem...)</li>
            <li> been using this product for almost the entire duration of my piercings healing process so far, and it&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> By the third day, ALL signs of irritation and infection were COMPLETELY gone.</li>
            <li> Even though a simple sea salt soak would accomplish essentially the same thing, H2Ocean just makes it so much easier to apply.</li>
            <li> its still there, but hopefully in the near future it will be gone.</li>
            <li> When the piercing bump is completely gone I will only be using h2oceanspray.</li>
            <li> When I came across this product, I really didn&#x27;t mind spending a few bucks to get my ear to feel normal again.</li>
            <li> Saline Solution works better to me than this, &amp; when my belly ring got infected it seemed like it made it worse .</li>
            <li> I only gave four stars because somehow I managed to get the most annoying can with a leaky top.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of expensive</li>
            <li> After the first 36 hours, I noticed the swelling was down.</li>
            <li> By the positive reviews I figured it would help, but I never imagined it would make such a big difference in such a short amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started using the H2Ocean spray just hours after my new microdermal anchor piercing (which is now 3 days old) and there is absolutely no redness or swelling.</li>
            <li> For months I had been trying to get rid of the bumps on the back of my cartilage piercing through various methods (aspirin, new jewelry, salt) with no avail.</li>
            <li> This is what I use to clean my industrial piercing everyday and when I ordered it I had just enough left thy should</li>
            <li> My ear no longer looks infected - no redness, no pain, the bump is gone, now has very minimal normal clear discharge and the swelling has drastically reduced.</li>
            <li> Three days after the first usage, the swelling was almost entirely gone, was no longer warm to the touch, and no longer so painful that cleaning it requires a gag and some oxycodone.</li>
            <li> &amp; I healed so much faster than I had expected to!</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for hard to clean piercings.</li>
            <li> If there is any crusting take a q-tip with a little bit of the solution and VERY gently swab around the area to remove it.</li>
            <li> I remember my piercer telling me that H2Ocean was good because it has a thing in it called Lysozymes which actually eat away at bad bacteria and infection and act like a barrier for the new piercing while it is healing.</li>
            <li> My new piercings felt hot only about a week or so, and this stuff stops the heat, excessive swelling, and pain.</li>
            <li> I have my nose pierced for 3 months now and will continue to use this at least once or twice a month to maintain a clean area.</li>
            <li> I like to clean my piercings  at least once a week.</li>
            <li> Does taste a little funny though, but gets job done.</li>
            <li> The first time, I got them pierced at Claire&#x27;s and used the little saline solution thing they gave me.  </li>
            <li> This is the exact same product for much less.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Elayne Angel&#x27;s The Piercing Bible recommended a saline solution and that really helped, but it felt wasteful to make a cup of the stuff when I only needed enough to wet a q-tip (and storing it long-term just seemed unsanitary)</li>
            <li> (I wasn&#x27;t that consistent after a few weeks).</li>
            <li> After the first few uses, the caps fell off BOTH bottles that I ordered.  </li>
            <li> I never had trouble with my first lobe piercing (got when I was 5)</li>
            <li> I began cleaning it with antibacterial soap and hot water which did help (along with antibiotics) but it dried my ear out a bit.</li>
            <li> I will buy again, good price other places its expensive.</li>
            <li> Immediately after spraying it on, I felt as if my whole ear had been cooled down.</li>
            <li> The swelling has gone down and there isn&#x27;t as much discharge.</li>
            <li> It is more expensive than plain sterile saline, but it is absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li> I used it often, the first two days, and I didn&#x27;t have less pain, but on the 3rd and 4th day, I started noticing a big difference.</li>
            <li> For me it has cleared up major swelling, major infection, and minor pain with this piercing since I got it!</li>
            <li> Doing a little soak made even the pain lessen along with healing any irritations I might have had from minor bumps to my fresh piercing.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> , there is new pink skin underneath.</li>
            <li> I usually spray it on right before bed.</li>
            <li> Other than that, highly recommend for all piercings.</li>
            <li> Your piercing will hurt less and feel as if healing much faster.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This will only help up clear minor things.</li>
            <li> that has helped IMMENSELY with calming the area down &amp; really promoting healing.</li>
            <li> I would like to write a good review for this product but when it arrived I was unable to use it because the spray nozzle was damaged and the canister was leaking every time I pushed down on the nozzle.</li>
            <li> Using this spray also soothes painful piercings when they&#x27;re still new and warm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several piercings over the years and never hand any heal half as fast as they do using this product.  </li>
            <li> Before I bought this I was using wound wash from CVS, and it really did the same thing for half the cost for double the solution.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use any other product for new piercings.</li>
            <li> And I used it for other new piercing I got as well.</li>
            <li> Even while using this, I still recommend washing your piercing every other day while it is new to prevent infection.</li>
            <li> My piercer said it could take 3 months to heal, but thanks to this spray I was healed and without pain in less than a month!</li>
            <li> So the other ear was not healing and starting to look infected - it was swelled, red, sensitive to touch, had a bump next to the jewelery, and discharge.</li>
            <li> Based on the other reviews I bought this stuff because my 7-week old nose piercing would get red from wearing makeup and sweating when working out.</li>
            <li> Long story short, I concluded that the sea salt was to thank for a few clear days after 3 years of struggling with adult acne.  </li>
            <li> I had gotten a couple piercings below the neck and having to do the sea salt soak all the time was almost impossible to do considering I live with more than just my boyfriend.</li>
            <li> I initially bought this because I knew I wasn&#x27;t washing my new piercing as much as I should, and mixing the proper sea salt/water solution was beginning to become tedious because I&#x27;m always busy.  </li>
            <li> I am so mad, the sprayer won&#x27;t actuate and there&#x27;s no way to get the liquid out effectively.</li>
            <li> I use it mostly for my stretched ear lobes, it soothes them and takes care of any irritations, like if I sleep on one side wrong.</li>
            <li> , I appreciate the fact that the solution cannot be affected by the metal container since it&#x27;s actually packaged in a small bag inside the can, and that the whole thing is recyclable.</li>
            <li> Like everyone else says it gets it clean without irritating the skin.  </li>
            <li> The earring on my upper lobe came out and long story short</li>
            <li> After 20 years of life I finally decided to get my ears pierced but had to wait for a little benign cyst that developed in my left earlobe to go away.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Within the week, it was less sensitive and well on its way to proper healing.</li>
            <li> most piercers will give you salt with a little cup- very hard to soak an ear for 10 minutes that way.</li>
            <li> Hey at the time I was not very educated on aftercare or piercings in general.</li>
            <li> I bought a small bottle where I had my tragus piercing done and it works very well, so</li>
            <li> I’ve been using H2Ocean for the past 5 years of piercings and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Others have said it runs out fast; not sure about that</li>
            <li> because the 1 oz the piercer gave me didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I got my nose stretched back to an 18g a couple days ago and with using this product it has helped with the healing process and it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.</li>
            <li> last that long</li>
            <li> I got my cartilage pierced for the third time (long story) almost two years ago.  </li>
            <li> And the 4 oz spray can does not last that long.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last as long as I hoped..</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;ve long since graduated from simply spritzing this onto my piercing.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product just a few days after and within 24 hours it appeared completely normal.</li>
            <li> The bottle did come a little broken, but it&#x27;s still able to use.</li>
            <li> I was having a lot of trouble with my new tragus piercing (redness, swelling, soreness) and my piercer recommended H2Ocean.</li>
            <li> The downside is that it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> It did dry out my ear when I used it multiple times a day</li>
            <li> The 4 oz bottle will last you a really long time as long as you don&#x27;t over use it.</li>
            <li> I really got tired of doing that and went online and did research on this product, so far I have not had any problems.</li>
            <li> The next day every single bump was gone and they didn&#x27;t even leave a scar or any type of discoloration.</li>
            <li> When I stopped using the product and went back to plain sea salt soaks the problem would clear up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as dry or scaly, not raised, not as tender and not near as red.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, one of the piercings didn&#x27;t heal properly (nothing to do with this product), but H2Ocean actually helped clear up the infection and prevent it from really coming on.</li>
            <li> After discovering I was allergic to anything less than real gold, I broke down and bought a $120 ring from BodyCandy.com.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who is seriously considering a piercing, have it on hand for the first day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had 7 piercings that never healed using other cheaper (and sometimes more expensive saline solutions).</li>
            <li> So far I have not really notice a difference other than my ear</li>
            <li> A little spritz of this will clear out the bacteria so it can start to heal.</li>
            <li> I really wished I had purchased it on amazon instead for less than half the price I gave.</li>
            <li> Thanks, keep up the hard work.</li>
            <li> After five days of them being infected, purple, painful to the touch and warm, I tried h2ocean.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic, Since it is so expensive</li>
            <li> H2O does it&#x27;s job in helping it heal and not swell up to gargantuan size.</li>
            <li> Ive stretched my ears,</li>
            <li> Industrials take a long time to heal</li>
            <li> I eventually got impatient and changed the piercing to early</li>
            <li> The piercing has not been sore and has not developed any crust whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed at how long the container lasts.</li>
            <li> Its harder to apply to facial piercings</li>
            <li> This has lasted me a long time.</li>
            <li> I have a few piercings and I always use this stuff because it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li> The bottle is a lot smaller than i expected</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy this product for as long as I have my piercings.</li>
            <li> In the morning and before bed I do a sea salt soak for as long as I have time for.</li>
            <li> I should have ordered this a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I have had four piercings over the course of my life: tongue, monroe, upper ear (twice), all of these done with a hollow needle.</li>
            <li> This product forces the bubble to pop within 24 hours and after a few days, is completely healed.</li>
            <li> The bottle lasts for a long time too because of that.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s really good for just spraying my belly ring when the crusties start to stick the ring to the hole (uncomfortable and not good for healing) or</li>
            <li> The spray itself works fine but the packaging it came in was very poor.</li>
            <li> Clears my face right up and heals my boyfriend&#x27;s canker sores before they get worse.</li>
            <li> AND IT LASTS VERY LONG AS LONG AS YOU ARE NOT SPRAYING TONS OF IT AT A TIME.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed since it had such great reviews.</li>
            <li> If this stuff seems overpriced to you, remember that you only use one small spray every time you use it, so the big can of it will last you a really long time.</li>
            <li> It definitely seems to speed up the healing time and there is no stinging like some other things.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely continue buying this product and look for other products they produce.  </li>
            <li> I have not used H2Ocean for any of my other piercings (ears), but when i recently got my navel pierced, it was recommended that I use it.  </li>
            <li> I have other piercings that didn&#x27;t do the same.</li>
            <li> And it helps with acne &amp; minor cuts or scrapes too!</li>
            <li> After 3 days of use my naval piercing was still extremely sore, red and not doing too well..</li>
            <li> I ran out of my other bottle the same day I received this bottle!</li>
            <li> It also has several other uses listed on a neat card that it comes packaged with.</li>
            <li> Recently I decided to get my other nostril pierced.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is to NOT over use this cause it can dry out your skin but other than that</li>
            <li> An injury got infected, and turned to what appeared to be the start of dry gangrene.  </li>
            <li> I also have a puppy who likes to lick my face/nose when I&#x27;m asleep so keeping my piercing clean is difficult at times.</li>
            <li> I also spray this into the inside of my nostril where the piercing in when my nose is dry.</li>
            <li> pat dry, apply H2ocean and then moisturize after it&#x27;s had a chance to absorb thoroughly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Spray, air dry, done.</li>
            <li> just itchy n dry n lots of crustys.</li>
            <li> Then, just let it air dry, and apply my Vitamin-E oil afterwards.</li>
            <li> I also got some Provon antimicrobial soap for cleansing &amp; keeping the areas moist as piercings on the face or basically anywhere tend to get dry and peel.</li>
            <li> and it is difficult to get a q-tip in there to clean</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry crusty from the salt at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting a rook piercing within the next few days, so I just bought a second bottle; you can never be without this item!</li>
            <li> I just sprayed at night and the next morning it dried it up and made it smaller .</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone with new or difficult piercings.</li>
            <li> I expected this to be much easier to spray on, but it only sprays aerosal or spits out droplets of saline instead of spraying it unless you hold it down, and since my piercing is a nose stud, it&#x27;s really hard to get inside my nose with.</li>
            <li> But this time, firstly, logistics was very slow.</li>
            <li> When this product arrived, my nose has not hurt a single time since and I can even remove the stud.</li>
            <li> I have not had a single issue with the functionality of this product, nor have I ever had any keloid/infection/bump when using this product.  </li>
            <li> The first few weeks it was super hot to the touch and very bloody when accidentally touched.</li>
            <li> I know the size is clearly stated, but you don&#x27;t realize how small the container is until you get it.</li>
            <li> I have used it a total of 6 times and it&#x27;s already 2/3 empty due to the leak.</li>
            <li> but the spray does dispense to a wide area which can be a bit wasteful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going to see how long it takes to finish this bottle before updating.  </li>
            <li> I thought it would never heal but H2Ocean cleared it right up in a few days and even got rid of my little bump after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and after only a day of use, the swelling is down, the redness is gone and</li>
            <li> I did, after the 3rd week I decided to bring it down to once a day...</li>
            <li> But I got a triple forward helix at least a couple months ago, and I was told that they take a very long time to heal completely and they hurt for a while!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff in the past and loved it, so I think I just got a bad can.</li>
            <li> I ordered the bigger bottle from Amazon for the same price I paid for the small bottle at the shop.  </li>
            <li> I would use it 2-3 times a day (less than the recommended 3-6) and it only lasted about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because I&#x27;m not sure how the entire healing process will go later, and it doesn&#x27;t stop the itching as the can says it does.</li>
            <li> I actually had to go back to the piercer and have him put a longer earring in because the earring was pinching my skin from being too small.</li>
            <li> Less than 3 weeks after the initial piercing the stud fell out</li>
            <li> After several weeks of using the product and starting to go without it, my industrial piercing healed itself with no more issues along the way.</li>
            <li> Have used different types of saline in the past (homemade, name brand) but definitely saw faster healing and reduced swelling w/H2Ocean.</li>
            <li> My cartilage piercing healed in half the time with daily care with this spray.</li>
            <li> Does the same thing and costs so much less.</li>
            <li> Still, I also use this stuff for other stubborn minor wounds or acne</li>
            <li> only problem I have is that you aren&#x27;t supposed to dry it or wipe it ... and it eventually dries to leave a really dried area.</li>
            <li> It got a little irritated on the third day, and then I heard about H2Ocean.  </li>
            <li> three times a day (two of these following my showers) and finish with using a Q-Tip to massage a little bit of Emu Oil around the piercing.</li>
            <li> and it only been a little over a month.</li>
            <li> i bought this as soon as i got my ears pirced and was disapointed with how little was actually in the bottle</li>
            <li> After I finished that little can, I found Amazon carries the same thing</li>
            <li> Still a little tender only been using it for 2 days</li>
            <li> bar is way to big for my little ear</li>
            <li> I have a hard time getting piercings to heal properly, and this is the 2nd try for a tragus.</li>
            <li> When I got this product I was using it twice daily and within 3 days the itching and swelling of the piercing wen down substantially!</li>
            <li> I have been using H2Ocean for over three months, spraying at least twice a day and so far the healing process is going</li>
            <li> I have a navel piercing and occasionally it gets infected, red and icky.</li>
            <li> Before being introduced to H2Ocean my piercings would do one of two things… keloid or flat out reject the jewelry all together and turn the pierced skin into a wrinkled/scarred mess.</li>
            <li> I only had it for a few days too</li>
            <li> product was just as expected.</li>
            <li> I will further review this product after a few months have passed of using it.</li>
            <li> and I expected it can work well.</li>
            <li> and it never really had a chance to sit still and heal.</li>
            <li> but this piercing has definitely healed up nicer than an eyebrow ring I had a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> After a few days my ear was almost back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got it 2 before before the expected arrival.</li>
            <li> I have had no discharge and pain has been minimal from the piercing.</li>
            <li> After only a few uses it just stops working.</li>
            <li> the same, redness/soreness gone within a few hours, infection gone within a day or two at most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li> I can not shake it up or even remotely move it without some of the contents coming out of the cap.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s getting empty</li>
            <li> I guess that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> it just seems to wet it and roll off, whereas the cotton ball keeps it there so it can soak into the skin?</li>
            <li> After a few uses this problem I had for years went away and the same applies to my nipple piercing.</li>
            <li> It made my piercing heal a lot faster than what was expected.</li>
            <li> so I never really had a reason to seek anything out.</li>
            <li> Got just what I expected.</li>
            <li> (i think a day before expected).</li>
            <li> I only have my piercing (bottom navel) soaking for a few seconds</li>
            <li> Came as expected.</li>
            <li> and it started getting irritated, my ear was getting harder around the area of the piercing and it was just all had</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not careful though on me at least it caused a build up of dry skin.</li>
            <li> Firstly, it&#x27;s a tragus piercing so soaking it is darn near impossible.</li>
            <li> It was a plain manila envelope, without any extra packaging which caused the cap to arrive shattered.</li>
            <li> Excuse my previous review.</li>
            <li> one I have minor scar tissue there from previous piercings and</li>
            <li> Though, the past 2 years, I thought it would look nice to use the third one, and boy, did it hurt when I had to push an earring through there, and after a day and night of keeping it in, hoping that my ear would get used to it, using hydrogen peroxide every few ours on my ear, and earrings, but I just couldn&#x27;t keep the earring in because it was so painful.</li>
            <li> two I later learned that I needed to wipe the piercing down with a little water on a Q-Tip</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I have sensitive skin or not, but when I used this every day, the salt in the solution dried my piercing out and caused it to bleed continuously.</li>
            <li> : I use this spray as a supplement to \\&quot;true\\&quot; saline soaks where I actually sit down for a few minutes and soak the piercing with the aid of a shot glass.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t hurt either (with a little baby lotion around my ear -not near the piercing though-got rid of the dryness)</li>
            <li> My friend had a bubble on her belly button piercing area due to a &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; belly ring and used this</li>
            <li> It said that it can be used on other things like skin rashes and acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using H2ocean with small amount of neosporin on the outside of the piercing.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t the immediate relief I&#x27;ve seen in other reviews, but there was a noticeable difference after 24 hrs.</li>
            <li> I used Rx prescription ointment, Dermawound, and other wound \\&quot;healers.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It helped my belly piercing healed faster than any other product.</li>
            <li> and i also use it for other nicks and cuts i get around the office.</li>
            <li> I bought this because i felt like the other wash wasn&#x27;t doing anything.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s due solely to this solution, because I used Provon soap and a bioflex stud too -</li>
            <li> I got a lemon and it cant be returned due to shipping specs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The healing process has been a breeze unlike my other piercings when I didn&#x27;t use this product.</li>
            <li> but when they got here, one didn&#x27;t have the spray nozzle and the other one, the nozzle broke off.</li>
            <li> tried tea tree oil, sea salt, some other crappy piercing care solution, and even soaked my nose in chamomile.</li>
            <li> and i know it was due to this product</li>
            <li> After getting my nose pierced I was experiencing extreme redness, swelling, discomfort, and the formation of the \\&quot;bump\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> No worries, I just had sharp pieces of metal shoved into my body, of course my immune system is freaking out.</li>
            <li> but it would not go away and was not pretty to look at.</li>
            <li> the other piercing  </li>
            <li> It is sitting in my vanity, unusable, due to the faulty spray mechanism.</li>
            <li> w/soap was making them extremely tender.</li>
            <li> so, I looked into other products.</li>
            <li> Use provon in the shower and this for the other cleanings.</li>
            <li> Other than that it seems to be doing its job.  </li>
            <li> can since my other was gone.</li>
            <li> keep your mouth closed!)</li>
            <li> This helped him a lot, when other products couldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Other sprays seem to dump out streams of the solution with each spray, and I used to go through a can in a week.</li>
            <li> This seller sent this can to me DENTED in 2 spots, and the nozzle did not spray- it only leaked out small amounts of the solution.</li>
            <li> has healed quicker  with the other things I do to care for it</li>
            <li> : got one the other week and the spray nozzle does not work so nothing is coming out.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> (I read some other reviews where people have ran out and stopped using it and they got infected...)</li>
            <li> I recently bought another bottle of this because my small one that was given to my by my piercer ran out.</li>
            <li> I have not have any rashes, bumps, lumps, or any other piercing issues.</li>
            <li> It did dry out my skin in the surrounding area, but nothing a little lotion couldn&#x27;t fix.  </li>
            <li> I spray a little of this on my ears and let dry - it automatically helps and it stops hurting.</li>
            <li> Others who I have spoken, have used other products or very minimal care, which resulted in infection or irritation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also very careful at what I do.</li>
            <li> If you use this stuff when you get cut it will heal without a scar or a very minimal one.</li>
            <li> Only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is that it is a spray, and is a tad messy when you spray it on ear piercings (runs down the ear/neck!).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few issues with the skin around my navel getting dry and flaky; this was for 2 reasons:</li>
            <li> , one didn&#x27;t have a cap on and was half empty.</li>
            <li> quickly, less than the expected</li>
            <li> My nose piercing FINALLY isn&#x27;t getting infected, which is really a first because the last two times, I soaked the crap out of my piercing and they still got infected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I decided to get H2Ocean to speed the recovery with minerals and other healing enzymes and overnight the swelling went down drastically.</li>
            <li> Lid on the bottle was a little dirty upon arrival like it wasn&#x27;t kept in clean conditions before it was shipped, and the lid was also slightly cracked and wouldn&#x27;t stay on the bottle.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect super-fast miracles, give it at least several hours, because your body takes time to heal anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had several dermal piercings the past few years</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> Its the easiest for travel &amp; not having enough time to mix salt &amp; water when youre late for work</li>
            <li> Not worth it</li>
            <li> Since a big part of getting piercings to heal is to keep the skin from fusing with earrings, I think this is a negative for this</li>
            <li> but it really is wrth every penny i had my belly button pierced by a total idiot who told me to wash it out with espom salts only</li>
            <li> I know it takes about 6-9 months for a belly button to heal and I am a slow healer so this was a definite lifesaver!</li>
            <li> even after a few days of tries.</li>
            <li> After two applications of this yesterday, the swelling is completely gone and the soreness has decreased dramatically.</li>
            <li> Within two days the swelling and heat had gone down.</li>
            <li> I would def recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for something to help bring the redness down and to speed up the healing process.</li>
            <li> It cut down on the healing time needed both times</li>
            <li> So I was down to 1 bottle.</li>
            <li> my swelling went down, the redness and soreness were all but gone, as well.</li>
            <li> The redness and the bump is already going down after doing this 3 times at 15 minutes each time.</li>
            <li> It made the swelling in my lip go down</li>
            <li> I had the piercing for about 5 weeks and the swelling of my piercing was not going down.</li>
            <li> I broke down and bought this.</li>
            <li> I took off the nozzle to see if the piece underneath would push down, and it did...</li>
            <li> My ear swelling has went down after 3 uses, and so has a lot of the soreness.</li>
            <li> and now I&#x27;m down to about 2x a day unless I feel it needs a cleaning.</li>
            <li> know this spray is a little pricier than some other options</li>
            <li> This product cuts down healing time by half.</li>
            <li> The other one have the spray dried all over.</li>
            <li> my ears were VERY sore, and the left one was even swollen really bad.</li>
            <li> and it cleared up in less than a week.</li>
            <li> However, like a previous review said, this isnt an antibiotic solution.</li>
            <li> The pain is less than half of what it was</li>
            <li> With a day my naval was noticeably less irritated and sore.</li>
            <li> I ran out in less than a month after using 2-4 times per day sparingly.</li>
            <li> Neither of them came with seals like the previous one did.</li>
            <li> I noticed a decrease in swelling and there was much less pain.  </li>
            <li> I love the product but the actual spray can is terrible.</li>
            <li> I used this spray at the suggestion of my piercer for my industrial and it cut my healing time in half.</li>
            <li> I googled found this and in less than a week or two...</li>
            <li> i dont know why i never got this for my previous piercings.</li>
            <li> a half ANYWAY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using H2Ocean for less than 24 hours and all the soreness is gone and</li>
            <li> Does it work and is it less hassle than what the piercers give you?</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t find it for like half an hour, and having read a lot about how nose piercings close in minutes</li>
            <li> i typically use the product after i&#x27;ve washed my face or taken a shower.  </li>
            <li> Whenever there is any slight pain I spray some on my ear and within minutes the pain goes away.</li>
            <li> I swear I&#x27;ve lost half the product just from leakage.</li>
            <li> but you can do it yourself for less money.</li>
            <li> My industrial piercing was having a hard time healing over and would be prone to getting infected (probably because no matter how careful I am with my hairspray, it gets in the way and my hair is sorta everywhere to begin with so that attracts dirt and other things).</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to mess around with heating distilled water and adding salt, like my piercer told me to, so</li>
            <li> : Spray your piercing with H2Ocean at least 4 times a day to sterilize and moisturize the area as long as your piercing is healing.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t sting or smell bad but be careful --- it goes fast!</li>
            <li> My industrial healed in half the time my piercer suggested it would take and all I did was use this spray everyday.</li>
            <li> This took the swelling down in a few days of using a few times a day.  </li>
            <li> Just spray the piercing itslef and take a little cotton swab and wipe it.</li>
            <li> I tampered with it a little and just couldn&#x27;t get it to work.</li>
            <li> has felt a little irritated after using it for 2 days now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little nervous to use them becuase of no seals.</li>
            <li> It popped a little, and I kept cleaning it.</li>
            <li> I got my tragus pierced a little over a week ago.  </li>
            <li> I had a little pimple forming and sprayed that too.  </li>
            <li> have been wanting to get a triple helix for a while but hesitated because other cartilage-type piercings have not gone well for me in the past, BUT this product is giving me confidence to try again.</li>
            <li> Obviously an infection is never good, but when it is in the middle of your face for everone to see, it&#x27;s even worse.  </li>
            <li> Does leak a little when shaking.</li>
            <li> and it even started to grow one of those little bumps:</li>
            <li> so I switched to just the sea salt soak but saw little results</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed and tried to return, BUT this kind of item cannot be returned as a policy from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Within a few weeks it looked a little infected and</li>
            <li> The spray is a little messy, so i gave it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> multiple cans)&lt;br /&gt;-Can waste - cans are not reusable (they are recyclable, at the very least)</li>
            <li> The product was so useful and helpful in my process of healing a bad piercing.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I continue to use it multiple times a day whenever I feel itching or irritation, but I have recently purchased another product that is a liquid soap called Crazy Chameleon piercing cleanser from [...]</li>
            <li> I will never again get pierced without having already purchased a few cans of this, and would recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s about to get any sort of piercing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too few people know about it and 2)</li>
            <li> It is marketed in too narrow a way.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t rub or use gauze, I just spritz this stuff on liberally a few times a day.  </li>
            <li> and the wound is shrinking as it dries from the edges and the dead stuff falls away</li>
            <li> I just forget to use it everyday</li>
            <li> However, my navel piercing has not caused me one bit of trouble and I think it is because of this product.  </li>
            <li> waste of money.</li>
            <li> I never gave a 3 star or below before but this time it wasted my money.  </li>
            <li> After changing out the jewelry (it WAS healed inside) cleaning and giving it a few spritzes, the redness and irritation was just about GONE.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just saying h2Ocean dried my piercing out.</li>
            <li> two weeks of using this a few times a day</li>
            <li> are too harsh.</li>
            <li> if it gets infected after a few sprays the infection goes away&lt;br /</li>
            <li> After using H2Ocean everyday, it began to heal within a week</li>
            <li> and I use this everyday  to prevent infection.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d try again every few weeks-same thing.</li>
            <li> I use it in conjunction with coconut oil to add moisture after this has dried up.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll waste your money trying to care for your piercings yourself.</li>
            <li> I have had nothing but trouble with this piercing.  </li>
            <li> I was using dried my ear up too sore to even touch.</li>
            <li> It had the spray button, but the piece that goes from the button to the can was missing.</li>
            <li> Although I had the piercing for years randomly I would get keloids inside my nose or a bump near the piercing.</li>
            <li> although I had it for three years it was like a game of russian roulette sometimes it would get inflamed or</li>
            <li> Using harsh chemicals like alcohol and peroxide can cause scarring and irritation.</li>
            <li> probably not its intended use, but i find it has healing properties for my everyday as well.</li>
            <li> Its messy though.</li>
            <li> I got my ear pierced and was using the saline solution they gave me and was having a lot of trouble with pain and swelling and even bleeding because it just wouldn&#x27;t heal.  </li>
            <li> Since then I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with the swelling, pain or bleeding.  </li>
            <li> It didnt work as well as I hoped &amp; its NOT a cheap product for the amount you get.</li>
            <li> I tried a few products including a q-tip medicine formula and man</li>
            <li> I try and do a soak a few times a week, but for the times when I&#x27;m in a hurry, I just spray this on and go.</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan.</li>
            <li> I use the spray at least 6 times/ day -- never less because I&#x27;m afraid of infection later.</li>
            <li> i also spritz it on parts of my face if i have a slight redness (not my eyes!</li>
            <li> Whether it was due to the post office or the seller, I am not sure, regardless, I was not pleased with the shipping.</li>
            <li> of gotten me through till this came in, but since it was so late I ran out and didn&#x27;t have anything to wash it with other than soap, but that&#x27;s messy</li>
            <li> Some people prefer to buy plain sea salt</li>
            <li> Occasionally I would also break out in ugly ol&#x27; pimplos and bumpity bumps and this makes swelling from piercings or swellings in general</li>
            <li> I was desperate and started searching the web for products and this product had high reviews.  </li>
            <li> I just wish it was either a bigger can or less expensive.</li>
            <li> I got dermal on the back of my neck and it is hard to take care since that is such an awkward area to have piercing.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s started looking pretty bad again</li>
            <li> H2Ocean is very expensive, and there are much cheaper alternatives that work just as well</li>
            <li> Also, in less dramatic news:  for old piercings that get infected or annoyed by say..cheap earrings (not that I know anyone who would have that problem :D)-a spritz of this and your worries are over.  </li>
            <li> I developed a nasty keloid on the upper part of the industrial and the piercing overall was just irritated up until I bought this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bump seriously went down in less than a day!</li>
            <li> It was swollen, red, and so painful I could barely open my jaw!</li>
            <li> Nevertheless I was frustrated and decided enough was enough.</li>
            <li> but then my little bump disappeared!</li>
            <li> The itching was intense, and so bad I thought about removing the jewelry.  </li>
            <li> No more inflammation or redness.</li>
            <li> the pain is no more.</li>
            <li> piercer had given me a small packet of sea salt to use, but it wasn&#x27;t doing anything for me</li>
            <li> I recently got my rook pierced and found it difficult to keep the bottom hole cleaned.</li>
            <li> no more crustys and the piercing is clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually get an allergic reaction from everything I use, but not this.</li>
            <li> I knew that crusties and lymph are always going to be present but the amount of it was indicating something was wrong.</li>
            <li> The bottle is small enought to carry in my bag.</li>
            <li> sting like usually salt water</li>
            <li> I USUALLY JUST SPRAY THEM</li>
            <li> No more bump, no more swelling.</li>
            <li> I have no more soreness</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no redness, no pain (even when I accidentally hit/snag it or when I wiggle and scrunch up my nose), and no more crusties.&lt;br</li>
            <li> bottle says to use it 3-6 times a day, but I usually just use it after I shower in the morning</li>
            <li> and that really sucks because it wastes your money.</li>
            <li> However, I am not sure how well it disinfected and helped with the healing process.</li>
            <li> I had received the small size (1.5ounce) from my piercer.  </li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;m not sure what happened</li>
            <li> I spent $18 dollars and waited 4 days for it to arrive at my house broken..</li>
            <li> I have had a bump for the past 3, even with increasing the use of H2Ocean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen some improvement in my skin in the past couple of weeks, but I hesitate to write that,</li>
            <li> As a supplement to your usual regiment</li>
            <li> you just got peirced or are having trouble with an infected piercing, BUY H2OCEAN!  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical this product would work as I have tried numerous things to try to help heal my helix that I&#x27;ve had for months with no luck.</li>
            <li> No more alcohol for me.</li>
            <li> perhaps a small keloid and</li>
            <li> and I was never really sure it was getting into the hole.</li>
            <li> and then I noticed a small bump growing.  </li>
            <li> I was always just told to wash it with antibacterial (usually DIAL) soap twice a day.</li>
            <li> When I got my nose pierced while on vacation a few years ago they gave me a small can of this and told me to use it at least 3 times a day.</li>
            <li> ever since the body piercer recommended this product for my cartilage ear piercing, i&#x27;ve been using this product for the past five years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for the past 3 years</li>
            <li> The first day was horrible as you can imagine my nipples were very red and sore</li>
            <li> so you are not touching the piercing with your hands.</li>
            <li> , I had a broken ear ring due to the chemicals in the&lt;br /&gt;spray</li>
            <li> The second time I got my ears pierced, I actually used hydrogen peroxide (which I now know was stupid), and my ears, yet again, got infected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My new piercing was infected and PAINFUL</li>
            <li> Even when my piercing is swollen and looks like it getting that dreadful bump, this stuff takes it right down without irritation.</li>
            <li> but it was stuck and not matter how hard I tried it would work.</li>
            <li> But it wasn&#x27;t a hard process.</li>
            <li> So, it&#x27;s hard to coat a q-tip or even a cotton ball with the sea salt and do a soak.</li>
            <li> I got my belly pierced and it was hard to do the salt soaks that they recommended to do.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s hard to use a product when the bottle doesn&#x27;t even work.</li>
            <li> After receiving anti biotics from my doctor and completing the course the infection had reduced but had left behind a nasty (fairly large) keloid.</li>
            <li> I ended up throwing it out which sucks.</li>
            <li> I will also have dirty dishwater occasionally get on my shirt around my navel</li>
            <li> so I tend to get kinda icky from working</li>
            <li> Such a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I also recently used it when I got a cold</li>
            <li> and it takes over a year (for me at least) to use up.</li>
            <li> I continue spritzing the H2ocean on my lobes at least once a day even after they&#x27;re healed.</li>
            <li> and it works wonders for me at least.</li>
            <li> or if thats common w</li>
            <li> At least 10.</li>
            <li> and they take at least 2 weeks before they stop being sore and 6 weeks to heal.</li>
            <li> This product is a saving grace for slow to heal piercings.  </li>
            <li> and I must say, my cartilage piercing bump is slowly disappearing,</li>
            <li> As much as I was sick and tired of the complications my piercings were giving me, I didnt want to lose them</li>
            <li> However, the bottle leaks BADLY due to its bad design, thus the overall experience is poor.</li>
            <li> I do not know what &amp;#34;aftercare&amp;#34; is supposed to mean.</li>
            <li> I mean zero.</li>
            <li> but no more!</li>
            <li> No more sea salt soaks for me!</li>
            <li> no more redness!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, the product I received was so poorly made that the spray nozzle was broken within less than 24 hours.</li>
            <li> but I mean seriously...</li>
            <li> and my ears are very sensitive, so it often gets unhappy with me when I sleep on my ear wrong causing a bubble to form.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the problem was but H2O did not help any, if anything it made it worse.</li>
            <li> then the nozzle stopped working now is COMPLETLY broken :/</li>
            <li> Seriously, I could not touch the ear at all without pain, and cleaning it was excruciating.</li>
            <li> For serious infections, google sea salt soaking for piercings.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> Seriously the people who gave this a one star must not know how to use this.</li>
            <li> The upper ear is an impossibly place to do the salt water soak reccomended by almost all piercers, that&#x27;s where this spray comes in.</li>
            <li> Seriously, the reviews do not lie.  </li>
            <li> I was getting super frustrated with this nasty red bump on my nose.</li>
            <li> People I know have gotten the worst reactions from unprofessional piercing and aftercare advice, and I always recommend them this product to fix whatever problems they have, and it never fails!</li>
            <li> i loooove this stuff and it may be a little bit on the expensive side</li>
            <li> It was swollen, and had an ugly red bump surrounding the piercing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t ever use the solutions they provide because they are not good for you at all.</li>
            <li> My snug was red, swollen and painful.</li>
            <li> solution works well after heavy sweating or if the piercing just starts to randomly itch</li>
            <li> I was afraid I would get a 1.5 oz because of other reviews</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my piercing for almost 2 years now, and every time it gets unhappy due to sleeping on it</li>
            <li> I know this because the first time I had it pierced after 6 months of it hurting and ripping and just looking disgusting</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because in the past, alcohol or peroxide was used.</li>
            <li> and it was awkward to put my ear in a little bowl.</li>
            <li> today, months later, if I accidentally snag my nose stud on something or do something stupid where it falls out, H2Ocean saves the day!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It has absolutely saved my ears from keloids and nasty infections every step of the way.</li>
            <li> It just got worse.  </li>
            <li> Even worse, the spray head is broken and can&#x27;t be used at all.</li>
            <li> I babied the piercings and they were just getting worse.</li>
            <li> Got tired of trying to hold my head sideways in a bowl of salt water.  </li>
            <li> and it was irritating the inside of my nose and drying out the skin on the outside.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this was broken when it was mailed in.</li>
            <li> It is totally unnecessary.</li>
            <li> Sprayer has broken on two out of two bottles.</li>
            <li> and it just got worse and worse, with my ears peeling skin where ever this stuff had touched it (not even close to the piercing,</li>
            <li> I have no clue if it was clogged or broken</li>
            <li> The lack of care when mailing gave me a poor inpression of this seller.</li>
            <li> It made it worse.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone dealing with irritating razor bumps</li>
            <li> But if you have a serious infection, do not use this!</li>
            <li> This is ridiculous!</li>
            <li> it was ridiculous!</li>
            <li> It cleared it up in just a few days, and no more annoying sea salt soaks.</li>
            <li> saw the doc about 3 days after I started using it, so it looked much less angry and dangerous</li>
            <li> Ive been having a lot of trouble cleaning my industrial piercings, if you know its a very difficult piece to take care of.</li>
            <li> It was huge, painful and disgusting.</li>
            <li> Mind you, this is a slow process, we&#x27;re several weeks in, but his prognosis was very grim..</li>
            <li> It did help my piercings, I am just disappointed about the hassle and the other 2 bottles.</li>
            <li> it was STILL red &amp; swollen with an ugly bump that wouldn&#x27;t go away!</li>
            <li> It was so gross and painful!</li>
            <li> Cleared up a nasty infection I got from an old cartridge piercing.</li>
            <li> Over all I&#x27;m very angry and not satisfied.</li>
            <li> I use to hate getting piercings to due to the fact that I would always get bumps and then the earring would become irrated</li>
            <li> unfortunately this made my navel piecing 10 times worse ill stick to sea salt</li>
            <li> A little disappointed.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of money :(</li>
            <li> I had a nasty bump by my nose piercing for the past few days.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about how \\&quot;wonderful\\&quot; H2Ocean was supposed to be.  </li>
            <li> But unfortunately I work in a job where I wear a 1 headphone headset for 12 hours.</li>
            <li> I had only had it for about 2 months and a nasty bump popped up.  </li>
            <li> a nasty looking inflammation appeared around the piercing (she knows the medical term for it, I don&#x27;t).  </li>
            <li> but I was extremely skeptical.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-A bit expensive (4 oz.</li>
            <li> and I had no idea what was wrong.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t work at all after pressing the button.</li>
            <li> Spraying this up my nose was weird but easier than soaking.</li>
            <li> i was wrong.....</li>
            <li> ever since i use this spray for my piercing, it grow worse than ever and so does my friend&#x27;s piercing!</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> That is completely useless to me.</li>
            <li> I work out a lot and the sweat would make my nose all nasty and red</li>
            <li> I came across h2ocean, and even though I was skeptical because all of the failed remedies I&#x27;ve already tried, I gave it a shot.</li>
            <li> I just recently recieved this product and the packaging was kinda boring</li>
            <li> So needless to say</li>
            <li> (I know it sounds weird, it helped with the swelling</li>
            <li> However, maybe I am allergic to this product or something, but I have had horrible instant reactions to it.</li>
            <li> There was nothing wrong</li>
            <li> , don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> them and know what&#x27;s wrong than get an infection.</li>
            <li> I normally am fearful of getting piercings due to sometimes keloiding</li>
            <li> It did not prevent me from getting a bump on my nose piercing because I was unlucky and got my stud caught in the tissue as I was trying to blow my nose after coming down with a horrible virus.</li>
            <li> I purchased this essentially as a desperate measure in desperate times caring for my father&#x27;s foot.  </li>
            <li> When in the shower, wash your piercing with unscented, pH-balanced, anti-bacterial soap.&lt;br /&gt;Never touch your piercing with dirty hands, never let anyone else touch your piercing with dirty hands/ etc, and don&#x27;t be unhygienic in any way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have no had blood blisters since or crazy</li>
            <li> I had planned for years on getting my nose pierced, but never did it because I was afraid of the infection.</li>
            <li> I bought this after fighting with an unhappy cartilage piercing.</li>
            <li> It makes all the difference in the world trying to sleep at night with an angry and painful piercing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d pack this stuff in to use when I&#x27;d accidentally get bug spray around the piercing, or have an itch with dirty hands, etc.  </li>
            <li> My piercing has been healed in few days!!!!!</li>
            <li> That made it worse!!</li>
            <li> Expensive and pricey!</li>
            <li> I was so angry and disappointed I contacted Amazon and they refunded me the money.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s difficult to ship!</li>
            <li> So after through research, I learned that the common recommendations for navel piercing cleaning (bactine, just antibacterial soap &amp; water, etc.) were actually terrible methods for cleaning piercings.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s painful and usually impossible to get rid of.</li>
            <li> Bad news</li>
            <li> Really a bad experience.</li>
            <li> Bad shopping experience.</li>
            <li> and I got a bad infection.</li>
            <li> About a week ago my piercing suffered some trauma from the jewelry snagging on my pillow, and it flared up really bad.</li>
            <li> I had to have my piercing removed at the shop after 2 days because of how bad the swelling was.</li>
            <li> can before things got really bad with my ears.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it was just bad luck.</li>
            <li> My nipples are nothing to play around with, so to speak, and I wanted this stuff before things got too bad.</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> too bad i took out my nose ring</li>
            <li> Nowadays it doesn&#x27;t hurt nearly as bad even when it occassionally does get pulled.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my frustrated nose piercing.  </li>
            <li> It swelled up and was so painful.</li>
            <li> I ended up giving up on the piercing because I was so frustrated.</li>
            <li> I learned that sea salt soaks help to reduce the swelling and soreness but after a while I grew sick of having to sit with a cup of solution suctioned to my piercings.</li>
            <li> This caused the skin around the dermal to become terribly inflamed and the skin around my piercing was nasty, dark, and crusty.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I feel like I lost a lot of product. :-(</li>
            <li> I was desperate!  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy</li>
            <li> Within a week my annoying bump was gone.  </li>
            <li> After about a week my ears were bloody, then it escalated to pus &amp; swelling</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had some idiot piercers tell me that I don&#x27;t need this, because ______ will do.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> so I am very disappointed with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t even use it came to my house broken !!!!</li>
            <li> So annoyed!!!!</li>
            <li> Worst thing ever !!!!</li>
            <li> The worst product I have ever used for piercings.</li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>
            <li> and I hate doing that!</li>
            <li> got a nasty looking blood boil and</li>
            <li> At Ricky&#x27;s the can leakage was insane.  </li>
            <li> Very annoying.</li>
            <li> just sitting there hurt insanely!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have used this for numerous piercings and it helps them heal so much faster ! I recommend this to anyone who is newly pierced .</li>
            <li> Like the product but it pools up a bit in the rings of the container after you spray it. Feels like I&#x27;m wasting it.</li>
            <li> No brainer for new piercings&lt;br /&gt;Must have for healing or if irritated&lt;br /&gt;Worth buying &amp; using vs. home remedies</li>
            <li> Well worth the price, easy to use and the quality of this product is excellent.</li>
            <li> So much easier than a saltwater rinse</li>
            <li> It cleaned my nose piercing really well and also my belly piercing. My friend had a bubble on her belly button piercing area due to a &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; belly ring and used this and it cleared up in less than a week. It&#x27;s easy to use compared to making your own sea salt mixture yourself.</li>
            <li> My piercings have healed very fast after using this! Lasted for about 8 months very much is used. Very good spray.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I use it on all my piercings and never had any problem with it! I just got my helix pierced yesterday and it has not been sore or anything!</li>
            <li> was scared that the spray button would break like the reviews said but my hasn&#x27;t! Glad I purchased it. Works well.</li>
            <li> It works great...healing my piercing really good(:&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to everyone with fresh piercings.&lt;br /&gt;Got it in a week</li>
            <li> The attached pic is after three days of use. I don&#x27;t think I need to say anything else but...THANK YOU!!!</li>
            <li> My 2 month old nose piercing was bleeding and oozing after I got a Biore nose strip stuck to it. It was so gross-looking I thought it would never heal but H2Ocean cleared it right up in a few days and even got rid of my little bump after a few weeks. I just had a problem changing my stud and it&#x27;s started looking pretty bad again but I&#x27;m not worried because I have H2Ocean by my side. It&#x27;s definitely something anybody with piercings should keep well-stocked always!</li>
            <li> This product has been the best thing i couldve used and i still currently use it, i have very sensitive skin and have had great success with this product.  Works well also with the Tattoo Goo anti-bac wash for tats &amp; piercings the perfect treatment combo.</li>
            <li> I was using a saline solution to clean my nose piercing and it got really infected (I guess working as a bartender and forgetting you have it in then touching your nose doesn&#x27;t help). I bought this stuff because a friend recommended it to me and it cleared up my infection very quickly! I would 100% recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> this product is amazing. I&#x27;ve had several piercings over the years and never hand any heal half as fast as they do using this product.  My industrial healed in half the time my piercer suggested it would take and all I did was use this spray everyday. All natural and definitely the way to go. I keep it on hand all the time</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I&#x27;m only bummed this wasn&#x27;t around 17 years ago when I started getting piercings. I use it mostly for my stretched ear lobes, it soothes them and takes care of any irritations, like if I sleep on one side wrong.</li>
            <li> H2Ocean definitely works, but I can&#x27;t say it works better than any other sterile saline solution. Before I bought this I was using wound wash from CVS, and it really did the same thing for half the cost for double the solution. H2Ocean is very expensive, and there are much cheaper alternatives that work just as well</li>
            <li> I was told my the piercer that this stuff is great for helping in the healing process.  It definitely seems to speed up the healing time and there is no stinging like some other things.  I will definitely order this anytime I get a piercing.</li>
            <li> I wanted to make sure my piercings that I got were well taken care of. I reviewed and searched online for best piercing aftercare solutions. I use this 3 times a day along with Provon antimicrobial soap twice a day. Both are great and leave my piercings feeling/smelling fresh. I&#x27;ve had no problems with using either. Love both and wouldrecommend either/both to others with piercings.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this stuff. my belly button wouldnt have healed without it. I know this because the first time I had it pierced after 6 months of it hurting and ripping and just looking disgusting I took the piercing out to let it heal up and when I got it redone, I immidiately used this h2ocean multiple times a day and I swear it healed in a month.</li>
            <li> This product did not help my nose piercing.</li>
            <li> Got item pretty fast! love it! works great! and prevents my nose piercing from getting infected. I will be getting some more soon!</li>
            <li> I swear by this stuff. I&#x27;ve only ever used this (and recomended hand soaps) to clean any of my piercings and this keeps them very clean. Plus It&#x27;s a lot easier then making your own sea salt soaks too.  (ya know, in case you didn&#x27;t trust the 60-something other people that told you so ;)  )</li>
            <li> I got the product super fast and it was brand new as it said. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks now and have never had a problem with it!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about how \\&quot;wonderful\\&quot; H2Ocean was supposed to be.  But I have been using it for under a week and have noticed great results.  I had both of my Tragus pierced in July, one has healed perfectly.  But unfortunately I work in a job where I wear a 1 headphone headset for 12 hours. So the other ear was not healing and starting to look infected - it was swelled, red, sensitive to touch, had a bump next to the jewelery, and discharge. I was desperate and started searching the web for products and this product had high reviews.  I placed the order the morning of Oct. 6th and received it Oct. 7th.  I started using it immediately!  My ear no longer looks infected - no redness, no pain, the bump is gone, now has very minimal normal clear discharge and the swelling has drastically reduced. It&#x27;s well on its way to a healthy healing.&lt;br /&gt;Inside the box was an information leaflet about how to properly care for a piercing and all of the uses for H2Ocean. It said that it can be used on other things like skin rashes and acne. I have been diagnosed with a very mild psoriasis - just small patch about the size of a silver dollar. Again, out of desperation for a solution, I started spraying H2Ocean on it as well. I&#x27;m not going to say this will cure it, but I have seen a significant positive difference in how it looks. It appears to be clearing up. It&#x27;s not as dry or scaly, not raised, not as tender and not near as red. I will definitely continue buying this product and look for other products they produce.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I started using the H2Ocean spray just hours after my new microdermal anchor piercing (which is now 3 days old) and there is absolutely no redness or swelling. I didn&#x27;t use it right away with my first anchor piercing, and it took over 2 weeks for the redness and swelling to go down. I&#x27;m also using it to help heal a deep wound from having my first anchor piercing removed. The removal left me with a big crater below my collarbone and the H2Ocean is significantly speeding along the healing process. The hole was big enough that I contemplated getting stitches, but the skin is actually regenerating itself to close over the wound and it&#x27;s happening quite rapidly. So, yeah... I&#x27;m pretty sure this stuff is magical. Cheers!</li>
            <li> I read all of the great reviews about H2Ocean prior to buying it. Now that I have tried it out for myself, the product is amazing! I bought H2Ocean for my industrial piercing because one side was still swollen after using tea tree oil. Immediately after spraying it on, I felt as if my whole ear had been cooled down. I noticed the difference quickly, and now, after 2 weeks, the swelling is almost gone! The product itself it great! HOWEVER, I would never purchase something that I expect to receive quickly such as a birthday gift because I received my package 5 days after the date the seller had given me. Whether it was due to the post office or the seller, I am not sure, regardless, I was not pleased with the shipping.</li>
            <li> Perfect for and Industrial bar!</li>
            <li> This makes things so much easier when having to clean my piercing. It makes the cleaning process a lot quicker.</li>
            <li> Even after 3 months of getting my ear pierced, I was still trying to get rid of the redness and inflammation. I researched a lot and figured that I shouldn&#x27;t be using an anti-bacterial near the area cause it might close my new piercing. When I came across this product, I really didn&#x27;t mind spending a few bucks to get my ear to feel normal again. AND IT WORKED! In just 3 days my ear was touchable again. No more inflammation or redness. I continued to use it twice a week and  now I use it just for the fun of it. It is a great product if you have pain and redness near your new piercing. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my frustrated nose piercing.  I had only had it for about 2 months and a nasty bump popped up.  I went to see the piercer to have it looked at and he said it was a keloid.  He told me just to keep soaking it with my sea salt mixed with warm water.  Anyone who has a nose piercing knows how much of a pain that is.  It took to much time and was just an inconvenience.  So I remembered the product H2ocean Body Piercing Spray that I used on my navel piercing.  Found it here on Amazon and bought it.  Not only does work but it just feels refreshing and clean.  Within a week my annoying bump was gone.  It&#x27;s just a brilliant product and I suggest it for anyone with a piercing.</li>
            <li> I pierced my cartilage, and it was healing well at first. All of a sudden, it started bleeding one day. I went back to the piercer, and he told me it was probably torn by accidentally sleeping on it, and that it would heal up just fine. It didn&#x27;t. It was swollen, and had an ugly red bump surrounding the piercing. I bought this product, and used it a couple weeks, and it has been perfectly healed! If you have any problems with piercings, this is the product to buy. You can&#x27;t beat the price for the work it does! This product also heals cuts, scrapes, burns, razor burn, and acne!</li>
            <li> When I got my belly button pierced, the piercer said to use antibacterial soap to clean it, which made the area really red, and I knew hydrogen peroxide was too harsh. When I found out about H2Ocean and saw all the good reviews, I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot. I&#x27;ve been using H2ocean with small amount of neosporin on the outside of the piercing. It hasn&#x27;t been red, it remains clean, and hasn&#x27;t been infected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked just as I had hoped, it&#x27;s a good price, and I hightly recommend it.</li>
            <li> H2Ocean is a great product; it helped my piercing heal very fast. I was not convinced it would make so much of a difference, but purchased it any way. It makes a difference in a matter of a day or two is all, and if your piercing beings to show signs of infection, you simply need to spray it a couple times before it looks okay again. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Every time I get a new piecing I make sure to be stocked up on h2ocean this stuff makes the healing process so much more comfortable and fast with little to no compilations</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second can now. Works better than anything else I&#x27;ve used! It&#x27;s gentle and effective. :)</li>
            <li> Great it help with my dimple piercing</li>
            <li> Strongly recommended for belly button piercings because it is much easier to use compared to the salt water mixture in a cup.  I have been using H2Ocean for over three months, spraying at least twice a day and so far the healing process is going well, no infections!!</li>
            <li> Do you have a piercing?  Do you want it to spew pus?  If you answered Yes then No, you&#x27;re in my boat and you should buy this product.  ESPECIALLY if your piercing is supposed to take more than two months to heal (otherwise, buy the smaller version, because you probably won&#x27;t need any more).  This stuff clears up infections like a boss, not to mention it holds them off if you use it regularly and don&#x27;t fiddle with your piercing/let others touch the cool new piercing/drag it through landfills.  A lot of people will suggest Bactine, hydrogen peroxide solutions, et cetera?  Laugh at them.  Most of those slow down the healing process and aren&#x27;t as effective with infections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take it from an experienced piercee.  This is cheap, sterile, and extremely well-produced.  It will rock your world.</li>
            <li> Best piercing after care I&#x27;ve purchased!</li>
            <li> My wife had her nose pieced over 2 months ago.  Within a few weeks it looked a little infected and a nasty looking inflammation appeared around the piercing (she knows the medical term for it, I don&#x27;t).  She cleaned it with sea salt up to 6 times a day which seemed to do nothing.  I stumbled upon this product while searching for quality nose ring and read some of the overwhelmingly positive reviews.  I made the purchase but I was extremely skeptical.  Well it&#x27;s been about 3 days since she starting using it and the irritation has almost completely disappeared.  I&#x27;m very impressed with this product!  I think I earned some brownie points with my wife too.</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever!!! It helps so much and makes healing so much quicker and easier. I recommend this to anyone getting a new piercing.</li>
            <li> I had my belly pierced for 3 weeks it was turning purple and it hurt at the touch I cleaned it regularly as the tattoo places said and still got infected I seen the reviews for this product and figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt. I purchased it not thinking it would do much within three days of using it it it now the came color as my skin amd healing so nicely. I would recommend this to anyone with any piercing!!!! I will continue to buy it!!</li>
            <li> One of my new piercing regimens i swear by. I feel the healing process is accelerated with this spray</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic. My tragus piercing got super irritated and inflamed 2 weeks after having it done. It was swollen, red, and so painful I could barely open my jaw! I ordered this and after only a day of use, the swelling is down, the redness is gone and the pain is no more. While waiting for this to arrive, I was soaking my ear in sea salt and that helped, but this method is not nearly as messy and works much better for the pain and inflammation. I wish I would have known about this prior to having my piercing done so I could have used it from day 1.</li>
            <li> Works well, but warm water from the sink and some $1.50 salt from Walmart works just as well.</li>
            <li> Love the product, Amazon sells it cheaper than most piercing places!</li>
            <li> The only reason why I am giving the product a five star is because it works wonders for piercings. It  healed my belly piercing wonderfully. When I first ordered this product I bought it exactly from the Company, not from Amazon and it never gave me any problem whatsoever.  The second time I purchased this item it was from Amazon and when I used it I got nothing but air coming from the bottle. I shook it and a mixture of air and the substance came out. Then all of a sudden the spray dispenser stopped working all of a sudden. I tried fixing it but it was stuck and not matter how hard I tried it would work. I was sooooo pissed. With that being said it&#x27;s a excellent product just got a defected one.</li>
            <li> I love H2Ocean! I use it to help clean my navel piercing. It&#x27;s a nice efficient way to ensure your piercing stays clean. Although, you shouldn&#x27;t make it your main source for cleaning.</li>
            <li> As the title states, this is the only solution that works for me piercings. I&#x27;ve had 7 piercings that never healed using other cheaper (and sometimes more expensive saline solutions). My piercings had always been very &amp;#34;pus-y&amp;#34;, hot, and irritated, and lasted YEARS until I finally removed them. Outside of my basic earrings that I got pierced as an infant, only my belly ring healed (took about 4 years). This stuff works! It has a soothing, cooling effect. My new piercings felt hot only about a week or so, and this stuff stops the heat, excessive swelling, and pain. If I forget to use this stuff when I&#x27;m busy with life, the heat comes back along with more pus. One or two applications gits rid of it all! I&#x27;m so happy with this stuff. The seller shipped the product in very fast - much faster than Amazon! I would put 4 stars because of the price, but considering it&#x27;s like the only thing on the market that works (for me), and the somewhat affordable price makes me go ahead and keep them at 5</li>
            <li> I loved the product and  how it is healing my belly piercing. Definitely worth 5 stars. I&#x27;m glad I got it for such a cheaper price than in store</li>
            <li> Works well with my pierced ear, well worth the price!</li>
            <li> **Disclaimer: infected piercings should be checked out by your piercer and/or physician. This spray is awesome, but is not a substitute for antibiotics or medical treatment if your piercing is severely infected **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had my left tragus &amp; right conch done on a Friday night. By Monday there was significant swelling of the right ear, visible redness, and extreme sensitivity to touch. Seriously, I could not touch the ear at all without pain, and cleaning it was excruciating. There was greenish pus (not lymph; opaque pus.) and the ear was very warm to the touch. All the classic signs of infection. Oh, and did I mention that my lymph nodes were involved in the party? Yeah. Bad news bears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The piercer had given me a small packet of sea salt to use, but it wasn&#x27;t doing anything for me (I had experienced some minor resistance to plain sea salt before with a rook piercing) so I was thrilled when this arrived in the mail. Applied immediately, and continued to spray both ears about 4 times per day. After the first 36 hours, I noticed the swelling was down. Three days after the first usage, the swelling was almost entirely gone, was no longer warm to the touch, and no longer so painful that cleaning it requires a gag and some oxycodone. It wasn&#x27;t the immediate relief I&#x27;ve seen in other reviews, but there was a noticeable difference after 24 hrs. Don&#x27;t expect super-fast miracles, give it at least several hours, because your body takes time to heal anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw the doc about 3 days after I started using it, so it looked much less angry and dangerous, she agreed that it was infected, but didn&#x27;t see a need to put me on antibiotics. Progress has only continued, so I&#x27;m very pleased that for me H2Ocean actually helped to cure an active infection. I will never again get pierced without having already purchased a few cans of this, and would recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s about to get any sort of piercing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, I appreciate the fact that the solution cannot be affected by the metal container since it&#x27;s actually packaged in a small bag inside the can, and that the whole thing is recyclable. Since it&#x27;s not refillable or reusable as any other spriting device, I&#x27;m glad it won&#x27;t wind up in the garbage when I&#x27;m done with it.ted by the metal container since it&#x27;s actually packaged in a small bag inside the can, and that the whole thing is recyclable.

            <li> At most of the professional piercing shops I&#x27;ve been pierced at, this product is always just included with the price of the piercing. One place, however, gave me a bag of salt to make saltwater out of. That really made me miss my old H2Ocean! Definitely a must have for new piercings.</li>
            <li> Many people will say this is just a \\&quot;glorified salt water spray,\\&quot; and the truth is... it basically is, but that&#x27;s the point. Salt water soaks and cleanings have been used in piercing care for longer than anyone can trace back and they really help the healing process. That&#x27;s before taking into account the antimicrobial benefit of the Lysozyme in H2Ocean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What H2Ocean provides (in addition to being an antimicrobial), is ease of application and a time saver. Instead of making your own sea-salt mix and then applying it with cotton swabs or what have you (and in the process not being very sterile), all you have to do is pop off the top and spray and you&#x27;re guaranteed a quick sterile cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this stuff for 4 of my piercings and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love using H2ocean to clean my piercings. Very easy to use and at a decent price. Some people prefer to buy plain sea salt but I will keep buying this. Much easier to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a total of 4 ear piercings (besides my lobes) and 1 body piercing. For the first three ear piercings I never had an issue as long as I washed with salt water every once in a while (I wasn&#x27;t that consistent after a few weeks). I got my cartilage pierced on a whim while on the boardwalk in Wildwood two or so months ago and it&#x27;s been the most agonizing one I&#x27;ve ever had. The first few weeks it was super hot to the touch and very bloody when accidentally touched. I opted to get H2O and it has done wonders. Within two days the swelling and heat had gone down. Today the piercing does still form a plasma pocket and scab but H2O does it&#x27;s job in helping it heal and not swell up to gargantuan size. Plus it now painless compared to the throbbing pulse my ear had before using this miracle spray!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About a year after I got my nipple pierced it start to show early signs of infection (think I changed the ring before it was fully healed) so I cleaned it out everytime I showered. To this day, almost two years since the piercing, it still does get some crusties. So I started using H2O to keep it clean and help it fully heal. I love this stuff! It did dry out my ear when I used it multiple times a day but hey, it&#x27;s salt water. What can you expect?</li>
            <li> My belly button ring got infected and this product cleared it right up, like literally in a day. This product does exactly what it says it does, what more can you want.</li>
            <li> the H2ocean piercing aftercare spray is awesome! It is the best product for healing up piercings. Thank you H2Ocean Inc</li>
            <li> Used this to heal my new wrist peircing. I got two barbells put it, it healed faster then i thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but of course, it&#x27;d not as good as an actual, warm sea salt soak.</li>
            <li> this is perfect for cleaning a newly pierced navel ! it helps speed up the healing process and keeps it from getting infected.</li>
            <li> This is a must have for new nose piercings! Nothing healed my nose as quickly as this; it even heals keloids rather quickly.</li>
            <li> I recently got my rook pierced and found it difficult to keep the bottom hole cleaned. I had heard about H2ocean from a friend and decided to try it. It is so easy and convenient to use and it makes cleaning the bottom hole a breeze. I just spray it on about 4-5 times a day and go. Of all the piercings I&#x27;ve had (bellybutton, tragus, industrial) my rook has healed the quickest and I would definitely recommend this for any piercing!</li>
            <li> This product worked absolutely amazing! After just about a week of using it for my nipple piercings the lil tiny keloids went away. I highly recommend this product to anyone with piercings</li>
            <li> I LIKE THIS PRODUCT, ITS CONVIENIENT. JUST MAKE SURE YOU SPRAY ON TO A QTIP OR ELSE SPRAYING DIRECTLY ON THE PIERCING WILL HAVE YOU WASTING MOST OF IT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of all sorts of ear piercings. Ive stretched my ears, had almost every piercing possible on my cartilege and through every piercing, I&#x27;ve used this product. It has absolutely saved my ears from keloids and nasty infections every step of the way. Not to mention that I&#x27;m allergic to every metal out there except surgical steel. This stuff allows me to keep my ear piercings and especially my ears in tact. I would def recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for something to help bring the redness down and to speed up the healing process. However, like a previous review said, this isnt an antibiotic solution. It&#x27;s meant as a preventive tool so if your piercing is off the wall, go to a dr, not just this spray.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this from hot topic (but Amazon is probably cheaper) but this stuff is amazing! The top of my industrial had been sore forever! I used this for a day and it&#x27;s already feeling so much better! And also before I bought this I had been doing sea salt soaks and I have been submerging my whole ear in salt water and it gave me ear infections (swimmers ear and inner ear infection) I guess I didn&#x27;t realize that! But I recently got my daith pierced so I&#x27;m using this to clean it because I don&#x27;t want another ear infection. (:</li>
            <li> Works perfect for piercings</li>
            <li> I got this for my new belly button piercing and it has worked so well! I&#x27;ve had no infections and it has definitely helped with the healing process. I also use it on my gauged ears and it is amazing! I love this stuff and will always use it for all my piercings.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff for piercing aftercare!  It works well and does its job very well.  I have the tragus piercing in both ears.  I&#x27;ve had the piercing done twice and used this both times I got the piercings done.  It certainly helped keep the piercing clean and I didn&#x27;t have any side effects. It cut down on the healing time needed both times I got the piercings.  I highly recommend this to anyone with a new piercing or for someone to purchase before getting a piercing.</li>
            <li> Just as described, great transaction!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I love it. I couldn&#x27;t live without it. Buy it buy it buy it buy it buy it</li>
            <li> H2Ocean is the best aftercare I&#x27;ve used. I have had several dermal piercings the past few years and I have used H2Ocean for all of them. I have yet to have any problems with any of my piercings while using this. Great product.</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan. For the price, it&#x27;s not worth it. I used mine up in a period of 2weeks.&lt;br /&gt;The  only thing I really liked about H2Ocean was the convenience of the spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick to Provon. In my opinion it has healed my piercings better and faster. And it lasts a lot longer.</li>
            <li> I got an industrial in my right ear about 2 and a half months ago, and I obtained a small bottle of this and was told to use it to help my new piercing heal and stay clean. It seemed to be doing the job perfectly well so I bought the bigger can and I love it. It&#x27;s easy to use, just spray it on and go. Some people will recommend washing it off, others won&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t wash it off, except when I&#x27;m in the shower. Industrials take a long time to heal so I still have much more healing time to deal with, and I will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s works pretty good. The piercing I have it doesn&#x27;t even feel like it&#x27;s there anymore, it stop hurting. I would buy this product again</li>
            <li> This is a great product for new piercings and anything else you want to clean out naturally. It doesn&#x27;t sting or smell bad but be careful --- it goes fast! It&#x27;s cheaper on Amazon than any store I&#x27;ve visited!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  There are only two problems with it: 1) Too few people know about it and 2) It is marketed in too narrow a way.  I purchased this essentially as a desperate measure in desperate times caring for my father&#x27;s foot.  He has impaired circulation and a suppressed immune system. An injury got infected, and turned to what appeared to be the start of dry gangrene.  I used Rx prescription ointment, Dermawound, and other wound \\&quot;healers.\\&quot; It just got worse.  I kept thinking that I wished I could soak it in salt water, but the risk of infection would increase, so I finally started looking specifically for a natural salt water (not saline) type cleanser. Found this and figured I could do no worse than I was doing.  WOW! This stuff is amazing. Discharge from the edges of the area stopped within two days.  I don&#x27;t rub or use gauze, I just spritz this stuff on liberally a few times a day.  The pain is less than half of what it was and the wound is shrinking as it dries from the edges and the dead stuff falls away, there is new pink skin underneath. Mind you, this is a slow process, we&#x27;re several weeks in, but his prognosis was very grim..like \\&quot;when the toe has to be removed FALLS OFF, etc\\&quot;  The doctor and home health nurse are now amazed.  I am thrilled! Dad is even happier.  duh :P  Also, in less dramatic news:  for old piercings that get infected or annoyed by say..cheap earrings (not that I know anyone who would have that problem :D)-a spritz of this and your worries are over.  It&#x27;s good stuff.  I&#x27;ll never be without a bottle in my home, even after Dad&#x27;s foot is all healed.  If you&#x27;re on the fence about trying it, go for it! I think you&#x27;ll be happy with the result.</li>
            <li> This product is a saving grace for slow to heal piercings.  Easy to use, super effective, an overall great purchase!  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> When I bought this my navel piercing had a aweful bump! In about a day or 2 it was gone and the piercing was also no longer infected! I highly recommend this!!</li>
            <li> My piercing looks 100% better after using this product! I would def recommend it to any and everyone, and will use it if I decide to get future piercings!</li>
            <li> Nothing works better! I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone with any kind of body piercing. DON&#x27;T use anything else, this is all you need!</li>
            <li> this works really well as long as you use as directed (no less than 3-6 times per day) i had a bump on my nose piercing for a long time and now it is pretty much gone and i use this every day to keep it away!</li>
            <li> A little disappointed.  All the reviews I read make it sound like it worked right away and would get rid of the bump around the hole. I really am surprised to see all the 5-star ratings. I have an ear piercing that is not in the regular cartilege.  It hasn&#x27;t changed much in a month and I use is 3 or 4 times a day.  It keeps it clean though.</li>
            <li> H2Ocean Piercing Aftercare Spray works wonders! Every time I get a new piercing at a tattoo shop, they always recomend this. When my tragus was infected, i used this spray. Just spray the piercing itslef and take a little cotton swab and wipe it. Love this product!</li>
            <li> I Love this , really helps .. I just forget to use it everyday but I always use it after a shower ..</li>
            <li> After the first few uses, the caps fell off BOTH bottles that I ordered.  SMH -__-</li>
            <li> Buy this, it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> I got my naval pierced and it healed okay with the sea salt soaks. I eventually got impatient and changed the piercing to early and it got irritated and a bit infected. One of my friends recommended H2Ocean. With a day my naval was noticeably less irritated and sore. I used it three times a day for a week and my naval was back to how it was prior to changing the piercing. Continued use and it&#x27;s completely healed and better than ever. I like to lay on my back, spray it and let my belly button fill up with it and then gently move the jewelry and swish it around while reading for 10 minutes. Then wipe it with a paper towel and wah-laa... no more crustys and the piercing is clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I use it for a week after I change my jewelry to keep it clean and avoid any irritation switching the jewelry out may cause even thought the piercing is fully healed. I would recommend this to anyone with a new naval piercing... or any type of piercing.</li>
            <li> I have not used H2Ocean for any of my other piercings (ears), but when i recently got my navel pierced, it was recommended that I use it.  When I pierced my ears (for both sets of holes), they were very sore for a couple weeks and kept getting crusty and gross.  It took them about 3 months to heal.  When I first pierced my cartilage, it became extremely infected and sore and I had to take it out.  However, my navel piercing has not caused me one bit of trouble and I think it is because of this product.  The piercing has not been sore and has not developed any crust whatsoever.  There is a little redness right around the jewelry, but it is only visible when I unscrew the top of my navel ring; I think the redness is also due to the fact that the piercing is only 3 days old.  This product has been GREAT and I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> This was great when I first got it but without dropping it or anything the nozzle just stopped working, I don&#x27;t know why. I tampered with it a little and just couldn&#x27;t get it to work. I ended up throwing it out which sucks. I don&#x27;t know what happened I only had it for a few days too</li>
            <li> I really wanted a belly button peircing but I was worried about infection.  After I researched it and found a safe place, I decided to do it. It got a little irritated on the third day, and then I heard about H2Ocean.  I got it and the irritation was gone!  It cleans the area, makes it less crusty, and this is gross, but it gets all of the icky stuff out from the inside which is really good for healing.  All you have to do is spray it on a couple times a day.  I have extremly sensitive skin, but I have not had one infection while using H20cean.</li>
            <li> Best product out there for piercings!</li>
            <li> Timely shipping, free shipping, quality product, what more can you ask?!</li>
            <li> Based on the other reviews I bought this stuff because my 7-week old nose piercing would get red from wearing makeup and sweating when working out. I also have a puppy who likes to lick my face/nose when I&#x27;m asleep so keeping my piercing clean is difficult at times. I got this in the mail today and within minutes the redness went away and my nose feels so much better! This is the best alternative to [trying to] soak your nose with a sea-salt solution and a washcloth. I would definitely keep this stuff around even if your piercing has already healed just to keep the area clean.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT, LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> H2Ocean hasn&#x27;t miraculously cured any infections for me or anything.  That&#x27;s because I haven&#x27;t had any for it to cure.  However, it&#x27;s really good for just spraying my belly ring when the crusties start to stick the ring to the hole (uncomfortable and not good for healing) or if I don&#x27;t have time to wash my piercing before my first class of the morning.  And, let&#x27;s face it, H2Ocean just *smells* like it works.  It smells like salty ocean and happy belly button.</li>
            <li> Last time I bought this product, it was good. But this time, firstly, logistics was very slow. I ordered on May 22, and received it on June 1. Even worse, the spray head is broken and can&#x27;t be used at all. Really a bad experience.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping it would clear up my infected nose piercing, it didn&#x27;t help me at all, maybe it helped others.</li>
            <li> I love H2O! It does the trick for any healing piercing or any time your piercing gets infected. I would never tell anyone to use anything but this product. I always have an extra can on hand. The only thing to be aware of is sometimes the product clogs because of its natural properties.</li>
            <li> Great results with this, I believe everything is healing just fine and it&#x27;s so much easier using this versus a sea salt soak. Just spray and go :).</li>
            <li> I recently got my nose pierced and shortly after my nose got infected, a lot of people recommended this spray so i tryed it, it works amazing after a couple days my nose was not infected anymore. Great for piercings!</li>
            <li> I am currently using this spray to help clean and heal my earlobe piercings and navel piercing and so far so good! :) This spray does a good job at drawing out any discharge. I got my navel pierced about 2 months ago and my lobes 2 weeks ago. After 20 years of life I finally decided to get my ears pierced but had to wait for a little benign cyst that developed in my left earlobe to go away. But while waiting for the cyst to shrink I decided to get my navel pierced.  I work as a dishwasher/and busser at a local restaurant and I tend to get hot and sweaty easily. I will also have dirty dishwater occasionally get on my shirt around my navel so I tend to get kinda icky from working and i know keeping new piercings clean is vital to preventing infections. I credit this spray for having none of my piercings getting infected so far despite working at a restaurant. :)</li>
            <li> I had a lot of swelling in my new ear piercings and it hurt to even touch my ear. This product really helped to reduce the swelling and pain. Definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li> Could always make your our mixture, but this is good if you don&#x27;t have enough time to or need it for piercings you can&#x27;t soak with a shotglass</li>
            <li> I love H2Ocean. It lessens the process for cleaning piercings and it&#x27;s easy to just spray on. I used this with new piercings and still use it occasionally when they&#x27;re healed. I did not get any infection and had no issues. Using this spray also soothes painful piercings when they&#x27;re still new and warm.</li>
            <li> I love to use this for my newly pierced tragus&#x27;s. I bought this as a salt infused treatment and it was the best decision. It made my irritated ears feel normal over night! This is the best piercing product I&#x27;ve bought so far. It also shipped super fast to me.</li>
            <li> Perfect for any piercing or even stretching! I use it on my nose and my plugs</li>
            <li> product was just as expected. shipping was a little much, but everything was fine and came on time.</li>
            <li> Love this product healed my industrial real good</li>
            <li> The spray comes out very easily. I usually put it on a cotton ball and rub it on my nose piercing to keep it clean (which I don&#x27;t need to do much more, since the piercing has completely healed, but I needed it often during the first few months). It&#x27;s nice and cooling and works well to keep my piercing clean without using any harsh cleaners. I love it. Plus, side note--it works well for sore throats and stuffy noses too! :)</li>
            <li> Love it! It helped my belly piercing healed faster than any other product. It&#x27;s also conviemient since its a spray and you can carry it anywhere</li>
            <li> This actually works to help heal your piercings quickly. I also used peroxide and alcohol at night and the spray in the mornings, the salt water spray seems to speed up the healing process.</li>
            <li> Has helped my piercings and is easy to use. Hasn&#x27;t worked any miracles for me though. All in all my favorite</li>
            <li> Awesome. Cleared up a nasty infection I got from an old cartridge piercing. Will definitely be re-purchasing so I can always have this on hand.</li>
            <li> IDK why but it seem like this didn&#x27;t help my piercing at all . Saline Solution works better to me than this, &amp; when my belly ring got infected it seemed like it made it worse . Maybe it&#x27;s just my body . IDK .</li>
            <li> I have always used this for my piercings and still stand by it. Helped to heal my nipples quickly and ease the burn of my industrial.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t feel like it was cleaning it well enough, but its ok for any piercing care</li>
            <li> I started using this because someone recommended me to use this to help with my belly piercing that was starting to get infected. After a week, my piercing started to look better and I have to say I love this thing! Its like a can of miracle! :) I know its just a spray can of H20 and salt but its so much easier to use than making one urself (well for me it is).</li>
            <li> I had an irratation develope 4 months after my navel piercing.  I have other piercings that didn&#x27;t do the same. So I bought this, and like the next morning it was clearing up.  By the third day it was gone, and its been a month and hasn&#x27;t returned.  Get it!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get much easier than spray several times a day. Could I make my own substitute? I don&#x27;t know, maybe. Probably not in such a convenient bottle. Abates and heals infections with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downsides:&lt;br /&gt;-A bit expensive (4 oz. lasts around a month, so you&#x27;ll need multiple cans)&lt;br /&gt;-Can waste - cans are not reusable (they are recyclable, at the very least)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I have sensitive skin or not, but when I used this every day, the salt in the solution dried my piercing out and caused it to bleed continuously. The bleeding stopped after I gave my ears a rest and used Neosporin to let the skin heal. Otherwise, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I had got my daughter&#x27;s ear pierced at Claires and noticed one of them turning red so I looked online for ear piercing cleaning solutions and I Decided to try this solution and it took the redness right away both of her ears healed great!</li>
            <li> GREAT stuff and works wonders for piercings. Really helps to keep them clean and infection free. I had one can get &amp;#34;gummed&amp;#34; up from salt deposits in the nozzle, but I called H2Ocean and they sent me a replacement right away. All they asked for was the lot number on the can.</li>
            <li> Worked well my piercing was very agitated and this stuff helped with cleaning it out.</li>
            <li> Prior to purchasing this product, I have heard lots about how great it was but had already bought a generic saline spray from the place that I got pierced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it was problem of the can that i purchased, but it LEAKED the saline spray everytime I shook or took off the cap. Still, it works great and helps ease and speed up the healing process for newly pierced areas. (Though I feel any saline spray would have producved the same effects)</li>
            <li> I started using this stuff on my infected nose piercing and it significantly reduced my giant bump. I would recommend this to anyone with a new piercing or infected piercing because it&#x27;s so easy to use and SUPER sterile!</li>
            <li> Both of my nipples were pierced 2 weeks ago. My piercer told me to spray this on twice a day...yeah, that&#x27;s it. It&#x27;s worked so well and it makes taking care of my piercings extremely easy. My nipples aren&#x27;t sore and haven&#x27;t been for over a week, there are no signs of infection, and they are beautiful. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I had my cartilage pierced about 8 months ago, and the lady who pierced my ear recommended that I purchase H2ocean to clean my ear. My ear was fine with using H2ocean for about two months before it got infected. I was running low on the product anyways, so I reordered, but despite my best efforts to keep the piercing/area clean, my ear stayed infected for over a month. Despite warning against using alcohol on the area, I finally decided to just switch to using an alcohol-based toner solution that cleared up my infection within a week! H2ocean may be good initially, since the piercing is usually sensitive, but I wasn&#x27;t really interested in spending $10 every two months to keep my piercing clean! The toner cost about $3 and will last much longer. Good luck!</li>
            <li> Amazing just make sure to have a paper towel for the drips</li>
            <li> I used this on my belly button piercing after experiencing swelling, redness and pain. After using it 2-3 times a day all my symptoms went away and everything seems to be healed. The only thing is to NOT over use this cause it can dry out your skin but other than that its perfect in moderation</li>
            <li> So far I have not really notice a difference other than my ear has felt a little irritated after using it for 2 days now. I will further review this product after a few months have passed of using it.</li>
            <li> Excuse my previous review. Mom picked it up and locked it up at her office and never told me.</li>
            <li> Worst thing ever !!!! Couldn&#x27;t even use it came to my house broken !!!! Thanks for nothing !!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this product. For the first time ever a new piercing has not got infected. I am using it on my new piercings, a couple that I am stretching and on my five year olds new earings! It is soothing and keeps the infection at bay. Forget about alcohol or hydrogen peroxide. H2Oocean and anti-bacterial soap is all you need!!</li>
            <li> Use on rook and snug piercings and it immediately takes the pain away so I can sleep at night</li>
            <li> Well first off I ordered 3 bottles, for some reason they could only send two (I still got my money back) When they got here I was all excited to try and one of them didn&#x27;t even work. It wouldn&#x27;t spray or do really anything. So I was down to 1 bottle. It did help my piercings, I am just disappointed about the hassle and the other 2 bottles.</li>
            <li> I purchased two bottles of this stuff after I got my cartilage pierced.  It&#x27;s been 4 days since I got my piercing and the swelling and redness is totally gone.  The piercing only hurts if I accidentally role onto it in the middle of the night, and even then it doesn&#x27;t hurt too much.  The scabbing is all gone and it feels clean and well-moisturized.  I definitely recommend this product to anyone with a new piercing.  I spray it every 4 or 5 hours (and wash it with soap for sensitive skin 1-2 times a day) and plan on lessening that to 2-3 times a day in a few weeks when it has healed more.  Buy this stuff!</li>
            <li> my daughter love it, belly ring, no infection heal quick can last a good bit still have a can on order</li>
            <li> My ear piercing was sore and as soon as i put this on it, it stopped hurting. I love it</li>
            <li> I got my ears pierced at Claire&#x27;s and Hey at the time I was not very educated on aftercare or piercings in general. (DO NOT GET PIERCED AT CLAIRE&#x27;S, they have no training except maybe an instructional video, and guns aren&#x27;t sanitary). I was pierced with sterling silver (not a correct metal to be pierced with!!) and was handed the claire&#x27;s aftercare product. After about a week my ears were bloody, then it escalated to pus &amp; swelling and I had no idea what was wrong. I babied the piercings and they were just getting worse. This product saved my piercings, after even a day there was a major improvement. A few days in and pus was gone, and a week or two later they were perfectly healed. I started going to a professional piercing place for my navel and lip piercing, and my piercer states that this is the best product on the market. It&#x27;s easy to use, just spray and go. I like to spray alot so that the piercing gets soaked. It will not likely cause anyone any sort of irritation, its extremely gentle. I usually get an allergic reaction from everything I use, but not this. I swear it speeds up healing time. People I know have gotten the worst reactions from unprofessional piercing and aftercare advice, and I always recommend them this product to fix whatever problems they have, and it never fails! I Plan to get more future piercings and I&#x27;ll need more bottles of this stuff, I pair this with sea salt soaks and I have the perfect aftercare.</li>
            <li> I got my cartilage pierced over a year ago and after about 8 months of the piercing it was starting to get really red,itchy, and sore. This aftercare spray showed up in my search for possible remedies for my ear so I ordered it...I really would love to say it helped my ear but if anything it made the skin even dryer/itchier.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m indifferent about this product. It didn&#x27;t seem to help but it didn&#x27;t hurt either (with a little baby lotion around my ear -not near the piercing though-got rid of the dryness)</li>
            <li> Arrived on time as ordered.  I have no complaints about the product or company. Would order again.  Daughter used on ears, nose and belly button.</li>
            <li> When I first got my piercings I followed my piercers directions to the T. But even after the intial \\&quot; healing time\\&quot; my piercings were still sore and would often swell up. Even if they didn&#x27;t bother me, I still had a lot of crusties and lymph. As much as I was sick and tired of the complications my piercings were giving me, I didnt want to lose them so I did some research on what helps with the swelling and soreness. I knew that crusties and lymph are always going to be present but the amount of it was indicating something was wrong. I learned that sea salt soaks help to reduce the swelling and soreness but after a while I grew sick of having to sit with a cup of solution suctioned to my piercings. H2Ocean gives me the natural sea salt solution in a to go container. It works just as well as a homemade solution. I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, convenient, and most of all effective! I&#x27;m amazed at how long the container lasts. Not only great for piercings but wound care as well.</li>
            <li> This spray really helped belly button piercing when it was fresh. My piercing was really irritated and red and sea salt soaks weren&#x27;t doing much to help. This spray reduced the irritation within an hour and kept it from getting that irritated again. I&#x27;ve been using it since and it&#x27;s really the best to use. I would recommend it to everyone with fresh piercings</li>
            <li> Had my nose pierced twice, both times a nose bump developed. This didn&#x27;t  make it go away but it certainly helped clean it and soothe any irritation. The downside is that it doesn&#x27;t last very long. I ran out in less than a month after using 2-4 times per day sparingly. Also, the nozzle leaks. So for the price you don&#x27;t get that much. It&#x27;s just very convenient and effective.</li>
            <li> Got tired of trying to hold my head sideways in a bowl of salt water.  Piercing was healed in no time with this.  And my hair wasn&#x27;t dripping salt water!</li>
            <li> As someone with five piercings and some of them in high maintenance areas believe me when I tell you that this is a mist have for new piercings. This is for when you are travelling and you know won&#x27;t do your warm seat salt soaks, when you&#x27;re at the stage where you still need to do warm seat salt soaks bit you keep &amp;#34;forgetting&amp;#34; because the newness of your piercing is gone and you&#x27;re over it, or just for regular cleaning. It works by drying on the piercing and making the gross stuff flake off. You just spray and go. It&#x27;s very convenient.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff ! It healed up my bellybutton piercing</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use any other product for new piercings. I&#x27;ve had my tragus, rook, and belly button pierced and this product will heal it quickly!</li>
            <li> Came on time but When i received this product in the mail it would not spray at all.  I guess i got a defected bottle.  Such a disappointment. Got a refund</li>
            <li> nozzle broke the first time I tried to use it</li>
            <li> I was given this stuff when I got my tragus and industrial pierced. I went and had my rook done last week and they didn&#x27;t give me this spray like last time. I was really upset! So, I found it on here and was so happy! This stuff works wonders! I bought the  4 oz. because the 1 oz the piercer gave me didn&#x27;t last long. It healed my piercings up quick and plus the coldness makes it feel good! I highly recommend this product!!!!</li>
            <li> It would not spray after the first time I used it. The bottle is completely full and there&#x27;s no way to get it to spray.</li>
            <li> Loved this stuff. Perfect for after a piercing and kept everything nice and clean :)</li>
            <li> This stuff does wonders. I also recently used it when I got a cold sore(gross, I know.) It helped a TON.</li>
            <li> Works great! Much easier than having to do a sea salt soak</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never gotten an infection in my piercings because of this product! Buy it before you get your piercing for immediate relief!</li>
            <li> After getting my forward helix pierced and being instructed to clean it twice a day with hot water and salt (salt wash) I did, after the 3rd week I decided to bring it down to once a day... HUGE MISTAKE. It took about 2 days for my ear to become swollen, purple, producing puss, and very hot. After receiving anti biotics from my doctor and completing the course the infection had reduced but had left behind a nasty (fairly large) keloid. After going to my piercer and asking for advice, which was \\&quot;use Tea Tree Oil and hot salty water\\&quot; I did some reading up of my own and found h2ocean, I live in the UK so shipping was fairly pricey but wow was it worth it, within 24 hours my keloid had completely vanished and redness reduced. Just got my navel pierced yesterday and so far so good. But I would definitely recommend this for getting rid of infections/keloids/crusty&#x27;s and keeping piercing&#x27;s clean and healthy :-) and shipping to the uk isn&#x27;t that pricey either so I&#x27;d recommend it for people on this side of the pond too!</li>
            <li> Worked wonders on my rook piercing! The spray was easy to use and it helped my fresh piercing heal much faster.</li>
            <li> My first time purchasing this and I believe it has healing qualities. Even though I have been using salt water solutions for my piercings, I decided to try this. After I sprayed it on the next day I swear my piercing stopped hurting.</li>
            <li> Works great for my piercings</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Healed my Tragus piercing up within a week! Came on time fast shipping!</li>
            <li> spray bottle broke as soon as i opened it. waste of money.</li>
            <li> This product is great at keeping piercings clean and soothing inflammation. This is especially helpful for cartilage piercings. I have an industrial and it is hard to clean easily 5+ times a day, but this spray makes the process MUCH faster. It doesn&#x27;t have an odor to it either which is a plus. Not sure if it&#x27;s the aerosol, but it comes out slightly cool which helps if the piercing feels hot.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to use this because I read really good reviews on it  unfortunately this made my navel piecing 10 times worse ill stick to sea salt soaks from now on</li>
            <li> I got my nose pierced 3 months ago, and started using this product maybe the 2nd or 3rd week after I got it done. And let me tell you, it did its job! I didn&#x27;t want to mess around with heating distilled water and adding salt, like my piercer told me to, so I was looking for an easier pre-made solution. I&#x27;ve so far never had an infection or inflammation at all. This spray is super easy to use, I just spray a little on a cotton swab, and just clean around the stud before bed and in the morning, and then I&#x27;m done! Saltwater is a natural wound cleanser, so it only makes sense to bottle purified saltwater to clean piercing sites. If this stuff seems overpriced to you, remember that you only use one small spray every time you use it, so the big can of it will last you a really long time. Highly reccommend it!</li>
            <li> I noticed an immediate improvement the next day after i used this spray. The redness and swelling i had around my navel piercing  was reduced drastically. Also i like that is takes away any pain and itching too...though i still do my water soaks at home, i still use this spray at work when soaking is not an option. The bottle is small enought to carry in my bag. I highly recommend this spray to anyone considering any type of piercings. Im not giving it five stars because product claims to make navel piercings heal faster...im not so sure about that. I did my piercing 5 months ago and used this spray religiously still i dont see it healing any faster. But im still satisfied with it...and i also use it for other nicks and cuts i get around the office.</li>
            <li> I bought H2Ocean from Hot Topic the day after I got my navel piercing and I don&#x27;t think there is anything better. I now have had the piercing for a week and it has never been sore (since the day I got it done) red or crusty. I use the spray 3x a day and I believe it is making my piercing heal fast and great! I will continue to use this product and order from Amazon from now on since it&#x27;s cheaper!</li>
            <li> Even though the instructions say use it from 3-6 times a day I still use my salt water mixture for my septum piercing, but this is nice for when I&#x27;m in a rush in the morning and I just need to spray a little on and clean it. When it arrived the cap was off, but I just popped it back on and it got here the same day it was suppose!(:</li>
            <li> I just got it and I expected it can work well. Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t work at all after pressing the button. I&#x27;m very disappointed and tried to return, BUT this kind of item cannot be returned as a policy from Amazon. Bad shopping experience. I never gave a 3 star or below before but this time it wasted my money.  To buy something you can never only look at how good it is and those 5 star comments. You should also check why so many of us gave 1 star.</li>
            <li> Bought this as an aftercare product for my first time getting my ears pierced. Worked great in getting rid of infections and then preventing future ones as your ears heal.</li>
            <li> its a good product but it doesn&#x27;t really help you heal</li>
            <li> This spray helped my ear piercings to heal quickly!</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever!!!!! Noticed my piercings getting better within days of using this.</li>
            <li> My septum ring was really flaky and red druing healing. I was told to do warm salt water soaks 3 times a day... which is a lot and kind of hard. Spraying this up my nose was weird but easier than soaking.</li>
            <li> For months I had been trying to get rid of the bumps on the back of my cartilage piercing through various methods (aspirin, new jewelry, salt) with no avail. After receiving this I was delighted when I discovered the bump come with one week of use twice a day!</li>
            <li> Nothing to say besides it&#x27;s the same h20cean that the piercer gave me. Works the same, great product, I use it for my nose ring and sometimes for my belly button ring when it wants to be a Butt.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.  No sting when applied.  Does a great job of keeping piercing healing properly. For me it has done a better job helping heal nipple piercings than salt water soaks and washing with Provon.</li>
            <li> I got my navel pierced and the spray was recommended.  Nothing beats salt water soaks using a shot glass, but I&#x27;d recommend this for ease-of-use and portability.  I recently went on a trip for a long weekend and found it very convenient.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used this for ear piercings yet, but did use it to clean up an open wound my husband had gotten.</li>
            <li> This product really works. Keeps your piercings clean. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to keep there piercings clean and healthy. I&#x27;ve used it on all my piercings and it has done a great job for me. Just make sure you follow all the steps to healing a piercing not just using a cleaner.</li>
            <li> The bottle is bigger then I thought itd be and the stuff taste rly oceany I think itll be great for my lip piercing.</li>
            <li> I got my belly button pierced a couple of months ago and this product keeps it clean, even after a sweaty exercise. I&#x27;ve used this product since day one of my piercing and since then I had no problems with redness or it puffing up. Very little pus comes out now and then (part of the healing process) but clean it with the spray and there won&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I recently pierced my cartilage and wanted to keep it from getting infected. My piercing is healing nicely and it looks great! Will definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> This product I recommend to any person who just got a piercing of any kind.&lt;br /&gt;H2ocean really works. Its easy, it really keeps your piercing clean, and eliminates any dried discharge.</li>
            <li> This product is the best you can get for healing. It&#x27;s the only thing I use for my nose piercing and it works great! The seller sent me all the directions and more. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> Came in quickly and on time and my ears healed up perfectly! I&#x27;m actually about to buy another bottle because i&#x27;ve just been using it so much!</li>
            <li> I got my navel pierced back in March and it has always been somewhat red/irritated. I figured it was just because I was constantly moving around etc and it never really had a chance to sit still and heal. Anyway, I could tell it was healed fine on the inside, but the area around the piercing was still red/irritated and I knew something had to be going on. So I went to get a second opinion and she told me it was an allergy to the surgical steel barbell, gave me a titanium one and told me to spray it 3-6 times a day with H2Ocean. After changing out the jewelry (it WAS healed inside) cleaning and giving it a few spritzes, the redness and irritation was just about GONE. I kid you not. A day later, it looks like it SHOULD, with NO redness etc around it. NONE. This stuff is totally worth getting if you&#x27;ve got any healing issues.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It is a great alternative to salt water soaks. It sped up the healing process and kept the pierced area clean. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> i really liked this product because it&#x27;s quick and simple especially if you are short on time! the only downside was that it formed a bump on the inside of my nose piercing? maybe i was just cleaning it too much or not enough but you are supposed to use this 3 to 6 times a day. i would highly recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my triple forward helix for about 2 months and it was still healing. I was using regular wound wash which the piercer recommended. I bought this because i felt like the other wash wasn&#x27;t doing anything. This makes my piercing feel clean and is helping it heal much faster. The spray is a little messy, so i gave it 4 stars. I will be buying this product again and will recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> Great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and worked on my piercing just fine.</li>
            <li> I got my nose stretched back to an 18g a couple days ago and with using this product it has helped with the healing process and it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has any piercings new or old.</li>
            <li> H2Ocean is amazing. It cleared up the persistent lymph on an older piercing and has helped my freshest piercing heal beautifully from day one. I use this and then Dr. Bronners in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes. It&#x27;s ten bucks for salt water. Yes, it works better IMO than regular sea salt rinses.&lt;br /&gt;I soak a q tip in it and then clean my barbells then spray each side of each piercing for good measure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a product that has permanently made its home on my shelf. Honestly, I could write a huge wall of text praising it, but I&#x27;m just going to tell you to fork over the ten bucks and enjoy your nice, clean body jewelry.</li>
            <li> First, understand that I have had my navel pierced a total of 4 times; the last being the most succesful one with the help of this product. After discovering I was allergic to anything less than real gold, I broke down and bought a $120 ring from BodyCandy.com. With that kind of investment, I needed to ensure that this piercing would keep. So after through research, I learned that the common recommendations for navel piercing cleaning (bactine, just antibacterial soap &amp; water, etc.) were actually terrible methods for cleaning piercings. Then I happened upon H2Ocean&#x27;s Aftercare Spray; read great reviews on it from multiple sites, found the best price here on Amazon, and bought it. I&#x27;ve had a few issues with the skin around my navel getting dry and flaky; this was for 2 reasons: one I have minor scar tissue there from previous piercings and two I later learned that I needed to wipe the piercing down with a little water on a Q-Tip end after cleaning it with the H2Ocean Spray. So after more research, I found this refined Emu Oil through Desert Palms Emu Ranch LLC that The Piercing Bible swears by online to treat dryness without clogging the piercing or infecting it as other oils do, and it has done wonders! My daily routine is showering twice a day with Dial Antibacterial Body Wash, clean my piercing with H2Ocean Aftercare Spray (following with a slight water cleaning) three times a day (two of these following my showers) and finish with using a Q-Tip to massage a little bit of Emu Oil around the piercing. No discomfort, no swelling, no oozing of any kind. I LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> I have a hard time getting piercings to heal properly, and this is the 2nd try for a tragus. I bought this because of raving reviews, and I feel it does what it advertises. This stuff reduced the red bump on my tragus every time t appears overnight. I use it like a soak with a cotton ball. I still do the hot sea salt soaks, but this is a great supplement if you are in a hurry.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my ear lobes while I was stretching them and this stuff works wonderfully. I would repurchase this over and over. Very good for healing piercings.</li>
            <li> Only thing that heals my piercings properly.</li>
            <li> Great for the lazy at heart. Anyone can make there own saline solution, but when you need your daughter to clean her piercing, this works.</li>
            <li> Got this for my Madonna lip piercing and this works wonders. I love this product and would recommend to everyone I know</li>
            <li> I used this for a week and I got a bad infection. I&#x27;m not saying this is what gave me the infection I&#x27;m just saying h2Ocean dried my piercing out.</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic. It keeps my piercings healthy and clean. I love it. It was recommended to me by my piercer and I&#x27;m glad I went with it. I bought some for my lady and her new piercings and it&#x27;s working for her as well. Will keep buying. A+ 11/10</li>
            <li> help alot with my piercing and would tell any one that have piercing you must have this bottle in handy.</li>
            <li> Just like youd buy at a piercers or a tattoo shop. Its the easiest for travel &amp; not having enough time to mix salt &amp; water when youre late for work</li>
            <li> After changing my helix ring to a gold horseshoe,  or so I thought as it turned out to be gold plated my piercing became inflamed with this huge pump at the back and pus exiting both the front and back or the piercing site. I ordered this spray, after one week the piercing look drastically better, now two months after it is fully healed!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. My tragus piercing is a year old and still hasn&#x27;t fully healed, but I&#x27;ve been using this product on it for about three months and it looks and feels better every day. I should have used this from the day I got it pierced! Like many people, I had a gross bump on my piercing that just wouldn&#x27;t go away...two weeks of using this a few times a day and it was completely gone! About a week ago my piercing suffered some trauma from the jewelry snagging on my pillow, and it flared up really bad. I knew it was straight to the h2ocean I go! I truly believe salt water is one of nature&#x27;s great healers. This stuff works great on cuts and acne too! I would recommend this to anyone healing a piercing.</li>
            <li> I got a monroe, and this is way more convenient than mixing up batches of salt water and dabbing on a piercing.  It also does help tone down any itching you might have through the initial healing and does a good job of cleaning/drawing out crusties. It did dry out my skin in the surrounding area, but nothing a little lotion couldn&#x27;t fix.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s due solely to this solution, because I used Provon soap and a bioflex stud too - but this piercing has definitely healed up nicer than an eyebrow ring I had a few years ago.  All in all, I&#x27;d recommend this for ease-of-use and portability.</li>
            <li> Actually made my belly button piercing a bit more irritated than usual. I guess I must just have sensitive skin and the added things in this are too harsh. If you&#x27;re like me, don&#x27;t underestimate the power of a good ol&#x27; fashioned sea salt soak and a q-tip. A bit more time consuming, but much better for people like me with sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve heard that it&#x27;s a good product, though, just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> This is the only spray I use on my piercing.  My nose piercing is over 5 years old, but I have really sensitive skin so my skin around my stud tends to flare up over nothing.  H2Ocean is fantastic at clearing up minor irritations on old piercings and for cleaning new piercings.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything else for my piercings and nothing has helped. until now!! great stuff! hope it works for everyone else</li>
            <li> I love H2Ocean! I use it regularly on all piercings. If I start having any soreness I spray it and the next day all pain is gone.</li>
            <li> I have an industrial bar and use this to help it heal faster. if it gets infected after a few sprays the infection goes away&lt;br /&gt;* tip: if you have a piercing infection use tea tree oil along with this</li>
            <li> Great product!! Used the first (1.5 oz) bottle from the piercing parlor before I was totally healed, within 2 days I knew I had to get more. Helps soothe soreness &amp; lubricate to keep the barbell from sticking when it moves. I used it probably twice every day &amp; I healed so much faster than I had expected to! And it helps with acne &amp; minor cuts or scrapes too! Definitely worth buying the 2 bottle pack</li>
            <li> Maybe I overused it, but it didn&#x27;t really help my piercing. I think mine got infected... But that could be my fault. I didn&#x27;t really care for it, but it seems like it&#x27;d be really great and efficient if it actually worked for me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years &amp; I&#x27;ve always had PERFECT healing. I&#x27;m also very careful at what I do. Like the bottle says, I use this stuff 3 times a day. Every other day, I&#x27;ll do a sea salt soak (get a Dixie cup &amp; fill it up with hot water, add some table sea salt &amp; soak the area with the piercing for a minute or two) for a month. After one month, I just clean 3 times a day with H2ocean. I have snake bites, industrials, nose piercing, cartridge; you get the idea. This solution is amazing. If your piercing isn&#x27;t healed right after using this for awhile, the piercing wasn&#x27;t pierced correctly.</li>
            <li> Buy it. Use it. Love it. It does not burn or sting, but keeps new piercings clean and soothed. My microdermals healed perfectly with this. I will use this product for all future piercings.</li>
            <li> Awesome! It&#x27;s great and so easy! I felt a difference right away from this to the gel that I was given by the piercing place! It&#x27;s phenomenal!!!! Recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this...did nothing for my Travis piercing. Much better off with tea tree oil which is a natural antiseptic.</li>
            <li> This is a Great product! Effortless transaction. Highly recommended. This is all I use on any piercing. Repeat customer and will continue to be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> The ONLY thing that prevented me from developing a keloid or hypertrophic scar on my nose! About two days after I&#x27;d accidentally got my nose stud caught on the fibers of a washcloth (while washing my face) a HUGE bump developed right beside the piercing. I assumed the piercing was just irritated so, I left it alone but nothing was healing the wound. I decided to get H2Ocean to speed the recovery with minerals and other healing enzymes and overnight the swelling went down drastically. I&#x27;m so glad that I took care of the would before scar tissue could appear--I have seen people with large keloids or hypertrophic scars on their noses from trauma along the nose stud that didn&#x27;t heal correctly. Yikes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update July 2015 * Here&#x27;s a photo to show the bump I had just beyond my nose stud. Throughout the day, it would fill with fluid that had to be drained. My &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; pic is after I&#x27;d actually put a bit a pressure on the bump to drain the fluid. I&#x27;m sure doctors/piercers would say NOT to do that, but I did anyway. After using H2Ocean everyday, it began to heal within a week and I would apply a TINY bit of Neosporin at night. Within a week, it was fine. I was also sure to clean the inside of my nose well, with the H2Ocean spray.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always tended to have issues with ear piercings healing and this stuff WORKS! It&#x27;s easy to use (I usually just sprayed some on a q-tip or sprayed it directly where I needed it). I would recommend this to anyone who is getting new piercings and also for anyone who wants to keep their current piercings clean :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had ten plus body piercings. I have used this on all of them. It&#x27;s made them heal quicker, and faster.</li>
            <li> Great value, easy to use, and really effective in cleaning new or maintaining cleanliness on older piercings. I thought I had a badly infected dermal and after a few consist days of this product and q-tip cleansing I was able to break away any build up around the stud without irritating the area more and it&#x27;s doing great now! Would buy and recommend! Big bottle is great value!!</li>
            <li> fix the problem ring up to heal fast for my nose&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t sting like usually salt water does it&#x27;s quick to use for the nose it was great shipping service&lt;br /&gt;over all a great product on everything :)</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF!!! IT MAKES MY NIPPLE PIERCINGS FEEL SO MUCH BETTER. I USUALLY JUST SPRAY THEM THEN WIPE THEM CLEAN WITH A QTIP AND IT LASTS VERY LONG AS LONG AS YOU ARE NOT SPRAYING TONS OF IT AT A TIME. GOOD LUCK!</li>
            <li> my daughter had her belly button pierced and I was very worried about infection setting in. The ocean spray has kept it in top shape, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Two years after I had my cartilage pierced it was STILL red &amp; swollen with an ugly bump that wouldn&#x27;t go away! I finally asked my doctor what to do; he gave me an antibiotic ointment. That made it worse!! My friend suggested H2Ocean. After 3 DAYS my ear was completely healed! No more bump, no more swelling. I love this product and recommend it to everyone. I probably don&#x27;t even need it anymore but I still use it once a week, just because it feels good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh! It also helps get rid of acne! I read that in an amazon review, so I tried it and it works!!</li>
            <li> I used this after I got my belly pierced and it has yet to turn as red as they said it would or hurt.  Like everyone else says it gets it clean without irritating the skin.  LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> H2Ocean is awesome. It may take a while to work but if you&#x27;re consistent and patient it&#x27;ll work for you.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for hard to clean piercings. I personally have my belly button pierced and I use this everyday  to prevent infection.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to clear your piercing when you recently got it or for preventive maintenance. I have my nose pierced for 3 months now and will continue to use this at least once or twice a month to maintain a clean area. Recommended for all which have piercings.</li>
            <li> I am so mad, the sprayer won&#x27;t actuate and there&#x27;s no way to get the liquid out effectively. I got a lemon and it cant be returned due to shipping specs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a nice full bottle, but no way to get use of it. :(</li>
            <li> Got to get more already. This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product. However I ordered two, one didn&#x27;t have a cap on and was half empty. The other one have the spray dried all over. Neither of them came with seals like the previous one did. I&#x27;m a little nervous to use them becuase of no seals.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! Healed my cartilage piercings in no time at all! I highly recommend this if you have new piercings, or just want a good product to clean your piercings with.</li>
            <li> I just got my naval pierced in April, and since then it&#x27;s been getting infected on-and-off. I created my own saline solution with sea salt that the piercer provided, but lately it hasn&#x27;t been working. After reading all of the positive reviews I was excited to try this product. It arrived a day before the estimated arrival. I&#x27;ve used it for 2 days now, and I can already tell a difference with my infected piercing. The swelling has gone down and there isn&#x27;t as much discharge. I love love love the H2Ocean spray.</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders fast...I ordered this product about a week after I got my navel pierced. This was my first  not counting so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect. I heard that surface piercings hurt and take longer to heal than others and I must say that this product it helped it heal pretty fast. I have no more soreness and it&#x27;s looking great and it only been a little over a month.</li>
            <li> This is very easy to use but I have yet to see results with a bump on my cartilage piercing...will update review when I do...or maybe not...there&#x27;s enough reviews....know what? I won&#x27;t...goodbye.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Had bumps on the inside of my forward helix and tragus. This stuff healed them in a week. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I got my most pierced almost three weeks ago.&lt;br /&gt;The antibacterial soap my piercer gave me worked fine when he did my conch last year, but a week into my nose piercing aftercare and it was irritating the inside of my nose and drying out the skin on the outside.&lt;br /&gt;Elayne Angel&#x27;s The Piercing Bible recommended a saline solution and that really helped, but it felt wasteful to make a cup of the stuff when I only needed enough to wet a q-tip (and storing it long-term just seemed unsanitary) so I bought this.&lt;br /&gt;After a week of this, my piercing feels like I&#x27;ve had it for months. There&#x27;s no redness, no pain (even when I accidentally hit/snag it or when I wiggle and scrunch up my nose), and no more crusties.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not even sure if it&#x27;s still producing discharge, it seems completely healed (however, its probably not fully healed and I fully intend to continue cleaning it daily and not change jewelry for another two and a half months or so. Never be reckless with a fresh piercing just because it seems fine)&lt;br /&gt;The bottle says to use it 3-6 times a day, but I usually just use it after I shower in the morning and before I go to bed (unless I&#x27;m working in the garden or at the gym, then I use it after I&#x27;m done with that). I just spray the ends of a q-tip and use one on the inside, one on the outside.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful product 10/10 would recommend.</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter&#x27;s newly pierced ears, the reviews were too good to pass up.  Went to use it for the first time and the sprayer was defective/stuck.  The entire bottle emptied on first spray.  What a waste of money :(</li>
            <li> Good, but I purchase too much after I got my belly button pierced. I used it for 3months then my piercing healed completely. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> After getting my navel pierced I purchased the 4oz H2Ocean sea salt cleanser from my piercer I paid $20 for it. I really wished I had purchased it on amazon instead for less than half the price I gave. This product really works wonders and takes away redness and swelling and that itchy feeling you get afterwards. I would recommend this product to anyone! It&#x27;s the best on the market and to save you some hard earned cash the smart thing to do if you know your surly going for a piercing I would purchase this product in advanced so you don&#x27;t end up being charged a bomb at your local piercer shop. :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my nipples pierced for about 2 years and they still get infected every once in awhile and ever since I&#x27;ve been using this product they havent got infected and I wish had got this stuff when I first got them pierced. So I very highly recommend this product for any body with nipple piercings.</li>
            <li> My daughter has piercings and this worked wonders with cleaning her belly button ring and keeping it from getting infected.</li>
            <li> I have several piercings and this is the best aftercare I have ever found. Love it, Works great!!</li>
            <li> This is the BEST stuff to use when trying to heal a piercing, and its usually fairly expensive. Pierce this 2 has a very reasonable price, and does not charge a fortune for shipping, so all in all you save money and still get the quality of this wonderful product. Thanks!</li>
            <li> The worst product I have ever used for piercings. For the first few days after piercing my nose I used a saline solution and it was going great, there was minimal swelling and no redness or signs of infection. Then my friend recommended i switch to H2Ocean. I had to have my piercing removed at the shop after 2 days because of how bad the swelling was. The instant he pulled it out, I felt a loud pop and the hole almost shut conpletely and began to ooze a yellowy-liquid. My piercer said he has never had a customer with a good experience from this product.</li>
            <li> I got this after my cartilage piercing started to get infected.  After just one day of use (applying every 6-8 hours as directed) I noticed a decrease in swelling and there was much less pain.  After a few days my ear was almost back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even used this on my noise piercing to help aid healing and ward off infection.  A must have for any piercing to prevent infection and aid healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  All the piercings I used this on healed quicker then ones I didn&#x27;t use this on.  It calms any irritation that begins and I get no pain in newly pierced ears.  I just got two new piercings and have ordered another bottle for them.  I continue to highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have 14 piercings, and I swear by H2Ocean!  I recommend this product to everyone I know-- it&#x27;s sterile, pH-balanced, won&#x27;t irritate piercings, is very convenient to carry in your purse/ etc, and is simple to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My directions: Spray your piercing with H2Ocean at least 4 times a day to sterilize and moisturize the area as long as your piercing is healing.  When in the shower, wash your piercing with unscented, pH-balanced, anti-bacterial soap.&lt;br /&gt;Never touch your piercing with dirty hands, never let anyone else touch your piercing with dirty hands/ etc, and don&#x27;t be unhygienic in any way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you already have a piercing that is red, swollen, beginning to keloid-- stop what you a currently doing and begin this regimine!  Soak a cotton ball in H2Ocean and hold it on the piercing for about 8 minutes-- this will make a huge difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is amazing!  Get it, and you won&#x27;t be sorry!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;xoxo&lt;br /&gt;Aurora</li>
            <li> Its harder to apply to facial piercings</li>
            <li> Ships fast and works great. Leaves my ears feeling soothed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my low 40&#x27;s, and when I was a teen, I had my ears pierced 3 times, and have usually only used the first two piercings. Though, the past 2 years, I thought it would look nice to use the third one, and boy, did it hurt when I had to push an earring through there, and after a day and night of keeping it in, hoping that my ear would get used to it, using hydrogen peroxide every few ours on my ear, and earrings, but I just couldn&#x27;t keep the earring in because it was so painful. I&#x27;d try again every few weeks-same thing. I finally decided to look into finding a solution, besides hydrogen peroxide which has always worked for me, to put on it which would help to heal it. I found this product, and bought it because of the great reviews. I used it often, the first two days, and I didn&#x27;t have less pain, but on the 3rd and 4th day, I started noticing a big difference. Two weeks later, the third one, which I hadn&#x27;t used for years, now feels like the first 2 which I have used since I was a teen-no pain at all. Whew! I can now wear 3 earrings a day (and night when I sleep), with no pain at all.</li>
            <li> This has lasted me a long time. A very practical item, glad I purchased it. Will purchase it again, thanky thanky.! My piercing has improved, thats for sure.</li>
            <li> I use this product for almost all my piercings. Ever since I started using this product I see my piercings heal a little quickly and prevent them from getting infected for which I love. I will continue to use this product every time I get a new piercing or on anything I can use this product on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on both my piercings, but since my ear is a lot more finicky I&#x27;ve had to go to saline for it, my lip however is healing rather quickly. I&#x27;m a smoker, and generally it takes longer for any piercing/wound to heal, but with this it&#x27;s doing amazingly well. I&#x27;m satisfied, they&#x27;ve seemed to fix their issues from previous bottles that the sprayer would pop off... (Which i don&#x27;t get why people made such a big fuss about that, it will literally go straight back on with no problem...) It&#x27;s all in all a great product, I can recommend this to anybody.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing to note- is if you have prior problems with piercings, don&#x27;t panic, and just keep with a cleaning regimen and switch every so often between this and another.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost the entire duration of my piercings healing process so far, and it&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br /&gt;The Lysosome, (an organelle in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells containing degradative enzymes enclosed in a membrane.) in combination with the Sea salt, which others have just dismissed this because it has sea salt, is an extra kick to help your body properly heal itself.</li>
            <li> The spray cap stopped working after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I use this here and there because I kept getting nose ring infections and thought this could clear it up. It hasn&#x27;t worked the way I was expecting it to. If your looking for something for the same issue Im having I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> We could not get it to spray out and we can&#x27;t return it.</li>
            <li> This was such a fast delivery ...I recently got my tragus and rook done ... Was the best</li>
            <li> It came really fast and was just as described. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This stuff really helped clear a stubborn infection in my ear right up, and made cleaning my ear a breeze. Much faster than using sea salt solution and comparable to sea salt soaking it for 5-10 minutes. This stuff WORKS! It cleared it up in just a few days, and no more annoying sea salt soaks. I&#x27;m now healed up and wearing my new earrings after my 6 weeks was up!</li>
            <li> I got double nostril piercings 3 months ago - didn&#x27;t have any issues for the first month and then the dreaded bumps appeared. Sea salt soaks worked the first time around but then the bumps came back- chamomile tea bags worked the second time but of course those stubborn bumps showed up again. It&#x27;s like they&#x27;re a super virus and know how to beat any solution! Finally I read about h2ocean so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. After one day of using this product, the bumps are significantly reduced and the redness is nearly nonexistent! This stuff works faster than the sea salt and the chamomile! I&#x27;m impressed and I&#x27;ll be a customer for life if it keeps working (fingers crossed!)</li>
            <li> This is a can of sterilized salt water that can be sprayed onto piercings to help them heal. I have been using this to help my cartilage piercings heal. This spray helps to clean them and when they were still new and hurting, it also helped them to hurt a bit less. It seems to work great and it takes over a year (for me at least) to use up. This is my second can. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> this was broken when it was mailed in. didn&#x27;t even get to use it!</li>
            <li> My belly button piercing actually got infected, and I ordered this to help it heal. &amp;It works amazing! It has really helped my infection, it&#x27;s almost completely gone! I&#x27;m in love with this product, I would recommend this to anyone with piercings! &amp;I will continue to order this for any future piercings I may get! I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought this. It helped an &amp;#34;angry&amp;#34; piercing. I sprayed my piercing and in two days my irritation cleared up.</li>
            <li> I got a rook piercing &amp; have been using only this product. The healing process has been a breeze unlike my other piercings when I didn&#x27;t use this product.</li>
            <li> I had problems with my ears getting irritated and swollen. This is years after having my ears pierced. I have 10 total and I switched all my earrings to surgical steel and bought this on amazon. Within 3 days my ears were completely healed. I love this stuff. And will continue to use this. It&#x27;s great and easy to use. You just spray !!! No cotton balls, no soaking you piercing just spray and go. And it&#x27;s more sanitary.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of piercings and nothing heals them faster than H2Ocean. About 3 cans of this will completely heal a piercing. I had a friend also use this on tattoos. It&#x27;s ohh-so-soothing. I don&#x27;t mind paying a bit more for the best!</li>
            <li> This is the best spray out there for piercings, I used it for my new nose piercing, and dermal. Works great!</li>
            <li> This spray is perfect in taking care of newly peirced ears. We ordered 4 cans but one can&#x27;s sprayer was messed up.</li>
            <li> H2Ocean is by far the best product for tats and piercings.  There are alternatives, but I have been using this product for many many years.  I only gave four stars because somehow I managed to get the most annoying can with a leaky top.  I feel like I lost a lot of product. :-(</li>
            <li> 5 days ago I got my naval pierced.. Thinking I would be saving money, I opted to go with Bactine when the tattoo parlor offered me the H2Ocean spray for $15.. After 3 days of use my naval piercing was still extremely sore, red and not doing too well.. So I ordered this. I don&#x27;t know if it was timing or the product, but after 2 days of using this, my naval is no longer red or sore to touch.. So I am very pleased with the actual spray..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER.. The bottle leaks. I have used it a total of 6 times and it&#x27;s already 2/3 empty due to the leak. I would say it is worth it if you have a piercing that&#x27;s bothering you, but be warned you may get a bottle that leaks.</li>
            <li> Awesome, just a great cleaner. I&#x27;ve used it before and it cleans better than anything. Not toxic, won&#x27;t burn or cause any adverse effects.</li>
            <li> This is convenient in the sense that I don&#x27;t have to whip out a cotton pad or a q tip to clean my ear and it&#x27;s also pretty effective for light infections. But if you have a serious infection, do not use this! Go to the doctor. This will only help up clear minor things.</li>
            <li> I got dermal on the back of my neck and it is hard to take care since that is such an awkward area to have piercing. I use this to clean and keep the dermal piercing clean and it is wonderful and does the job. the seller provided fast shipping and nicely packaged the items. many thanks</li>
            <li> A staple for any new piercing or just keeping existing piercings clean. This lasts forever and feels so refreshing! I will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> Buy this. I have had issues with ear piercing infections my whole life... this is a miracle spray!</li>
            <li> I love the product but the actual spray can is terrible. The actual liquid is amazing! The can leaks though and that really sucks because it wastes your money.</li>
            <li> Great for piercings and tattoos.loved this product ever since it was recommended by my tattoo artists . thank you so much.</li>
            <li> Would give 0 stars.....the bottle come leaking and it cant even be returned..... this is the second time i have got this the first time everything was perfect so i thought it would be okay to order again i was wrong.....just out almost 20 dollars perfect!!!</li>
            <li> If you have any body piercings this is the product to use to clean and heal piercings, the shipping was super fast and the price for the size of the can is great bought this months ago and I still have the can and still use it! A really great aftercare product from a great business.</li>
            <li> Ggggrrreeaaatttt!!!!! I love this spray help heal my nipple piercings , great for razor burns as well! Will repurchase time and time again!</li>
            <li> I got a third hole pierced in my ears at a reputable pavilion in a nearby mall. They pierced my ears with a gun. About 2 days later, my ear lobes were throbbing, sore, hot, swollen and red. Despite my cleaning them twice a day with the cleaning solution provided at the time of piercing, I was headed straight for infection-ville. I remembered using H2Ocean for a nose piercing I got a while ago at a tattoo shop. It healed quickly and without incident.  So I headed straight back to the tattoo shop to buy another can before things got really bad with my ears.  I applied the solution in the parking lot of the tat shop. I was desperate!  I cleaned my new piercing 3 or 4 times a day for 2 days. By the third day, ALL signs of irritation and infection were COMPLETELY gone. It feels like I never got a piercing.  If you&#x27;re getting pierced or you&#x27;ve already done it, this stuff is a MUST HAVE for happy healing. Get some!!! NOW!!!</li>
            <li> saves me the hassle of trying to soak it. Fast, easy, and much more efficient. I recommend to anyone with piercings!</li>
            <li> My daughter went through a couple of these with her recent nose piercing. It seems to work better than anything else! Just wish it came in a bigger size.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I use it for everything.  It work on rashes, or any irritated skin. It soothed my sunburn.  I bought a 4 oz bottle 6 months ago and it is just now running out.  Use It sparingly. You don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> I was afraid I would get a 1.5 oz because of other reviews but I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase I got it 2 before before the expected arrival.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this. It is totally unnecessary. You will save a lot of money by just making your own sea salt solution. This made my ear a lot more irritated and I only used it twice a day. Once I stopped using this stuff, my ear looked and felt a million times better. Hold on to your money, don&#x27;t but this. Not worth it</li>
            <li> I just got my nose pierced in April and this stuff has been great for keeping it clean and infection-free.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Even when my piercing is swollen and looks like it getting that dreadful bump, this stuff takes it right down without irritation.</li>
            <li> Worked as good as if you were buying it in the piercing shop</li>
            <li> this cleaning stuff helped my tragus piercing heal and the bump never came back. If i get more piercings i definetly need to get more of this!</li>
            <li> This product is really good at cleaning the surface of the skin like removing dead skin and such.  However, I am not sure how well it disinfected and helped with the healing process.</li>
            <li> It was good, but since its a spray, it got a little messy when applying.&lt;br /&gt; All in all great product.</li>
            <li> H2Ocean is much easier to use on a new ear piercing- most piercers will give you salt with a little cup- very hard to soak an ear for 10 minutes that way. I still use the spray, especially before and after running- whether I&#x27;m wearing earrings or not- just to keep the healed piercing clean. The spray is very soothing if a pierced ear gets irritated. This is difficult to find at a piercing store, and to find the 4oz can, so ordering online is the best way to purchase.</li>
            <li> Great product. Use it every day to clean my piercing.</li>
            <li> This is a great product when you have piercing. Fast service. So problems of any kind</li>
            <li> I got my snakebites yesterday.  Over the years with all my other piercing I&#x27;ve used Morton ionized salt with warm water. I&#x27;m glade I made the choice to buy this. It&#x27;s much more efficient and easy to use. Definately will use for future piercings. Does taste a little funny though, but gets job done.</li>
            <li> Very good product.  I bought a small bottle where I had my tragus piercing done and it works very well, so I ordered the bigger bottle from Amazon for the same price I paid for the small bottle at the shop.  I have had no discharge and pain has been minimal from the piercing. I was skeptical because in the past, alcohol or peroxide was used. But this works much better than either of those. Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I used this spray at the suggestion of my piercer for my industrial and it cut my healing time in half. I used it for about 3 months with soap and water cleansing in between and after 5 months I could lay on my industrial without pain or irritation. Highly recommend this product and it was cheaper getting it off amazon than from my shop.</li>
            <li> I got my septum pierced about a month ago. The first few days I was using hot salt soaks, but those were kind if a pain and pretty impractical. I ordered this stuff as soon as I could because of all the good reviews. My piercer said it could take 3 months to heal, but thanks to this spray I was healed and without pain in less than a month! The coldness may not feel as nice as the warm soak, but it&#x27;s so much easier to do and you can really get up into those crevasses without moving or touching your nose/the piercing at all, (which is a must in those first two weeks due to how sore you&#x27;ll be).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really glad I bought this. My piercer was trying to sell me a generic saline solution for $15 at the shop and I&#x27;m glad I found this instead!</li>
            <li> I have a few piercings and I always use this stuff because it&#x27;s natural. I don&#x27;t ever use the solutions they provide because they are not good for you at all. This stuff is theeee best .. I like to make my own salt water solutions but I don&#x27;t always have the time. So this is, again, thee best!</li>
            <li> Quick shipping! Great item.</li>
            <li> I was very happy to find this item, and can say that it is much better than trying to soak a new piercing in salt-water (not very convenient for a helix piercing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does exactly as it says: It cleans the piercing &amp; the jewelry &amp; dissolves crusted lymph fluid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have is that you aren&#x27;t supposed to dry it or wipe it ... and it eventually dries to leave a really dried area. I have found this to be a bit too drying and causes the earring to fuse with the skin - which means tearing skin when spinning the earring. Since a big part of getting piercings to heal is to keep the skin from fusing with earrings, I think this is a negative for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I continue to use it multiple times a day whenever I feel itching or irritation, but I have recently purchased another product that is a liquid soap called Crazy Chameleon piercing cleanser from [...] that has helped IMMENSELY with calming the area down &amp; really promoting healing. It is said to also reduce scar formations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the H2Ocean is a good product, but its healing abilities are questionable.</li>
            <li> I always keep this on hand, it is without a doubt the best product for piercings!</li>
            <li> I just pierced my nipples....YESTERDAY! And let me tell you... piercing those things were not my most fun piercing. Ive had them all, nose, tragus, cartilage, belly (done twice) and tongue. These things HURT like Hell. However, I immidiately purchased this once I was pierced from the shop because Ive heard so many great reviews on it... IT IS THEE TRUTH!!!! My nipples were extremely sore and sensitive to any touch, even my own t-shirt and swollen a bit. I sprayed this on 3 times and a final time before I went to bed last night. The after-piercing pain/discomfort was GONE! The mild swelling was GONE! My nipples looked as though they&#x27;ve been pierced for awhile now, they looked and felt great. Also, there were no &amp;#34;crusties&amp;#34; around the barbells like most new piercings create. I LOVE THIS STUFF! I never do reviews so it&#x27;s pretty damn awesome!! :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on and off over the years for my piercings, it works really well in cleaning and reducing swelling caused by inflammation and also reduces the size of the bumps that normally pops u when you have a cartilage piercing. I use it in conjunction with coconut oil to add moisture after this has dried up. I&#x27;ll always go back to it. the price on here was good with free ship.</li>
            <li> After showering and cleaning with Dial soap, spray this on and walah! Your piercing will heal in no time. Bought for a new naval piercing and was healed completely in about a month. Won&#x27;t change it still listening to my piercer, but the skin around the piercing is completely healed and no puss. Thanks for an awesome product!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I ran out of the saline wound wash that I originally bought from my piercer when I first got my conch pierced. I had no problems with it. I have now been using it on my new nose piercing with no problems.</li>
            <li> Great for piercings. Keeps them clean without having to wash them multiple times per day. I&#x27;ve used it on all piercings, and it works wonders! Worth the purchase for sure.</li>
            <li> I am stretching my lobes and I use this stuff to care for my ears. It helps the healing process and keeps everything nice and clean. I like that its a spray so it helps keep germs off your ears. Awesome stuff. :D</li>
            <li> Wife&#x27;s ear was swollen, red, pussy, and almost growing around piercing.  This took the swelling down in a few days of using a few times a day.  Works great!!</li>
            <li> Ive been having a lot of trouble cleaning my industrial piercings, if you know its a very difficult piece to take care of. But this stuff works! After a week or two, my piercing was clean, and i didnt have to worry about infection. I love how its a spray bottle, and ill be buying again soon. The bottle is a lot smaller than i expected but it really goes a long way. &amp;#60;3 love it, saved my piercing!!! I also do regular cleanse soaks, but this is perfect for cleaning it in rushed mornings, or tiering nights after a long day.</li>
            <li> Sprayer has broken on two out of two bottles. After only a few uses it just stops working. So annoyed!!!!</li>
            <li> I recently got my helix pierced along with another body peircing. My body peircings quickly healed in less than 2 months! Since my helix usually gets infected easily I was in dire need of a care product that would help prevent that. This spray gets the job done. It soothes pain, thoroughly cleans, reduces redness, can be used with any peircing &amp; at the same time heals! I love this stuff &amp; reccomend!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a last ditch effort in keeping my eyebrow ring. Ever since they were re-pierced it has not healed up in almost 2 years, constantly getting infected and blood bubbles, I was to the point of just taking them out, cleaning it up and giving up. The first time they never had an issue. I went to get them re-stretched after they tried to heal on me and the guy re-pierced them instead, right next to the other holes. NOTHING but issues since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this and started using it twice a day at first, then once every other or two, my piercings have cleared up, have no had blood blisters since or crazy infections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY Reccomnd this product. It saved my face! lol</li>
            <li> Keep the piercing feeling clean through recovery! I used it on my earlobe piercing and it worked wonders. So easy with the spray as well! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> really good for navel piercings. definitely worth the money! if you use it regularly it can really relieve redness and sensitivity of the piercing</li>
            <li> this stuff is fantastic. I have a navel piercing and occasionally it gets infected, red and icky. just 1-2 spray of this a day for like 3 days and BOOM no more infection, just silky healthy skin :) I would recommend it for anyone with piercings, ears, nose, lip, and especially belly!</li>
            <li> The spray can didn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Is it possible to leave no stars?  I&#x27;ve had an ear cartilage piercing for over 16 months.  I bought this just to help keep the area clean.  After the first use my ear became swollen.  The next morning blood had caked around my piercing.  I went to my piercer that afternoon and he told me that I should stay away from the product and go back to sea salt soaks until it re-healed.  I know everyone&#x27;s experience can vary, but I just want to let people know that there can be very adverse reactions to using this product.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff.  It&#x27;s just saline, but works great to help heal new piercings.  I know the size is clearly stated, but you don&#x27;t realize how small the container is until you get it.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Worked really well on my piercing! Helped heal the nasty bumps on the cartilage on my ears, great stuff!</li>
            <li> I use h2ocean quite often. I ordered two but when they got here, one didn&#x27;t have the spray nozzle and the other one, the nozzle broke off.</li>
            <li> I have a triple forward helix, and trying to mix up my own sea salt solution and get it on my piercings without giving myself swimmer&#x27;s ear was a PAIN. This stuff is magic. It gets in there without making a huge mess and makes it sooooo much easier to clean my piercings!</li>
            <li> I like the product, I&#x27;ve found it very convenient on the go for new or upset piercings.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately 2/4 cans I&#x27;ve recieved have had defective spray nozzles after a couple months of use.</li>
            <li> It was working, like healing my piercing then the nozzle on the spray bottle just came off, I was upset &amp; wasn&#x27;t going to spend my money again on it. Upset ! 😑</li>
            <li> Great product&#x27;! My daughter used it if her belly piercing.  It soothed  and cleansed it at the same time. I would definetly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> Works well but I mean seriously... you&#x27;re paying money for salt water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t last that long but it is convenient.</li>
            <li> When I got my snakebites this spray worked just as my piercer said it would. I had no trouble with the product and my piercing did not get infected.</li>
            <li> I had a nasty bump by my nose piercing for the past few days. It was huge, painful and disgusting. I ordered this, and received it this morning. The bump seriously went down in less than a day! It popped a little, and I kept cleaning it. But it wasn&#x27;t a hard process. Now, you can&#x27;t even tell I had something there.</li>
            <li> Works great on all my piercings! never get infected again after using it</li>
            <li> The only piercing spray I ever use!</li>
            <li> Go-to aftercare for piercings; pretty basic and does the job, as long as you are good with up-keep. For serious infections, google sea salt soaking for piercings.</li>
            <li> I had some &amp;#34;hidden&amp;#34; piercings and used this to clean it multiple times a day. Unfortunately, one of the piercings didn&#x27;t heal properly (nothing to do with this product), but H2Ocean actually helped clear up the infection and prevent it from really coming on. The other piercing healed beautifully and stays clean with a few sprays every now and then. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I got this stuff originally from the shop where I got my triple helix done, but when I ran out I wanted to have something to clean up makeup from the area. It works great!</li>
            <li> my piercing was fine before i use this. ever since i use this spray for my piercing, it grow worse than ever and so does my friend&#x27;s piercing! I&#x27;ve thrown it away.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my belly piercing, worked like magic...for over 7 months that would wasn&#x27;t healing...i was using betadine..I googled found this and in less than a week or two...the drainage had cleared..wound healed...the lysozyme in it ate the bacteria maybe dunno....</li>
            <li> I used this on my nose piercing when it got infected a couple of weeks after I got the piercing. healed it right up. I used this about a week ago when it showed signs of infection and after a couple of days it was back to normal. the 4 oz size lasts FOREVER I haven&#x27;t even used a fourth of it. A must for every piercing.</li>
            <li> Great product, helps a lot! Thank you for the awesome price!</li>
            <li> I had received the small size (1.5ounce) from my piercer.  They wanted $9.00 for a second can.  This one was a much better bargain.</li>
            <li> The thing is, I have never had my ears pierced so I cannot say if this worked or not... But I got a triple forward helix at least a couple months ago, and I was told that they take a very long time to heal completely and they hurt for a while! Well my ears feel fine, unless I do something silly like smack myself really hard, and they seem to already be mostly healed! I did spray some on a cotton ball and use it on my face for my acne, it didn&#x27;t seem to help it much Buuuuut I didn&#x27;t see any new acne pop up either... But it made me feel better to have something beside just &#x27;Water and soup&#x27; which is what my piercer told me to use.</li>
            <li> This is a product to use when ur in need of some fast healing. I will buy again, good price other places its expensive.</li>
            <li> Best thing you could buy for your piercings!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this on my year old microdermals that like getting infected once in a while, my new nip piercings, as well as my stretched ears. Results always the same, redness/soreness gone within a few hours, infection gone within a day or two at most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish I had known about this years ago, would have saved me COUNTLESS piercings!</li>
            <li> I really needed this stuff for my industrial piercing! I ran out of my other bottle the same day I received this bottle! Great service! :)</li>
            <li> My belly button piercing wasn&#x27;t healing after 8 months so I bought this product and it healed in two weeks within using it.</li>
            <li> This product works ok but honestly, it is WAY overpriced. This is ridiculous! All you have to do to make your own H2Ocean is heat up 8 oz. of water in your microwave and then stir in 1/4 tsp of sea salt. Stick it into a squirt bottle and save $20. Seriously. I don&#x27;t recommend buying this</li>
            <li> Purchased to help heal a tragus piercing. Works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I had only used the product a couple times before it broke..the item cannot be returned, either.</li>
            <li> My girl loves this product. It&#x27;s great for those complicated piercings (rooks, dermals, etc.) It really helps in the healing process a lot faster!</li>
            <li> It really works well, but I don&#x27;t like the sprayer top; its like a mist spray I have a nostril piercing, and I use q-tips to clean it. So, it&#x27;s hard to coat a q-tip or even a cotton ball with the sea salt and do a soak. Other than that, it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> I seen this stuff on a website I was looking at for piercings. I was interested in it and read some reviews. After coming here, to Amazon, I quickly found out it had several good reviews. I decided to try it out. I didn&#x27;t notice anything significant at first. I started gauging my ears though and they get sore after doing so, especially since I like to play my guitar, and I have to wear headphone so I don&#x27;t bother others. They&#x27;re always sore when I wake up first thing anyway. I spray a bit of this stuff on, and literally within minutes my ears aren&#x27;t hot anymore, and the pain almost completely vanishes. I recommended this stuff to my brother who is very experienced with piercings, and he&#x27;s surprised at how well this works. Great stuff. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone with piercings. It also has several other uses listed on a neat card that it comes packaged with. I&#x27;ve used it for piercings and when I get cuts. It also came with a 15% off next purchase code. Great for me, because I plan on ordering some more.</li>
            <li> H2Ocean works pretty well. I bought it after I let my friend give me 3rd holes in my ears when she got a job at Claires. I knew better than to use their solution (or go there at all lol) but I did anyway, and guess who got an infection on both ear lobes?! So I ordered this. I soaked my ears in warm salt water once a day and then sprayed this throughout the day and it helped significantly. The salt seems to help with any discomfort and works wonderfully. Now that the whole infectious ordeal is over, I just use it to keep them clean.</li>
            <li> Authentic Product and Fast Delivery! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff so much! i got it today and my  nose piercing is feeling soooo good. i dont know why i never got this for my previous piercings.</li>
            <li> I love this product for my piercings and have even used it on mosquito bites, ant bites, and my eczema!</li>
            <li> Awesome product. I used this right after I got my industrial piercing done and it worked amazing. it healed it extremely fast and will be ordering more in the future. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I got my bellybutton pierced three weeks ago, and I had ordered this before because one of my friends recommended it. I ordered two bottles because I was expecting them to be smaller when they are. I haven&#x27;t even come close to using all of the first one yet, and it seems to be working great! It is very convenient when I am at work or school because I can&#x27;t always make a sea salt soak. It&#x27;s so easy to use, and it arrived faster than I expected. Both the bottles were in great shape. I would definitely give this a try!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter as she had a cartilage piercing that has taken over a year to heal.  She was religiously preparing sea salt soaks with warm water, using a glass to soak her ear - time-consuming and messy.  The spray works wonderfully, and my daughter&#x27;s ears are doing fine.</li>
            <li> i bought this as soon as i got my ears pirced and was disapointed with how little was actually in the bottle and then when i found out that saline soluting aka contact solution dose the exact same thing i felt very ripped off. the price is way to high when you can use saline solution for a cupple dollors.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Helps the healing process of every one I&#x27;ve had. Recommended to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT product. Really helps with swelling/infections in piercings. I give it 3 stars because the aerosol can crapped out after about 2 weeks. It completely lost pressure so now I have to just stick a q-tip in the hole where the nozzle used to be. Otherwise, good stuff.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for everything having to do with skin healing or skin irritation. The relief is immediate.</li>
            <li> I normally am fearful of getting piercings due to sometimes keloiding but u recently got my nipples pierced and the pierced suggested this product and my piercings have been healing wonderfully! Now some say the bottle/can leaks and I did experience that ordering it from Amazon so my next can I will probably get at a pierced or hot topic store</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes for this stuff, as my ears are super sensitive and I was having issues with irritation. It was very cooling and soothing at first, but about an hour after, my piercing were swollen, dry, and hot. I tried it for a week and it just got worse and worse, with my ears peeling skin where ever this stuff had touched it (not even close to the piercing, so I know it wasn&#x27;t just crusties). I finally gave up and switched to a mild tea tree solution and my ears are much happier.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Really works! I used it for more  Than one purpose (piercing, bee sting, and razor bumps) loved the product!</li>
            <li> I got my nose pierced a while ago, and it got infected right away.&lt;br /&gt;I tried tea tree oil, sea salt, some other crappy piercing care solution, and even soaked my nose in chamomile. Nothing worked. I was getting super frustrated with this nasty red bump on my nose. Finally, I decided to try this product and the bump went away within hours I would say!&lt;br /&gt;Even today, months later, if I accidentally snag my nose stud on something or do something stupid where it falls out, H2Ocean saves the day!&lt;br /&gt;I use it for canker sores as well and they disappear within a day.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product!!!</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast and the bottle came ready to use. It really does wonders for any piercing, as it healed a small tear in my ear VERY quickly. The bottle did come a little broken, but it&#x27;s still able to use. I can not shake it up or even remotely move it without some of the contents coming out of the cap. Other than that, works great and is very nice!</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping, amazing product. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I like using this product in between salt water soaks--however, I find that when use the spray 3-4x a day and do the salt water soak only once (before bed), my Tragus is more tender versus when I do the salt water soaks 2-3x a day and don&#x27;t use the spray.</li>
            <li> Lid on the bottle was a little dirty upon arrival like it wasn&#x27;t kept in clean conditions before it was shipped, and the lid was also slightly cracked and wouldn&#x27;t stay on the bottle.</li>
            <li> After recently getting my nipple pierced the antibacterial soap wasn&#x27;t doing much when it came to cleaning and preventing infection. After a couple days of use, using it 2-3 times a day the small infection is pretty much gone and my nipples are healing really fast! Love it!!</li>
            <li> great product for piercing. this definitely help with the healing process.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for my second hole piercing I was using the solution given to me when I got them pierced but they were starting to get sore. I got this and almost immediately there was relief. I will be using it from now on for my piercings!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and is a great product.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST stuff. I got a cheap upper lobe piercing (first mistake) after I had gotten my first two holes with no pain and no bad after effects. Well. The earring on my upper lobe came out and long story short I had to put the earring back in THREE DAYS after getting it pierced. It swelled up and was so painful. I was scared my ear would swell around the earring. I got H2Ocean per recommendation of the piercing place and it was a miracle worker! I kid you not within 2-3 days my ear was perfectly normal and pain free. I bought another bottle just for the heck of it and just in case. Well about 7 months after I got the piercing I thought I was in the clear. Well I&#x27;m not sure what happened but my ear swelled again and this time it bled and there was white discharge. It was so gross and painful! Again, H2Ocean fixed my ear in 3-4 days. No pain and no longer swollen! I never write these reviews but I have been so satisfied I was compelled to write one. I feel like the dad in My Big Fat Greek Wedding-I&#x27;ve started putting it on scrapes and acne and it works for that as well. I would recommend getting this and using it in place of the stuff piercing salons give you. For me it has cleared up major swelling, major infection, and minor pain with this piercing since I got it!</li>
            <li> Amazing product not harsh on skin like other piercing cleaners</li>
            <li> I do not know what &amp;#34;aftercare&amp;#34; is supposed to mean. But while your piercing is HEALING.... DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT. It contains lysozyme which is derived from eggs, and can actually hurt your piercing rather than help it heal. Also if you have an allergy that&#x27;s another reason not to use it. As soon as I stopped using this product, I was better off. Expensive and pricey! Ask any GOOD piercer and they will NOT recommend it.</li>
            <li> I heard this stuff was great for fresh piercings. However when I received it after purchasing from Amazon, the bottle was completely sealed. As in the nozzle that is supposed to spray was completely sealed and I couldn&#x27;t even make a hole in it to get it to work. Maybe it was just bad luck. They promptly refunded me the money with no hassle. I&#x27;ve given it a one star only because I never got to actually try it.</li>
            <li> I have an industrial in my ear, it he first week I had it I can&#x27;t even describe how much pain I was in this stuff is like magic within about 3 days after using it my piercing didn&#x27;t hurt</li>
            <li> Great spray, I highly recommend it !</li>
            <li> You feel it working.  :)</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing it works great for all peircings , I recommend getting a 4oz bottle though because you go through it relatively fast.</li>
            <li> Good to have on hand, works great for cleaning when in a hurry or on the go.  Use with Q-tips to gently and safely clean any deposits on jewelry.  Helps with maintenance and peace of mind during the healing process.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I used it for my nipple piercings. If your piercing hurts, spray it this product. I also so on the website that you can use it for acne and canker sores. Clears my face right up and heals my boyfriend&#x27;s canker sores before they get worse. I also have a pet dumbo rat who ended up losing part of her toe. I decided to spray this product on her wound. Vet said to keep using it and it healed her right up in two weeks. Couldn&#x27;t love this product anymore.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m aware I could probably make a reasonable facsimile of this product for pennies on the dollar, I keep coming back to Amazon for it.  I got my cartilage pierced for the third time (long story) almost two years ago.  Because I have an auto-immune disease I take forever to heal in the first place, but as you may or may not know, cartilage takes forever and a half ANYWAY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff really kept me going, and hopefully I&#x27;m not jinxing it by saying my cartilage is finally healed!  Still, I also use this stuff for other stubborn minor wounds or acne (my daughter would swear by it) and I find it&#x27;s a product worth paying for.</li>
            <li> This makes cleaning your piercings so much easier. It helped get rid of some redness that I had around my piercing quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this. Although I can make my own, it is easy to just spray some on a q-tip (I get really close to the q-tip and spray a slow stream until saturated) and then clean my nose piercing. I also spray a tiny bit on a cotton ball and then lay it on my piercing to soak. I had hypertrophic scarring which caused a bump next to my piercing. It took time and patience but it helped. I also used this to make an aspirin paste which I placed on my nice every night. Now I just clean my piercing twice a day with the spray. I think I was over zealous initially with my piercing which cause the irritation and the bump. I have learned to not move the piercing and just clean gently around it. I also spray this into the inside of my nostril where the piercing in when my nose is dry. After 3 weeks of babying my nose, the bump went away.</li>
            <li> just this heals my belly piercing. And my dog bit it which set it back MONTHS. but again, with just this stuff, it&#x27;s already healing up as I it was never injured by that piranha like dog</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this a year ago when I had some ear piercings done. This stuff is the best. I have never had ear piercings heal so quickly. I had always gone to the mall to get my ears pierced and bought their after care stuff. My ears always took forever to heal. Not with this! Also, I just like to keep this around the house as a wound cleaner. It&#x27;s great for cleaning little cuts and scrapes. Also, great for healing blemishes. If you had to pop that pimple, then you have to clean it afterward. A little spritz of this will clear out the bacteria so it can start to heal. (and then keep your hands off it)  Also, if you tend to be allergic to certain metals and your ear piercings get infected, use this to clear the infection up. Another great thing about this product is that you can control the spray.  If you want just a tiny bit to spay out, you can do that. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I love H2Ocean but I had to take off a star because I think the sprayer on mine was defective. It leaked out the side and made the product get used up very quickly. I love it though and just think I got unlucky. I would still order again.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff it work&#x27;s in a day make&#x27;s it easy to put in now nipple rings I will be getting the h2ocean tattoo aftercare</li>
            <li> I got my tragus pierced a little over a week ago.  Despite following all of the instructions I was given, it still managed to get pretty swollen and infected.  I had heard about this product and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday my ear was red, swollen, and leaking.  When I got home from work I had the H20cean spray waiting for me.  I used it and within a couple of hours the redness and swelling were almost gone!  By this morning it is almost back to a normal size!  I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with the product.  By the positive reviews I figured it would help, but I never imagined it would make such a big difference in such a short amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never get another piercing without having a can of this handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, it had on the information slip it helps with acne.  I had a little pimple forming and sprayed that too.  This morning it is totally gone!</li>
            <li> I ordered H2Ocean b/c of all of the wonderful reviews that it received. Used it on 4 new piercings (R &amp; L tragus, L rook, R conch). It was ok. The first week that I used it it did help with the itching. But then my rook started to swell. I thought it was b/c I was sleeping on it so I kept using the spray thinking it&#x27;s great healing powers that people raved about would help. The saline solution that I was making myself was more soothing than this. I was wrong. I ended up doing a regular sea salt soak and then the rook began to feel better. I did not see any difference between the h2ocean and regular sea salt solution and the provon soap I used. And the 4 oz spray can does not last that long. I would use it 2-3 times a day (less than the recommended 3-6) and it only lasted about 3 weeks. I&#x27;m not about to spend $11 every 3 weeks on something that really didn&#x27;t seem to do too much good anyway. Save your money. Get some sea salt, distilled water, and provon soap. It&#x27;ll last A LOT longer and better than the h2ocean</li>
            <li> I love this H2ocean piercing aftercare spray! Great product! I will use this again &amp; I do recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I had used this product before, I just needed more of it and didn&#x27;t know where to get it locally. I paid about the same online as I did when I bought it in a shop. It arrived quickly and was in perfect condition. It&#x27;s a great product, very soothing and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I got  three helix piercings in a day from Walmart. Within a day they got infected. They kept getting bumped and irritated. I was using the standard cleaner they give you. After five days of them being infected, purple, painful to the touch and warm, I tried h2ocean. I&#x27;ll tell you right now, I was so close to taking them all out. This product worked like a miracle. All of my problems started disappearing. When I sprayed it on, it literally started pulling out pus from my piercings. I no longer have a problem.</li>
            <li> This is a great product I always use it for all my piercings I have 22 and this stuff healed them all and fast too I also use it to clean my piercings</li>
            <li> I spent $18 dollars and waited 4 days for it to arrive at my house broken.. The top did not work to spray and I can&#x27;t return it. Horrible!</li>
            <li> A great product that has helped a lot with the healing process of my industrial piercing, not to mention the fact that it has arrived in 5 days as opposed to 15. Five stars, great job!</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THE SPRAY ON BOTH OF MY NIPPLES AN SO FAR EVERTHING IS GOING JUST GREAT,THIS SPRAY IS JUST GREAT AN I WILL BUY MORE FROM THESE GUYS</li>
            <li> I got this to help keep my bellybutton ring clean during the day when I couldn&#x27;t do salt water soaks. A day or two after I started using it a big red bump appeared around the top of the piercing, and was bleeding. So after another day or two of using H2O I stopped and went back to just salt water soaks, it&#x27;s fine and back to normal now. I&#x27;m not sure what the problem was but H2O did not help any, if anything it made it worse. But I&#x27;ll keep it around, only because you CANT return it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using h2ocean for several years now, I love this stuff.  It works great for piercings!</li>
            <li> Got in on time and everything but after three days it stopped working and then leaked everywhere</li>
            <li> If you have piercings, especially cartilage, buy it. You&#x27;ll waste your money trying to care for your piercings yourself. Just get it. This product cuts down healing time by half.</li>
            <li> This is by far the most easy and efficient piercing care product available anywhere. I got my tragus pierced and they said that this piercing will be a problem area and prone to infection since it takes 9-12 months to heal. I sprayed this on 6 times a day for the first month, then 2 times a day for the second month, and now in the third month I use about every 2-3 days. My piercing does not hurt or itch or anything and I owe it all to H2Ocean. The only time it has hurt was when I got my hair done and the girl accidentally got bleach on it so as soon as I got home I sprayed this every hour for 4 hours and never had another issue. Please get this because it really does work.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for ear piercings! It doesn&#x27;t sting, helps the piercings heal, and is extremely convenient and easy to use. I love that it can be sprayed on so you don&#x27;t have to do the dreaded, time-consuming salt soaks.</li>
            <li> First, let me say this is NOT a bad product, it just wasn&#x27;t right for ME.  I travel a lot and sometimes soaking my piercings isn&#x27;t  so easy when you are on the go. This seemed like it would be a convenient way to care for them. I must be sensitive to an ingredient in this or something, though. Whenever I would use it my piercings would become sore, itchy and irritated. The itching was intense, and so bad I thought about removing the jewelry.  When I stopped using the product and went back to plain sea salt soaks the problem would clear up. I tried it several times thinking it may have been coincidence but had the same result each time. My sister loves it though, and I will continue to order it for her. But for me I will be returning to my regular sea salt soaks, they are cheaper and I can control the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I got the 1.5oz can from the piercing tattoo shop where I got my piercings, and it cost $10. After I finished that little can, I found Amazon carries the same thing but in a bigger sized can for the same price! Just got it, and it came after one day even though I ordered through 2 day prime membership shipping method. I am so happy because it came right after I emptied out the other can!</li>
            <li> This is awesome...had an industrial piercing and this has really helped to heal it up quickly !</li>
            <li> If you have a gold earring it heals quickly. It was really good.</li>
            <li> I liked the actual formula but the spray bottle completed stopped working after only using it a few times. Its still full but nothing will come out. Very disappointed since it had such great reviews.</li>
            <li> I WISH TGE BOTTLES CAME WITH MORE.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good spray... I just wish it was available in a bigger size.... and u won&#x27;t be able to tell wen it&#x27;s getting empty</li>
            <li> H2Ocean healed my nose piercing quickly.  This vendor sells at a great price and shipped my order very quick. Will def recommend.  Thanks</li>
            <li> H2Ocean is phenominal. I got my belly button and cartilage pierced about a month ago. I&#x27;ve been using the H2Ocean and it&#x27;s helped to clean and soothe the piercings without drying them out. Knowing that it&#x27;s natural and used for healing. I had some cuts/scrapes on my arm that were stinging so i sprayed some on the area and it immediately helps to soothe it and reduce redness! I definitely reccommend using it even if you&#x27;ve had your piercing for months.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this for her ears and it&#x27;s a really good product. I will order it again when she needs it.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this for my belly ring and then started to use this for my tragus and it&#x27;s a life-saver. Occasionally I would also break out in ugly ol&#x27; pimplos and bumpity bumps and this makes swelling from piercings or swellings in general go away almost instantly. This should really be called Magical Mist or something because it&#x27;s truly amazing.</li>
            <li> Revolutionary as an all around antiseptic.  Legendary healing times for any wound.</li>
            <li> I have had my nipples pierced for over a year now I used this stuff when I first got them pierced &amp; never have had a problem until now, Some how Ive gotten an infection in one of my nipples Ive been using a peroxide mix with water to kill the infection &amp; I use this spray to draw out any bit of infection left Works wonderfully! Great stuff I greatly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Yes, the saline solution is good, and the method of cleaning a piercing by spraying it is convenient and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the product I received was so poorly made that the spray nozzle was broken within less than 24 hours. This product is unusable if the spray bottle doesn&#x27;t work, and as you can see from other reviews here, many of these products are defective. The icing on the cake is that this purchase is not returnable or refundable by Amazon. I&#x27;d urge all potential purchasers to look elsewhere before investing money in something that won&#x27;t work especially because you can&#x27;t get your money back like you deserve!</li>
            <li> It has helped clear up my tragus piercing tremendously.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this and would recommend to anyone with new piercings. After just one day of use (applied 3-5 times a day) my swelling went down, the redness and soreness were all but gone, as well. For anyone that would like to know, I used this on an industrial piercing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was packaged well, also. It came quickly, and the bottle was factory sealed. I see people reporting problems with the nozzle/sprayer, but I encountered none myself.</li>
            <li> Helped heal my piercings PERFECT&lt;br /&gt;quick healing and i know it was due to this product</li>
            <li> Very quick delivery, it was here faster then I thought ! It works great ! Will definitely be using this from now until the end of time ! Love it ! (:</li>
            <li> I use to hate getting piercings to due to the fact that I would always get bumps and then the earring would become irrated and I would just end up having to take them out. I recently got a industrial piecring and decided to look up a cleaning spray. I already had a bump and decided to order this. I started using it and after a while my bump started to go away! I am so happy with this product! I will definatley buy again!!!</li>
            <li> Good Product. but I don&#x27;t love it!</li>
            <li> Great product thanks.</li>
            <li> Perfect for times you&#x27;re too lazy to make a warm salt soak from scratch, which means less skipping out on morning cleans or whatever. I&#x27;m pretty pleased, I&#x27;ve used this on all 7 of my piercings as well as my stretched eats and they&#x27;ve been doing great. I totally reccomend this to everyone with a piercing, New or old.</li>
            <li> This stuff is perfect for new piercings! I use this to clean my new septum piercing about 2-3 times a day. It makes it feel so fresh and clean! Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, which says something about this amazing product. After getting my nose pierced I was experiencing extreme redness, swelling, discomfort, and the formation of the \\&quot;bump\\&quot;. I bought this product just a few days after and within 24 hours it appeared completely normal. I was so excited and I have not had any problems at all and will continue to use this product daily.</li>
            <li> So, I have recently re-pierced my navel, 4th time is the charm right? So, I bought this and had it redone. We shall see if its everything its been cracked up to be. So far, so good. I have a little irritation, but I think that&#x27;s just do to the jewelry, I am very sensitive to all kinds of metals, even pure gold&#x27;s and silvers. But so far no swelling and the puss and discharge is at a bare minimum (completely normal). Very easy to use and for being &amp;#34;sea water&amp;#34; I expected a sting, but nothing, feels good when I spray it. I used to live in Miami and nothing healed a wound or even a piercing better than running into the ocean, so we shall see.</li>
            <li> perfect, takes away soreness, gentle spray, carry it in my deep purse, and will use this from now on. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great!! I thought it would be a little bigger but Great! Works wonders for any piercing. Using it for my conch and Helix!</li>
            <li> I’ve been using H2Ocean for the past 5 years of piercings and I highly recommend it! Before being introduced to H2Ocean my piercings would do one of two things… keloid or flat out reject the jewelry all together and turn the pierced skin into a wrinkled/scarred mess. I recommend H2Ocean to EVERYBODY because if it can save my piercings, it can save anyone’s.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, so this should tell you something... A week ago today I got both of my nipples pierced. I was instructed to clean them twice a day with regular saline solution, which I did diligently. The first 2 days the piercings felt great, but by day 3 lymph nodes in my left armpit where starting to swell. No worries, I just had sharp pieces of metal shoved into my body, of course my immune system is freaking out. By day 4 my right nipple is becoming increasingly sore. That&#x27;s when I start researching different aftercare options and H2Ocean starts popping up in my search. I have always found that if you want to get a real feel for people&#x27;s opinions of products, amazon.com is the place to go. So after reading many of the reviews I was sold. I should also state that I did not buy this off of amazon, but only because I need this product NOW. My nipples are nothing to play around with, so to speak, and I wanted this stuff before things got too bad. Sooo, I went to the local mall and procured some from Hot Topic. I have been using H2Ocean for less than 24 hours and all the soreness is gone and my lymph nodes are back to normal. I highly suggest to anyone who is planning on getting pierced, to have this on hand. Great product.</li>
            <li> I was using this on my cartilage piercing after it was done because that&#x27;s what they gave me to use. My piercing healing up pretty well but eventually I ran out. I tried doing at home sea salt soaks to see if this was really just overpriced seas salt soaks and my piercing got infected within a week (go figure). So I going to buy another bottle and hopefully my piercing will start to heal again!</li>
            <li> I recently had gotten my belly button done as well as 6 dermals ( i think thats how you spell it) on my back. This product saved me! Its perfect and helped me heal so fast! I love love love this!!! I can&#x27;t stress enough how important it is to keep your piercings clean and this is what the tattoo store recommend to me. they also sold it in the shop. It last a long time and is so important to have! I think this is a must if yo have a new piercing!</li>
            <li> Glad I took the recommendations of people online; this product has helped my ears heal after TWO YEARS of troublesome piercings.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping! Great product for all piercings</li>
            <li> I had an infection on my belly button ring and this helped heal it a lot!</li>
            <li> Must have if you have a belly piercing. I had an irritated piercing, and after using this, my belly was better in 2 days. I use it every day. Great stuff !</li>
            <li> I had my belly button pierced almost 2 years ago and was told to use the old antibacterial soap and neosporin trick to clean it -- in 2 weeks, it was swollen and infected, big time. I had to take it out and let it heal up. Later, I got it redone and used Blarex Wound Wash Saline on it, which did heal it quite nicely, but it took longer and I did have irritation to begin with. A week ago, I got my cartilage pierced and was recommended the H2Ocean -- WOW!! I can&#x27;t belive how well this has worked! I have had little to no crusties to clean and it looks great. It does still itch and it&#x27;s still sore, but I guess that&#x27;s to be expected. I use the spray at least 6 times/ day -- never less because I&#x27;m afraid of infection later. I have ordered 2 more cans from here for backups. One to keep at home and one to keep with me. I gave it 4 stars because I&#x27;m not sure how the entire healing process will go later, and it doesn&#x27;t stop the itching as the can says it does. But yes, I would definately recommend this before using anything else.&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE** Okay, it&#x27;s been 5 weeks since I had the cartilage pierced. I have had a bump for the past 3, even with increasing the use of H2Ocean. I stopped using it for a while and went to sea salt soaks and emu oil for a while, and it seemed to help, but not a lot. But, I had an idea. You can do sea salt soaks with cotton balls, so why not use H2Ocean on a cotton ball and hold it there? And whaddya know? The redness and the bump is already going down after doing this 3 times at 15 minutes each time. Maybe it didn&#x27;t work for me before because it doesn&#x27;t seem to stay on the ear... it just seems to wet it and roll off, whereas the cotton ball keeps it there so it can soak into the skin? I don&#x27;t know, but all I can say is it works, you just have to find the method that works for you as to how to apply it.</li>
            <li> omg! this product is awesome fast healing time and the price was great fast delivery</li>
            <li> Seems to work well so far. Bought it originally to help clear up an infected ear lobe after a stretch and it worked for that. I&#x27;m also using it on a new nose piercing, which is healing great with no discomfort whatsoever. I like how it&#x27;s in a spray can because it makes it easier to get into those hard-to-reach places (like inside my nose) without having to touch the piercing and risk germ exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been wanting to get a triple helix for a while but hesitated because other cartilage-type piercings have not gone well for me in the past, BUT this product is giving me confidence to try again. I&#x27;ll update how that goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: cartilage doing fine. I use this spray in between daily washes with hot water and dial gold. I also put a little tea tree oil on my piercings for good measure.</li>
            <li> The product was delivered very quickly which I loved. But the nozzle was defective.. the seller was apologetic and offered some suggestions as to how to fix the nozzle. That didn&#x27;t work and now I am left with a full can of h2ocea. That is completely useless to me. Perhaps it was just my bottle that was defective.  In terms of delivery,  I would say the seller did a great job at getting it to me quickly. Too bad.</li>
            <li> If you have an egg allergy/intolerance DO NOT use this product. Lysozyme is derived from eggs and the reaction is unbearable pain!</li>
            <li> Great for all of my piercings.</li>
            <li> Where would I be without this.. I certainly recommend this for anyone who has got fresh piercings, it&#x27;s so easy to use!</li>
            <li> Easy and simple cleaning, no other products need to be used along with it. It&#x27;s been 2 mos. since my piercing and i still use it as a preventative. Advise this purchase.</li>
            <li> I got a full body wax and I think I might have had an allergic reaction or something because I ended up with bumps and acne all over my body. There really wasn&#x27;t an area of skin that was bump free. While freaking out I noticed this in my bathroom and decided to spray it all over my bumps. It took care of the itching and I noticed that they dramatically reduced in size. I sprayed this 3 or 4 times in one day. The next day every single bump was gone and they didn&#x27;t even leave a scar or any type of discoloration. After that experience I always keep a bottle of this stuff around. It&#x27;s great for any type of allergic reactions, rashes, cuts, scrapes, acne, and scars. If you use this stuff when you get cut it will heal without a scar or a very minimal one. I love H2Ocean Salt Water Spray and always have a bottle on hand, just in case.</li>
            <li> My snug was red, swollen and painful. I couldn&#x27;t see my bar at all. After 24 hours with H2Ocean, my ear is so much better. Already I can see a visible reduction in swelling and redness! There is a substantial amount of my bar is showing now and the pain has reduced tremendously! Although it is still sore, it isn&#x27;t throbbing. And these are results after the first day! I can&#x27;t imagine what it will be like a week from now. I recommend this product for all piercings! It also helps treat razor burn and acne!</li>
            <li> i got my cartilage pierced and i took good care to clean it with the cleaning solution from the piercer but for some reason my ear got a bump on it that would not go away. i don&#x27;t think it was infected and it didn&#x27;t hurt but it would not go away and was not pretty to look at. nothing else worked so i tried this spray and the bump went away. the spray made me feel more assured that my piercing would heal better/safely. i would definitely recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> I work out a lot and the sweat would make my nose all nasty and red i got this and used it every day&lt;br /&gt;After my shower and within a week it looked great&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t go a day with out using this stuff any1 with a nose ring&lt;br /&gt;Need this stuff</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product all over my face for the treatment &amp; prevention of mild-moderate adult acne. I recently vacationed in Jamaica, and I was elated when my skin started clearing up after a couple of days of playing in the sea.  Long story short, I concluded that the sea salt was to thank for a few clear days after 3 years of struggling with adult acne.  An Amazon search for sea salt/acne turned up H2ocean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spray a bit on a cotton pad and wipe across my entire face, 2x/day. I have tried to just spray it across my face, but then I end up with product on my lips &amp; eyelids, where I don&#x27;t need or want it. I cleanse, pat dry, apply H2ocean and then moisturize after it&#x27;s had a chance to absorb thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen some improvement in my skin in the past couple of weeks, but I hesitate to write that, because any acne sufferer knows, that can also have a lot to do w/ the amount of stress you&#x27;re under, hormonal changes (esp. for women!), etc. But I do think the product helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I make sure to use a decent moisturizer after each use, as the salt has a potential to be drying, but otherwise I find it to be very gently and pretty effective. It&#x27;s not the &#x27;miracle cure&#x27; by any means... unfortunately, there is NONE (Trust me!), but I think it&#x27;s a great item to give a try in your daily cleansing routine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many piercings done but always have trouble with healing. H2Ocean is pretty much the only thing that has ever worked for me. My piercing heal fast and they never, ever get infected. Definitely a great product.</li>
            <li> I bought this when I got my nose pierced and have repurchased when I ran out. It&#x27;s great for cleaning a new piercing and for cleaning when you change your jewelry. Yes you can make your own saltwater and put it in a spray bottle, but it is not sterile. If you are getting a piercing, get this spay.</li>
            <li> i loooove this stuff and it may be a little bit on the expensive side but it really is wrth every penny i had my belly button pierced by a total idiot who told me to wash it out with espom salts only and he was very stern on nothing else.. well six months later my piercing still has not healled so i said &amp;#34;f*** right off&amp;#34; too my old piercing duder and looked to others for advice.. and i discovered this good stuff. not only did it heal my bellybutton but it aslo treats many other things like ravor burn and acne kudoos to h2ocean for your amazing product!!!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s refreshing and doesn&#x27;t sting but it does disinfect</li>
            <li> Didnt work at all for me. I had to go see a dermatologist about my tragus. I guess results may vary. In my case... It didnt work for me.</li>
            <li> This is the best piercing care product I have come across. It is the only one I will use on my piercings. It makes your piercings feel refreshed. I used this for my lip piercing and cartilage piercing. It made the swelling in my lip go down and it made it heal much faster than it was just using sea salt as a cleanser. It cleans any crust you may have right off. I always keep a container of this stuff in my house.</li>
            <li> I felt this was a good product for cleaning my piercings. Doing a little soak made even the pain lessen along with healing any irritations I might have had from minor bumps to my fresh piercing.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I dislike is the price, but I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well on nipple piercings!</li>
            <li> Before I bought this spray, I cleaned my ear piercings with warm water &amp; sea salt. This method worked great but I seen all the great reviews about this product &amp; decided to try it out myself. Basically, it&#x27;s the same thing accept it&#x27;s in a can &amp; you don&#x27;t have to mix it fresh daily. The reason I&#x27;m giving it one star is because of the price &amp; unlike the warm water &amp; sea salt, this completely dried out my ears leaving it kind of flaky with dry skin. Save your money &amp; just make your own cleaning solution.</li>
            <li> Very good piercing cleaning solution! It soothes the pain instantly. I got an industrial done about two months ago and right after the piercing session, my ear was burning. I sprayed this on my ear (it feels so good!) and the next morning, I couldn&#x27;t feel the pain anymore. Two months later, the pain never came back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first used it three times a day during the first couple weeks, then twice a day. However, it doesn&#x27;t have all the properties of a good old hot sea salt soak, which breaks down the crusts and opens the capillaries, thus allowing a better oxygenation (and a faster healing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use this spraying solution when I really don&#x27;t have the time/the possibility to use a soak, and it does a very good job!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, perfect for my needs</li>
            <li> This product does not work very well at all. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a good product. I used it on my tragus piercing for a while when I didn&#x27;t have ready access to sea salt and hot water.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help with my industrial piercing healing and cleaning regiment. As a supplement to your usual regiment it&#x27;s great no complaints at all. If you&#x27;re not careful though on me at least it caused a build up of dry skin.</li>
            <li> The must have after care product. I use it on my nipple piercing. Its simple and I can carry it anywhere. easy to use and available anywhere and time. Seriously the people who gave this a one star must not know how to use this. Spray, air dry, done. Easy.</li>
            <li> Use this for my ear piercings and it is very convenient. It&#x27;s a very small amount, but it&#x27;s good for on-the-go sanitation. Love that it&#x27;s pressurized.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently got a nose piercing and for the first couple of months it did fine but later on as I began to touch it it formed a bump around and I was freaking out trying to find a solution to get rid of it. I used everything anyone can recommend. Tee tree oil peroxide alcohol certain cleansers and nothing worked so I went to a piercing shop and he recommended this. I wasn&#x27;t too sure about it but I was willing to try anything to rid of the hideous bump so I ordered (great price by the way) got it the same week and after using it within a week my bump was gone! I love this stuff all it needs is a quick spray and your good. I recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Great after care saline spray for piercings.</li>
            <li> really great for quick cleaning and easy to use&lt;br /&gt;if traveling this is great to just toss in your bag with some cotton swabs and go does the job</li>
            <li> I received it quickly, everything was like it should be, and it done an amazing job! I use to use regular backing spray that you can purchase at Walmart, so this was my first time trying it out. I love it!! I recommend this for anyone. In my opinion it helps speed up the healing process, but I&#x27;m sure it differs from person to person of course.</li>
            <li> My nose is already healed after piercing it 3 weeks ago! At first, I was making a sea salt flush (recipe given to me by the place where I pierced my nose) and antibacterial soap. It would still hurt. When this product arrived, my nose has not hurt a single time since and I can even remove the stud.</li>
            <li> I expected this to be much easier to spray on, but it only sprays aerosal or spits out droplets of saline instead of spraying it unless you hold it down, and since my piercing is a nose stud, it&#x27;s really hard to get inside my nose with. Other than that, I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s amazing, but it&#x27;s sterile and salt water, so it lives up to my expectations. Don&#x27;t buy it unless your piercing is easy to spray, though.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best for all piercing healing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also my son fell and scrapped his knee and he actually let me spray this on it and said it didn&#x27;t hurt</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t make my belly button piercing any better. In fact, it ruined my piercing. I am disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> My piercer told me to soak my piercing in sea salt for 10 minutes twice daily. Firstly, it&#x27;s a tragus piercing so soaking it is darn near impossible. Secondly, I don&#x27;t have time for that. So once I heard about this product I just had to try it. It works great! I have two bottles now, one for work and one for home. Is it simply sea salt in a can? Yep! Does it work and is it less hassle than what the piercers give you? Yep and yep! I would definitely recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> The product was so useful and helpful in my process of healing a bad piercing. I ended up taking out the ring and letting the holes close. I am so thankful to have bought this spray during that process. Highly reccommended.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have had many facial piercings (nostril, septum, snakebites, vertical labret).  With all of these peircing I had always used H2Ocean and had never ever ever had an infection in any of them.  Recently I decided to get my other nostril pierced.  After getting pierced, the piercer offered me H2Ocean or said that I could just do my own sea salt soaks.  Since money is kind of tight, I decided to go the cheap route and do my own soaks.  BIG MISTAKE!  I have had nothing but trouble with this piercing.  Over 2 months that I have had this piercing it has been infected on and off the entire time.  Obviously an infection is never good, but when it is in the middle of your face for everone to see, it&#x27;s even worse.  So, I caved and went to buy H2Ocean (It&#x27;s only around 15 bucks at the shop for a 4oz bottle, I&#x27;m just a cheap skate).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough about this stuff.  Super easy to use, you just spray it on and let it air dry.  It&#x27;s much easier than mixing your own solution and trying to awkwardly soak it for 5-10 minutes.  It&#x27;s also much more effective.  I bought it two days ago and the infection is almost totally gone.  After this fiasco, I know to never buy anything else for piercing aftercare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you just got peirced or are having trouble with an infected piercing, BUY H2OCEAN!  You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Amazing thing!!!!! My piercing has been healed in few days!!!!! No rash, no pain, nothing- I&#x27;ve been using this 3 times per day.  Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It works really well. And is convenient enough to carry to work, out of town, or wherever.</li>
            <li> Came on time, in one piece, with instructions and a receipt through the mail in a bubble wrapped envelope. I&#x27;m completely happy with it. One note, it&#x27;s main ingredient is derived from eggs, so if you&#x27;re allergic to them, don&#x27;t use it!</li>
            <li> purchased this after having my cartilege piercing get infected. used it twice a day and the infection cleared out after only 3 days</li>
            <li> I will order this product again and also recommend to fellow pierces. I had a inflamed keloid after I got my nose re-pierced. It was infected and very sensitive for months after I had my piercing. After trying all the methods possible out there. I came across h2ocean, and even though I was skeptical because all of the failed remedies I&#x27;ve already tried, I gave it a shot. The solution came in about 3 business days and  about 2 weeks of using h2ocean the keloid went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased customer!</li>
            <li> This is in my opinion the best aftercare spray available!  My wife swears by it and I&#x27;m glad I found it for such a great price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome.  Sometimes my 2nd and 3rd ear piercings start to hurt - like if I wear the earrings to bed, etc.  I spray a little of this on my ears and let dry - it automatically helps and it stops hurting.</li>
            <li> I only used this thing ONCE. because its GREAT!! After i used it, i had no pains what so ever. Worked GREAT on my cartilage</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say for certain if this helped. I used it along with regular seasalt soaks in a cup of warm water. I did make sure that I sprayed my piercing on a daily basis with it. My piercing also did better when I sprayed some on a cotton ball and held the cotton ball on the piercing for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic, Since it is so expensive I use the Simple Saline as a pre-wash and follow up with the H2 Ocean.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical this product would work as I have tried numerous things to try to help heal my helix that I&#x27;ve had for months with no luck. After reading how many positive reviews there were, I just had to give it a shot as I was just going to let my helix close and get it re-pierced. within a day or so of use , I&#x27;d say the crusts went away and it wasn&#x27;t sore and reddened. Not only do the crusts go away, but it makes it easy to remove because they don&#x27;t seem to harden with this product.  In addition to my helix, I  have been using it on my new Tragus as well as my snug to reduce inflammation and it&#x27;s truly a miracle product! I&#x27;m getting a rook piercing within the next few days, so I just bought a second bottle; you can never be without this item! I WOULDN&#x27;T RATE SOMETHING SO HIGHLY AND BUY FOR A SECOND TIME IF I THOUGHT THIS PRODUCT WASN&#x27;T GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy yet another when I reach the end of the bottle, I couldn&#x27;t ask for a cheaper more beneficial product! THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has new piercings. I got a snug (ear) piercing and I was making my own salt water solution. I had the piercing for about 5 weeks and the swelling of my piercing was not going down. I actually had to go back to the piercer and have him put a longer earring in because the earring was pinching my skin from being too small. I remember my piercer telling me that H2Ocean was good because it has a thing in it called Lysozymes which actually eat away at bad bacteria and infection and act like a barrier for the new piercing while it is healing. It came to me within 3-5 business days which was pretty quick. When I got this product I was using it twice daily and within 3 days the itching and swelling of the piercing wen down substantially! The snug piercing that I have can take up to a year to heal and I have had my piercing for 3 months now and use H2Ocean about once every 3rd day to clean it and I still have more than half the bottle left. I love this product! It also works well with soothing piercings that you are gauging. I gauged my helix (top of ear) from 18 to 16 a month after I got my snug and the earring was very tight but it didn&#x27;t swell. The H2Ocean worked great to soothe the heat and general discomfort of the piercing. I used it for about 3 days and the piercing was back to normal! I absolutely would get this and use it for anytime I get a new piercing from here on out! I am 100% satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> My first can that I ordered was defective, so I contacted the seller. They were prompt, pleasant and courteous and sent me a brand new can without charge! I also love this product. It cleans my ears very well and I neber have an infection. Highly recommend this product and seller!</li>
            <li> Item as described. Quick shipping. Highly recommend helps heal piercings very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a piercing you need this item in your life. Get it now!</li>
            <li> This stuff does miracles for piercing. I was having an issue with my microdermals and i tried everything to heal them. I started using this daily and they are healed and feeling great.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t for me but works great! Does the job. More pricey but ey, this product which is salt water based makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I had a 14 inch gage in my left ear since I&#x27;m older I didn&#x27;t want it anymore so I reopened  the other piercing  in my right ear to match. This stuff works. No where near as much pain. Still a little tender only been using it for 2 days and it&#x27;s almost healed. The alcohol  I was using dried my ear up too sore to even touch. This cleared up the dryness from the alcohol.  Thinking about ordering more. I like to clean my piercings  at least once a week. No more alcohol for me.</li>
            <li> I just got this today and let me say oh my god. This product is completely amazing. Wow. I have my nose and upper helix pierced and ive just used a sea salt and water mixture to clean them. Well after i would clean them, i wouldnt be able to move them at all without pain around the hole. But i used this once just now and they are feeling so much better. Ive had them for almost 3 months now and my nose was still sore. I will definitely buy this again and again and use it as my cleaning method. I also purchased Provon medicated lotion soap which i will also do a review on once i try it out. But overall, i am VERY pleased with H2Ocean Piercing Spray.</li>
            <li> Helped my piercings heal great.</li>
            <li> Worked great. Used it for a large tatoo and it healed nicely. Nothing fishy here :)</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing with healing piercings. I used this on my septum piercing and it has really helped with the healing process... I used normal saline till I got this, however H2Ocean is much better getting the little crustys off of the jewelry. This will be my go to when I am pierced. I also heard the H2ocean company also makes stuff for tattoo healing. going to check that out for sure.</li>
            <li> Very effective numbing spray. It goes quite a ways and I used it for all of my piercings, ears and belly button. I wouldn&#x27;t get anything else.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! Used it for my belly piercing and healed it fine, and I&#x27;m now using it for my Labret (side lip) piercing. It&#x27;s healing up really well.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff it works great for any piercing any time and its good for an anti-bacterial for your face.</li>
            <li> I initially bought this because I knew I wasn&#x27;t washing my new piercing as much as I should, and mixing the proper sea salt/water solution was beginning to become tedious because I&#x27;m always busy.  I just wish I would have known about this sooner.  It could not be easier to use, it&#x27;s sanitary, it&#x27;s convenient, and I will be forever a fan.  The spray is so cool and makes my piercing feel so much better.  I would recommend this to anyone who is seriously considering a piercing, have it on hand for the first day.  I will use this for at least the 5 remaining months of healing time, if not longer, amazing product.</li>
            <li> No complaints about the product. It is awesome. Now moving on to the actual bottle. It is sitting in my vanity, unusable, due to the faulty spray mechanism.</li>
            <li> Very soothing and worth the price right after a piercing.</li>
            <li> The best cleaning spray for your newly pierced belly button!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used H2Ocean to heal most of my piercings and I love it. Even though a simple sea salt soak would accomplish essentially the same thing, H2Ocean just makes it so much easier to apply. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my nose pierced now...3 times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this to anyone because I know I&#x27;m not supposed to do this, but I&#x27;ve stopped doing the sea salts altogether and have been using this, along with an anti-microbial soap. My nose piercing FINALLY isn&#x27;t getting infected, which is really a first because the last two times, I soaked the crap out of my piercing and they still got infected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is pretty damn amazing.</li>
            <li> Great! This item is both a body &amp; oral piercing spray... I just recently got my nipples pierced and cleaning them twice a day w/soap was making them extremely tender. With this spray, it makes the job much easier... I even had my friend try it. (Tongue piercing) She said it made her mouth feel &amp;#34;refreshed&amp;#34; &amp; salty lol.</li>
            <li> Works great on cuts and scraps. Doesn&#x27;t burn and helps quickly heal. My 5 year old likes this on his skinned knees or &amp;#34;boo-boo&#x27;s&amp;#34;. Doesn&#x27;t leave any funky smells. Natural.</li>
            <li> love the product&lt;br /&gt;came quickly, less than the expected two weeks&lt;br /&gt;when it arrived the cap was shattered but i wont return it because its just a cap!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last as long as I hoped..I had more of the product in the can but the spray nozzle gave out</li>
            <li> I got my belly pierced and it was hard to do the salt soaks that they recommended to do. That&#x27;s when I found this aftercare spray! You just spray it on and it removes any discomfort you may have had before. Great cleaning product and I would definitely recomend it to anyone with a new piercing.</li>
            <li> One of my cans sprayer does not work I tried to contact the supplier but no one got back to me so I am very disappointed with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a great cleaning product for my new piercings.  It kept my ears clean and germ free.  Only downside was when I received the product, it would not spray.  It had the spray button, but the piece that goes from the button to the can was missing. With some creative help on YouTube, I was able to get it to work.</li>
            <li> No complaints. Brought for my kids when they got their ear pierced and worked great. Glad for the price, lol.</li>
            <li> Completely helped to heal my piercing!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! i use it for all my piercings! its a quick clean and it is effective. definitely buy it!</li>
            <li> (Bought using boyfriend&#x27;s account) I bought a bottle of this back in February when I got both of my nipples pierced. This stuff worked well right off the bat by reducing pain and redness. It did not, however, stop the infection in my right one which eventually led to me taking them out. I started stretching my ears in April and had this laying around. I decided to try it on my ears, and let me tell you- it felt fantastic! It does a great job of cooling and soothing freshly stretched lobes. I continue spritzing the H2ocean on my lobes at least once a day even after they&#x27;re healed. It moisturizes and keeps my lobes feeling healthy and happy!</li>
            <li> This product does everything it says in it&#x27;s description as long as you adhere to the directions and do not over clean your piercing. I had my nose pierced for nearly four years in a shop that wasn&#x27;t the most hygienic to say the least. Although I had the piercing for years randomly I would get keloids inside my nose or a bump near the piercing. I also wear makeup and am not the best at washing it off every night like I should. After a few uses this problem I had for years went away and the same applies to my nipple piercing. My nipple piercing although I had it for three years it was like a game of russian roulette sometimes it would get inflamed or perhaps a small keloid and sometimes it was perfectly fine. Nevertheless I was frustrated and decided enough was enough. I looked online and tried all these home remedies of sea salt and water, but I never seemed to get the proportions right. I had the H2Ocean Tattoo Aftercare cream which did a great job for my tattoo&#x27;s so, I looked into other products. I stumbled upon this and it is the holy grail for piercings. After a few days my piercings were better with minimal effort -- perfect for a somewhat lazy girl like myself.</li>
            <li> Fast, easy piercing care that I can carry around with me. I use it 3-6 time daily depending on how my piercing feels. It&#x27;s almost healed and h2ocean spray has really smoothed out the process.&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I use this spray as a supplement to \\&quot;true\\&quot; saline soaks where I actually sit down for a few minutes and soak the piercing with the aid of a shot glass.</li>
            <li> Function as advertised and easy to use. My pierce heals pretty well in 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;So I am going to buy another one just in case.</li>
            <li> I wish I had this before when I had my ear lobes and naval pierced.&lt;br /&gt;I got this because I had gotten the 1st canister from my piercer when I went to get my helix pierced.&lt;br /&gt;Using this spray, you can notice the change within 1 day.  Your piercing will hurt less and feel as if healing much faster.&lt;br /&gt;I think my helix has healed much faster than my navel and definitly faster than my earlobes.  Even though I think it is supposed to take longer.&lt;br /&gt;This spray doesn&#x27;t sting or burn.  It feels refreshing and I will definitely be using this over and over from now on.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item because I recently got my navel pierced and I need something reliable and natural to clean it with. I had seen all of the amazing reviews claiming how it has \\&quot;healed their infection\\&quot; I was very excited to see this and decided to go for it. I got it fairly fast and tried using it right out if the box but to my surprise it would not spray. I have no clue if it was clogged or broken but it refused to spray at all. I was so angry and disappointed I contacted Amazon and they refunded me the money. I recently ordered another bottle In hopes it was just a mistake and won&#x27;t happen again. It better not happen again. I need this solution for my belly button. I will update further on the new bottle. Over all I&#x27;m very angry and not satisfied.</li>
            <li> This product worked amazing for me. I have an industrial piercing and it started to get infected. Within like two days of using this stuff helped heal it up right away.!!! Definitely buy!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my brother after he got his first piercing. The person who did it, wanted to sell him after care solution  but it was over priced. So I looked around and bought him this. It took a bit for it to arrive since it was around x-mas, which worried me but it arrived. It has kept his pierced area clean and healthy &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Helped when I pierced my own ears. Kept them clean. I also decided to use it on my navel piercing.</li>
            <li> Love it, works very well helps with healing process</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my navel pierced 2 times previously and used hydrogen peroxide and rubbing alcohol to clean it. I was told to do this by my friends who also have their navels pierced and used those products to keep it clean. Both times my piercing was red, swollen, and looked infected. Recently I got my navel re- pierced for the third time and came across H2Ocean at a local Tattoo parlor for piercing aftercare. It doesn&#x27;t burn and immediately took away redness and swelling. I love this product and recommend it to anyone for piercing aftercare. Though it does suck if you can&#x27;t buy it locally, you must order it online.</li>
            <li> Great product! It so soothing and cooled the natural inflammation that occurred with  my cartilage ear piercing. It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but I still highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been in love with this stuff ever since the first time i bought it at my tattoo shop a few years ago. it&#x27;s the best for cleaning belly piercings for sure, even helps clear up infected ones! You should definitely give this product a try, it works so well!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone with Piercings, considering I have plenty of them, this product has always worked nice for me with healing my piercings. I Never had any problems whatsoever with using this product, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anything else !</li>
            <li> This is a life saver after any piercing! It is a must have. It heals the piercing very well. Recommend it.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Healed my cartilage piercing very well using it 2 times a day. I would recommend this product. So happy I purchased it.</li>
            <li> No affects with this.  Easy to use.  My piercing never get infected either.  Way cheaper to buy on line than in the parlor.</li>
            <li> This is a MUST HAVE for anyone with a new nose piercing. Using harsh chemicals like alcohol and peroxide can cause scarring and irritation. I had a new stud that caused the dreaded &amp;#34;bump&amp;#34; on my piercing, I&#x27;m assuming it was the metal quality, and after changing the stud and using this spray regularly I healed quickly and scar-free.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because it was recommended by Peircer and it&#x27;s gotten great reviews. I just recently recieved this product and the packaging was kinda boring but the can itself was in Good condition. Ive been using it for two days.. N already I notice a change. I have my Monroe Peirced and it wasn&#x27;t inflamed or anything just itchy n dry n lots of crustys. I started using this n the itching is gone not so much crust either. It&#x27;s great. I also had my nose Peirced abt two months ago n it&#x27;s taking forever to heal completely n after using H2Ocean I&#x27;ve noticed a change in both peircings.def will order more of this!!</li>
            <li> Recently got a navel piercing and it was getting irritated. I got this product and it is doing so much better! highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is way overpriced for what it is. Within a month the bottled clogged up from all the salt and it created more problems with my tragus piercing then just regular cleaning. Salt and water works a million times better and is much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Good buy, good shipping!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy that I have this product, but I don&#x27;t like that even I shake it, drips of water fly.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Makes it so much easier to keep my piercings clean, it doesn&#x27;t hurt and I really do think it makes them heal better. I recently got something repierced and healing it this time using this spray has been SO much better. When my more healed piercings get irritated, I spray them with a little of this and it soothes the dryness and irritation. I can&#x27;t see myself ever needing something else to clean my piercings, wish I could give this 10 stars!</li>
            <li> I like it helps my belly button heal after it got infected</li>
            <li> Used this after I got my belly ring pierced. Its what my body piercer recommend. its easy to clean it on the go.</li>
            <li> The only thing I trust when it comes to my piercings besides homemade sea salt soaks. I have over 10 different piercings and this has never failed me. It always heals up infections or any irritation within a day or two. It&#x27;s great if you don&#x27;t have the time to soak your piercings multiple times a day or if you are just using it to maintain your already healed piercings. I will continue to buy this product for as long as I have my piercings. Thanks H2ocean.</li>
            <li> I would like to write a good review for this product but when it arrived I was unable to use it because the spray nozzle was damaged and the canister was leaking every time I pushed down on the nozzle. I have heard so many good things about this product and I wish I had been able to use it like I wanted to.</li>
            <li> I used this product a whole 2 days before it stopped spraying. From the first use it worked great on my nose piercing,  but now I have no idea how to make the can work again.</li>
            <li> This piercing aftercare spray is the best. It is easy to use and heals piercings quickly. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with this purchase once i got it! But that wasn&#x27;t till 3 days after the latest day I was suppose to get it! This is what I use to clean my industrial piercing everyday and when I ordered it I had just enough left thy should of gotten me through till this came in, but since it was so late I ran out and didn&#x27;t have anything to wash it with other than soap, but that&#x27;s messy and I hate doing that! So needless to say, I you order this product be prepared to wait FOREVER!!!!</li>
            <li> It sprays on easily and cools down the burn of your newly pierced site.  I use it as recommended and my pierced ear cartilage is healing as promised.</li>
            <li> I avoided buying saline spray when I could just do it myself. I found I wasn&#x27;t using it consistently b/c it was always a process. I broke down and bought this. So much easier to keep a piercing clean. Nozzle doesn&#x27;t clog, consistent spray stream. For the next piercing, I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> The spray nozzle collapsed inside the can after using this 3 times.</li>
            <li> I will never use anything else!  Use provon in the shower and this for the other cleanings. Works amazing!</li>
            <li> it is awesome it is everything they say</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought H2Ocean before and like it. I ran out of my last bottle so bought this one. When I got it, it obviously hadn&#x27;t been tested to make sure it worked before being shipped out. I tried to spray the mist onto a q-tip and nothing but air came out of the nozzle. I took off the nozzle to see if the piece underneath would push down, and it did... And didn&#x27;t come back out. Now I can only get anything out of the bottle by shaking it and having it come out of the hole (without the nozzle). I just pierced my rook and needed a cleaner so I couldn&#x27;t return it and wait for a new one to come.</li>
            <li> Immensely helps reduce healing process, therefore I&#x27;m confident that I am able to change my bar in two months. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I use this spray for all my piercings. My piercer recommended it to me and since trying it I&#x27;ve never gone back. It&#x27;s so convenient that the salt water is already mixed up for you and it also contains Lysozyme which is effective in healing. The 4 oz bottle will last you a really long time as long as you don&#x27;t over use it. For me it&#x27;s lasted through 3 new piercings.</li>
            <li> The can I got didn&#x27;t work, but they refunded me. I&#x27;ve used this stuff in the past and loved it, so I think I just got a bad can.</li>
            <li> Very good product!!!!</li>
            <li> It really is as great as everyone says. What really draws me to this product is how it sprays. It&#x27;s a high pressure spray that gets into the piercing hole. Before I was using either a swab with sea salt water and I was never really sure it was getting into the hole. Definitely buying again!</li>
            <li> I got this to use while gauging my ears since I have lost many, many ear piercings to infection in the past. I never had trouble with my first lobe piercing (got when I was 5) but since I wanted to stretch decided to be cautious and got this and gauge gear. I can&#x27;t say if it works or not since I&#x27;m using it as a precaution only, but I haven&#x27;t had any infection issues in the first couple stretches so that&#x27;s a good sign. The only thing I dislike is the force with which the spray ejects... its too much and seems to waste product. A more targeted delivery system would be preferred.</li>
            <li> I have used H2Ocean on all my piercings based on the recommendation of my piercer and I must say this stuff is pretty good.  Ears healed pretty fast and no real issues. I definitely recommend it, its also much cheaper on Amazon than in stores.</li>
            <li> I use this to clean my stretched ears and septum piercing. I couldn&#x27;t find it in Walmart, so I turned to Amazon. The dude at the piercing place told me that this is like awesome to use for your piercings, so I just buy this every time.</li>
            <li> Love it! My ears where sore after I had my cartilage pierced started using this within a few days I want having problems anymore was great!</li>
            <li> for my teenage daughter, piercing... she says it works well. Looks like it does it job. thn a lot. u</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this makes cleaning easy</li>
            <li> This product is so easy to use, and has helped my piercing heal faster. additionally, on older piercings that were sensitive, it&#x27;s eliminated the sensitivity so I can put piercings back in them!</li>
            <li> I got my nose pierced in August 2013.  It was red for two weeks and then I noticed a small bump growing.  It got bigger each day.  After doing some research online I tried the following home remedies:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Tea tree oil&lt;br /&gt;2.  Hydrogen Peroxide&lt;br /&gt;3.  Preparation H (I know it sounds weird, it helped with the swelling but the bump came back).&lt;br /&gt;4.  warm compresses&lt;br /&gt;5.  Ice&lt;br /&gt;6.  Asprin paste&lt;br /&gt;7.  Betadine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NONE of these above worked.  So I did some research on Amazon and found this product.  I bought it after reading the reviews.  It came quickly and had no problems with my order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the FIRST day of using it (as directed) my keloid started to disappear.  I would recommend this product to anyone with a nose keloid or just someone who got their nose pierced.  Its soothing and cool to the skin.  All natural and has natural enzymes to help with the healing process in addition to the sea salt.  TRUST ME IT WAS WORTH EVERY CENT.  After the first bottle I ended up buying 2 more bottles because it worked so well!</li>
            <li> Today I open the bottle and I am so upset that the spray doesn&#x27;t work. I really hope I can get another bottle because I have tried the product and it&#x27;s really good</li>
            <li> I had planned for years on getting my nose pierced, but never did it because I was afraid of the infection. I finally said \\&quot;meh\\&quot; and went ahead and did it anyway. I bought a really good 18k nose stud and a can of this stuff and I have had ZERO problems. I mean zero. My piercing healed so fast I couldn&#x27;t believe it. Less than 3 weeks after the initial piercing the stud fell out and I couldn&#x27;t find it for like half an hour, and having read a lot about how nose piercings close in minutes I figured I would have to go in and get it redone, but I popped that stud back in there like nothing. Buy this. It&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Now about the product H2ocean spray, I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 days so far and I must say, my cartilage piercing bump is slowly disappearing, its still there, but hopefully in the near future it will be gone. I will be ordering another bottle. The only negative thing I have to say about the product is that It leaks from the top. Other than that it seems to be doing its job.  I will definitely recommend this product to a friend or whom ever decides to get a piercing b/c this works the best over regular sea salt soaks. I still do 1 sea salt soak a day plus cleaning with antimicrobial liquid soap and afterwards I spray on h20ceanspray. When the piercing bump is completely gone I will only be using h2oceanspray.</li>
            <li> Best aftercare product. I&#x27;ve used this for all the piercings I have and they have all healed great. The bottle is big and will last a while.</li>
            <li> I bought this after fighting with an unhappy cartilage piercing. It makes all the difference in the world trying to sleep at night with an angry and painful piercing. I use it on the off day that I have any issues and it helps soothe the piercing in a matter of minutes.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a life saver. It made my piercing heal a lot faster than what was expected. I love this.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely a must have for anyone who has external piercings. My industrial piercing was having a hard time healing over and would be prone to getting infected (probably because no matter how careful I am with my hairspray, it gets in the way and my hair is sorta everywhere to begin with so that attracts dirt and other things). I developed a nasty keloid on the upper part of the industrial and the piercing overall was just irritated up until I bought this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within the week, it was less sensitive and well on its way to proper healing. After several weeks of using the product and starting to go without it, my industrial piercing healed itself with no more issues along the way. The keloid is also gone from sight too. 100% recommend.</li>
            <li> This is not a miracle product that will heal your piercing in five seconds. It also doesn&#x27;t last very long and is kind of overpriced for what it is. I&#x27;ve only had my nose piercing for a month now and using the spray two-three times a day and I&#x27;m almost done with my second bottle. I only use this when I cannot do a sea salt soak - so once on my lunch break at work and then after I go to the gym or eat dinner. In the morning and before bed I do a sea salt soak for as long as I have time for. It did not prevent me from getting a bump on my nose piercing because I was unlucky and got my stud caught in the tissue as I was trying to blow my nose after coming down with a horrible virus. Oww.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does what it says - cleans the piercing and removes crust. And I will keep purchasing. I just wish it was either a bigger can or less expensive.</li>
            <li> Easy to carry in my purse to use at work. Great product. Very convenient.  Looks like hairspray so discreet too.</li>
            <li> Good product; goes fast.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while my piercing still infected but I blame weather its so hot in here and its a lil difficult to clean it many time at day cause of my work but it is getting much more better so I recommend this product it is really helpful</li>
            <li> i use this not for tattoos but bumps i get in the back of my head and it works wonders for me at least.</li>
            <li> I got my industrial piercing everything was fine until my bf kept hitting it. After 2 months I started noticing two bubbles one on the top inside &amp; one at the bottom. I was at a point were I want to remove my piercing if it didn&#x27;t get better. I readed all these great reviews and I just didn&#x27;t want to do the whole soaking in water &amp; sea salt. I decided to buy H2O Ocean Spray &amp; Provin Medicated Lotion Soap and It worked my bubbles went away. I stopped using it and I notice it was forming another one I used it again. And in a couple of days I went away. So far so good. No Bubbles. would defiantly recommend to anyone with any piercings.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product instead of my sea salt soaks for about a week now and I really like it! It seems to be doing the job really well, my belly button piercing looks almost completely healed on the outside. I know it takes longer for the inside to heal but this seems to be doing its job well. I will continue to use this for the duration of my healing process :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having mixed feelings about this product. The first time I used it, I bought it direct from H2Ocean&#x27;s website for a brand new piercing and had no problems. The shipping was quick and the product worked. However, I recently developed in an infection in one of my piercings and wanted to try this product to see if it would help clear up the infection. But it&#x27;s hard to use a product when the bottle doesn&#x27;t even work. It doesn&#x27;t spray at all. At most, it sort of dribbles out a drop at a time. I&#x27;ve heard of these kinds of bottles getting clogged after repeated use, but not being clogged upon the first attempted use. So while I&#x27;ve had good experience with this product in the past, I can&#x27;t say whether or not it would work for multiple purposes because of the crappy packaging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had multiple piercings and up until I got my nose done none of the places ever offered anything to put on the piercings. I was always just told to wash it with antibacterial (usually DIAL) soap twice a day. I&#x27;ve never had an issue with my piercings healing so I never really had a reason to seek anything out. When I got my nose pierced while on vacation a few years ago they gave me a small can of this and told me to use it at least 3 times a day. I had started school about a week after getting it done and was required to cover the piercing with a band aide or remove it for my clinicals. Obviously I wasn&#x27;t going to remove it. The piercing obviously didn&#x27;t like the band aide covering it for 8 hours at a time. It got really sore so I increased how often I used it and soon the problem was resolved and my piercing healed perfectly and is still good 3 years later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently just got another piercing and the place that I go to doesn&#x27;t carry this stuff so I had to order another can since my other was gone. I had to wait 4 or 5 days to get it after I got the piercings and I could instantly tell the difference after I started using it once it arrived. The piercings are healing beautifully and much faster than they would be otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to anyone that gets something pierced. They also have tattoo after care products. I haven&#x27;t had the pleasure of trying any of them yet but you can bet when I get my next tattoo that I will definitely be trying them out. If they work anywhere near as well as this product I will be a happy camper.</li>
            <li> This is an absolute must have for fresh piercings and the shipment was very quick. Its a lot of product, especially for the price. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who would like to take care of their new piercing.</li>
            <li> When I first received the product it worked like a charm; however after about a month the spray broke and I couldn&#x27;t use the rest of it. ):</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and have used it before and was working great for a couple days then the nozzle stopped working now is COMPLETLY broken :/</li>
            <li> I had my forward helix pierced about 5 months ago... it was healing nicely and then just started deteriorating. My ear was swollen and crusty. I started using this spray and after a few days the swelling reduced and it feels much improved. This is a lot easier to use than the salt water concoction the pierced had me mix and then lay on my ear daily.</li>
            <li> I ran out of H2O ocean and no one sells the 4oz bottles by me. Ordered it. Shipped fast. My piercings feel much better :)</li>
            <li> ever since the body piercer recommended this product for my cartilage ear piercing, i&#x27;ve been using this product for the past five years.  with daily use, my piercing has healed beautifully but i&#x27;ve long since graduated from simply spritzing this onto my piercing.  i also spritz it on parts of my face if i have a slight redness (not my eyes! if you accidentally spray with an open mouth, it tastes quite salty. keep your mouth closed!) or on my body if i want to clean a freshly scratched scab. probably not its intended use, but i find it has healing properties for my everyday as well. i typically use the product after i&#x27;ve washed my face or taken a shower.  it may not work for all people, but if you feel like you get healed after taking a dip in the ocean, this product is like that plus healing lysozymes. it&#x27;s one of those products i like to keep handy in my bathroom medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my brother because his ears are always infected. This helped him a lot, when other products couldn&#x27;t. Good price too.</li>
            <li> Love using h2ocean, just got two piercing in my ear. Whenever there is any slight pain I spray some on my ear and within minutes the pain goes away. This is my second can, my first one was the travel size.</li>
            <li> Much easier that doing a total soak in salt water. Yes please!</li>
            <li> Works great, better than alcohol, hydrogen peroxide. I bought it for my 9 year old&#x27;s pierced ears, which we had done at a professional piercing place and they recommended this product. Only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is that it is a spray, and is a tad messy when you spray it on ear piercings (runs down the ear/neck!).</li>
            <li> works very well, if your ear has gotten infected.</li>
            <li> Bought for my rook piercing. Because I&#x27;m lazy and can&#x27;t be bothered to make my own solution. Nice to be able to just squirt this on it. Does leak a little when shaking. Also stung. A lot. I eventually washed my ear with water and then sprayed it. Much better.</li>
            <li> Actually, my teenage daughter uses this product and really loves it.</li>
            <li> Works great a must have for cleaning</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best for new piercings.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> I use this H2Ocean spray for every piercing I get. It is super convenient, so you can carry it along with you during the day in case the piercing flares up. It is also easier than mixing up salt water from scratch. I would highly recommend this to anyone getting a new piercing. It feels very refreshing and your piercing will love it!</li>
            <li> I recently started stretching my ears. I went from an 18g to a 12g, and let&#x27;s just say - my ears were VERY sore, and the left one was even swollen really bad. I bought some of this stuff, after seeing many reviews stating it was the &#x27;miracle spray for piercings&#x27;. I figured why not, and ordered some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely LOVE it. It does come out in a pretty big mist, so in order for me to put it on my ears without getting it all over my face, I just spray quite a bit on the ends of q-tips (enough to where it&#x27;s dripping wet) and I clean the ear hole/jewelry really well. Then, just let it air dry, and apply my Vitamin-E oil afterwards. It leaves the piercing feeling nice, and fresh. It has a really good &#x27;clean&#x27; feel to it. My ear swelling has went down after 3 uses, and so has a lot of the soreness. I can now go through the day without throbbing, itchy earlobes. (:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you&#x27;re looking to stretch your ears - this is highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This product is the best thing i have tried so far for my belly peircing. I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, but when I got the product it didn&#x27;t have a hole in spray nozzle so I couldn&#x27;t get any product out.</li>
            <li> love the product&lt;br /&gt;fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;good price&lt;br /&gt;would use this seller again&lt;br /&gt;like the spray and that you use it more than once over trying to keep a shot glass on your neck works great</li>
            <li> I was given this when I got my nose pierced.  It works like a dream - no infections, ever.  I have since used it on my pierced ears when I got an infection from cheap earrings.  Works great!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to receive my order in a timely fashion. They even took extra care in packaging my item. Given the competitors, the price for the size/ounces was very good. I have had no problems and am very happy. Thanks, keep up the hard work.</li>
            <li> this H20 Ocean piercing spray healed my infected naval and traigus piercing!!! amazing stuff, highly recommend!! I was really surprised!</li>
            <li> I had tried different things to clear up my pierced ears, but nothing worked.  H2 Ocean worked in about a week.</li>
            <li> Great product shipped quickly!&#x27;</li>
            <li> I used this after a rook piercing and it was great. So soothing and my piercing healed so quickly. I also had surgery recently and used it to clean the incision sites. It is a gentle stream and yet strong enough to get rid of the crusties.</li>
            <li> Love this spray.  Easier to use that squirt solution.</li>
            <li> Have ear piercing problem?this one can get rid of all of your problem ,turst me ,you have to get one</li>
            <li> the product worxed good but the can clogged after a few uses and we had to run under hot water and d1g wth a p1n so 1t was a problem</li>
            <li> Better than making my own sea salt soaks. It does run out fast but it is a much easier alternative!</li>
            <li> Love that I am not getting added bacteria touch my ear. This is great but I went through the whole bottle in 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this aftercare spray. I&#x27;ve tried some other piercing sprays but what I love about this one is how long it lasts. Other sprays seem to dump out streams of the solution with each spray, and I used to go through a can in a week. With this product, the spray has a concentrated spray that is effective in cleansing the piercing area with an adequate amount of solution. I&#x27;ve been able to combat several infections with this product, and would recommend it to anyone looking for an awesome piercing aftercare solution.</li>
            <li> I previously bought this product from the tattoo shop where I got my eyebrow pierced, and it worked GREAT on it and my bellybutton piercing (which was starting to swell). When I ran out, I figured I could save money by ordering a bigger can via Amazon. This seller sent this can to me DENTED in 2 spots, and the nozzle did not spray- it only leaked out small amounts of the solution. I kept it in hopes that maybe it would resolve itself, but 2 weeks later, the nozzle will not work at all and my eyebrow and belly button piercings are suffering. I have to find something else soon or I&#x27;m going to get an infection. Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> I should have ordered this a long time ago. I have tried many piercings out only to fail when they got infected and/or never healed. I have had four piercings over the course of my life: tongue, monroe, upper ear (twice), all of these done with a hollow needle. But the piercing that healed the best was my most recently upper ear, and I chalk it up to this product. The upper ear is an impossibly place to do the salt water soak reccomended by almost all piercers, that&#x27;s where this spray comes in. A little squirt three times a day feels good and encourages healing. I will never pierce again without this spray.</li>
            <li> I use it for my belly button piercing. Use 2-3 times a day. Heals quite faster. Definitely a must have.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to ALL of my friends with piercings! It is the only thing I have found that is easy to use and cleans my piercings well! I have ordered this four times, twice for myself and twice for a friend! I have been using this stuff ever since I got my belly button pierced in August and since then, I have gotten 3 more piercings! Even my piercer recommends this stuff!</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews, I decided to get this because everyone said it was worth the hype. However, maybe I am allergic to this product or something, but I have had horrible instant reactions to it. My cartilage piercing started to sting and burn, and after a day it had completely swollen up and was covered with discharge. If you have sensitive skin, i DO NOT RECOMMEND you purchase this.</li>
            <li> I had got my back dimples pierced using micro dermal anchors in the summer of 2012.  They were healing perfectly until I had a misfortunate accident and tugged one dermal a little too hard while scratching in the area. This caused the skin around the dermal to become terribly inflamed and the skin around my piercing was nasty, dark, and crusty. I bought H2Ocean and, I kid you not, after one day use the inflammation went down a great deal and the skin is not as dark as it was before the use of this product.</li>
            <li> I just got my navel pierced last month and it was really red, swollen, and very sore for a few weeks so after reading online about this I decided to try it out and wow it made a huge difference! The discomfort went away within 24 hours and I continue to use it and I notice its healing alot faster! My eyebrow and nose ring have already healed faster than what the paper says because of this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this and it also works for cuts, scrapes &amp; acne too! This stuff is great! (:</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;I have my industrial pierced and I got the dreaded bump.&lt;br /&gt;My bar is way to big for my little ear so it got bumped around ALOT.&lt;br /&gt;I got a nasty looking blood boil and the piercing was starting to get infected.&lt;br /&gt;I soaked a cotton ball and put it in my ear. I also took a piece of cotton and rolled it around the top of my piercing so it wouldn&#x27;t get bumped around. I would soak the piece of cotton throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;THIS STUFF DOES WONDERS. It&#x27;s been 2 days and my piercing is completely normal now.&lt;br /&gt;Just spray your piercing, and for the love of God, leave it alone!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product for piercings. I have the top of my cartilage pierced and my ears are very sensitive, so it often gets unhappy with me when I sleep on my ear wrong causing a bubble to form. This product forces the bubble to pop within 24 hours and after a few days, is completely healed. I&#x27;ve had my piercing for almost 2 years now, and every time it gets unhappy due to sleeping on it wrong/catching it on clothing/etc., I use this spray and it works great.</li>
            <li> I recently had my lip &amp; septum pierced and before I went through with them, I did some research on aftercare. The name H2Ocean kept coming up everywhere. So I ordered the large size and it really soothes &amp; cleans the areas wonderfully! It&#x27;s best to spray lightly on a sterile cotton swab &amp; apply that way because the spray goes everywhere, they may want to change the dispenser. I really didn&#x27;t have any terrible pain during &amp; right after piercing but they were a bit tender the first couple of days but H2Ocean really works to clean, soothe &amp; heal, I plan to use it for minor cuts and I hear it&#x27;s great for minor acne as well. Amazing what sea salt will do!! I highly recommend this product, even good for tattoo healing. I also got some Provon antimicrobial soap for cleansing &amp; keeping the areas moist as piercings on the face or basically anywhere tend to get dry and peel. The H2Ocean helps in that matter too. Great stuff!!</li>
            <li> Got just what I expected. There was nothing wrong the product and the shipping was quick. The only thing was that the can leaks sometimes, but I knew this prior to buying the product.</li>
            <li> Worked great on my neck piercing it really helped it heal faster. Thank you for offering this great product and very reasonable pricing!!</li>
            <li> I have multiple cartiledge piercings but haven&#x27;t always used this stuff. On my first one I used the regular soap cleaning method and after two years it never would heal. I even had those bumps around the piercing (can&#x27;t remember the name at the moment). For my next piercing I tried using saline solution wound wash and that didn&#x27;t work out either. I ended up giving up on the piercing because I was so frustrated. Now I use H2Ocean and my last 3 new holes have healed perfectly and on time. This spray has even made some of my old bumbs go down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this spray is a little pricier than some other options but I think it is well worth it. My piercings definitely heal faster and look better since I have been using this. I have purchased this on amazon and got it in the mail right away. But it is also available at Hot Topic. When they have their bogo 50% off sale, it equals out to about the same price, so either way is good.</li>
            <li> I got a nose piercing in August 2012 and I was doing the salt water soak 3-4 times a day per my piercer. I really got tired of doing that and went online and did research on this product, so far I have not had any problems. I spray it on a Q Tip and clean the outside and the inside plus I use the antibacterial soap he instructed me to use once a day. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used for 2 weeks about and seems to be working at keeping infection from my piercings.  Its messy though.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great but it&#x27;s difficult to ship! Mine exploded in the box before it reached me, but if you can buy this in person it&#x27;s perfect</li>
            <li> I just got my navel pierced just a week ago and H2ocean is amazing my piercing is healing wonderfully with no irritation. This is the BEST product for any piercing.</li>
            <li> arrived on time, seems to be working good. can&#x27;t wait to see the results.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this on my 4-week old rook piercing in conjunction with Provon soap and it works wonders. No pain and my ear is healing beautifully. The barbell can now move freely in my ear painlessly and smoothly. While the soap cleanses the piercing and the surrounding ear space, I feel like this product gets inside and drains all the impurities (while also keeping the outer area cleansed as well.) Best part, as other reviews have expressed, is that you can literally just spray and go. I work 9-5 and I bring it to work so I can clean during the day because my rook is still pretty new and needs to be cleaned more than once a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s great. Not everything works for everyone, but this definitely worked for me.</li>
            <li> At Ricky&#x27;s the can leakage was insane.  From Here it lasts longer! Overall you need it for piercings like industrial bar so spend the money clown! lmao</li>
            <li> Works great and it heals my piercings properly ! I&#x27;ve used this product for the past 3 years</li>
            <li> This soothing and healing spray works great for new body piercings,and any residual soreness after changing out a piercing!! Much more than just a plain sea salt solution!!</li>
            <li> This is great but..... not a good value for the price. I can use this for literally a week... and then it&#x27;s all gone...</li>
            <li> I had been purchasing this locally, at a much steeper cost.  This is the exact same product for much less.  Totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> Works great. Way cheaper than tattoo shop.</li>
            <li> Have bought this many times and will forever be a loyal fan!!</li>
            <li> Perfect.  Good price and arrived a little sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> Amazon, you always meet and exceed my expectations.  However, you didn&#x27;t have much to do with this product except to deliver it to my doorstep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used H2Ocean spray, I purchased it because my job was hiking 8 hours a day in the woods of the Central Cascades.  I&#x27;d pack this stuff in to use when I&#x27;d accidentally get bug spray around the piercing, or have an itch with dirty hands, etc.  I have not had a single issue with the functionality of this product, nor have I ever had any keloid/infection/bump when using this product.  To top it off, even when the canister feels empty and theres &#x27;nothing left&#x27;, it still goes a really long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had some idiot piercers tell me that I don&#x27;t need this, because ______ will do.  But if it gets infected, you&#x27;re screwed.  If you get a keloid, thats not going away.  I KNOW this product will keep my piercing clean and will help it heal correctly.  Worth the $9 you pay by far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten my ears pierced twice and both times have used different cleaning products.  The first time, I got them pierced at Claire&#x27;s and used the little saline solution thing they gave me.  They quickly got very infected.  The second time I got my ears pierced, I actually used hydrogen peroxide (which I now know was stupid), and my ears, yet again, got infected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was thinking about piercing my nose, I was really worried about possible infection, so I did my research and found that H2Ocean is the most trusted aftercare spray.  Seriously, the reviews do not lie.  This stuff has been magic for my nose.  I&#x27;ve had my piercing for about 3 weeks now and it has not gotten infected.  It feels great and isn&#x27;t red or swollen.  Highly, highly, HIGHLY recommend!  Amazing spray!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re wondering how much you&#x27;re going to have to buy, I&#x27;ve found that thorough cleaning for 3 weeks has taken most of the 4 oz bottle.  So just be aware, you are definitely going to have to be replenishing it when your piercing is healing.</li>
            <li> i love this product and would definitely order a lot more , i love piercings and this will help clean new piercings and reduce the pain in pierced area , this work for me and i love it! i would recommend this to people who recently got a new piercing . totally satisfied :)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff oh so very much and was thankful to find it online:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product to heal all of my ear/cartilage piercings, septum, belly button, and nose piercing. I feel like it helps piercings heal faster and it&#x27;s just easy to use. I spray some of this on a couple Q-tips, wipe around all the exposed areas of my new piercing, then I&#x27;m done. I have never had a piercing get infected, reject, or have any problem while using this product.</li>
            <li> It got here in three days! I just got my septum pierced, so I spray it on a cotton swab and clean my piercing that way. So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff since I got my belly priced and it works wonders  I love it  has healed quicker  with the other things I do to care for it</li>
            <li> Have used different types of saline in the past (homemade, name brand) but definitely saw faster healing and reduced swelling w/H2Ocean.</li>
            <li> My Girlfriend and I swear on this product. It is easy and fast to apply, soaks in quick and does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> GREAT for nose piercings, and pretty much any piercing. I also loved spraying this where i had an ingrown nail to wash away from bacteria. Love it! too bad i took out my nose ring but i would definitely use it for my toes! haha</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. I got my belly pierced and at the time the place gave me this product. I finished it and needed a new one. This was great.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: got one the other week and the spray nozzle does not work so nothing is coming out. Very annoying.</li>
            <li> Works great!! I sprayed it onto a qtip and applied it to the area needed. only used it once or twice and everything after that was clear</li>
            <li> I got my nose pierced over six months ago and the redness and soreness is just now beginning to heal, after I started using this product. It&#x27;s just a sea salt solution, so it&#x27;s nothing groundbreaking, but the fact that it works AND is a spray is the kicker. You just spray it three to six times per day and leave it. Couldn&#x27;t be easier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Know what it feels like to have your nose ring pulled, or even pulled out? Yeah, that&#x27;s almost the level of pain I experienced just when moving the piercing a little bit --- but no more! (Because it&#x27;s finally healing.) Nowadays it doesn&#x27;t hurt nearly as bad even when it occassionally does get pulled. The reviews about speeding healing convinced me to try this. If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re most concerned about, or maybe even just convenience, give this stuff a shot. :)</li>
            <li> I got my navel pierced nearly 3 weeks ago and I was worried it would get infected because my body seems to not like any metals unless its gold. I&#x27;ve been using this stuff since day one, spraying it on about 4x a day the first week and now I&#x27;m down to about 2x a day unless I feel it needs a cleaning. I&#x27;ve had pretty much no redness and it was only sore for the first week. I only have done a sea salt soak about 3x since the piercing, and I clean it in the shower every other day with antibacterial hand soap (dial.) Other than that, I think this stuff is what has been saving my butt from getting an infection! I&#x27;ve already ordered another can so I dont run out! (I read some other reviews where people have ran out and stopped using it and they got infected...)</li>
            <li> I got my ear pierced and was using the saline solution they gave me and was having a lot of trouble with pain and swelling and even bleeding because it just wouldn&#x27;t heal.  I was on the brink of going back and having my rook piercing removed,  I got this hoping it would help before I got an infection and Voila!  It was a miracle...my ear started feeling and looking better by the next evening.  Since then I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with the swelling, pain or bleeding.  I think it&#x27;s actually helping it heal instead of just keeping it clean.  It is SO convenient that it is a spray...I had my rook done and it is difficult to get a q-tip in there to clean so this was very nice to use.  I would recommend this to anyone that has a tricky to clean ear piercing, and anyone that is having trouble getting their piercing to heal.</li>
            <li> I got this after my industrial piercing started to swell. It was a month after I got it done and it still was swollen but not so much sore and it even started to grow one of those little bumps:( i started out doing a saline wash but that did nothing so I switched to just the sea salt soak but saw little results and it was awkward to put my ear in a little bowl. That&#x27;s when I saw all the reviews on this and got it! Now I didn&#x27;t notice much right away like everyone else so I almost lost hope but then my little bump disappeared! And my ear is looking sooo much better! Plus at hot topic these are $20 so definately recommended!</li>
            <li> The cleansing and healing process made it so much easier to maintain my new piercings because of He Ocean Piercing Aftercare. I would definitely buy this product again without hesitation.</li>
            <li> H2Ocean is amazing! If you have a piercing THIS is what you need to buy for it! It&#x27;s convenient and non-irritating. My cartilage piercing healed in half the time with daily care with this spray.</li>
            <li> Perfect, exactly what I wanted. Cleans piercings really well and fast. Be sure to follow the instructions, noone likes to get an infection!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing piercing for a number of years now and have found H2Ocean to be the ONLY product I sell and recommend for piercing aftercare.</li>
            <li> It does the job. Its recommended my many of my piercing artists and when used with antimicrobial sope it keeps away infection. Great buy, great price.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I will use on my nose ring. Definitely helps with healing and irritation. I highly recommend this spray.</li>
            <li> This is our family&#x27;s first choice for piercing care. We have used H2ocean for over 10 years with the same good healing results every time. Amazon has as always the best price on this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve compared this to standard wound-wash saline, and this works so much better. It is more expensive than plain sterile saline, but it is absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li> My belly button piercing was hurting quite a bit for about a month after piercing it. I purchased this spray and used it and within a few days it felt sooo much better. I know it takes about 6-9 months for a belly button to heal and I am a slow healer so this was a definite lifesaver! Made me so much more comfortable during the healing process!!!</li>
            <li> I have 3 piercings that I have used this on and it works great. It is convenient to use when I&#x27;m not in a place to soak in sea salt solution. It helps accelerate healing and I can carry it in my purse. It does not sting and helps get rid of discharge from the piercing. I like to use it after a nice shower.</li>
            <li> Love this product, came really fast (i think a day before expected). This spray really helped heal my piercings and I use it on a daily basis to help prevent any infections also</li>
            <li> My nose healed super fast with this! So did my cartilage. If you have a keloid (bump around your piercing) clean it with this, let it dry, then gently massage the bump with tea tree oil. Works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Worked with the healing of my conch.  Use 5-6 times a day :)</li>
            <li> I was having a lot of trouble with my new tragus piercing (redness, swelling, soreness) and my piercer recommended H2Ocean. The soap I was using was drying out my piercing causing it to become irritated, so I replaced my washing with spraying h2ocean twice a day and I am so happy with the results. The swelling, redness, and soreness have gone away entirely. I still wash my piercing with soap in the shower, but my main piercing care is h2ocean.</li>
            <li> It didnt work as well as I hoped &amp; its NOT a cheap product for the amount you get. Would have gotten more stars if you get more product for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I ordered this I was using sea salt water, it was effective but so messy &amp; time consuming. This only lasted me through my 2nd month with many more months to go, until my piercing is completely healed.  Since I&#x27;ve ran out of this within a month, I have been using regular contact saline &amp; its wonderful!!  I only have my piercing (bottom navel) soaking for a few seconds &amp; I see how well its working to heal (crusty stuff coming off &amp; any pus gets drawn out)</li>
            <li> Love this so much! I use it for my industrial and so far, everything works perfectly.</li>
            <li> If you have a new piercing this is a must. It helped heal my belly button &amp; helix piercings very well. Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Came as expected. leaks a little but over all good.</li>
            <li> This is actually the best aftercare I have ever tried! I used it on my tragus, belly button, Vertical clit hood piercing, and for my gauges! My only gripe (if I can call it that), is if you have extremely sensitive skin, make sure to use this product along with jewelry that is titanium or niobium or else it won&#x27;t heal AS WELL. This product does really well externally, BUT if you have jewelry that your body is rejecting, you&#x27;ll end up taking the piercing out. Just to be safe, when I got my nipples pierced, I made my own mixture of dead sea salt and water, soaked a rag and kept them on my nips (cheaper route but the spray is more convenient).</li>
            <li> This is the best sea salt solution i have tried, and came right on time! Definitely recommend, what a great purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. However, it does NOT remove the neccessity of cleaning your piercings regularly. This is more for use when you&#x27;re traveling, or just to have a small clean-up whenever you need it and don&#x27;t have time to do a real thorough cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this once in the morning and once before bed, and whenever I feel like my piercing is a bit dirty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great product if you are stretching piercings!</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this for cleaning her piercings and it keeps her clean and helps with the healing process.</li>
            <li> Ordered a can of h20cean. Product arrived on time but did not work when I used!!! Can was leaking the solution and would not spray it.</li>
            <li> I love it ...You think it&#x27;s not working but it is</li>
            <li> I would recommend using H2O spray over the salt solution. It&#x27;s easier just spray on and it helped to heal my nose piercing after 4 months of use. I had my nose pierced with a gum. NEVER, never, NEVER have it piercd with a gum.</li>
            <li> Yes. I love this spray.</li>
            <li> Cannot get aerosol to discharge, cannot get a response from either H2 ocean OR Amazon on resolution of the issue. Cannot return because it&#x27;s aerosol. Very unhappy</li>
            <li> Self pierce a lot and really convenient. I buy it all the time.</li>
            <li> Use it for my ears and my nipples. Have not had an infection, yet!</li>
            <li> when i got this product it wouldnt spray out at all. even after a few days of tries. i had to contact the manufacturer and thank god they sent me a new one for free.</li>
            <li> If you need to keep a piercing clean or get some extra gunk off at the end of the day, this is one of the best products to use. The sea salt is just enough to where it does not become irritated.</li>
            <li> I wish I had started using H2ocean when I first got my piercings -- it really does work wonders! What I notice most is my year-old tragus piercing keeps getting what I assume to be a keloid inside my ear and it&#x27;s painful and usually impossible to get rid of. But after literally only 3 days of using this stuff, it&#x27;s almost completely gone! No more sea salt soaks for me! Just spray it on and let it sit -- do not wipe off! That&#x27;s the trick to it working. I highly recommend this to anyone with new or difficult piercings. I will continue to use it, hands down!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others have said it runs out fast; not sure about that yet but hey even if I pay more for this than wound wash saline, I know I&#x27;m getting my $10 worth for sure.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this after reading all the 5 star reviews, but after one use, my tragus piercing felt prickly and swelled up for a day or two. Going back to regular saline wound wash spray and SSS at home.</li>
            <li> H2Ocean works so well on healing up your new piercings or any piercing infections. It clears the redness and itching right away. If you just got a brand new piercing, this is the product you need!! Spray it on 4 times a day, however, if you have a piercing infection, spray it every hour or so and it will clear the irritation in just one day! Very happy with this product, just what I need for body piercings!</li>
            <li> I had to try this product as I&#x27;ve heard so many people raving about how great this product is, and I have to say that I am very impressed.  It&#x27;s gentle, cleans effectively, doesn&#x27;t irritate, i like that it comes in a spray can; that makes it very convenient for on the go and it heals infections well.  I wish they created larger versions of this.</li>
            <li> As the title says, this stuff is amazing! When you spray it on it just feels like God is blowing on your ears or something! It&#x27;s kind of expensive but it&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li> I must admit this hurt the first week I tried it. I almost gave up but I decided to stick to it since is a highly recommend product. Am glad I did I can&#x27;t see myself without this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this quite a while back to care for my septum piercing and am only just now getting around to writing a review. But it worked great! And I used it for other new piercing I got as well.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t the money on this. Get a gallon of distilled water and a clean up, pour it into said cup, add seasalt and put in the microwave until warm then place over your piercing. Does the same thing and costs so much less. I&#x27;ve done this for all of my piercings and have had completely positive results.</li>
            <li> Great product! Exactly hot it was described and kept piercing nice and clean. Really recommend this product to anyone with a new piercing</li>
            <li> The 4 oz can lasts me about a month&#x27;s worth of use.  I spray/use q-tips inbetween my twice daily sea salt soaks.  A smaller 2oz back up can goes with me in my gym bag...solution works well after heavy sweating or if the piercing just starts to randomly itch (I have a new industrial).  Helps clear away crusties and soothes when piercing is irritated (helps soothe my hypertrophic scarring).  I dont recommend using this as an &amp;#34;always&amp;#34; cleaning method...as nothing beats a sea salt soak but this is a good way to go for cleaning inbetween soakings.  I love the H2Ocean spray, hence the 5 stars, but the particular 4oz can I received got a &amp;#34;rattle&amp;#34; in the can after about a weeks worth of use.  Sounds like a foam roller is in the can and now doesnt spray evenly/consistently.  Also noticed after the &amp;#34;rattle&amp;#34; started, the spray would irritate my piercing.  Dont know if defective can or if thats common w the 4oz cans (Ive always used the 2oz and never had a problem).  I highly recommend this product and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Everyone with a piercing should buy it. It&#x27;s quite refreshing to the skin and keeps crud away. You should pair this with tea tree oil simply because it&#x27;s a salt solution  and can dry out the area pretty quickly. Bought twice already,</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else for piercings. Works way better than just mixing salt in saline solution. It is worth the price for me. Seems to heal piercings faster and makes clean up easy</li>
            <li> I have many piercings. At least 10. Three in my face, a bunch in the ears and the nips... This is my standard aftercare spray I use. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and haven&#x27;t had any issue. It really gets the job done quite well, cleans up the gunk and soothes those throbbing new piercings. The spray is pretty solid. You can aim it and go and hit the area with accuracy. The stream is condensed so you don&#x27;t need a lot when you spray. The bottle lasts for a long time too because of that. This spray isn&#x27;t really good for infections though. If you&#x27;re piercing gets infected, you should be soaking it in warm salt water, which you should mix yourself using salt and distilled water. Other than that, highly recommend for all piercings.</li>
            <li> I completely abide by this stuff for piercings. It soothes and treats any mild irritation or infection. I also use it to change my belly ring so it slides easier. Whenever my piercing flares up, this is what I turn to. Great product that I would recommend to anybody who has a piercing!</li>
            <li> Is what it says it is, salt water in a can. Spray even with a nice fine mist and feels full.</li>
            <li> Helped heal my nose piercing fast 😃awesome product.</li>
            <li> Does the job.. I have been using it to take care of my new ear piercing</li>
            <li> This is a really wonderful product! I just got my nipples pierced and they take at least 2 weeks before they stop being sore and 6 weeks to heal. The first day was horrible as you can imagine my nipples were very red and sore and I couldn&#x27;t even touch them! just sitting there hurt insanely! I figured I&#x27;d be holding ice packs on my boobs for the next 2 weeks. But I did as instructed, and cleaned them 4 times a day with this spray and by the second day they were so much better! I couldn&#x27;t even tell they were pierced, I didn&#x27;t feel any pain unless I bumped them! They felt SO much better it was ridiculous! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone considering getting a piercing! Its a savior!</li>
            <li> While I do like the cooling effect of the spray and it has helped heal my stubborn cartilage piercings, it leaks ALL THE TIME. Every time I open the cap the water leaks out and I have to wipe it up. I swear I&#x27;ve lost half the product just from leakage. Wish it were in a pump instead of an aerosol.</li>
            <li> I got two piercings at the same time, side by side on my cartilage. It swelled and became infected within four days (granted I wasn&#x27;t taking good care of it so the blame is all on me.) I began cleaning it with antibacterial soap and hot water which did help (along with antibiotics) but it dried my ear out a bit. I began using H2Ocean more often instead of the soap and it worked just as well! I like this better actually because it saves me the trouble of having to boil water and mix the soap and wait for it to cool so I don&#x27;t burn my ear (yes laziness!) Now I only use antibacterial soap on my piercings once while I&#x27;m taking a hot shower and use H2Ocean during the rest of the day. I just spray some on both sides of my cartilage and I&#x27;m done! And since the can isn&#x27;t too big, I can carry it with me and spray it as needed! :)</li>
            <li> The spray itself works fine but the packaging it came in was very poor. It was a plain manila envelope, without any extra packaging which caused the cap to arrive shattered. For the most part it&#x27;s not a huge deal, but when traveling/moving it&#x27;s a pain to have to worry about whether or not something will make it spray off in my bag. The lack of care when mailing gave me a poor inpression of this seller.</li>
            <li> The product is great, but the bottle was shipped to me with a broken nozzle, so I can&#x27;t even use it. Yaaaaaayyyyyy.</li>
            <li> I just received this yesterday and I already know that I will never use anything else on my piercings. I had my nipples pierced about three-four weeks ago and started running out of the differently branded aftercare solution my piercer gave me. Upon reading the reviews I decided to try this instead of buying more of the other product, especially since this was a better value and seemed to do wonders for healing piercings. My piercings weren&#x27;t infected, but they were still very swollen and sore. After two applications of this yesterday, the swelling is completely gone and the soreness has decreased dramatically. I am currently planning more piercings once my nipples heal and will definitely stock up on H2Ocean for all of them.</li>
            <li> Helped heal my two new piercings about 3 weeks quicker than normal soap and water would. I already have 10 piercings and only heard about this on 9 and 10. Totally wish I knew about it quicker!  Very easy to use because of the spray bottle being continuous spray. Doesn&#x27;t dry crusty from the salt at all. Definitely a keeper!</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping! I bought this for my rook piecing and it seems to be healing quite nicely. thank you again</li>
            <li> Great for piercings and this is the large spray can.</li>
            <li> The liquid itself is very good to use. However, the bottle leaks BADLY due to its bad design, thus the overall experience is poor.</li>
            <li> works like a charm, piercing stopped hurting</li>
            <li> Its reallly good, i would like a bigger spray can though.</li>
            <li> Good price and fast delievery</li>
            <li> This cleared up a bite (possibly brown recluse) that wouldn&#x27;t heal for months.</li>
            <li> This has been a really good product for taking care of my belly button piercing.. I had a lot of problems and this helped me a lot!! Now my belly button piercing finally it healed fine!!</li>
            <li> Great product. I use it for cleaning my piercing but noticed it can be used for many other things too.  The product arrived in a timely manner and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> H2Ocean is one of the best things to get when you have a piercing. It works great to clean them during the day. If you have a new piercing I recommend buying this to clean them. Works great! :)</li>
            <li> so why did I call this my left arm I am always using this product and very happy that&lt;br /&gt;it keeps body piercings from getting infected. Watch your pierced ear rings, do not&lt;br /&gt;clean them with sea salt spray, I had a broken ear ring due to the chemicals in the&lt;br /&gt;spray and walmart was able to exchange without a problem.</li>
            <li> THANK GOD I found this online! I have gauged ears and one had been bothering me for months until I remembered this stuff!! I used it forever ago when I had my piercings first done and it works SO well! Needless to say, my ears are feeling great now and I don&#x27;t have to worry about letting my holes close back up! This spray is so unbelievably easy to use, just spritz it on and let it air dry. I usually spray it on right before bed. If you&#x27;re even considering getting H2Ocean, definitely go for it!</li>
            <li> DOES EXACTLY WHAT IT SAYS. I LOVED IT. STILL HAVE PLENTY LEFT ALSO.</li>
            <li> Good Stuff! Use it everyday to clean my nose piercing. Comforts me knowing it&#x27;s in a bottle and therefore much cleaner than using anything else. Helped make the dreaded bump go away.</li>
            <li> AMAZING product!  I was having some issues 2years post nip piercings (red, yucky debris, swollen) almost to the point of wanting to take my loss on the initial pain of the piercing and remove my rings to let the piercing close up.  I tried a few products including a q-tip medicine formula and man nothing holds a flame to H2Ocean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pros&lt;br /&gt;- IMMEDIATE soothing relief of discomfort in affected area&lt;br /&gt;-cleaned away debris easily and thoroughly&lt;br /&gt;-inflamed and sore piercing became almost healed overnight&lt;br /&gt;-reduction is debris (barf) trickling out of pierced area&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cons&lt;br /&gt;-This probably is just my fault - but the spray does dispense to a wide area which can be a bit wasteful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going to see how long it takes to finish this bottle before updating.  I would definitely buy again and would recommend this product for anyone who is feeling hopeless about their piercing issues.</li>
            <li> Definetly recommend my navel piercing healed quickly 😃</li>
            <li> Very easy to spray and get in those tough-to-reach areas! I don&#x27;t need to mess with cotton balls now :)</li>
            <li> Hands down, this is the best product for any piercing. I used this on all manners of piercings when I was younger and ordered it for my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s new ear piercings as well. I would never use anything else. It is cooling to tender new piercings and promotes fast healing. I also like that it sprays so you are not touching the piercing with your hands.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this spray. My cartilage piercing was infected for the longest time and this spray helped heal it. It is important to apply it diligently and it will work wonders.</li>
            <li> I recently bought another bottle of this because my small one that was given to my by my piercer ran out. It did help heal my belly button piercing, HOWEVER I found that Witch Hazel actually works better. I&#x27;ve been using the Dickinson&#x27;s Witch Hazel and It&#x27;s almost fully healed!! This product does help though, and especially for a fresh piercing, I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> exactly what i was looking for .. heals piercings like magic</li>
            <li> I use for labret, nose and ear piercings. I have not have any rashes, bumps, lumps, or any other piercing issues.</li>
            <li> Okay so I recently bought this spray because I got my cartilage pierced and it started getting irritated, my ear was getting harder around the area of the piercing and it was just all had, I freaked out and thought my was infected so I looked up ways to clean my piercing I&#x27;ve tried the hot water and sea salt soak but bending my head over a cup wasn&#x27;t working for me. I then decided to buy this. The only reason this works is because it eliminates you actually touching your ear, all you do is spray and go. If you&#x27;re not up to spending money on this I suggest you go to walmart and buy an empty spray bottle and sea salt, boil the water and add a lot of sea salt and put it in the spray bottle and you have you&#x27;re own h20cean spray, don&#x27;t get me wrong I like the product but you can do it yourself for less money.</li>
            <li> this was delivered fast and i used it for a forward helix piercing i had gotten, because it started to form keloids, but a week later they were gone!!</li>
            <li> superb, honestly. i&#x27;m currently gauging my ears and i&#x27;ve been cleaning my holes each night with this stuff. it keeps everything nice and clean and infection-free while also helping with pain/throbbing and allowing my holes to adjust. definitely worth buying for staying safe while sizing up :~0</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this because of all the good reviews, but it did not work for my belly piercing. It made it worse. My belly piercing wasn&#x27;t even red after I got it pierced but as soon as I started to use this, a patch of red surrounded the piercing. It looked like it was about to get infected so I looked online and saw that Neosporin was a good product to use so I found some laying around the house and started using that instead and it cleared the red patch. If you are thinking about getting this product, try Neosporin first.</li>
            <li> bought this again after my first one ran out. my belly button piercing was red from being tinkered with too many times and I heard this was a good remedy for it.&lt;br /&gt;after a couple weeks, my piercing healed perfectly! no more redness! will be buying in the future :)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a very good product for all piercings it works very well..my order had came very quickly without any problems</li>
            <li> I had gotten a couple piercings below the neck and having to do the sea salt soak all the time was almost impossible to do considering I live with more than just my boyfriend. I used this spray every day just as the directions say and they healed up nicely and the piercings didn&#x27;t even really get itchy except a few times when I soaked them in sea salt. I would recommend this to anyone who gets any kind of piercing because this stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time, as described, in new condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product for new piercings as well as old ones. Was purchased for continual cleaning of existing piercings in which this product works great. Found out about product from tattoo artist and used for a new piercing, in which it worked great. Others who I have spoken, have used other products or very minimal care, which resulted in infection or irritation. While I used this product my piercings healed properly with no adverse effect. Great product recommend 100%.</li>
            <li> This product is very convenient. It is a simple way to get your saline solution quickly. I still HIGHLY recommend doing a saline SOAK during at least the first week of a new body piercing (nipples, bellybutton, etc.) Just because a spray is not as thorough. The spray is a great addition to the soak, and anytime you feel any flare ups in your piercings. You need to make sure the spray is not replacing regular gentle cleaning with an anti-microbial soap. If there is any crusting take a q-tip with a little bit of the solution and VERY gently swab around the area to remove it. Do NOT force any piercings to move or continue to swab if it hurts. Remember if your questioning anything you&#x27;re feeling you can always call the business who pierced you, it&#x27;s better to &amp;#34;bother&amp;#34; them and know what&#x27;s wrong than get an infection. I digress, this spray is great to travel with in between soaks and washes, easy to carry in your purse, very sanitary as it stays in the can. I have 10 piercings and started using this when i started to get piercings below the neck and have had no issues! P.S. Take an anti-inflammatory like ibuprofen (avoid asprin as it thins blood) to reduce swelling and pain, if you&#x27;re a fellow lady take a women&#x27;s daily vitamin, and zinc, which helps with the healing process!  Hope this review and these tips can help! Remember any questions, go to a doctor or your piercer!</li>
            <li> This product did exactly what I was hoping !! Plus it was at a Fantastic Price !!! I would definitely recommend this Product !</li>
            <li> This stuff saved me!! My new piercing was infected and PAINFUL but once I got this and started using it 5 times a day (and anti-bacterial soap in shower), it healed nicely!</li>
            <li> The headline says it all</li>
            <li> I mainly use this product for razor bumps! Works wonders! I recommend this product to anyone dealing with irritating razor bumps</li>
            <li> I love this product it made my healing process so much faster and i still use it to keep area feeling clean and fresh</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for years, and it helps dissolve the gunk that gets on your jewelry from a healing piercing. It also feels nice on the piercing. Even while using this, I still recommend washing your piercing every other day while it is new to prevent infection.</li>
            <li> Salt soaks can be time consuming. I try and do a soak a few times a week, but for the times when I&#x27;m in a hurry, I just spray this on and go. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and it&#x27;s already helped remove crusts and reduce the redness of two irritated piercings. I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I read really good reviews. I used it for my nose piercing because I had a bump next to it. And I must say this really worked!! I just sprayed at night and the next morning it dried it up and made it smaller . Days later I had no bump (: this was the only thing that helped me.</li>
