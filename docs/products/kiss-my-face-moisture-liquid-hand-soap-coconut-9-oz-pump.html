            <li>I love coconut - lots of it, but not this.</li>
            <li>Love the scent and ingredients.</li>
            <li>but I love the smell of coconut.</li>
            <li>This soap is ok when compared to most hand soaps.  </li>
            <li>I love this brand.</li>
            <li>I love how my hands feel after washing.  </li>
            <li>Great smell, not harsh on the hands.</li>
            <li>Great smell, all natural.</li>
            <li>It was strong, it lingered on your hands for a while, and if I had kept using it, probably would have triggered an odor-induced headache.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li>I think this is a good product and only seems available on line so ok</li>
            <li>I love kiss my face products largely because they are all natural and smell so darn good.  </li>
            <li>It suds up thoroughly and my hands feel both squeaky clean and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>Washes away without the need to scrub my hands forever to keep clean.</li>
            <li>Better price here than at our natural grocery store.</li>
            <li>Lathers well, washes off easily and leaves a soft, clean, feeling without being greasy.</li>
            <li>This does make a nice lather and leaves hands soft instead of dry, but the scent is very strong.</li>
            <li>It is a mild soap that is exactly what I wanted  </li>
            <li>but I use traditional antibacterial soap if I feel like I really need to make sure my hands clean.</li>
            <li>Daughter gets dry skin in the winter and this soap is much more gentle than the anti-bacterial soaps flush in the market.</li>
            <li>It does not dry my skin and it has a nice smell without being gagging like the ones our local store sells.</li>
            <li>You only need a little to get a great lather.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s silky, smooth, luxurious, and a daily treat!</li>
            <li>In the winter I give a pump of this soap along with a tiny pump of fial so that I get the better smell and soothing soap along with a little antibacterial action :)</li>
            <li>Dries hands a little more than I&#x27;d expect.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by this modestly priced item.  </li>
            <li>The consistency is a little thick and it really doesn&#x27;t lather well, which is why I think it is just ok.</li>
            <li>I unscrewed and poured into empty from another, much cheaper, brand rather than return.</li>
            <li>smells really good but could be too artificial smell</li>
