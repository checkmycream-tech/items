    <ol>
            <li>This product has great slip!</li>
            <li>My hair is soft..shiny...and best twistout yet!!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li>and it smells really great.</li>
            <li>but it smells great</li>
            <li>I think it may not be good for my type of curls</li>
            <li>It did give me good curl definition and moisture.</li>
            <li>After using this product, my hair felt great and was easy to style.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice affect on my hair and smells really good  :-).</li>
            <li>I would maybe use this stuff for cream to put my hair up in a bun or some kind of updo.</li>
            <li>So, like I said, it&#x27;s good for updos, but since I already have a moisturizer that I like better</li>
            <li>It smells delicious, works very well.</li>
            <li>my curls is gorgeous ,love this product</li>
            <li>use it when performing a twist out - awesome product, provides curls and not hard on hair or to touch.</li>
            <li>And I like to try new products for curls in my hair to see what works best.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>My twist outs are phenomenal as well...</li>
            <li>After all the hype and you tube reviews I as expecting a better outcome on my daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s allowed my hair to be more manageable</li>
            <li>I get nice frizz free</li>
            <li>I like this curl cream better than....</li>
            <li>But I like it better than Shea Moisture&#x27;s Curl Enhancing Smoothie.</li>
            <li>I have tried many many hair care products for my curly hair-</li>
            <li>this has to be my favorite by far!!&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine for my hair to be a bit exotic, but this was just unprofessional.)</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t foresee this ever becoming my go-to product.</li>
            <li>I have read that shrinkage is primarily caused by the texture of your hair, so that is something else to consider.</li>
            <li>stays all day, gives my curl definition, lift, and a smooth look.  </li>
            <li>I used it on wet and blown out hair to creat a beautiful twist out.</li>
            <li>great for natural drying or diffuse drying-I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>and when I used this product directly after co-washing my hair, the back of my hair (4a) exhibited shrinkage to my neck (yes, that many inches!!!).</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, the smell is sickly sweet, like cake or pastries.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it in my sons&#x27; very short hair and it&#x27;s definitely made a difference when I brush their hair each morning before school besides the very delicious scent.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s perfect for my my short curly hair,I always work it in wet hair</li>
            <li>Its my new holy grail!!!</li>
            <li>I experience most shrinkage in the back of my hair that is 4a.</li>
            <li>It smells fabulous, made of natural ingredients</li>
            <li>, I most likely won&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
            <li>The souffle did exactly what it said it would do.</li>
            <li>This product did absolutely nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t mind it that much.</li>
            <li>I applied it to my damp hair and my hair became very sticky, which I did not like at all.</li>
            <li>I lucked upon this product when I first went natural and have used it since.</li>
            <li>Was hesitant to buy it because I thought it would be like the kinky curly product but was pleasantly surprised to see that it had POSITIVE results on my hair.</li>
            <li>I would have been MUCH better off leaving in a little bit of my conditioner.</li>
            <li>and I think I fall into one of the 4 types of hair (can&#x27;t really tell which yet, it&#x27;s been over 20 yrs since I&#x27;ve seen my natural hair).</li>
            <li>curls with shine and no hard hold.</li>
            <li>The next day, my hair was even more of a disaster and extremely dry to the touch, as though I had just been to the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Used this product for the first time last week.</li>
            <li>It has a lot of moisture, so it is good for that, but not for everyday curls with your hair down.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t sing this products praises enough.</li>
            <li>The only issue is that it doesn&#x27;t provide much of a hold.</li>
            <li>Ive just reached my 7 month natural mark</li>
            <li>I use it to twist my freshly washed and wet hair.</li>
            <li>And at $16/8oz, Souffle is a lot less expensive and a lot more \\&quot;organic\\&quot; than some other very popular products out there that I won&#x27;t name...</li>
            <li>However, the shrinkage is not nearly that much when I use this product on my twist outs.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that I can&#x27;t find it at my local Target store, accessibility would be nice.</li>
            <li>especially the new growth</li>
            <li>I am currently 7 weeks in my transition from relaxed hair to natural</li>
            <li>and it kept my hair really soft while allowing it to lengthen at the same time.</li>
            <li>Second, on Day 2, my hair fell apart completely that it was a disaster.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The ingredients are so pure that my hands aren&#x27;t sticky at all after I apply it, like other products I have used.</li>
            <li>I probably won&#x27;t purchase the souffle again, only because my hair is very fine and the souffle was a little too heavy.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The Curl Enhancing smoothie leaves the hair feeling strange to me.  </li>
            <li> And I will try it out again-maybe on a long weekend when it doesn&#x27;t matter what my hair looks like-</li>
            <li> When I ran out of the Hair Milk that I usually use I decided to try something new-</li>
            <li> I will buy this product for as long as they supply it!</li>
            <li> I added the cream to my hair after letting it air dry (and adding my leave-in conditioner -[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> And afterwards, the hair doesn&#x27;t feel dry or coated.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the product it didn&#x27;t perform as expected.  </li>
            <li> This product works well for twist outs, as well as wet styling.  </li>
            <li> I tried other natural/curl products, but none of them have done as well as this one does.</li>
            <li> It will hold your moisture as well as giving a fragrance envious by other products.</li>
            <li> It has a sweet/pastry smell to it, but it is just so strong that it smells so bad.</li>
            <li> By the time my hair had dried, it was as if I hadn&#x27;t put any product in my hair at all-it was poofy, unruly, and dry.</li>
            <li> I have long 3C hair and usually use Carol&#x27;s Daughter products.</li>
            <li> (just don&#x27;t lay down on them).</li>
            <li> I kinda like that the cream smells like icing and would like if my hair kept that smell after the cream has dried.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this product since it has all natural ingredients; usually when I purchase a beauty produce that is \\&quot;all</li>
            <li> My only fear is that one day, the product will just stop working for me, I&#x27;ve heard other ladies mention this problem with other products :(</li>
            <li> First off, the smell of this stuff is disgusting.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the product it didn&#x27;t perform as expected.  Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> After using this product, my hair felt great and was easy to style.  I Will use and purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I use it to twist my freshly washed and wet hair. My twists were never so springy and bouncy before I started using the Souffle! My twist outs are phenomenal as well...I really can&#x27;t sing this products praises enough. My only fear is that one day, the product will just stop working for me, I&#x27;ve heard other ladies mention this problem with other products :( Well, for now I&#x27;ve found my Holy Grail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Different products work differently on every head of hair regardless of hair texture. You&#x27;ll never know how something works fot you until you try it! And at $16/8oz, Souffle is a lot less expensive and a lot more \\&quot;organic\\&quot; than some other very popular products out there that I won&#x27;t name...rhymes with Kiss Bessie&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> After all the hype and you tube reviews I as expecting a better outcome on my daughter&#x27;s hair.  It can leave a flaky film the next day when combined with the daily leave in moisturizer by curls.</li>
            <li> I am currently 7 weeks in my transition from relaxed hair to natural and I think I fall into one of the 4 types of hair (can&#x27;t really tell which yet, it&#x27;s been over 20 yrs since I&#x27;ve seen my natural hair). I have been using the Curl Souffle daily for over a week after I take out my satin covered sponge rollers each morning and it&#x27;s allowed my hair to be more manageable especially the new growth and it smells really great. I&#x27;ve been using it in my sons&#x27; very short hair and it&#x27;s definitely made a difference when I brush their hair each morning before school besides the very delicious scent.</li>
            <li> I lucked upon this product when I first went natural and have used it since. I tried other natural/curl products, but none of them have done as well as this one does. I kinda like that the cream smells like icing and would like if my hair kept that smell after the cream has dried. I get nice frizz free (frizz is a big problem for me) curls with shine and no hard hold. I can actually touch my hair and scrunch the curls with that straw feeling and the curls bounce back (just don&#x27;t lay down on them).</li>
            <li> I have several textures in my hair (3b, 3c, 4a).  This product works well for twist outs, as well as wet styling.  The reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star is that I does not prevent shrinkage that well.  I have read that shrinkage is primarily caused by the texture of your hair, so that is something else to consider. I experience most shrinkage in the back of my hair that is 4a. My hair is to the middle of my back and when I used this product directly after co-washing my hair, the back of my hair (4a) exhibited shrinkage to my neck (yes, that many inches!!!). However, the shrinkage is not nearly that much when I use this product on my twist outs. It smells fabulous, made of natural ingredients and I probably will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Used this product for the first time last week. Was hesitant to buy it because I thought it would be like the kinky curly product but was pleasantly surprised to see that it had POSITIVE results on my hair. I added the cream to my hair after letting it air dry (and adding my leave-in conditioner -[[ASIN:B000BH92J2 Shea Moisture Shea Butter Leave in Conditioner 8oz]]) and it kept my hair really soft while allowing it to lengthen at the same time. It has a nice affect on my hair and smells really good  :-). It&#x27;s pricey so I don&#x27;t use it that often.</li>
            <li> I could not stand this stuff. I just got this as a recommendation from a fellow curly girl. And I like to try new products for curls in my hair to see what works best. So I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. First off, the smell of this stuff is disgusting. I cannot stand the smell. I swear every time I breathe it in, I gag. It has a sweet/pastry smell to it, but it is just so strong that it smells so bad. Second, on Day 2, my hair fell apart completely that it was a disaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t stay at all. I would maybe use this stuff for cream to put my hair up in a bun or some kind of updo. It has a lot of moisture, so it is good for that, but not for everyday curls with your hair down. I think it may not be good for my type of curls I have, so it didn&#x27;t work for me. So, like I said, it&#x27;s good for updos, but since I already have a moisturizer that I like better and I cannot stand the smell of this stuff, I most likely won&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this product since it has all natural ingredients; usually when I purchase a beauty produce that is \\&quot;all natural\\&quot; the quality may suffer. This was not the case with the styling cream. It smells delicious, works very well. The ingredients are so pure that my hands aren&#x27;t sticky at all after I apply it, like other products I have used. In fact,  the left over product on my hands works well as a moisturizer! I do not even need to wash them after I apply it! I have tried multiple different curling products from low-end to high-end, but they all end up sticky or make my hair look crispy or wet. I will buy this product for as long as they supply it!</li>
            <li> This product has great slip! I used it on wet and blown out hair to creat a beautiful twist out. Curls Soufflé will stay in my product rotation. My only complaint is that I can&#x27;t find it at my local Target store, accessibility would be nice.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s perfect for my my short curly hair,I always work it in wet hair my curls is gorgeous ,love this product</li>
            <li> The souffle did exactly what it said it would do. It did give me good curl definition and moisture. I probably won&#x27;t purchase the souffle again, only because my hair is very fine and the souffle was a little too heavy. My 2nd day hair felt gummy.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!! use it when performing a twist out - awesome product, provides curls and not hard on hair or to touch.</li>
            <li> I like this curl cream better than....dare I say it.....Shea Moisture&#x27;s Curl Enhancing Smoothie.  The Curl Enhancing smoothie leaves the hair feeling strange to me.  This product leaves the hair feeling moist. And afterwards, the hair doesn&#x27;t feel dry or coated.  The only issue is that it doesn&#x27;t provide much of a hold. But I like it better than Shea Moisture&#x27;s Curl Enhancing Smoothie.</li>
            <li> I have tried many many hair care products for my curly hair- this has to be my favorite by far!!&lt;br /&gt;It stays all day, gives my curl definition, lift, and a smooth look.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a build up like a lot of creams do nor does it leave a sticky residue on your hands if you touch your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Its great for natural drying or diffuse drying-I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This product did absolutely nothing for my hair. I have long 3C hair and usually use Carol&#x27;s Daughter products. When I ran out of the Hair Milk that I usually use I decided to try something new-this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the smell is sickly sweet, like cake or pastries. If you don&#x27;t want your head to smell like a bakery or candy shop, do not get this product. I didn&#x27;t mind it that much. I applied it to my damp hair and my hair became very sticky, which I did not like at all. By the time my hair had dried, it was as if I hadn&#x27;t put any product in my hair at all-it was poofy, unruly, and dry. (I work in a corporate environment-it&#x27;s fine for my hair to be a bit exotic, but this was just unprofessional.) I would have been MUCH better off leaving in a little bit of my conditioner. The next day, my hair was even more of a disaster and extremely dry to the touch, as though I had just been to the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this product works for some people. And I will try it out again-maybe on a long weekend when it doesn&#x27;t matter what my hair looks like-but I don&#x27;t foresee this ever becoming my go-to product.</li>
            <li> This product will take your curls to another level. It will hold your moisture as well as giving a fragrance envious by other products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t define my curls or anything but it smells great and I use it when twisting my hair. I say try it out</li>
