            <li> Not surprisingly, there is no mention of the size I could find anywhere in the description of the item.  Only if you enlarge the pic and look at the tiniest numbers at the left corner would you get this essential piece of info. 15% Epsom salt. What is &amp;#34;Pure&amp;#34; in that Dead sea salt? It is a purely overpriced item with important info omitted. Otherwise, there is nothing wrong with this item. It smells nice and dissolves without trace.</li>
