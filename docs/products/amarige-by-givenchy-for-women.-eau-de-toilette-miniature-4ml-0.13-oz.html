            <li>Awesome !</li>
            <li>Best scent.</li>
            <li>The cologne itself smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful size for purse or travel.</li>
            <li>excellent seller, very good product, all according to the description recommend</li>
            <li>This is great perfume smells awesome.  </li>
            <li>maybe bcoz i didnt read what size it is lol</li>
            <li>Still great smelling stuff.</li>
            <li>But I am more of a Ralph by Ralph Lauren or Be Delicious by DKNY fan.</li>
            <li>My friend loved it.</li>
            <li>Just the combo of scents that smell good to me and on me.</li>
            <li>I could have just gone to Macy&#x27;s and gotten a full bottle for FREE!!!!</li>
            <li>I love Givenchy perfume they all smell great.  </li>
            <li>and I fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>This is one of my top 2 favorite perfumes.  </li>
            <li>I think this company is diluting the product with something to fill the bottle up and try to make more money because you cannot return the perfume to Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I got my order today , i love the smell of amarige</li>
            <li>Ever Love this scent.  </li>
            <li>Would love to purchase the soap and lotion in this product line.</li>
            <li>I also love the bottle it came in</li>
            <li>There are so many memories engendered by this product.  </li>
            <li>Most scents disappear within an hour or two because of my body chemistry I think.</li>
            <li>and I really enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>But the size of this bottle cannot be used for more than 1 or two times.  </li>
            <li>I of course love the scent.</li>
            <li>This means that during the shipping process, most of my perfume had leaked from the bottle before the package even got to my doorstep.</li>
            <li>wifes favorite perfume</li>
            <li>I get the package today and the bottle is in about 1/3 the way full!</li>
            <li>I expect to remain a loyal customer for many years to come.</li>
            <li>This small bottle fits perfectly in my purse.</li>
            <li>Glad to be able to get this hard to find fragrance that I have loved for years.</li>
            <li>but the scent stays long and nice scent</li>
            <li>I thought I was getting a cute little bottle of one of my favorite frangrances.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to have a mini bottle to have for my purse, however, the design is such so that the perfume will easily leak if the bottle is not kept upright.</li>
            <li>I first smelled this perfume on a lady I once knew</li>
            <li>Thank you SO much !</li>
            <li>This bottle is marked &amp;#34;SAMPLE-NOT FOR RESALE&amp;#34;, yet I paid $6.93 for it - this was for the product, the shipping was free.  </li>
            <li>Personally, if I am going for a richer, more grown up scent I will stick with Lady Million.</li>
            <li>For some reason i do not have a way to contact seller so decided to write review VERY upset.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, this is a personal old favorite.  </li>
            <li>To top it off, it wasn&#x27;t sealed and over half of the perfume leaked all over the packaging.  </li>
            <li>oh, I know Amarige to be a bit loud at first spray, but this goes on like a new born kitten.  </li>
            <li>but I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>Love it, just too small.  </li>
            <li>Smells funny, and not like the actual size perfume.</li>
            <li>Old bottle?  </li>
            <li>I needed small to fit regulations..</li>
            <li>It comes a mess and half full.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I purchased this small bottle because being so close to the holidays, I did not want to step on my husband&#x27;s toes and purchase a large one because he probably will as a gift.  </li>
            <li> I love this perfume, wish It wasn&#x27;t so small and expensive</li>
            <li> Until the manufacture fixes the lid/top it is a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Prompt shipping and as expected.</li>
            <li> Used up my small bottle in short order.</li>
            <li> I was not aware I could not return it either.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price</li>
            <li> but this product is too small not worth for what i pay .</li>
            <li> this was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> This is too heavy, musky and &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; for me.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I ordered this small bottle to use for a tip I a taking via airplane.  </li>
            <li> I suggest anyone who likes this perfume have a small spare for your purse</li>
            <li> I tried a little on my wrist and the smell was so bad I instantly threw it in the garbage.  </li>
            <li> The bottle slightly leaks though which is annoying.</li>
            <li> i was disappointed that the bottle was tooo small</li>
            <li> Even the lotion is very faint.  </li>
            <li> The lid does not seal the bottle of perfume making it worthless for travel in your purse.</li>
            <li> It was so sickening</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  </li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>

            <li> I first smelled this perfume on a lady I once knew and I fell in love with it.  I did not purchase this item but I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I wear this perfume and buy it regularly.  I purchased this small bottle because being so close to the holidays, I did not want to step on my husband&#x27;s toes and purchase a large one because he probably will as a gift.  This is one of my top 2 favorite perfumes.  I wanted enough to get me by until Christmas.  When I opened this bottle, the smell was anything like what it should smell like.  It smells like a chemical was added.  It smells like motor oil or something equivalent to that.  It&#x27;s HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  It was so sickening, I tried opening the bottle to see if it needed to air out some and nothing helped.  I tried a little on my wrist and the smell was so bad I instantly threw it in the garbage.  I think this company is diluting the product with something to fill the bottle up and try to make more money because you cannot return the perfume to Amazon.  DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS SELLER!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, wish It wasn&#x27;t so small and expensive</li>
            <li> I got my order today , i love the smell of amarige but this product is too small not worth for what i pay .</li>
            <li> Awesome ! Thank you SO much !</li>
            <li> Best scent. Ever Love this scent.  However, gone to soon.  Need a bigger bottle.  Would love to purchase the soap and lotion in this product line.</li>
            <li> I brought this as a gift. My friend loved it.</li>
            <li> Love it, just too small.  Thank you guys.</li>
            <li> Uh-oh, I know Amarige to be a bit loud at first spray, but this goes on like a new born kitten.  Old bottle?  Even the lotion is very faint.  Otherwise, this is a personal old favorite.  Evokes feelings of deliciousness through my entire being.</li>
            <li> This is great perfume smells awesome.  I love Givenchy perfume they all smell great.  I also love the bottle it came in</li>
            <li> i was disappointed that the bottle was tooo small maybe bcoz i didnt read what size it is lol but the scent stays long and nice scent</li>
            <li> Glad to be able to get this hard to find fragrance that I have loved for years. This small bottle fits perfectly in my purse.</li>
            <li> lo malo es que es mas pequeño de lo que esperaba&lt;br /&gt;todo perfecto como lo describian&lt;br /&gt;lo recomiendo.. sigan asi..&lt;br /&gt;todo perfecto como lo describian&lt;br /&gt;lo recomiendo.. sigan asi.. mejor imposible</li>
            <li> There are so many memories engendered by this product.  I expect to remain a loyal customer for many years to come.</li>
            <li> Used up my small bottle in short order. Just the combo of scents that smell good to me and on me. Most scents disappear within an hour or two because of my body chemistry I think. Amarige works well for me and I really enjoyed it. Will get a bigger bottle when finances permit.</li>
            <li> I ordered this small bottle to use for a tip I a taking via airplane.  I needed small to fit regulations.. I get the package today and the bottle is in about 1/3 the way full! For some reason i do not have a way to contact seller so decided to write review VERY upset. Such a rip off.</li>
            <li> excellent seller, very good product, all according to the description recommend</li>
            <li> The cologne itself smells wonderful.  But the size of this bottle cannot be used for more than 1 or two times.  Not worth the price</li>
            <li> Smells funny, and not like the actual size perfume. this was a waste of my money. would not buy again.</li>
            <li> This bottle is marked &amp;#34;SAMPLE-NOT FOR RESALE&amp;#34;, yet I paid $6.93 for it - this was for the product, the shipping was free.  To top it off, it wasn&#x27;t sealed and over half of the perfume leaked all over the packaging.  Shame on you Amazon!!!  I thought I was getting a cute little bottle of one of my favorite frangrances.  I could have just gone to Macy&#x27;s and gotten a full bottle for FREE!!!!</li>
            <li> Not a big enough bottle !  Still great smelling stuff.</li>
            <li> Horrible. I am not a fan but I know others that are a fan so don&#x27;t say no just because of me. Personally, if I am going for a richer, more grown up scent I will stick with Lady Million. But I am more of a Ralph by Ralph Lauren or Be Delicious by DKNY fan. This is too heavy, musky and &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; for me.</li>
            <li> I of course love the scent. The bottle slightly leaks though which is annoying. In the future I will buy a spray.</li>
            <li> I was excited to have a mini bottle to have for my purse, however, the design is such so that the perfume will easily leak if the bottle is not kept upright. This means that during the shipping process, most of my perfume had leaked from the bottle before the package even got to my doorstep. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> wifes favorite perfume so she loves it.</li>
            <li> Buyer beware.  The lid does not seal the bottle of perfume making it worthless for travel in your purse. It comes a mess and half full.  I was not aware I could not return it either. Until the manufacture fixes the lid/top it is a total waste of money. I should have paid attention to another person that reported this. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Wonderful size for purse or travel. Prompt shipping and as expected. I suggest anyone who likes this perfume have a small spare for your purse</li>
