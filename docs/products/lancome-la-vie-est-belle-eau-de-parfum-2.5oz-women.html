            <li>This was a great buy on amazon.  </li>
            <li>La Vie Est Belle by Lancome is amazing!.</li>
            <li>Plus  she smells good as well .</li>
            <li>She wore it and loved it.  </li>
            <li>My daughter tried it once before she went to school and had friends telling her about how good she smelt.  </li>
            <li>it smelled better on paper, but i gave it to a good friend of mine</li>
            <li>The result is a gorgeous, original scent that&#x27;s both feminine and empowering.</li>
            <li>Does smell nice too although too strong for the husband.</li>
            <li>the smell is amazing, lovely, strong but yet seductive.</li>
            <li>Love the perfume</li>
            <li>I love Lancôme&#x27;s La Vie est  Belle Parfum.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>This refreshing perfume has notes of vanilla, musk, and iris.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve fallen in love with this one and am buying it for myself.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good about this perfume!</li>
            <li>smells fresh floral and most important feminine, received so many compliments.</li>
            <li>I wore it the next day to work and when i walked pass my co-workers to my office, everyone caught the smell in the air and told me i smell beautiful.</li>
            <li>That said, if you love patchouli, buy it, but be aware that there are a lot of patchouli haters out there whose lives will not be so belle when you wear it.</li>
            <li>This one was still pleasantly there the next day.</li>
            <li>Five, I kid you not, five different people told me how good I smelled...</li>
            <li>The bottle was marked 2012, so I suspect it was in an warm environment.</li>
            <li>Many of the well-known names/brands that are pleasing to my sensitive nose are gone within just an hour.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful perfume, intense and yet subtle.</li>
            <li>Received my order right away.</li>
            <li>I had checked many other places and found it was a great deal more expensive.  </li>
            <li>My husband does not like strong perfume a little too strong for him</li>
            <li>smells so good, last so long.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t care what it costs - it&#x27;s too rare for me to find one that is not a migraine trigger, smells so nice, and stays on me for such a long time.</li>
            <li>Got home straight to amazon</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s noticeable, and it&#x27;s very refined.</li>
            <li>It is a bit strong, but that&#x27;s not unusual for a Lancome fragrance.</li>
            <li>I will highly recommend this product to all ladies that believe that &amp;#34; Life Is Beautiful&amp;#34; &amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this for anyone that want one that can be warn at work and out at night.</li>
            <li>This smells really good but a little stronger than expected.</li>
            <li>Live and learn.</li>
            <li>It is very strong and  you do not need to use hardly any.</li>
            <li>You can buy this perfume and size directly from Lancome for $98.00.  </li>
            <li>The bottle I purchased on Amazon was old.</li>
            <li>She was surprised</li>
            <li>Unlike my wife who feels she has to announce herself every time she enters a room or car, I like perfume subtle, hits you low from the ground and you can&#x27;t tell immediately in a group who smelled so nice until closer inspection.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of this new perfume.</li>
            <li>It absolutely reeks of patchouli, an odor that is to me more foul than a baby&#x27;s dirty diaper.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> One day i  was shopping at the TownEast Mall and i went across these ladies in the perfume department and they sprayed a sample of La Vie Est Belle on me and I can tell you this, the smell is amazing, lovely, strong but yet seductive. I immediately wanted to grap one and they told me it cost $100.00 without taxes, so i chosed to wave on that. Got home straight to amazon and here it is for $85.99, same 2.7 oz. With no hesitation, i ordered  one from BeautyEncounter and the delivery package was so solid and organized. I wore it the next day to work and when i walked pass my co-workers to my office, everyone caught the smell in the air and told me i smell beautiful. Even my husband loves it. The smell sticks on every outfit that i wear for the next couple of these. I will highly recommend this product to all ladies that believe that &amp;#34; Life Is Beautiful&amp;#34; &amp;#34; La Vie Est Belle by Lancome is amazing!.</li>
            <li> I had won a miniature and one night, decided to use it. Five, I kid you not, five different people told me how good I smelled... I thought, &amp;#34;we have a keeper!&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s a wonderful perfume, intense and yet subtle. It&#x27;s there, it&#x27;s noticeable, and it&#x27;s very refined. Not shabby at all!!</li>
            <li> It makes the Girlfriend happy,  So it makes me happy as well !!! Plus  she smells good as well .</li>
            <li> Having only spritzed a tiny bit on myself at Macy&#x27;s, I nonetheless feel qualified to review this. It absolutely reeks of patchouli, an odor that is to me more foul than a baby&#x27;s dirty diaper. And it is ubiquitous these days; I think men are now preferring it to musk in their cologne. It&#x27;s everywhere. When I got home I had to scrub the sprayed hand at least four or five times to remove the malodorous stuff. And the odor still lingers on the strap of my handbag. Once I had to return a scarf to a store because someone with a patchouli-based perfume had tried it on. That said, if you love patchouli, buy it, but be aware that there are a lot of patchouli haters out there whose lives will not be so belle when you wear it.</li>
            <li> smells so good, last so long. smells fresh floral and most important feminine, received so many compliments. you will not regret</li>
            <li> You can buy this perfume and size directly from Lancome for $98.00.  Love the perfume but someone is gouging at this price.</li>
            <li> I love Lancôme&#x27;s La Vie est  Belle Parfum. I get so many compliments. Received my order right away. Very happy with my experience.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this for anyone that want one that can be warn at work and out at night.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife to try it-she just adores it. Does smell nice too although too strong for the husband. Unlike my wife who feels she has to announce herself every time she enters a room or car, I like perfume subtle, hits you low from the ground and you can&#x27;t tell immediately in a group who smelled so nice until closer inspection. She is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good about this perfume! I&#x27;ve received numerous compliments while wearing it. I know this will be a &amp;#34;keeper&amp;#34; for me.</li>
            <li> My wife loves her La vie est belle perfume! She tells me she always gets complements wherever she goes while wearing this. Makes a great gift and we recieved it in about 4 days after placing the order.</li>
            <li> This smells really good but a little stronger than expected. My husband does not like strong perfume a little too strong for him</li>
            <li> it was in great condition! not too crazy about the smell, i originially smelled it on paper, and not on myself. it smelled better on paper, but i gave it to a good friend of mine</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this perfume since it came out. The bottle I purchased on Amazon was old. The bottle was marked 2012, so I suspect it was in an warm environment. I will only buy from Lancôme in the future. Big disappointment for the $5.00 I saved. Live and learn.</li>
            <li> Great fragerance! We had an unfortunate accident with the glass container and Lancome was very customer focused to help address the issue.  :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of this new perfume. It is a bit strong, but that&#x27;s not unusual for a Lancome fragrance. This refreshing perfume has notes of vanilla, musk, and iris. The result is a gorgeous, original scent that&#x27;s both feminine and empowering. My one complaint is, unfortunately, that it doesn&#x27;t seem to have great staying power. But it&#x27;s a beautiful fragrance nonetheless!</li>
            <li> Perfume is a very personal thing. Many of the well-known names/brands that are pleasing to my sensitive nose are gone within just an hour. This one was still pleasantly there the next day. I&#x27;ve fallen in love with this one and am buying it for myself. There&#x27;s even a bit of the scent left on a throw I pulled over me the day I tested it in the store. Don&#x27;t care what it costs - it&#x27;s too rare for me to find one that is not a migraine trigger, smells so nice, and stays on me for such a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Christmas because my wife left a sampler out. I thought it was a hint.  So after I bought it I asked about the sampler. She said she didn&#x27;t like it.  I gave it to her still.  She wore it and loved it.  My daughter tried it once before she went to school and had friends telling her about how good she smelt.  I had to buy another bottle for Mother&#x27;s Day.</li>
            <li> My wife had mentioned that she wanted to get this perfume and I was looking for a gift to get her.  I went and ordered it at a great price and it was delivered faster than expected.  She was surprised and I was a hero.</li>
            <li> This was a great buy on amazon.  I had checked many other places and found it was a great deal more expensive.  It is very strong and  you do not need to use hardly any. It lasts and lasts.  I was swimming for an hour in the evening - no sunscreen - and when I got out I could still smell it on me.</li>
