            <li>Excellent quality and very sturdy.  </li>

            <li>If you like a good vigorous scrub, you will love this one.</li>
            <li>A good product, well made, but it would be so much better if it had a curved handle.</li>
            <li>After much research, I chose this brush and I am very happy about it.</li>
            <li>I would have liked it sealed.</li>
            <li>Perfect bristles stiffness - not hard on the skin.  </li>
            <li>Great product and quick ship.  </li>
            <li>The wood handle is a good weight and easy to hold.</li>
            <li>I thought spending more for a better, &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product was a good idea</li>
            <li>Excellent brush so far.</li>
            <li>So far  6 months into and its awesome.</li>
            <li>it is great, well worth the money</li>
            <li>This is by far the BEST bath brush I have EVER owned.</li>
            <li>The wood, in which the handle is formed is a GOOD length and smooth in the hand.</li>
            <li>- perfect amount, not too soft</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always nice to get the most out of your money.</li>
            <li>Beautifully made, very nice wood and handle design, and now a part of every shower for my always-itchy back.</li>
            <li>The length is great, the bristles are just right</li>
            <li>Just go easy when you start!</li>
            <li>The bristles feel good, they clean well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very nice brush with the boar bristles right in the wood, not in plastic.  </li>
            <li>Well Made, all one piece which is very important.</li>
            <li>Nice strong handle on this - unless it gets used like a baseball bat, I don&#x27;t see this breaking.</li>
            <li>Nice and long and feels great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that will change in the humid months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Best body back brush on the market</li>
            <li>The warm sun glared off its glossy surface and it was filled with crystal salt water carried by serfs in motif-ed urns from the Aegean beach below.</li>
            <li>And I would recommend this excellent back brush to any and all.</li>
            <li>And I would recommend this excellent back brush to any and all.</li>
            <li>so I might be in the market for a spare soon, :-)</li>
            <li>I was glad to find a brush that was all one piece of wood.</li>
            <li>Many have detachable brushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s just a matter of time before the brush is unusable.</li>
            <li>love the bristles on the brush, love the length, but the handle design needs to be changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love being able to reach my backside while showering.</li>
            <li>The workmanship is outstanding.</li>
            <li>Even though it costs a bit more than plastic ones...</li>
            <li>just touching it</li>
            <li>Hopefully the bristles will soften up with more usage.</li>
            <li>I have bought many brushes on line and in retail stores and</li>
            <li>this by far is the best quality and the longest handle available.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this bath brush, and I believe you will too.</li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping &amp; brush does a great job.</li>
            <li>.. Everyone should have this in their bathroom, don&#x27;t forget  to someone you love as a gift.</li>
            <li>I love this German quality excellent product!</li>

            <li>Excellent back brush!  </li>
            <li>Love the wood handle.</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact I bought one of much better quality for $5 from TJ Maxx.</li>
            <li>I love this -</li>
            <li>The handle length is perfect for letting me reach everywhere on my back.</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>Needs more protection on the wood to keep it from discoloring</li>
            <li>I bought this lovely 19.7 in.</li>
            <li>It has the longest handle I have been able to find.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t love it more.</li>
            <li>I love it...been using it over 6 months.  </li>
            <li>Best back brush</li>
            <li>love it.  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>The Burstenhaus Redecker Beechwood is perfect with the long handle......</li>
            <li>first I loved this brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Handle is long - perfect for tall people.</li>
            <li>But let me assure you, its worth EVERY penny!!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s been over a year now, and the new brush has held up great.  </li>
            <li>After many uses the smell is still there and just as strong.</li>
            <li>The bristles are much more comfortable than the plastic bristles on most brushes</li>
            <li>Being single this is a wonderful product</li>
            <li>Like the feeling of being truly clean when done in the shower!  </li>
            <li>Best way to clean your back.</li>
            <li>Overall, the quality is very good.</li>
            <li>Happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>Longer length makes this great for my 85 year old Mom to reach her feet in the shower.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice long handle, is well made and does a great job.</li>
            <li>have to say I am very unlucky after I read all those good reviews.</li>
            <li>Decided to upgrade and I am delighted with the whole brush.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are nice and soft, but not too soft - perfect.  </li>
            <li>I did a lot of research on many brushes before buying this one, and am not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Strong handle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m limiting it to a couple of showers per week and that seems fine.  </li>
            <li>If you have a normal-sized shower it should be fine.</li>
            <li>This is working fine for me.</li>
            <li>The suction is great and the attachments OK, they tend to work loose.</li>
            <li>excellent; even though I would have preferred with a little curved.</li>
            <li>The little twine loop on the end is perfect for hanging it in the shower to drip out when done.</li>
            <li>Very nice quality, bristles just right, nice long handle.</li>
            <li>my own personal use, at best it&#x27;s a back scratcher, but that&#x27;s not why I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>It is indeed a rare and satisfying buying experience.s rinsed from my cleaning skin.</li>
            <li>It is indeed a rare and satisfying buying experience.</li>
            <li>I found out the Kent brush was no longer available.</li>
            <li>Since the Kent brush would have received Five Stars and the cheap brush One Star</li>
            <li>The perfect combination of firm with softness.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great back scrubbing brush because it has a 9.5in.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a truly great shower brush look no further - this is it!</li>
            <li>Its contour makes for a comfortable fit and feel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use the cheap $5 nylon shower puffs on a stick from Walmart.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable to handle.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Great back brush to wash</li>
            <li>If they were available, I&#x27;d buy the Sauna Brush, the Massage Brush, and 2-3 hairbrushes at a minimum.</li>
            <li>This is a great back brush.  </li>
            <li>yes this is a great bathroom item for washing your back...</li>
            <li>I liked this brush so much  </li>

            <li>Very nice overall.</li>
            <li>Wonderful long handle and very sturdy construction.</li>

            <li>If you shower with this brush, you will be clean.  </li>

            <li>In my opinion, they are JUST RIGHT!</li>
            <li>Just Right!  </li>
            <li>I opened my eyes and my back was clean in the shower, and my skin felt good.</li>
            <li>I opened my eyes and my back was clean in the shower, and my skin felt good.</li>
            <li>would be better if the wood was finished and not raw, but the bristles are nice and worrks really well.</li>
            <li>The wooden handle feels good</li>
            <li>Most folks wouldn&#x27;t give a bath brush much thought...</li>
            <li>just can&#x27;t say enough good thing about this brush</li>
            <li>I would recommend a purchase if you need a good back brush.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and the brush is a nice length.</li>
            <li>Not bad for almost two years of use.</li>
            <li>The wood is smooth and feels great before using, but once exposed to water and drying it has a little fuzzy texture.</li>
            <li>If you find such a product, be sure to examine the angle of the head to the shank to be sure they thought-it-thru.</li>
            <li>the whole brush is one piece; the brush head can&#x27;t fly off just when you start scrubbing your back (grr).&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>/mildew so quickly.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t expect it to break or wear out quickly,</li>
            <li>Delivered quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li>well I would have liked it better if the head was slightly angled  as it is straight and would contact the back at a a more comfortable and effective angle.</li>
            <li>The bristles are just the right stiffness and does a good job of scrubbing my back.</li>
            <li>Kind of \\&quot;medium\\&quot; stiff, which gives a NICE stimulating scrub to the skin, without over-scratching.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little ruff at first, but other wise great!</li>
            <li>It feels good on my skin, wish I had known about this one long ago.</li>
            <li>handle is very long and made from good quality wood.</li>
            <li>When I brush the brush, lol, the black spots do disappear, so I think it is mold.</li>
            <li>I love bore brissle brushes, of any type, (have one finger brush, a hair brush and now this back brush) and its the real thing, for the price I would have anticipated a slightly better finish on the wooden portion, but its wood alright, and the bristles feel exquisite on my back.</li>
            <li>This brush is good - made of one single piece of wood; hopefully it won&#x27;t break where the brush joins the handle.</li>
            <li>received within the last couple of days, but I love it!</li>
            <li>I looked and looked for a good strong quality bath brush that didn&#x27;t feel harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li>The top end couldn&#x27;t dry and I saw more wood discoloration showing up.</li>
            <li>I use this for dry body brushing to stimulate lymph fluid movement and it feels awesome!</li>
            <li>It really is quite a fine brush and accounts of its manly bristles being somewhat firmer than the norm are accurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really is quite a fine brush and accounts of its manly bristles being somewhat firmer than the norm are accurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The one I have still works fine holding up very well.  </li>
            <li>Great Brush after a year is a little cracked still work</li>
            <li>Although it seems to be very high quality, I&#x27;ve got 3 huge gripes with this item.</li>
            <li>The touch of fresh air replaced the crust of soil and exertion.</li>
            <li>The touch of fresh air replaced the crust of soil and exertion.</li>
            <li>Worth the $.  </li>
            <li>I love this bath brush--it does not get too soft in the shower.</li>
            <li>I like the natural look of the brush, the length of the handle, the stiffness of the bristles -- I thought this was going to be one of those satisfying purchases where you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing as much fun as cleaning bristles from your shower drain, now is there?  </li>
            <li>In about a year most of the bristles had fallen out of my old $12 brush</li>
            <li>It is worth the price.  </li>
            <li>I bought two already, and I will most likely buy two more soon, just to be sure I have one, for as long as I [hope] to be \\&quot;around\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>It is extremely well-made with bristles that feel good against your skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the right bristle strength and right length.</li>
            <li>The Bürstenhaus brush has bristles that have just the right stiffness to do their job without being bothersome.  </li>
            <li>Right now, I lean it in the corner.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and the bristle stiffness is just right.</li>
            <li>Just right for the shower.</li>
            <li>the right length and stiffness of bristles.</li>
            <li>I had rotator cuff surgery on my right arm,(my dominant side).</li>
            <li>Bristles have just the right stiffness.  </li>
            <li>just right.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are just right</li>
            <li>The bristles are just right.</li>
            <li>It would be nice to have a slight curve to the brush/handle, but it still does a fine job.</li>
            <li>The brush is very dense and the handle good and long.</li>
            <li>Have to admit this is a fantastic brush sturdy handle and soft yet firm bristles gets alot of use and the bristles are still great.</li>
            <li>Even if your gripping hand has some soap on it your grip on the beechwood handle is still far better than it would be on a plastic handle under the same conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>has a nice long reach.  </li>
            <li>It does have a long handle which is nice for reaching one&#x27;s lower back.&lt;br</li>
            <li>one has a nice, long handle.</li>
            <li>Nice long handle.  </li>
            <li>Nice long handle</li>
            <li>The bristles are a good balance for me of aggressive enough to feel like it&#x27;s working, but not uncomfortably stiff or prickly.</li>
            <li>and I have sensitive skin that reddens and scratches easily.</li>
            <li>First off the brush density is apparent much more the cheaper ones .</li>
            <li>Strong with natural bristles.  </li>
            <li>The extra length in the handle makes it great to reach ALL my back.</li>
            <li>High quality and cool backstory.</li>
            <li>Would be perfect if handle had a little bend in it to make it easier to reach your whole back.</li>
            <li>Most of the others we&#x27;ve had have been quite coarse.  </li>
            <li>Then I purchased this brush based primarily on reviews saying the bristles were soft.</li>
            <li>Been looking for a brush that would last for more than 5 showers.</li>
            <li>I waited almost four months to give a review just to make sure it would last.  </li>
            <li>i would give it higher marks if the handle were curved to wash back area better.  </li>
            <li>it exists and doesn&#x27;t break during the first use... etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll just know better and buy several at a time</li>
            <li>Never going back to using cheap scrubbers again!</li>
            <li>They are medium-stiff, which is exactly what we wanted.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really helped him with his backne!</li>
            <li>Of course this is much better quality, the comparison is only to the firmness of the bristle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but it would be much better if the head had an angle to it to make it easier to reach your back.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more in a back brush.</li>
            <li>Took my first shower with it this morning and it met all my expectations.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m 6&#x27;1&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>Just exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made to last, for sure.</li>
            <li>However, upon first use, the bristles began to smell.</li>
            <li>My favorite feature of this brush, is it is a solid piece and doesn&#x27;t come apart, or break.  </li>
            <li>Strong, looks nice, brish is not so hard, gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Pretty much &#x27;just right&#x27; for the job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t retain soap very long to scrub the whole body and the bristles, in my own opinion, are too stiff.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>Very well made, just the right amount of stiffness.</li>
            <li>I purchased it after buying three others on Amazon from other manufacturers in an effort to replace one I&#x27;ve had and liked a lot.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great pity that the only one we can buy in this country is this bath brush.</li>
            <li>I had to replace my old back brush and quickly discovered that these days, most use a glue for the bristles which dissolves in a humid environment like a shower.  </li>
            <li>Its a beautiful simple design, is long enough, and the bristles are firm, yet feel great on your skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind paying a bit extra for good quality but definitely</li>
            <li>Great bristles - not too stiff or too soft.  </li>
            <li>I bought this brush based on the positive reviews here.</li>
            <li>just right, particularly if you&#x27;re shoulder</li>
            <li>The bristles are just the right stiffness, and I&#x27;m hanging it out of the main stream of water, so the wood won&#x27;t discolor as rapidly as it might.  </li>
            <li>A precious sliver of warmth, fresh breeze and golden sunlight filters through green trees.</li>
            <li>I love the brush part of this long handled brush.  </li>
            <li>I was becoming clean… finally, clean…</li>
            <li>I was becoming clean… finally, clean…</li>
            <li>First it&#x27;s too straight.</li>
            <li>Brush feels great - just right - not too hard &amp; not too soft.</li>
            <li>It definitely feels wonderful on my back as well as other areas.</li>
            <li>The bristles are about what I&#x27;d want them to be - make sure you dry it between uses.  </li>
            <li>I love the long handle; very ergonomic.</li>
            <li>- she tried the plastic kinds, but they were either too short or the heads would detach too easily.</li>
            <li>This is the first brush I could say that about since my late, beloved Bath &amp; Body Works brush died three years ago (after a six-year run).</li>
            <li>I bought a brush from a large national chain which was inexpensive.</li>
            <li>It has plenty of reach but because its straight as an arrow it doesn&#x27;t make positive contact with everywhere I need to scrub.</li>
            <li>This one is just right (FYI, I have pretty sensitive skin and these bristles do not hurt at all).  </li>
            <li>I have used plenty of cheap ones before but for a little extra money you get something that is A LOT better!</li>
            <li>Damn fine back scrubber!</li>
            <li>This is one fine brush and should last quite some time</li>
            <li>&amp; it&#x27;s made out of very high quality wood by artisans in Germany.</li>
            <li>very high quality indeed.</li>
            <li>This brush does the trick, reaches those hard to get spots and leaves the skin feeling good when finished.  </li>
            <li>and I really like the fact that it is made of wood.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a brush to wash and scrub whole body.</li>
            <li>Golden hair, lilted by the soft Aegean breeze in the afternoon sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Holds up really well to lots of use.  </li>
            <li>I really like this brush.  </li>
            <li>I really like this bath brush.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and it&#x27;s vendor!  </li>
            <li>Really like this brush.  </li>
            <li>so this really helps.</li>
            <li>I have been using since June and see and feel a real difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>However it is very well made.  </li>
            <li>When I viewed this brush online, I noticed the straight handle . . .</li>
            <li>Very well constructed brush.</li>
            <li>I really like this &amp;#34;Back Scrubber&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It is made very well used it for about a month now</li>
            <li>Seems to be holding up very well.</li>
            <li>I really like this bath brush.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy construction and the longest handle I have found in a bath brush.  </li>
            <li>Should be safe enough for sensitive skin, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nicely weighted but not too heavy.</li>
            <li>a little stiff, but good!!!</li>
            <li>I was looking for brushes that last a long time and don&#x27;t break in half and this brush is perfect.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!  </li>
            <li>Bristles are right for me (not to soft).</li>
            <li>All I hoped for: strong, long manageable.  </li>
            <li>Reasons why this brush is better than other shower brushes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I took the advice of other reviewers and made sure to hang it up.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still giving it 5 stars because I&#x27;m pretty sure no back brush would work for him until he is finished with physical therapy.</li>
            <li>I have this companys other brushes and will just say these people know how to make brushes and top quality ones at that.</li>
            <li>The bristles are super firm, but still soft enough to work up a good lather.</li>
            <li>The bristles are a perfect strength, not too soft or hard, and the handle is a nice enough length to get to those hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li>Now I can appropriately clean my back.</li>
            <li>It apparently has an overheating problem that neither the manufacturer nor Fuller Brush, in this case are willing to reveal, some people will do anything for a buck!</li>
            <li>It is made of high quality solid wood and has a really nice long handle.</li>
            <li>The long handle is the perfect length for reaching those parts of your back that are hard to reach comfortably with a regular brush.  </li>
            <li>Handle is natural, very smooth and doesn&#x27;t slip when wet.</li>
            <li>This seems to be the only authentic, high-quality, stiff boar bristle brush available here.</li>
            <li>I was standing, naked, in a huge porcelain pool in an arbor near an olive grove.</li>
            <li>The wood is comfortable in your hand and is dry and treated.</li>
            <li>My mom loves it, I gave it to her as part of her mothers day gift, being older</li>
            <li>That is my only complaint, otherwise it&#x27;s a great brush.</li>
            <li>: Don&#x27;t buy a back scrubber, get this you will thank me later :)</li>
            <li>They washed the rime of exertion and toil from my skin, the one brushing vigorously on my back with The Brush, not only to clean it, but also to bring fresh blood to the surface in a blush of new vitality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Light suds rinsed from my cleaning skin.</li>
            <li>I purchased on belief of the high reviews and hope.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this</li>
            <li>This Bath Brush is HIGH</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>High quality brush.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t last very long but deliver a good scrub that doesn&#x27;t hurt and I can reach all of my back and side parts with them.</li>
            <li>I decided to spend a little more and get this from Germany.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s a great brush and its long handle reaches my back with ease.</li>
            <li>bought this back brush after feeling grubby and having access to a rare $50 of discretionary income.</li>
            <li>have used the brush for a few showers and enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>I have started to &#x27;dry brush&#x27; and was using a shorter handled brush (also purchased on Amazon) but wasn&#x27;t able to access the back of me.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are just the right stiffness for daily use, and seem to be holding up well.</li>
            <li>and personally I think they have the comfort just right with</li>
            <li>Beautifully made, the way the bristles are placed into the wood it does not look like they will ever separate as some reviewers have complained about in other brands.</li>
            <li>The bristles on this brush are stiff enough for a good scrub but not so much they will turn your skin cherry red.  </li>
            <li>Time for a new one.</li>
            <li>manufacturer contacted me and offered a new brush.  </li>
            <li>This one still looks new.  </li>
            <li>My wife, who is pregnant, has really dry skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well made, so if you are looking for a very soft brush, you will like it.  </li>
            <li>and this brush is soft enough to really do such a fine job I rounded off the end of the handle drilled a 3/8 chamfered hole in  it and used the rope it came with and can now also hang it up in the shower.</li>
            <li>Most brush bristles are either way too stiff, or way too soft.  </li>
            <li>I hung it up to the towel bar with enough space around it for ventilation, at first I thought it was water mark</li>
            <li>Soft bristles!</li>
            <li>Unlike brushes with plastic handles, your grip actually gets better when your hands and/or the handle get wet!  </li>
            <li>The bristles are not hard but not to soft.</li>
            <li>The bristles are firm enough to give a good scrub, yet soft enough they don&#x27;t rub off the hide.</li>
            <li>I decided to purchased a new brush in case it became completely unglued.</li>
            <li>Sturdy, long, just right on the stiffness.</li>
            <li>The bristles on the brush are soft enough so that they don&#x27;t scratch, and stiff enough that they give the skin a good scrub.</li>
            <li>The long handle is nice, but a bit heavy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just over that threshold of feeling just a little scratchy for a moment until you get going, and then it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>All in all this is one fine brush and while it is a little pricey</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with this item I ordered a second one for my other bathroom!</li>
            <li>Had a Kent brush for many tears, but left it behind in a hotel.&lt;br /&gt;While Kent brushes are excellent, they are expensive and don&#x27;t have a full, or long enough handle.</li>
            <li>Long handle, soft but sturdy bristles and just the right shape to get where you can not.  </li>
            <li>Also, the middle of the bristles on the brush are slightly elevated for better skin to brush contact.</li>
            <li>(I keep hitting the shower wall), but is an improvement over the previous brush in reach for back scrubbing.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, well pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>And the hanging loop is just the right size for hanging on the shower head to dry.  </li>
            <li>If you want a strong stiff one, get this.</li>
            <li>I love it, gets to those hard to reach places.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very firm, but all the better to get clean, in my humble opinion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She did not walk; she seemed to levitate, up from the sea toward my clear pool, now murky with the lost filth of my exertions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never</li>
            <li>/&gt;She did not walk; she seemed to levitate, up from the sea toward my clear pool, now murky with the lost filth of my exertions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never</li>
            <li>The extra length handle is great, as I am unable to fully stretch my arm(s)</li>
            <li>the bristles are too soft and the handle is not curved.  </li>
            <li>Not as soft as i was expecting</li>
            <li>But, that straight shank just doesn&#x27;t make washing the back intuitive.</li>
            <li>There we swam in the rapture of youth, unburdened by gravity or age or duty, until our union was complete- there in the sun and sea and serenity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There we swam in the rapture of youth, unburdened by gravity or age or duty, until our union was complete- there in the sun and sea and serenity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Received the product and had a crack in it near the brush.</li>
            <li>I always leave it standing or hanging after using it, so it will naturally drain off water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Having it made of wood and natural bristles somehow reminds me that not everything needs to be plastic.</li>
            <li>If you want a soft brush, buy Swissco.</li>
            <li>I was concerned that the bristles would be too soft, but they are not.  </li>
            <li>so I did my whole back...</li>
            <li>I received this brush and could not wait to feel those soft bristled on my skin.</li>
            <li>and they aren&#x27;t so soft</li>
            <li>No probs so far</li>
            <li>but the bristles are too soft for me.</li>
            <li>It you like soft bristles</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s by far the longest (one of my criteria)</li>
            <li>Unlike some others I&#x27;d tried, it&#x27;s very well-made from a solid piece of wood.</li>
            <li>Works very well; would recommend for a standard bath/shower brush.</li>
            <li>The bristles feel soft when you run your finger across them</li>
            <li>Spend the extra money and get a real quality brush.  </li>
            <li>- the bristles are not too soft, nor are they abrasive.</li>
            <li>The handle is solid and this brush is really well made.  </li>
            <li>because we have a very compact shower, but that wouldn&#x27;t make me purchase one with a smaller handle after owning this one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned so far.  </li>
            <li>I like the natural finished wood.  </li>
            <li>Had to replace my old one.  </li>
            <li>Then using a soft rags I buffed it up like you do shoes.</li>
            <li>More expensive than some others out there, but worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It is worth the money spent.</li>
            <li>Should last for years, with sturdy handle and a nice thick head of bristles.</li>
            <li>The wooden handle is extra long, so it&#x27;s great for reaching down you back.  </li>
            <li>The long handle makes it easy to cover your entire back</li>
            <li>Super for a back scratcher on dry skin as well.</li>
            <li>It has a long handle which is great because my previous brushes weren&#x27;t long enough to reach all parts of my back.</li>
            <li>The materials feel better than any of the dozens of cheaper back scrubbers I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend this back scrubbing brush to anyone who uses products like this.</li>
            <li>well balanced, the bristles are both smooth but firm enough to really scrub your back.</li>
            <li>The bristles are just right and the handle is long enough for me.  </li>
            <li>Not losing any bristles, not too harsh, just right!</li>
            <li>My new bath brush works very well to reach the middle of my back where my joint pain and general stiffness no longer allow me to scrub without one.</li>
            <li>And if you are tall or big, the long handle makes reaching your entire back easy.  </li>
            <li>My husband wanted a back brush with an extra long handle and extra strong bristles.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried bleach and leaving it in a sunny window but that didn&#x27;t help much or for long.  </li>
            <li>Minor irritation really, but caused me to discontinue use.</li>
            <li>I bought this brush despite the higher price because I wanted natural bristles and wood and the extra long handle.  </li>
            <li>The bristles feel great; as mentioned by other reviews, people have different preferences on firmness and roughness, but I think this brush is moderately firm and not too rough</li>
            <li>Mildews after a week even when carefully dried, otherwise not bad if you don&#x27;t mind scrubbing your skin in that proximity to mold.</li>
            <li>It is made from a single piece of wood, not too heavy,bristles just right and hangs conveniently next to my shower.</li>
            <li>If you have a large shower or bath, this would be the ultimate luxury brush, even if it is just simple, unfinished wood.</li>
            <li>The bristles feel somewhat soft but they are densely packed and therefore firm and just right for folks who don&#x27;t like soft brushes.</li>
            <li>bristles not as hard as expected or would have liked</li>
            <li>Very high quality basic back brush.  </li>
            <li>When I bought my new toaster, I also bought this back brush.</li>
            <li>These factors, combined with the shrewd deal I negotiated on my new toaster, paved the way for the The Back Brush.</li>
            <li>water, liquid soap- the cheapest I could find, and my new brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I lathered it up and switched grip to scrub my back, closing my eyes like a contented cat.</li>
            <li>And in its newly cleaned wake, it left the tender skin of my youth.</li>
            <li>And in its newly cleaned wake, it left the tender skin of my youth.</li>
            <li>I have used it for 3 months on a daily basis and it is still like new.</li>
            <li>Need a new back brush.</li>
            <li>The bathroom doesn&#x27;t have much airflow and its still dry every night, I don&#x27;t expect it to get any mold issues.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s a big guy, and with this brush can now reach his whole back.</li>
            <li>I am 6&#x27;3&amp;#34; so I&#x27;ve got a lot of real estate I can&#x27;t reach with a standard length back scrubber without disconnecting my shoulder.</li>
            <li>Finally--a back brush with a long handle that won&#x27;t fall apart or get mushy bristles in the first year.</li>
            <li>The right size, a little scratchy but not harsh.</li>
            <li>Although this was priced considerably higher than some of the other bath brushes on Amazon, I purchased this after reading , reviews.  </li>
            <li>My wife has a larger machine, by a different company, of the exact same design.</li>
            <li>The brush comes off hard at first, but after a few times and adjusting the pressure I apply, there are no issues, hands down a good brush for the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a simple, very well made product that&#x27;s worth the extra few bucks.</li>
            <li>However, the bristles are embedded right into the wood unlike my previous brush which had a plastic plate that held the bristles and it eventually fell off, hence my purchase of this brush.</li>
            <li>The solid beechwood handle is just the right length and is extremely durable.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never seen or felt &amp;#34;natural Boar bristles&amp;#34; as soft as these, but I love the long bath brush handle that reaches into those hard to reach places on my back.  </li>
            <li>These were generally used as lint brushes - not to brush your hair or anything.  </li>
            <li>also my wife (who suffers from allergy rashing on her back) keeps stealing it from me for her own use!</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really yield info on the durability of the wood or the bristles, but it looks and feels as though the brush will last a long time.</li>
            <li>How much can you say about a shower brush....maybe not much, but this one has hit the spot.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are very sturdy, but not too rough.  </li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t be sorry, it&#x27;s well worth the price for real wood and real hog bristles.</li>
            <li>As it replaced an old brush I found it a trifle harsh at first</li>
            <li>Expensive, but really nice quality.</li>
            <li>, it was very dry in the house(I used to live in a city with humid sub-tropical climate and I had experience with mold developed on wood).</li>
            <li>Proper care is simply rinsing it well with hot water, shaking out the excess water and hanging it to dry.  </li>
            <li>and also it is a problem if it can&#x27;t dry normally.</li>
            <li>the wooden handle is wide and very grippable even when wet - so much stronger than a plastic</li>
            <li>Redecker brush is obviously very well put together, and I fully expect it to last a very long time with proper care.  </li>
            <li>My thanks go out to the numb skull mass marketers, none of whom were able to provide me a lifetime supply of their inferior product.</li>
            <li>The ones that look soft, often have bristles so rough they practically flay you alive.</li>
            <li>There are sooo many poor quality back brushes on the market.</li>
            <li>when held under hot water and rubbed with your hand, the bristles can be softened up a little more.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li>and the bristles are not so harsh as to hurt, but they are just right for scrubbing with the shower running on my back.</li>
            <li>I was actually surprised how long the brush was in person.</li>
            <li>only downside is that it&#x27;s difficult to scratch your own back with.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not cheap, but it&#x27;s not outrageously expensive, either, and this seems to be a category where you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>It does seem to turn black in certain places on the brush.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t super hard to the point I feel like my skin is being irritated</li>
            <li>Pair this with the sugar scrubs that are offered here by the 3&#x27;s and your dry brushing followed by scrub experience is complete.</li>
            <li>I had a feeling it would be, because I noticed it was a GERMAN product, and in my years(50+), if there&#x27;s one thing I&#x27;ve noticed about GERMAN products, its the Germans generally don&#x27;t \\&quot;compromise\\&quot; when they</li>
            <li>Too early to tell how long this will last, however I think the brushes will fall out before the handle breaks.  </li>
            <li>Long handle, large round brush with really soft bristles.</li>
            <li>They are soft enough to scratch your back but not tough enough to leave you raw afterward.</li>
            <li>We have purchased virtually every such brush available through local stores and they have all failed to live up to expectations.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are a little rough on my sensitive skin, and my liquid soap doesn&#x27;t lather up on it real well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s able to take the dead skin off, in or out of the shower, without be grating or having to push really hard.</li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY recommend this brush over ANYTHING I have seen yet&lt;br /&gt;from other sources!</li>

            <li> If you like a good vigorous scrub, you will love this one.</li>
            <li> A good product, well made, but it would be so much better if it had a curved handle.</li>
            <li> After much research, I chose this brush and I am very happy about it.</li>

            <li> Perfect bristles stiffness - not hard on the skin.  </li>
            <li> Great product and quick ship.  </li>
            <li> The wood handle is a good weight and easy to hold.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s always nice to get the most out of your money.</li>
            <li> Beautifully made, very nice wood and handle design, and now a part of every shower for my always-itchy back.</li>
            <li> The length is great, the bristles are just right</li>
            <li> Just go easy when you start!</li>
            <li> The bristles feel good, they clean well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very nice brush with the boar bristles right in the wood, not in plastic.  </li>
            <li> Well Made, all one piece which is very important.</li>
            <li> Nice strong handle on this - unless it gets used like a baseball bat, I don&#x27;t see this breaking.</li>
            <li> Nice and long and feels great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that will change in the humid months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Best body back brush on the market</li>
            <li> The warm sun glared off its glossy surface and it was filled with crystal salt water carried by serfs in motif-ed urns from the Aegean beach below.</li>
            <li> And I would recommend this excellent back brush to any and all.</li>
            <li> And I would recommend this excellent back brush to any and all.</li>
            <li> so I might be in the market for a spare soon, :-)</li>
            <li> I was glad to find a brush that was all one piece of wood.</li>
            <li> Many have detachable brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s just a matter of time before the brush is unusable.</li>
            <li> love the bristles on the brush, love the length, but the handle design needs to be changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love being able to reach my backside while showering.</li>
            <li> The workmanship is outstanding.</li>
            <li> Even though it costs a bit more than plastic ones...</li>
            <li> just touching it</li>
            <li> Hopefully the bristles will soften up with more usage.</li>
            <li> I have bought many brushes on line and in retail stores and</li>
            <li> this by far is the best quality and the longest handle available.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this bath brush, and I believe you will too.</li>
            <li> ok.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping &amp; brush does a great job.</li>
            <li> .. Everyone should have this in their bathroom, don&#x27;t forget  to someone you love as a gift.</li>
            <li> I love this German quality excellent product!</li>
            <li> but I LOVE the bristles....</li>
            <li> is just right&amp;#34; :)</li>
            <li> This is the perfect back brush.  </li>
            <li> I am not the most flexible of people</li>
            <li> Excellent back brush!  </li>
            <li> Love the wood handle.</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact I bought one of much better quality for $5 from TJ Maxx.</li>
            <li> I love this -</li>
            <li> The handle length is perfect for letting me reach everywhere on my back.</li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> Needs more protection on the wood to keep it from discoloring</li>
            <li> I bought this lovely 19.7 in.</li>
            <li> It has the longest handle I have been able to find.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t love it more.</li>
            <li> I love it...been using it over 6 months.  </li>
            <li> Best back brush</li>
            <li> love it.  </li>

            <li> I really love this brush</li>
            <li> its ok but not worht the price I paid for it</li>
            <li> Overall very happy</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> The Burstenhaus Redecker Beechwood is perfect with the long handle......</li>
            <li> first I loved this brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Handle is long - perfect for tall people.</li>
            <li> But let me assure you, its worth EVERY penny!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s been over a year now, and the new brush has held up great.  </li>
            <li> After many uses the smell is still there and just as strong.</li>
            <li> The bristles are much more comfortable than the plastic bristles on most brushes</li>
            <li> Being single this is a wonderful product</li>
            <li> Like the feeling of being truly clean when done in the shower!  </li>
            <li> Best way to clean your back.</li>
            <li> Overall, the quality is very good.</li>
            <li> Happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> Longer length makes this great for my 85 year old Mom to reach her feet in the shower.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice long handle, is well made and does a great job.</li>
            <li> have to say I am very unlucky after I read all those good reviews.</li>
            <li> Decided to upgrade and I am delighted with the whole brush.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are nice and soft, but not too soft - perfect.  </li>
            <li> I did a lot of research on many brushes before buying this one, and am not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Strong handle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m limiting it to a couple of showers per week and that seems fine.  </li>
            <li> If you have a normal-sized shower it should be fine.</li>
            <li> This is working fine for me.</li>
            <li> The suction is great and the attachments OK, they tend to work loose.</li>
            <li> excellent; even though I would have preferred with a little curved.</li>
            <li> The little twine loop on the end is perfect for hanging it in the shower to drip out when done.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality, bristles just right, nice long handle.</li>
            <li> my own personal use, at best it&#x27;s a back scratcher, but that&#x27;s not why I purchased it.  </li>
            <li> It is indeed a rare and satisfying buying experience.s rinsed from my cleaning skin.</li>
            <li> It is indeed a rare and satisfying buying experience.</li>
            <li> I found out the Kent brush was no longer available.</li>
            <li> Since the Kent brush would have received Five Stars and the cheap brush One Star</li>
            <li> The perfect combination of firm with softness.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a great back scrubbing brush because it has a 9.5in.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a truly great shower brush look no further - this is it!</li>
            <li> Its contour makes for a comfortable fit and feel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use the cheap $5 nylon shower puffs on a stick from Walmart.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable to handle.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Great back brush to wash</li>
            <li> If they were available, I&#x27;d buy the Sauna Brush, the Massage Brush, and 2-3 hairbrushes at a minimum.</li>
            <li> This is a great back brush.  </li>
            <li> yes this is a great bathroom item for washing your back...</li>
            <li> I liked this brush so much  </li>
            <li> Great for scrubbing back, but also for the bottom of your feet and lower legs.  </li>
            <li> Great product will definitely only buy from them again.</li>
            <li> All good so far, after a couple months of use.</li>
            <li> So far so good, Have been using this brush for about four months now.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> A Strong long handle with great massaging boar bristles.  </li>
            <li> Very nice overall.</li>
            <li> Wonderful long handle and very sturdy construction.</li>
            <li> If it had a slight curve it would be perfect, but it&#x27;s good enough.  </li>
            <li> Great long handle.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much that I bought one for my husband, and he likes his very much also!</li>
            <li> Worth the price!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this back scrubber.</li>
            <li> You are worth it!</li>
            <li> Love at first scrub.  </li>
            <li> The wood is very smooth and the brush is lovely just-firm-enough natural bristles.  </li>
            <li> is a great product and worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> If you shower with this brush, you will be clean.  </li>
            <li> So far, this is the best back brush I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> Dense bristles that clean while floating over the skin.  </li>
            <li> this one is just right!</li>
            <li> In my opinion, they are JUST RIGHT!</li>
            <li> Just Right!  </li>
            <li> I opened my eyes and my back was clean in the shower, and my skin felt good.</li>
            <li> I opened my eyes and my back was clean in the shower, and my skin felt good.</li>
            <li> would be better if the wood was finished and not raw, but the bristles are nice and worrks really well.</li>
            <li> The wooden handle feels good</li>
            <li> Most folks wouldn&#x27;t give a bath brush much thought...</li>
            <li> just can&#x27;t say enough good thing about this brush</li>
            <li> I would recommend a purchase if you need a good back brush.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and the brush is a nice length.</li>
            <li> Not bad for almost two years of use.</li>
            <li> The wood is smooth and feels great before using, but once exposed to water and drying it has a little fuzzy texture.</li>
            <li> If you find such a product, be sure to examine the angle of the head to the shank to be sure they thought-it-thru.</li>
            <li> the whole brush is one piece; the brush head can&#x27;t fly off just when you start scrubbing your back (grr).&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> /mildew so quickly.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect it to break or wear out quickly,</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li> well I would have liked it better if the head was slightly angled  as it is straight and would contact the back at a a more comfortable and effective angle.</li>
            <li> The bristles are just the right stiffness and does a good job of scrubbing my back.</li>
            <li> Kind of \\&quot;medium\\&quot; stiff, which gives a NICE stimulating scrub to the skin, without over-scratching.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little ruff at first, but other wise great!</li>
            <li> It feels good on my skin, wish I had known about this one long ago.</li>
            <li> handle is very long and made from good quality wood.</li>
            <li> When I brush the brush, lol, the black spots do disappear, so I think it is mold.</li>
            <li> I love bore brissle brushes, of any type, (have one finger brush, a hair brush and now this back brush) and its the real thing, for the price I would have anticipated a slightly better finish on the wooden portion, but its wood alright, and the bristles feel exquisite on my back.</li>
            <li> This brush is good - made of one single piece of wood; hopefully it won&#x27;t break where the brush joins the handle.</li>
            <li> received within the last couple of days, but I love it!</li>
            <li> I looked and looked for a good strong quality bath brush that didn&#x27;t feel harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> The top end couldn&#x27;t dry and I saw more wood discoloration showing up.</li>
            <li> I use this for dry body brushing to stimulate lymph fluid movement and it feels awesome!</li>
            <li> It really is quite a fine brush and accounts of its manly bristles being somewhat firmer than the norm are accurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really is quite a fine brush and accounts of its manly bristles being somewhat firmer than the norm are accurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The one I have still works fine holding up very well.  </li>
            <li> Great Brush after a year is a little cracked still work</li>
            <li> Although it seems to be very high quality, I&#x27;ve got 3 huge gripes with this item.</li>
            <li> The touch of fresh air replaced the crust of soil and exertion.</li>
            <li> The touch of fresh air replaced the crust of soil and exertion.</li>
            <li> Worth the $.  </li>
            <li> I love this bath brush--it does not get too soft in the shower.</li>
            <li> I like the natural look of the brush, the length of the handle, the stiffness of the bristles -- I thought this was going to be one of those satisfying purchases where you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing as much fun as cleaning bristles from your shower drain, now is there?  </li>
            <li> In about a year most of the bristles had fallen out of my old $12 brush</li>
            <li> It is worth the price.  </li>
            <li> I bought two already, and I will most likely buy two more soon, just to be sure I have one, for as long as I [hope] to be \\&quot;around\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> It is extremely well-made with bristles that feel good against your skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the right bristle strength and right length.</li>
            <li> The Bürstenhaus brush has bristles that have just the right stiffness to do their job without being bothersome.  </li>
            <li> Right now, I lean it in the corner.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and the bristle stiffness is just right.</li>
            <li> Just right for the shower.</li>
            <li> the right length and stiffness of bristles.</li>
            <li> I had rotator cuff surgery on my right arm,(my dominant side).</li>
            <li> Bristles have just the right stiffness.  </li>
            <li> just right.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are just right</li>
            <li> The bristles are just right.</li>
            <li> It would be nice to have a slight curve to the brush/handle, but it still does a fine job.</li>
            <li> The brush is very dense and the handle good and long.</li>
            <li> Have to admit this is a fantastic brush sturdy handle and soft yet firm bristles gets alot of use and the bristles are still great.</li>
            <li> Even if your gripping hand has some soap on it your grip on the beechwood handle is still far better than it would be on a plastic handle under the same conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> has a nice long reach.  </li>
            <li> It does have a long handle which is nice for reaching one&#x27;s lower back.&lt;br</li>
            <li> one has a nice, long handle.</li>
            <li> Nice long handle.  </li>
            <li> Nice long handle</li>
            <li> The bristles are a good balance for me of aggressive enough to feel like it&#x27;s working, but not uncomfortably stiff or prickly.</li>
            <li> and I have sensitive skin that reddens and scratches easily.</li>
            <li> First off the brush density is apparent much more the cheaper ones .</li>
            <li> Strong with natural bristles.  </li>
            <li> The extra length in the handle makes it great to reach ALL my back.</li>
            <li> High quality and cool backstory.</li>
            <li> Would be perfect if handle had a little bend in it to make it easier to reach your whole back.</li>
            <li> Most of the others we&#x27;ve had have been quite coarse.  </li>
            <li> Then I purchased this brush based primarily on reviews saying the bristles were soft.</li>
            <li> Been looking for a brush that would last for more than 5 showers.</li>
            <li> I waited almost four months to give a review just to make sure it would last.  </li>
            <li> i would give it higher marks if the handle were curved to wash back area better.  </li>
            <li> it exists and doesn&#x27;t break during the first use... etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just know better and buy several at a time</li>
            <li> Never going back to using cheap scrubbers again!</li>
            <li> They are medium-stiff, which is exactly what we wanted.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really helped him with his backne!</li>
            <li> Of course this is much better quality, the comparison is only to the firmness of the bristle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but it would be much better if the head had an angle to it to make it easier to reach your back.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more in a back brush.</li>
            <li> Took my first shower with it this morning and it met all my expectations.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m 6&#x27;1&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> Just exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made to last, for sure.</li>
            <li> However, upon first use, the bristles began to smell.</li>
            <li> My favorite feature of this brush, is it is a solid piece and doesn&#x27;t come apart, or break.  </li>
            <li> Strong, looks nice, brish is not so hard, gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Pretty much &#x27;just right&#x27; for the job.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t retain soap very long to scrub the whole body and the bristles, in my own opinion, are too stiff.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> Very well made, just the right amount of stiffness.</li>
            <li> I purchased it after buying three others on Amazon from other manufacturers in an effort to replace one I&#x27;ve had and liked a lot.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great pity that the only one we can buy in this country is this bath brush.</li>
            <li> I had to replace my old back brush and quickly discovered that these days, most use a glue for the bristles which dissolves in a humid environment like a shower.  </li>
            <li> Its a beautiful simple design, is long enough, and the bristles are firm, yet feel great on your skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind paying a bit extra for good quality but definitely</li>
            <li> Great bristles - not too stiff or too soft.  </li>
            <li> I bought this brush based on the positive reviews here.</li>
            <li> just right, particularly if you&#x27;re shoulder</li>
            <li> The bristles are just the right stiffness, and I&#x27;m hanging it out of the main stream of water, so the wood won&#x27;t discolor as rapidly as it might.  </li>
            <li> A precious sliver of warmth, fresh breeze and golden sunlight filters through green trees.</li>
            <li> I love the brush part of this long handled brush.  </li>
            <li> I was becoming clean… finally, clean…</li>
            <li> I was becoming clean… finally, clean…</li>
            <li> First it&#x27;s too straight.</li>
            <li> Brush feels great - just right - not too hard &amp; not too soft.</li>
            <li> It definitely feels wonderful on my back as well as other areas.</li>
            <li> The bristles are about what I&#x27;d want them to be - make sure you dry it between uses.  </li>
            <li> I love the long handle; very ergonomic.</li>
            <li> - she tried the plastic kinds, but they were either too short or the heads would detach too easily.</li>
            <li> This is the first brush I could say that about since my late, beloved Bath &amp; Body Works brush died three years ago (after a six-year run).</li>
            <li> I bought a brush from a large national chain which was inexpensive.</li>
            <li> It has plenty of reach but because its straight as an arrow it doesn&#x27;t make positive contact with everywhere I need to scrub.</li>
            <li> This one is just right (FYI, I have pretty sensitive skin and these bristles do not hurt at all).  </li>
            <li> I have used plenty of cheap ones before but for a little extra money you get something that is A LOT better!</li>
            <li> Damn fine back scrubber!</li>
            <li> This is one fine brush and should last quite some time</li>
            <li> &amp; it&#x27;s made out of very high quality wood by artisans in Germany.</li>
            <li> very high quality indeed.</li>
            <li> This brush does the trick, reaches those hard to get spots and leaves the skin feeling good when finished.  </li>
            <li> and I really like the fact that it is made of wood.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a brush to wash and scrub whole body.</li>
            <li> Golden hair, lilted by the soft Aegean breeze in the afternoon sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Holds up really well to lots of use.  </li>
            <li> I really like this brush.  </li>
            <li> I really like this bath brush.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and it&#x27;s vendor!  </li>
            <li> Really like this brush.  </li>
            <li> so this really helps.</li>
            <li> I have been using since June and see and feel a real difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> However it is very well made.  </li>
            <li> When I viewed this brush online, I noticed the straight handle . . .</li>
            <li> Very well constructed brush.</li>
            <li> I really like this &amp;#34;Back Scrubber&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It is made very well used it for about a month now</li>
            <li> Seems to be holding up very well.</li>
            <li> I really like this bath brush.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy construction and the longest handle I have found in a bath brush.  </li>
            <li> Should be safe enough for sensitive skin, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nicely weighted but not too heavy.</li>
            <li> a little stiff, but good!!!</li>
            <li> I was looking for brushes that last a long time and don&#x27;t break in half and this brush is perfect.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!  </li>
            <li> Bristles are right for me (not to soft).</li>
            <li> All I hoped for: strong, long manageable.  </li>
            <li> Reasons why this brush is better than other shower brushes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I took the advice of other reviewers and made sure to hang it up.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still giving it 5 stars because I&#x27;m pretty sure no back brush would work for him until he is finished with physical therapy.</li>
            <li> I have this companys other brushes and will just say these people know how to make brushes and top quality ones at that.</li>
            <li> The bristles are super firm, but still soft enough to work up a good lather.</li>
            <li> The bristles are a perfect strength, not too soft or hard, and the handle is a nice enough length to get to those hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> Now I can appropriately clean my back.</li>
            <li> It apparently has an overheating problem that neither the manufacturer nor Fuller Brush, in this case are willing to reveal, some people will do anything for a buck!</li>
            <li> It is made of high quality solid wood and has a really nice long handle.</li>
            <li> The long handle is the perfect length for reaching those parts of your back that are hard to reach comfortably with a regular brush.  </li>
            <li> Handle is natural, very smooth and doesn&#x27;t slip when wet.</li>
            <li> This seems to be the only authentic, high-quality, stiff boar bristle brush available here.</li>
            <li> I was standing, naked, in a huge porcelain pool in an arbor near an olive grove.</li>
            <li> The wood is comfortable in your hand and is dry and treated.</li>
            <li> My mom loves it, I gave it to her as part of her mothers day gift, being older</li>
            <li> That is my only complaint, otherwise it&#x27;s a great brush.</li>
            <li> : Don&#x27;t buy a back scrubber, get this you will thank me later :)</li>
            <li> They washed the rime of exertion and toil from my skin, the one brushing vigorously on my back with The Brush, not only to clean it, but also to bring fresh blood to the surface in a blush of new vitality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Light suds rinsed from my cleaning skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased on belief of the high reviews and hope.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this</li>
            <li> This Bath Brush is HIGH</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> High quality brush.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last very long but deliver a good scrub that doesn&#x27;t hurt and I can reach all of my back and side parts with them.</li>
            <li> I decided to spend a little more and get this from Germany.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s a great brush and its long handle reaches my back with ease.</li>
            <li> bought this back brush after feeling grubby and having access to a rare $50 of discretionary income.</li>
            <li> have used the brush for a few showers and enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> I have started to &#x27;dry brush&#x27; and was using a shorter handled brush (also purchased on Amazon) but wasn&#x27;t able to access the back of me.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are just the right stiffness for daily use, and seem to be holding up well.</li>
            <li> and personally I think they have the comfort just right with</li>
            <li> Beautifully made, the way the bristles are placed into the wood it does not look like they will ever separate as some reviewers have complained about in other brands.</li>
            <li> The bristles on this brush are stiff enough for a good scrub but not so much they will turn your skin cherry red.  </li>
            <li> Time for a new one.</li>
            <li> manufacturer contacted me and offered a new brush.  </li>
            <li> This one still looks new.  </li>
            <li> My wife, who is pregnant, has really dry skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well made, so if you are looking for a very soft brush, you will like it.  </li>
            <li> and this brush is soft enough to really do such a fine job I rounded off the end of the handle drilled a 3/8 chamfered hole in  it and used the rope it came with and can now also hang it up in the shower.</li>
            <li> Most brush bristles are either way too stiff, or way too soft.  </li>
            <li> I hung it up to the towel bar with enough space around it for ventilation, at first I thought it was water mark</li>
            <li> Soft bristles!</li>
            <li> Unlike brushes with plastic handles, your grip actually gets better when your hands and/or the handle get wet!  </li>
            <li> The bristles are not hard but not to soft.</li>
            <li> The bristles are firm enough to give a good scrub, yet soft enough they don&#x27;t rub off the hide.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchased a new brush in case it became completely unglued.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, long, just right on the stiffness.</li>
            <li> The bristles on the brush are soft enough so that they don&#x27;t scratch, and stiff enough that they give the skin a good scrub.</li>
            <li> The long handle is nice, but a bit heavy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just over that threshold of feeling just a little scratchy for a moment until you get going, and then it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> All in all this is one fine brush and while it is a little pricey</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this item I ordered a second one for my other bathroom!</li>
            <li> Had a Kent brush for many tears, but left it behind in a hotel.&lt;br /&gt;While Kent brushes are excellent, they are expensive and don&#x27;t have a full, or long enough handle.</li>
            <li> Long handle, soft but sturdy bristles and just the right shape to get where you can not.  </li>
            <li> Also, the middle of the bristles on the brush are slightly elevated for better skin to brush contact.</li>
            <li> (I keep hitting the shower wall), but is an improvement over the previous brush in reach for back scrubbing.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, well pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> And the hanging loop is just the right size for hanging on the shower head to dry.  </li>
            <li> If you want a strong stiff one, get this.</li>
            <li> I love it, gets to those hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very firm, but all the better to get clean, in my humble opinion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She did not walk; she seemed to levitate, up from the sea toward my clear pool, now murky with the lost filth of my exertions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never</li>
            <li> /&gt;She did not walk; she seemed to levitate, up from the sea toward my clear pool, now murky with the lost filth of my exertions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never</li>
            <li> The extra length handle is great, as I am unable to fully stretch my arm(s)</li>
            <li> the bristles are too soft and the handle is not curved.  </li>
            <li> Not as soft as i was expecting</li>
            <li> But, that straight shank just doesn&#x27;t make washing the back intuitive.</li>
            <li> There we swam in the rapture of youth, unburdened by gravity or age or duty, until our union was complete- there in the sun and sea and serenity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There we swam in the rapture of youth, unburdened by gravity or age or duty, until our union was complete- there in the sun and sea and serenity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Received the product and had a crack in it near the brush.</li>
            <li> I always leave it standing or hanging after using it, so it will naturally drain off water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Having it made of wood and natural bristles somehow reminds me that not everything needs to be plastic.</li>
            <li> If you want a soft brush, buy Swissco.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that the bristles would be too soft, but they are not.  </li>
            <li> so I did my whole back...</li>
            <li> I received this brush and could not wait to feel those soft bristled on my skin.</li>
            <li> and they aren&#x27;t so soft</li>
            <li> No probs so far</li>
            <li> but the bristles are too soft for me.</li>
            <li> It you like soft bristles</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s by far the longest (one of my criteria)</li>
            <li> Unlike some others I&#x27;d tried, it&#x27;s very well-made from a solid piece of wood.</li>
            <li> Works very well; would recommend for a standard bath/shower brush.</li>
            <li> The bristles feel soft when you run your finger across them</li>
            <li> Spend the extra money and get a real quality brush.  </li>
            <li> - the bristles are not too soft, nor are they abrasive.</li>
            <li> The handle is solid and this brush is really well made.  </li>
            <li> because we have a very compact shower, but that wouldn&#x27;t make me purchase one with a smaller handle after owning this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned so far.  </li>
            <li> I like the natural finished wood.  </li>
            <li> Had to replace my old one.  </li>
            <li> Then using a soft rags I buffed it up like you do shoes.</li>
            <li> More expensive than some others out there, but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It is worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> Should last for years, with sturdy handle and a nice thick head of bristles.</li>
            <li> The wooden handle is extra long, so it&#x27;s great for reaching down you back.  </li>
            <li> The long handle makes it easy to cover your entire back</li>
            <li> Super for a back scratcher on dry skin as well.</li>
            <li> It has a long handle which is great because my previous brushes weren&#x27;t long enough to reach all parts of my back.</li>
            <li> The materials feel better than any of the dozens of cheaper back scrubbers I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend this back scrubbing brush to anyone who uses products like this.</li>
            <li> well balanced, the bristles are both smooth but firm enough to really scrub your back.</li>
            <li> The bristles are just right and the handle is long enough for me.  </li>
            <li> Not losing any bristles, not too harsh, just right!</li>
            <li> My new bath brush works very well to reach the middle of my back where my joint pain and general stiffness no longer allow me to scrub without one.</li>
            <li> And if you are tall or big, the long handle makes reaching your entire back easy.  </li>
            <li> My husband wanted a back brush with an extra long handle and extra strong bristles.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried bleach and leaving it in a sunny window but that didn&#x27;t help much or for long.  </li>
            <li> Minor irritation really, but caused me to discontinue use.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush despite the higher price because I wanted natural bristles and wood and the extra long handle.  </li>
            <li> The bristles feel great; as mentioned by other reviews, people have different preferences on firmness and roughness, but I think this brush is moderately firm and not too rough</li>
            <li> Mildews after a week even when carefully dried, otherwise not bad if you don&#x27;t mind scrubbing your skin in that proximity to mold.</li>
            <li> It is made from a single piece of wood, not too heavy,bristles just right and hangs conveniently next to my shower.</li>
            <li> If you have a large shower or bath, this would be the ultimate luxury brush, even if it is just simple, unfinished wood.</li>
            <li> The bristles feel somewhat soft but they are densely packed and therefore firm and just right for folks who don&#x27;t like soft brushes.</li>
            <li> bristles not as hard as expected or would have liked</li>
            <li> Very high quality basic back brush.  </li>
            <li> When I bought my new toaster, I also bought this back brush.</li>
            <li> These factors, combined with the shrewd deal I negotiated on my new toaster, paved the way for the The Back Brush.</li>
            <li> water, liquid soap- the cheapest I could find, and my new brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I lathered it up and switched grip to scrub my back, closing my eyes like a contented cat.</li>
            <li> And in its newly cleaned wake, it left the tender skin of my youth.</li>
            <li> And in its newly cleaned wake, it left the tender skin of my youth.</li>
            <li> I have used it for 3 months on a daily basis and it is still like new.</li>
            <li> Need a new back brush.</li>
            <li> The bathroom doesn&#x27;t have much airflow and its still dry every night, I don&#x27;t expect it to get any mold issues.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s a big guy, and with this brush can now reach his whole back.</li>
            <li> I am 6&#x27;3&amp;#34; so I&#x27;ve got a lot of real estate I can&#x27;t reach with a standard length back scrubber without disconnecting my shoulder.</li>
            <li> Finally--a back brush with a long handle that won&#x27;t fall apart or get mushy bristles in the first year.</li>
            <li> The right size, a little scratchy but not harsh.</li>
            <li> Although this was priced considerably higher than some of the other bath brushes on Amazon, I purchased this after reading , reviews.  </li>
            <li> My wife has a larger machine, by a different company, of the exact same design.</li>
            <li> The brush comes off hard at first, but after a few times and adjusting the pressure I apply, there are no issues, hands down a good brush for the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a simple, very well made product that&#x27;s worth the extra few bucks.</li>
            <li> However, the bristles are embedded right into the wood unlike my previous brush which had a plastic plate that held the bristles and it eventually fell off, hence my purchase of this brush.</li>
            <li> The solid beechwood handle is just the right length and is extremely durable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen or felt &amp;#34;natural Boar bristles&amp;#34; as soft as these, but I love the long bath brush handle that reaches into those hard to reach places on my back.  </li>
            <li> These were generally used as lint brushes - not to brush your hair or anything.  </li>
            <li> also my wife (who suffers from allergy rashing on her back) keeps stealing it from me for her own use!</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really yield info on the durability of the wood or the bristles, but it looks and feels as though the brush will last a long time.</li>
            <li> How much can you say about a shower brush....maybe not much, but this one has hit the spot.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are very sturdy, but not too rough.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry, it&#x27;s well worth the price for real wood and real hog bristles.</li>
            <li> As it replaced an old brush I found it a trifle harsh at first</li>
            <li> Expensive, but really nice quality.</li>
            <li> , it was very dry in the house(I used to live in a city with humid sub-tropical climate and I had experience with mold developed on wood).</li>
            <li> Proper care is simply rinsing it well with hot water, shaking out the excess water and hanging it to dry.  </li>
            <li> and also it is a problem if it can&#x27;t dry normally.</li>
            <li> the wooden handle is wide and very grippable even when wet - so much stronger than a plastic</li>
            <li> Redecker brush is obviously very well put together, and I fully expect it to last a very long time with proper care.  </li>
            <li> My thanks go out to the numb skull mass marketers, none of whom were able to provide me a lifetime supply of their inferior product.</li>
            <li> The ones that look soft, often have bristles so rough they practically flay you alive.</li>
            <li> There are sooo many poor quality back brushes on the market.</li>
            <li> when held under hot water and rubbed with your hand, the bristles can be softened up a little more.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> and the bristles are not so harsh as to hurt, but they are just right for scrubbing with the shower running on my back.</li>
            <li> I was actually surprised how long the brush was in person.</li>
            <li> only downside is that it&#x27;s difficult to scratch your own back with.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap, but it&#x27;s not outrageously expensive, either, and this seems to be a category where you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> It does seem to turn black in certain places on the brush.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t super hard to the point I feel like my skin is being irritated</li>
            <li> Pair this with the sugar scrubs that are offered here by the 3&#x27;s and your dry brushing followed by scrub experience is complete.</li>
            <li> I had a feeling it would be, because I noticed it was a GERMAN product, and in my years(50+), if there&#x27;s one thing I&#x27;ve noticed about GERMAN products, its the Germans generally don&#x27;t \\&quot;compromise\\&quot; when they</li>
            <li> Too early to tell how long this will last, however I think the brushes will fall out before the handle breaks.  </li>
            <li> Long handle, large round brush with really soft bristles.</li>
            <li> They are soft enough to scratch your back but not tough enough to leave you raw afterward.</li>
            <li> We have purchased virtually every such brush available through local stores and they have all failed to live up to expectations.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are a little rough on my sensitive skin, and my liquid soap doesn&#x27;t lather up on it real well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s able to take the dead skin off, in or out of the shower, without be grating or having to push really hard.</li>
            <li> I would HIGHLY recommend this brush over ANYTHING I have seen yet&lt;br /&gt;from other sources!</li>
            <li> and yet they are comfortably soft for all other areas of the body up to and including my face and nose.</li>
            <li> The wooden handle is long enough for people to get a through back scrub.</li>
            <li> Because of the long handle it can be a little tough if  you have only a small shower space but all in all I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> High quality wooden handle, and short, stiff boar bristles.</li>
            <li> A long handle that allows you to brush your entire back without straining.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 5&#x27;10&amp;#34; guy and the long handle is helpful to reach the middle back.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s solid wood and long enough to reach everywhere.</li>
            <li> It is of high quality, both the wood and the bristles and the bristles are stiff enough to scrub without being too abrasive.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of the bristles, but the handle forces me to work hard to get to hard to reach parts of my back because it is not contoured.  </li>
            <li> I hang it in my shower to dry, towards the outside and leave the shower curtain pulled back to allow for ventilation.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical of a brush with a wood handle, thinking about how wood soaks up water, but for the brief use it gets, the water doesn&#x27;t seem to soak in much, and I hang it on the outside of the shower curtain when not in use to promote full drying of the wood and bristles.</li>
            <li> The handle is long enough for someone tall like me.</li>
            <li> It seems like this brush will last a LONG time, before you need to replace</li>
            <li> only the handle seems to be a bit long for me.</li>
            <li> Long lasting, quality made</li>
            <li> It should last a long time</li>
            <li> I expect it to last a long time.</li>
            <li> and it isn&#x27;t long enough for me</li>
            <li> Not clear yet if it&#x27;s actually rotting out, or just discolored.</li>
            <li> Long wooden handle means you don&#x27;t have to bend down so far.  </li>
            <li> only comment that isn&#x27;t 100% positive is that if you have a very small shower area with solid doors, the handle might be TOO long.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it quickly began to discolor at the (brush-end) tip, which hangs down as it drains.</li>
            <li> Simply rinse it well after use and let it dry.</li>
            <li> The brush is a little rough at first, but once you get it wet and soaped up, it softens.</li>
            <li> Plus the bristles are not too soft and definitely not too stiff.  </li>
            <li> We descended, Jan and I, down to the clear Aegean, across the worm, white sand, and into the water- greeting by fluorescent fishes with wide eyes.</li>
            <li> We descended, Jan and I, down to the clear Aegean, across the worm, white sand, and into the water- greeting by fluorescent fishes with wide eyes.</li>
            <li> I ONLY use it for back washes, so maybe it has lots of other uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush is firm but not stiff  </li>
            <li> But for me the handle is way too long.  </li>
            <li> My husband wanted a well-made, long handled bath brush for use in the shower.  </li>
            <li> The handle is long and allows me to reach all areas.</li>
            <li> long handle</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well made and the long handle is a plus.</li>
            <li> the bristles are midway between soft and harsh; this brush is exfoliating, but it&#x27;s not a Silkwood shower.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> The Bristles, are not too soft, not too firm.</li>
            <li> The bristles are not soft at all.</li>
            <li> This is really strange, I couldn&#x27;t understand what it was?</li>
            <li> Long washcloth just didn&#x27;t do the job.  </li>
            <li> The one nitpick I have is that the finish is not apparently completely waterproof, thus my 4 star rating rather than 5.</li>
            <li> The bristles are firm but soft and don&#x27;t fall out of the brush at all.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s made by what is probably the last brushmaker in the world making a wide assortment of brushes in the old-fashioned handcrafted manner.</li>
            <li> Minus 1 star for bristle softness - if you want a BRISK back scrub this is not your brush.</li>
            <li> but I still like this brush and will use it for a long time.</li>
            <li> The long handle makes showering while asleep makes it a must</li>
            <li> Used daily and no real signs of wear.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after about a week of use, hanging it in my shower from the cord attached through a hole in the handle, it began to develop a dark discoloration at the bottom and at the top curved part of the brush that I&#x27;m guessing is ... mold??</li>
            <li> They were pale and young and firm, unblemished by the rigors of age and time.</li>
            <li> Long reach, sturdy and brushed tight enough that soap does not fall through the brushes.  </li>
            <li> Longer handle than other similar products.</li>
            <li> It hurts my back a little but not enough to not use it.</li>
            <li> fully with other type brushes to scrub my back.</li>
            <li> I bought it before checking prices at Marshalls/TJ Maxx or other discount retailers and they are all around $5 for the same brush.</li>
            <li> In our dry winter weather the bristles and wood dry thoroughly every day.  </li>
            <li> I hang it by the string to let it dry between uses.</li>
            <li> I hang it to dry after each shower.</li>
            <li> and maybe I overdid it, but my back broke out in an itchy rash after a few nights of shower and back scrub.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are a little on the short side, and for my taste a little too soft.</li>
            <li> The handle is long enough to use it on my back, but in a small shower enclosure, it can be too long to use it on the rest of my body.  </li>
            <li> I have limited shower space</li>
            <li> No more adult acne.</li>
            <li> The bristles are just firm enough without being so firm that they hurt sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li> Not bad but expensive</li>
            <li> They would either gradually loose all of their bristles or just break at the handle area.  </li>
            <li> The ones that have bristles attached to a plastic disc that has been nailed on with tacks can come loose and fall off.</li>
            <li> While better than my disastrous brush they are not nearly as soft as the Kent brush.</li>
            <li> But could not get past the fact that my skin was itching and getting tiny red spots where I used it.</li>
            <li> but the humid environment made the wooden part turned black.  </li>
            <li> While the bristles are actually very soft, they are thickly spaced and stand up to his vigorous scrubbing.  </li>
            <li> The handle is plenty long enough to reach all the way down to the small of the back.  </li>
            <li> The string loop for hanging it was a little short</li>
            <li> I like to do spray tans when I need a little color, and exfoliation is key to not looking like a splotchy Oompa Loompa.  </li>
            <li> He is very particular about back brushes and has an extremely difficult time finding one he likes.  </li>
            <li> A little rough until the bristles are used several times.  </li>
            <li> but it had been over a day and the other part of the wood was totally dry already except that spot.</li>
            <li> Some said it was soft and some said it was hard</li>
            <li> I find them neither soft nor hard</li>
            <li> The bristles are not too soft and not too hard......</li>
            <li> Always had hard time reaching middle of my back.  </li>
            <li> Folks with tender skin should be careful.  </li>
            <li> A few minutes later it ran again for about another five minutes then stopped.</li>
            <li> A total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Also feel a bit curious, how come there is no product tag, label or sign either attached to or printed on the product?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Heavy cord hanger will last.</li>
            <li> Money well spent.</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it.  </li>
            <li> After 2 months of use - the bristles all still there and they maintain their firmness when wet.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s had this brush a couple months and by now other back brushes are usually scrubbed flat.  </li>
            <li> But smells when wet.</li>
            <li> The brush was all I expected.  </li>
            <li> Initially, this was almost too scratchy, but it has softened over a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t too rough on the skin.</li>
            <li> This should be done before you ever get it wet</li>
            <li> Plus, insects ate down the long boar bristles, hence needing replacement.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the bristles are stiff and harsher than I&#x27;m used to.  </li>
            <li> The too soft/too stiff is entirely personal preference; however, like Goldilocks I will continue to search for one that is &amp;#34;just right&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It has a very small crack from dropping it, but it is still completely functional and that is to be expected after about 3 years.</li>
            <li> A little pressure goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> handle is a little too long in one respect</li>
            <li> This brush is one single piece of wood, well constructed and the bristles are just slightly stiff--enough to scrub but not hurt the skin.</li>
            <li> My shower is long and fairly narrow just having the footprint of the bathtub that used to be there.</li>
            <li> Echoing the sentiments of other reviewers (and sounding a bit like Goldilocks from The Three Bears)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming this is due to the porous wood which traps water and then becomes moldy.</li>
            <li> as another reviewer suggested (again, to keep it from discoloring due to bacterial growth).</li>
            <li> Money well spent!</li>
            <li> This back brush helps me reach places I cannot get to with an ordinary brush.</li>
            <li> Extremely rigid bristles.</li>
            <li> Bristles are stiff and the handle is plenty long.</li>
            <li> It might turn a little dark over time(mine has a little dark spot on the back of the head, which doesn&#x27;t bother me), but it will NOT crack, as some other cheaper brushes will do.</li>
            <li> Firm enough but not too firm.  </li>
            <li> I used it in the shower this morning for the first time and was a little surprised at how almost painful it was.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a stiff and hard brush but this is just like my old one.</li>
            <li> nice quality brush, dont like the finish of the wood handle, the raw unfinished feel is annoying.</li>
            <li> It may darken a little but it&#x27;s to be expected given its wood.</li>
            <li> Handle a little rough - wood grain raised with water exposure.</li>
            <li> He used once said it&#x27;s too hard for his back.</li>
            <li> I hang the brush from a hook in the shower, so I&#x27;m not sure what other way there is for the brush to dry after a shower and to not have this problem.</li>
            <li> but if you apply pressure while scrubbing you will feel a scratching effect (if you want it) and if you scrub hard for too long you can scrub your skin pink.</li>
            <li> (If you&#x27;re not careful, you can really hurt yourself badly on the nails.)</li>
            <li> Brush is well made, but unfortunately my husband did not like the straight handle.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are firm, have a wide bed, and are not scratchy.</li>
            <li> Too soft and poor shape.</li>
            <li> so I had to replace it with a slightly longer loop of string.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> /&gt;5/23/14 forgot to say the brush could use a slight curve as well.</li>
            <li> Black mold on wood handle after 6 days of use</li>
            <li> If you are serious about back brushing,  this is the one.  </li>
            <li> Beginning to notice head bristle side is turning black.</li>
            <li> My other bath brush had a thicker, stronger wooden base, but was just not long enough.</li>
            <li> If the strap were just a little bigger/</li>
            <li> A little rope on the end</li>
            <li> They are a little pricey</li>
            <li> it is a little bit of heaven to get in all those places you can&#x27;t reach;</li>
            <li> Bristles need a little \\&quot;break-in\\&quot; period to soften.  </li>
            <li> so the grain doesn&#x27;t raise a little.</li>
            <li> It was very dark brown color</li>
            <li> Had one I used everyday for 4 years.</li>
            <li> Verry heavy</li>
            <li> so if one falls apart, as they often do, I&#x27;ll have a few backups.</li>
            <li> but now I feel I just wasted my money and am considering pitching it.  </li>
            <li> not something discolored and cracked just in a few days&#x27; use.</li>
            <li> those wanting a firm brush like I do, this will not do the job.  </li>
            <li> NOT  cheap.  </li>
            <li> Bristles are firm and course boars hair with no loss after a few months.</li>
            <li> Not good&lt;br /&gt;Too harsh to your skin</li>
            <li> The bristles are firm, but don&#x27;t scratch.</li>
            <li> Bath brush a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I got tired of the bath brushed which come in two parts and the head is always falling off or cracking.</li>
            <li> The bristles are medium firm and packed densely.  </li>
            <li> The ones that look firm turn mushy within a week.</li>
            <li> use it everyday</li>
            <li> The brush is sturdy and well made, but the brush bristle area is too narrow for a body bath or shower.  </li>
            <li> &#x27;s a little stiff (like mine is).</li>
            <li> If it was slightly curved would be even nicer!  </li>
            <li> The bristles are way too stiff.</li>
            <li> This brush is rather stiff</li>
            <li> The bristles on this thing are stiff without being gouging.</li>
            <li> My first one was worn down to the base and lasted a few years.  </li>
            <li> He has bad shoulders and this one puts too much stress on them.  </li>
            <li> There’s a small window in my shower.</li>
            <li> I like the length of the brush handle, and the fact that it&#x27;s all one piece instead of the brush being removable - in my experience, the brushes usually come off as I&#x27;m scrubbing.  </li>
            <li> He thought a back brush would help, and unfortunately it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> A bit rough on the skin until broken in.</li>
            <li> bristles are thick and firm.</li>
            <li> which turns out to be a bit awkward for reaching all parts of my back in my narrow shower.  </li>
            <li> Wow - here&#x27;s a product which is just about impossible to find.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are robust, but not too hard.</li>
            <li> These brushes of this quality are hard to find in stores for this price.</li>
            <li> The bristles are not too hard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find something produced in Germany that&#x27;s \\&quot;cheesy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> but I found it medium to hard.</li>
            <li> That brush would take the skin off a rhinoceros or at least remove paint from any surface.</li>
            <li> However the discoloration of the wood complained by another reviewer also happened to my brush.</li>
            <li> i initially complained about this brush because the bristles came out after about 6 months of use.  </li>
            <li> I do mean crafted not manufactured.</li>
            <li> Sometimes a little difficult to get the angle</li>
            <li> Unfortunately about six months ago the round brush area, which was attached to the brush, began to come unglued.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately what is a firm bristle for some is not for others, that is a chance you take buying</li>
            <li> My experience with products made in Germany are that they are made to last not like cheaper crap on the market.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I had to use it to find out if it was satisfactory.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I found this thing really crude and clumsy.</li>
            <li> And how can you go wrong with a product made in Germany?</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my SO who has a nasty elbow injury and washing his back causes him pain.</li>
            <li> The ones that look like expensive polished wood are often cheaper than they appear and splinter</li>
            <li> Very poor quality.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m afraid it will become moldy soon.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so unpleasant to use that I literally never use it.</li>
            <li> It was impossible to be mold,it didn&#x27;t look like mold, plus I had a/c on all day and night</li>
            <li> A bad odor.</li>
            <li> I have tried a variety of bath brushes and been disappointed........</li>
            <li> My bathroom isn&#x27;t especially poorly ventilated and I would think that the manufacturers of the product would understand that the brush would be hung in the shower or bathroom after use and take this into account.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The Brush swabbed and scrubbed and abraded all that was terrible and bad in the world from my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The Brush swabbed and scrubbed and abraded all that was terrible and bad in the world from my skin.</li>
            <li> I do like the brush, but this discoloration makes it very ugly</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed -- anybody have any ideas?</li>
            <li> The worst part is that it stops running in about five minutes.</li>
            <li> It smells awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> does the job to get where no man has done before----my back.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!  It is perfect.  The length is great, the bristles are just right and I really like the fact that it is made of wood.  The weight is perfect too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dot</li>
            <li> All I hoped for: strong, long manageable.  The string loop for hanging it was a little short so I had to replace it with a slightly longer loop of string.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> Excellent brush so far. I&#x27;ve had it for a month. The handle is longer than I needed, but that&#x27;s a plus in my mind. The brushes are robust, but not too hard.</li>
            <li> Nicely built.  Handle is attached to the brush.  The detachable ones would fall apart during use.</li>
            <li> How much can you say about a shower brush....maybe not much, but this one has hit the spot.  Long handle, soft but sturdy bristles and just the right shape to get where you can not.  Love this brush and will get another!!</li>
            <li> Expensive, but really nice quality.</li>
            <li> Wow - here&#x27;s a product which is just about impossible to find.  These were generally used as lint brushes - not to brush your hair or anything.  they work great as a bath brush.</li>
            <li> I love the brush part of this long handled brush.  The bristles are perfect.  But for me the handle is way too long.  I am always banging the handle in my shower door.  My shower is long and fairly narrow just having the footprint of the bathtub that used to be there.</li>
            <li> I would not buy this brush again.  the bristles are too soft and the handle is not curved.  It&#x27;s well made, so if you are looking for a very soft brush, you will like it.  to compare, the plastic bristle brushes you can find at target are firmer than this brush.</li>
            <li> Great long handle. Bristles are perfect for washing. Best washing brush I&#x27;ve purchased for showers. Not flimsy.</li>
            <li> I purchased on belief of the high reviews and hope.  Unfortunately I had to use it to find out if it was satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s built well and sturdy.  With a lot of use it would probably last awhile.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t retain soap very long to scrub the whole body and the bristles, in my own opinion, are too stiff.&lt;br /&gt;For my own personal use, at best it&#x27;s a back scratcher, but that&#x27;s not why I purchased it.  I wanted a brush to wash and scrub whole body.</li>
            <li> Great product and quick ship.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality, bristles just right, nice long handle.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush despite the higher price because I wanted natural bristles and wood and the extra long handle.  I have never used a back scrubber and maybe I overdid it, but my back broke out in an itchy rash after a few nights of shower and back scrub.  I&#x27;m limiting it to a couple of showers per week and that seems fine.  In our dry winter weather the bristles and wood dry thoroughly every day.  I&#x27;m sure that will change in the humid months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very nice brush.  Just go easy when you start!</li>
            <li> Had one I used everyday for 4 years. Time for a new one. They are the best</li>
            <li> Not as soft as i was expecting</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, maybe it&#x27;s me... but I found this thing really crude and clumsy. It looks good and is well made. But, that straight shank just doesn&#x27;t make washing the back intuitive. It&#x27;s so unpleasant to use that I literally never use it. It just hangs in my shower. I ONLY use it for back washes, so maybe it has lots of other uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Were I to purchase a replacement, I&#x27;d get one with an aggressively curved shank. If you find such a product, be sure to examine the angle of the head to the shank to be sure they thought-it-thru. The head should likely be almost parallel with the hand grip. The shank&#x27;s curve brings the head in and inch or two closer to the lower-back and should (I suppose) somewhat follow the spine.</li>
            <li> I have gone through a brush every 3 months from the department stores. I decided to spend a little more and get this from Germany.  So far  6 months into and its awesome. No wear, feels great on skin and works great. I will buy another if this ever wears out!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my BF.  He is very particular about back brushes and has an extremely difficult time finding one he likes.  This was a Christmas gift and and he loves it!  Echoing the sentiments of other reviewers (and sounding a bit like Goldilocks from The Three Bears) this one is just right!</li>
            <li> Best body back brush on the market</li>
            <li> The brush lived up to expectations. As it replaced an old brush I found it a trifle harsh at first but I&#x27;m getting used to it.</li>
            <li> When I bought my new toaster, I also bought this back brush. The thing was $23. Twenty-three dollars…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you what happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this back brush after feeling grubby and having access to a rare $50 of discretionary income. These factors, combined with the shrewd deal I negotiated on my new toaster, paved the way for the The Back Brush. An Arab trader would be proud of me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The back brush arrived- preceded by a host of flowery five-star reviews on Amazon.com. I opened it. It seemed nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I got in the shower. There’s a small window in my shower. It’s rather like a slit-window in a Libyan prison. A precious sliver of warmth, fresh breeze and golden sunlight filters through green trees. It evokes contemplation of Mandela’s imprisonment, or the wretched cell in North Vietnam were McCain was interned…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warm water, liquid soap- the cheapest I could find, and my new brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I lathered it up and switched grip to scrub my back, closing my eyes like a contented cat. I was not at all prepared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly I was transported, to the Greek Isle of Lesbos. I was standing, naked, in a huge porcelain pool in an arbor near an olive grove. The warm sun glared off its glossy surface and it was filled with crystal salt water carried by serfs in motif-ed urns from the Aegean beach below. I stood there, knee deep in the water of the ern, the sun warming my naked skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From nowhere a trio of unclad nymphs appeared, brandishing sponges and… The Back Brush. They were pale and young and firm, unblemished by the rigors of age and time. Golden hair, lilted by the soft Aegean breeze in the afternoon sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naked in the pool, the nymphs attended me. They washed the rime of exertion and toil from my skin, the one brushing vigorously on my back with The Brush, not only to clean it, but also to bring fresh blood to the surface in a blush of new vitality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Light suds rinsed from my cleaning skin. The touch of fresh air replaced the crust of soil and exertion. I was becoming clean… finally, clean…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Brush swabbed and scrubbed and abraded all that was terrible and bad in the world from my skin. And in its newly cleaned wake, it left the tender skin of my youth. Unsoiled, unfettered- warmed by the bright Aegean sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then she appeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend Jan, lilting and buoyant in a gauze layer so sheer and unencumber-ing it seemed cloud-like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She did not walk; she seemed to levitate, up from the sea toward my clear pool, now murky with the lost filth of my exertions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never had I seen such a scene of beauty and splendor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her toes painted blue-turquoise. We descended, Jan and I, down to the clear Aegean, across the worm, white sand, and into the water- greeting by fluorescent fishes with wide eyes. There we swam in the rapture of youth, unburdened by gravity or age or duty, until our union was complete- there in the sun and sea and serenity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I opened my eyes and my back was clean in the shower, and my skin felt good. And I would recommend this excellent back brush to any and all. It really is quite a fine brush and accounts of its manly bristles being somewhat firmer than the norm are accurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Few things in life have exceeded my expectations as have this excellent brush. It is indeed a rare and satisfying buying experience.s rinsed from my cleaning skin. The touch of fresh air replaced the crust of soil and exertion.

            <li> This is a nice, long-handled brush.  These brushes of this quality are hard to find in stores for this price.</li>
            <li> A quality brush at a fair price.</li>
            <li> My husband wanted a well-made, long handled bath brush for use in the shower.  This fits the bill!  It is extremely well-made with bristles that feel good against your skin.  Most of the others we&#x27;ve had have been quite coarse.  I highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> It does seem to turn black in certain places on the brush. I&#x27;m assuming this is due to the porous wood which traps water and then becomes moldy. When I brush the brush, lol, the black spots do disappear, so I think it is mold. I hang the brush from a hook in the shower, so I&#x27;m not sure what other way there is for the brush to dry after a shower and to not have this problem. Other than that, it&#x27;s a great brush and its long handle reaches my back with ease.</li>
            <li> Nice strong handle on this - unless it gets used like a baseball bat, I don&#x27;t see this breaking. The handle broke on my last brush like this - it was plastic. The bristles are a good balance for me of aggressive enough to feel like it&#x27;s working, but not uncomfortably stiff or prickly. It&#x27;s just over that threshold of feeling just a little scratchy for a moment until you get going, and then it&#x27;s fine. Never leaves me feeling like my skin has been scratched, though. I was a little skeptical of a brush with a wood handle, thinking about how wood soaks up water, but for the brief use it gets, the water doesn&#x27;t seem to soak in much, and I hang it on the outside of the shower curtain when not in use to promote full drying of the wood and bristles. All good so far, after a couple months of use.</li>
            <li> Wonderful.  It&#x27;s the right bristle strength and right length.</li>
            <li> Longer handle than other similar products. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, long, just right on the stiffness.</li>
            <li> Best Brush, I have bought, head does not come off, and it does not crack ....great product.</li>
            <li> I love bore brissle brushes, of any type, (have one finger brush, a hair brush and now this back brush) and its the real thing, for the price I would have anticipated a slightly better finish on the wooden portion, but its wood alright, and the bristles feel exquisite on my back. also my wife (who suffers from allergy rashing on her back) keeps stealing it from me for her own use! so I might be in the market for a spare soon, :-)</li>
            <li> works as it should, i like it for my feet &amp; back.</li>
            <li> A Strong long handle with great massaging boar bristles.  Does everything it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Best way to clean your back.</li>
            <li> Over 10 years ago I purchased a bath brush from Kent, a British company. To me this brush was perfect. Long handle, large round brush with really soft bristles. Unfortunately about six months ago the round brush area, which was attached to the brush, began to come unglued. I decided to purchased a new brush in case it became completely unglued.I found out the Kent brush was no longer available. I bought a brush from a large national chain which was inexpensive. What a mistake. That brush would take the skin off a rhinoceros or at least remove paint from any surface. Then I purchased this brush based primarily on reviews saying the bristles were soft. While better than my disastrous brush they are not nearly as soft as the Kent brush. Since the Kent brush would have received Five Stars and the cheap brush One Star I am giving this brush Three Stars. ,</li>
            <li> I love this brush! The bristles are super firm, but still soft enough to work up a good lather. I haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding yet either. The wood handle is a good weight and easy to hold. This brush has greatly improved my showers.</li>
            <li> Although this was priced considerably higher than some of the other bath brushes on Amazon, I purchased this after reading , reviews.  It doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  The wooden handle is extra long, so it&#x27;s great for reaching down you back.  The bristles are firm, have a wide bed, and are not scratchy. The perfect combination of firm with softness.&lt;br /&gt;  And, the rope at the end of the handle is great to hook on your shower head.&lt;br /&gt;It looks like the brushes in the worlds finest spas.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product and worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> Been looking for a brush that would last for more than 5 showers. it is great, well worth the money</li>
            <li> I was glad to find a brush that was all one piece of wood. Many have detachable brushes. The brush is a little rough at first, but once you get it wet and soaped up, it softens. And how can you go wrong with a product made in Germany?</li>
            <li> Love this bath brush! I have short arms but this helps me reach my entire back. Provides a great and stimulating scrub. Shipped and received 3 days after ordered.</li>
            <li> The long handle makes it easy to cover your entire back</li>
            <li> Great bristles - not too stiff or too soft.  Holds up really well to lots of use.  Looks like a keeper!</li>
            <li> Great brush. Verry heavy</li>
            <li> The handle is long and allows me to reach all areas. The wooden handle feels good and I like the fact that I can still grip it when my hands are soapy. I also like the way it holds the lather while in use.</li>
            <li> a little stiff, but good!!!</li>
            <li> Worth the $.  Well made and it looks like it will last.  The bristles are about what I&#x27;d want them to be - make sure you dry it between uses.  I&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Initially this would have been a 5 star rating. However, just 3 months since the purchase the wood at the bristle end of the brush has split. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s just a matter of time before the brush is unusable. For the price this brush should last until the bristles wear out. Now what?</li>
            <li> Beats those dinky plastic brushes sold in most grocery stores any day of the week!</li>
            <li> This is a great back scrubbing brush because it has a 9.5in. long handle &amp; it&#x27;s made out of very high quality wood by artisans in Germany. I highly reccomend this back scrubbing brush to anyone who uses products like this.</li>
            <li> excellent; even though I would have preferred with a little curved.</li>
            <li> This is easily the very best shower brush I have ever purchased and I have tried many.  We have purchased virtually every such brush available through local stores and they have all failed to live up to expectations.  They would either gradually loose all of their bristles or just break at the handle area.  The Bürstenhaus brush has bristles that have just the right stiffness to do their job without being bothersome.  The solid beechwood handle is just the right length and is extremely durable.  I waited almost four months to give a review just to make sure it would last.  Neither my wife nor I have noticed any bristles on the shower floor.  At this rate I would expect the brushes to last for years.  If you are looking for a truly great shower brush look no further - this is it!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t figure out where to put the batteries. Just kidding.&lt;br /&gt;Actually, I can&#x27;t find a good place to put the brush itself. If the strap were just a little bigger/longer, I could hang it on the shower handle. Right now, I lean it in the corner.&lt;br /&gt;When they figure that out, I&#x27;ll give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Nice brush, but it could be stiffer. The long handle is nice, but a bit heavy. In spite of its limitations it&#x27;s useable.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and the bristle stiffness is just right. Sometimes a little difficult to get the angle just right, particularly if you&#x27;re shoulder&#x27;s a little stiff (like mine is).</li>
            <li> i would give it higher marks if the handle were curved to wash back area better.  love the bristles on the brush, love the length, but the handle design needs to be changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/23/14 forgot to say the brush could use a slight curve as well.</li>
            <li> Nice brush - I love it!</li>
            <li> Works well and feels nice.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> USE IT EVERY DAY,PERFECT</li>
            <li> Quality product. The bristles are not too hard. I love the long handle; very ergonomic. I have had the detachable brush head type before and the brush head would constantly fall off. Buy 2. Hand held and back brush!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a brush. It does what it should. Not losing any bristles, not too harsh, just right! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> very high quality indeed.</li>
            <li> I love being able to reach my backside while showering. I can rub a bar of soap on the bristles and then scrub away. The handle is long enough for someone tall like me. It is of high quality, both the wood and the bristles and the bristles are stiff enough to scrub without being too abrasive. The little twine loop on the end is perfect for hanging it in the shower to drip out when done. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing brush! Highly recommend this</li>
            <li> Most folks wouldn&#x27;t give a bath brush much thought... it exists and doesn&#x27;t break during the first use... etc. THIS one, however... is a GREAT example of craftsmanship and functionality. The workmanship is outstanding. I also do woodwork and can appreciate the skill and knowledge that went into making this brush. Even though it costs a bit more than plastic ones... just touching it I can feel the care and expertise that went into making a great product. I would HIGHLY recommend this brush over ANYTHING I have seen yet&lt;br /&gt;from other sources!</li>
            <li> bristles not as hard as expected or would have liked</li>
            <li> Well Made, all one piece which is very important. Just right for the shower.</li>
            <li> I love this bath brush--it does not get too soft in the shower. I liked it so much that I bought one for my husband, and he likes his very much also!</li>
            <li> Nice wood brush, good value, just as described.</li>
            <li> Damn fine back scrubber!</li>
            <li> Best body brush I&#x27;ve ever had.  Beautifully made, very nice wood and handle design, and now a part of every shower for my always-itchy back. More expensive than some others out there, but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The bristles are just the right stiffness and does a good job of scrubbing my back. It&#x27;s well made and the long handle is a plus. But wish the handle was curved to reach all areas of my back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen or felt &amp;#34;natural Boar bristles&amp;#34; as soft as these, but I love the long bath brush handle that reaches into those hard to reach places on my back.  My other bath brush had a thicker, stronger wooden base, but was just not long enough. Plus, insects ate down the long boar bristles, hence needing replacement.&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully that will not occur with this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just received within the last couple of days, but I love it!</li>
            <li> Reasons why this brush is better than other shower brushes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. the wooden handle is wide and very grippable even when wet - so much stronger than a plastic handle!&lt;br /&gt;2. the whole brush is one piece; the brush head can&#x27;t fly off just when you start scrubbing your back (grr).&lt;br /&gt;3. the bristles are midway between soft and harsh; this brush is exfoliating, but it&#x27;s not a Silkwood shower.&lt;br /&gt;4. when held under hot water and rubbed with your hand, the bristles can be softened up a little more.&lt;br /&gt;5. the rope hanging loop is totally decent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When this one wears out, I&#x27;ll buy another one just like it. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> The BEST bath brush I have ever owned !! Have recommended brush to friends and have had nothing but &amp;#34;Thank you&amp;#34; in return........</li>
            <li> Brush is well made, but unfortunately my husband did not like the straight handle.  He has bad shoulders and this one puts too much stress on them.  Still searching for the perfect curved handle brush.</li>
            <li> I tend to break the plastic handles on these type of brushes. I&#x27;m very glad I bought this. The bristles are much more comfortable than the plastic bristles on most brushes</li>
            <li> keep them in stock &amp; I will purchase one when in need !!!</li>
            <li> Received the product and had a crack in it near the brush. See photo for details.</li>
            <li> I like the length of the brush handle, and the fact that it&#x27;s all one piece instead of the brush being removable - in my experience, the brushes usually come off as I&#x27;m scrubbing.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the bristles are stiff and harsher than I&#x27;m used to.  I used it in the shower this morning for the first time and was a little surprised at how almost painful it was.  Hopefully the bristles will soften up with more usage.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality shower brush.  The bristles are very sturdy, but not too rough.  Well made, looks like it will hold up to the test of time.  A little rope on the end so I can hang it on the hook.  Very nice overall.</li>
            <li> Needed a scrub brush to reach my back in the shower. This brush is good - made of one single piece of wood; hopefully it won&#x27;t break where the brush joins the handle. Happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> I looked and looked for a good strong quality bath brush that didn&#x27;t feel harsh on my skin. This is it! Its a beautiful simple design, is long enough, and the bristles are firm, yet feel great on your skin. I am very pleased!!</li>
            <li> A little rough until the bristles are used several times.  Folks with tender skin should be careful.  Softens with use.  Wonderful long handle and very sturdy construction.</li>
            <li> The suction is great and the attachments OK, they tend to work loose. The worst part is that it stops running in about five minutes. There is no helpful information in the manual to explain the reason. A few minutes later it ran again for about another five minutes then stopped. It apparently has an overheating problem that neither the manufacturer nor Fuller Brush, in this case are willing to reveal, some people will do anything for a buck! My wife has a larger machine, by a different company, of the exact same design. It too has a problem with overheating. Will NOT by from Fuller ¨Bull¨ again.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush.  The bristles are just right and the handle is long enough for me.  Very good quality.</li>
            <li> I have bought many brushes on line and in retail stores and this by far is the best quality and the longest handle available. I have used it for 3 months on a daily basis and it is still like new. It is the perfect stiffness to clean yet not scratch your skin. They are a little pricey but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I love showering &amp; bathing with a shower brush, and I have experienced many. So let me be honest about this Bath Brush. This is by far the BEST bath brush I have EVER owned. I had a feeling it would be, because I noticed it was a GERMAN product, and in my years(50+), if there&#x27;s one thing I&#x27;ve noticed about GERMAN products, its the Germans generally don&#x27;t \\&quot;compromise\\&quot; when they \\&quot;do\\&quot; something. It&#x27;s hard to find something produced in Germany that&#x27;s \\&quot;cheesy\\&quot;. This Bath Brush is HIGH quality!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The wood, in which the handle is formed is a GOOD length and smooth in the hand. Its contour makes for a comfortable fit and feel. It might turn a little dark over time(mine has a little dark spot on the back of the head, which doesn&#x27;t bother me), but it will NOT crack, as some other cheaper brushes will do. I always leave it standing or hanging after using it, so it will naturally drain off water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The Bristles, are not too soft, not too firm. In my opinion, they are JUST RIGHT! Kind of \\&quot;medium\\&quot; stiff, which gives a NICE stimulating scrub to the skin, without over-scratching. Should be safe enough for sensitive skin, in my opinion. BEST discovery is, I have NOT noticed ANY bristles flaking off, becoming smashed, or changing color in the 60 days I have used my Burstenhaus Redecker Beechwood bath brush. It seems like this brush will last a LONG time, before you need to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) You definitely get what you pay for! This brush is not a $5-$10 \\&quot;cheapo\\&quot; brush. But let me assure you, its worth EVERY penny!! I don&#x27;t ever want to use another brand bath brush. I&#x27;m SOLD. I LOVE this bath brush, and I believe you will too. I bought two already, and I will most likely buy two more soon, just to be sure I have one, for as long as I [hope] to be \\&quot;around\\&quot;.  Take care.</li>
            <li> My mom loves it, I gave it to her as part of her mothers day gift, being older it helps give her extra reach.</li>
            <li> Great brush that is one piece with the brush head versus two-piece brushes that fall apart; it is not moldy or deteriorating by staying in the shower</li>
            <li> Great Brush after a year is a little cracked still work ok.</li>
            <li> Strong, looks nice, brish is not so hard, gets the job done. What else do you need?</li>
            <li> The quality of brush seems good. The bristles are a little on the short side, and for my taste a little too soft. The too soft/too stiff is entirely personal preference; however, like Goldilocks I will continue to search for one that is &amp;#34;just right&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Perfect in every way................I have tried a variety of bath brushes and been disappointed........The Burstenhaus Redecker Beechwood is perfect with the long handle......Try it your back will thank you...........</li>
            <li> I really like this bath brush.  Having it made of wood and natural bristles somehow reminds me that not everything needs to be plastic.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush based on the positive reviews here. Although it seems to be very high quality, I&#x27;ve got 3 huge gripes with this item. First it&#x27;s too straight. It has plenty of reach but because its straight as an arrow it doesn&#x27;t make positive contact with everywhere I need to scrub. The bristles are way too stiff. It felt like scrubbing with a hair brush. I&#x27;ve actually had hair brushes that were softer. Also the bristles have and odor. A bad odor. They smell like the animal they came from. Its a pungent zoo animal smell. I thought that the lather from my soap would wash the odor out but no luck there. Based on these factors I will not buy another one of these. I&#x27;ll continue to use the cheap $5 nylon shower puffs on a stick from Walmart. They don&#x27;t last very long but deliver a good scrub that doesn&#x27;t hurt and I can reach all of my back and side parts with them. I&#x27;ll just know better and buy several at a time so if one falls apart, as they often do, I&#x27;ll have a few backups.</li>
            <li> A GOOD FUNCTIONAL PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I like the natural look of the brush, the length of the handle, the stiffness of the bristles -- I thought this was going to be one of those satisfying purchases where you get what you pay for.  Unfortunately, after about a week of use, hanging it in my shower from the cord attached through a hole in the handle, it began to develop a dark discoloration at the bottom and at the top curved part of the brush that I&#x27;m guessing is ... mold?? My bathroom isn&#x27;t especially poorly ventilated and I would think that the manufacturers of the product would understand that the brush would be hung in the shower or bathroom after use and take this into account.  If I&#x27;d known, perhaps a coat of polyurethane would have helped, I don&#x27;t know.  I&#x27;ve tried bleach and leaving it in a sunny window but that didn&#x27;t help much or for long.  I thought spending more for a better, &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product was a good idea but now I feel I just wasted my money and am considering pitching it.  Very disappointed -- anybody have any ideas?</li>
            <li> Fast shipping &amp; brush does a great job.</li>
            <li> I love it, gets to those hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable to handle.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are very good and do a wonderful cleaning!&lt;br /&gt;I would refer this brush to EVERYONE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JAY</li>
            <li> This seems to be the only authentic, high-quality, stiff boar bristle brush available here. High quality wooden handle, and short, stiff boar bristles. I purchased it after buying three others on Amazon from other manufacturers in an effort to replace one I&#x27;ve had and liked a lot.  If you want a soft brush, buy Swissco. If you want a strong stiff one, get this.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how I lived without it, it is everything a bath brush should be.  When I lather up and scrub my back it is a little bit of heaven to get in all those places you can&#x27;t reach;.. Everyone should have this in their bathroom, don&#x27;t forget  to someone you love as a gift. You can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> I have used plenty of cheap ones before but for a little extra money you get something that is A LOT better! Never going back to using cheap scrubbers again!</li>
            <li> Absolutely AWESOME!!!!!!</li>
            <li> A total waste of money. The bristles are not soft at all. It feels like I&#x27;m rubbing my back with course sandpaper.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that the bristles would be too soft, but they are not.  They are medium-stiff, which is exactly what we wanted.  The long handle is the perfect length for reaching those parts of your back that are hard to reach comfortably with a regular brush.  I did a lot of research on many brushes before buying this one, and am not disappointed.  The quality of this brush is wonderful, too!</li>
            <li> Longer length makes this great for my 85 year old Mom to reach her feet in the shower.  Nice product, sturdy - she tried the plastic kinds, but they were either too short or the heads would detach too easily.</li>
            <li> the right length and stiffness of bristles. just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> I love this German quality excellent product!</li>
            <li> Excellent product... Rope could be longer to make a bigger hole to go over shower head - but I LOVE the bristles.... I worried they would be too scratchy- NOPE - perfect amount, not too soft either.  A little pressure goes a long way.  Got that spot in the middle of my back, but didn&#x27;t want to stop there so I did my whole back... Thank you.</li>
            <li> has a nice long reach.  quality product, speedy delivery</li>
            <li> This is my second brush. My first one was worn down to the base and lasted a few years.  I received this brush and could not wait to feel those soft bristled on my skin. The bristles are not hard but not to soft. It definitely feels wonderful on my back as well as other areas.</li>
            <li> Perfect bristles stiffness - not hard on the skin.  Seems well made - would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Awesome bath brush.  Works as intended and continues to maintain quality after weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Just got it yesterday and used it. It looks substantial only the handle seems to be a bit long for me. Also feel a bit curious, how come there is no product tag, label or sign either attached to or printed on the product?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Aug. 3 2014 update]&lt;br /&gt;I have used the brush for a few showers and enjoyed it. However the discoloration of the wood complained by another reviewer also happened to my brush. It was at the pointed end of the brush head.I hung it up to the towel bar with enough space around it for ventilation, at first I thought it was water mark but it had been over a day and the other part of the wood was totally dry already except that spot. It was very dark brown color and I felt wetness when I touched it. I didn&#x27;t use it last night, and this morning, I still saw that discoloration just a bit lighter. It was impossible to be mold,it didn&#x27;t look like mold, plus I had a/c on all day and night, it was very dry in the house(I used to live in a city with humid sub-tropical climate and I had experience with mold developed on wood). This is really strange, I couldn&#x27;t understand what it was? I do like the brush, but this discoloration makes it very ugly and also it is a problem if it can&#x27;t dry normally. So I would change my review from 4 stars to 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Aug. 8 2014 update]&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I am very unlucky after I read all those good reviews. Yes, the bristles are good! The wood feels and looks terrific! I just have that brush head problem. The top end couldn&#x27;t dry and I saw more wood discoloration showing up. I gave it two nights break and this morning, I checked it to find it drier and the discoloration lighter but still damp. However I saw two fine cracks!!! I don&#x27;t mind paying a bit extra for good quality but definitely not something discolored and cracked just in a few days&#x27; use. I am going to look for boar bristles brush with plastic handle.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product.  Excellent quality and very sturdy.  My experience with products made in Germany are that they are made to last not like cheaper crap on the market.  Worth the price!</li>
            <li> My husband loves the brush. Best he has ever used.</li>
            <li> Great product that is made with quality wood. I highly recommend this product and it&#x27;s vendor!  Best brush ever! 😊</li>
            <li> I love this brush the length is perfect, I am a tall girl so this brush is great.</li>
            <li> I got it for my boyfriend and it&#x27;s really helped him with his backne!</li>
            <li> The reviews were correct that this is a very good quality made brush.  Unfortunately what is a firm bristle for some is not for others, that is a chance you take buying online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those wanting a firm brush like I do, this will not do the job.  It is a softer bristle like the bristles found on plastic handle brushes at Walmart.  You know the ones that come in different colors and have a hook to hang it on the shower head.  Of course this is much better quality, the comparison is only to the firmness of the bristle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave the brush to another family member who, like &#x27;Goldilocks&#x27;, says &amp;#34;it is just right&amp;#34; :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little ruff at first, but other wise great!</li>
            <li> This is my second brush they are really great an make your body , legs, feet feel great just can&#x27;t say enough good thing about this brush</li>
            <li> This item was hung in the shower and imediately started growing mold. This is a very nice product otherwise. It even had the faintest odor of smoked pork when removed from the packaging.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect back brush.  I know that&#x27;s subjective, but I have been searching for ages.  Most brush bristles are either way too stiff, or way too soft.  This one is just right (FYI, I have pretty sensitive skin and these bristles do not hurt at all).  I like that it is made from one solid piece of wood, so there is no separating the brush head while you&#x27;re using it.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I like it. Some said it was soft and some said it was hard but I found it medium to hard. It hurts my back a little but not enough to not use it. Everyone has different sensitivities.</li>
            <li> Really like this brush.  Quality item.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this back scrubber. I am not the most flexible of people so this really helps. In my opinion, the bristles are perfect. They aren&#x27;t super hard to the point I feel like my skin is being irritated and they aren&#x27;t so soft I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m getting a good scrub. The length of the handle is perfect. The materials feel better than any of the dozens of cheaper back scrubbers I&#x27;ve tried in the past. I was hesitant about the price but with all the good reviews I thought I&#x27;d give it a try &amp; I am very happy that I did. If you are in the market please try this scrubber!</li>
            <li> Have to admit this is a fantastic brush sturdy handle and soft yet firm bristles gets alot of use and the bristles are still great.</li>
            <li> Bought this for the hubby and he loves it!</li>
            <li> Works well. No probs so far</li>
            <li> Really great but the bristles soften when soap lathers</li>
            <li> Quality well made brush from Germany. What else would you expect?</li>
            <li> Always had hard time reaching middle of my back.  Long washcloth just didn&#x27;t do the job.  this is ergonomically correct.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Really good quality brush but the bristles are too soft for me. It you like soft bristles this is the brush for you.</li>
            <li> Excellent back brush!  Should last for years, with sturdy handle and a nice thick head of bristles.</li>
            <li> Excellent brush, I took the advice of other reviewers and made sure to hang it up.  The bathroom doesn&#x27;t have much airflow and its still dry every night, I don&#x27;t expect it to get any mold issues.</li>
            <li> I pored over the selection of brushes on Amazon and felt that this would be the best option..... I was right!!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my SO who has a nasty elbow injury and washing his back causes him pain. He thought a back brush would help, and unfortunately it didn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m still giving it 5 stars because I&#x27;m pretty sure no back brush would work for him until he is finished with physical therapy. I&#x27;ve been using it, and my skin feels great.</li>
            <li> Gift for husband who finds it to be very well made and a perfect length.</li>
            <li> My new bath brush works very well to reach the middle of my back where my joint pain and general stiffness no longer allow me to scrub without one. It&#x27;s by far the longest (one of my criteria) and the bristles are not so harsh as to hurt, but they are just right for scrubbing with the shower running on my back. The one nitpick I have is that the finish is not apparently completely waterproof, thus my 4 star rating rather than 5. I worry about the longevity of the handle. However, the bristles are embedded right into the wood unlike my previous brush which had a plastic plate that held the bristles and it eventually fell off, hence my purchase of this brush. I would recommend a purchase if you need a good back brush.</li>
            <li> I have been using since June and see and feel a real difference in my skin. Even reduction in appearance of cellulite!!! Love it!! : D</li>
            <li> So far so good, Have been using this brush for about four months now. The extra length handle is great, as I am unable to fully stretch my arm(s) fully with other type brushes to scrub my back. Had a Kent brush for many tears, but left it behind in a hotel.&lt;br /&gt;While Kent brushes are excellent, they are expensive and don&#x27;t have a full, or long enough handle. This is a great buy.</li>
            <li> Great brush!  If it was slightly curved would be even nicer!  Soft bristles!</li>
            <li> i bought a similar brush in Munich 8 yrs ago and I finially found a replacement</li>
            <li> I was actually surprised how long the brush was in person. I have limited shower space so sometimes I do clank the hand on the wall a couple of times, but the extra length makes cleaning all areas a cinch. The bristles feel great; as mentioned by other reviews, people have different preferences on firmness and roughness, but I think this brush is moderately firm and not too rough and I have sensitive skin that reddens and scratches easily. I&#x27;ve only had the brush a couple days so I can&#x27;t really yield info on the durability of the wood or the bristles, but it looks and feels as though the brush will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of the bristles, but the handle forces me to work hard to get to hard to reach parts of my back because it is not contoured.  Still...I like it.</li>
            <li> Bought for husband. He used once said it&#x27;s too hard for his back.</li>
            <li> Unlike some others I&#x27;d tried, it&#x27;s very well-made from a solid piece of wood. The bristles are just the right stiffness for daily use, and seem to be holding up well. My only complaint is that it quickly began to discolor at the (brush-end) tip, which hangs down as it drains. Not clear yet if it&#x27;s actually rotting out, or just discolored.</li>
            <li> Good brush.  Bristles need a little \\&quot;break-in\\&quot; period to soften.  Would be perfect if handle had a little bend in it to make it easier to reach your whole back.</li>
            <li> NOT  cheap.  However it is very well made.  I do not see having to replace this for years..........  This brush is rather stiff so only get it if you are looking for a brush that is stiff......yet not overly so.</li>
            <li> Great back brush to wash</li>
            <li> I had to replace my old back brush and quickly discovered that these days, most use a glue for the bristles which dissolves in a humid environment like a shower.  There&#x27;s nothing as much fun as cleaning bristles from your shower drain, now is there?  Thankfully this brush actually seems to be designed for use in a shower.  The bristles are soft and the brush is a nice length.</li>
            <li> Best brush you can buy for bath. Especially for a man . Love the wood handle.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality. The bristles fall out all the time. I bought it before checking prices at Marshalls/TJ Maxx or other discount retailers and they are all around $5 for the same brush. As a matter of fact I bought one of much better quality for $5 from TJ Maxx.</li>
            <li> Only shortcoming is the length of the bristles.  Just a tad too short.  But still provides that invigorating just scrubbed feel.</li>
            <li> I love this - I feel like I&#x27;m is a spa every time I take a shower. It&#x27;s nicely weighted but not too heavy. The bristles are firm but soft and don&#x27;t fall out of the brush at all. The handle length is perfect for letting me reach everywhere on my back. It&#x27;s just a simple, very well made product that&#x27;s worth the extra few bucks.</li>
            <li> Long lasting, quality made</li>
            <li> Very well made, just the right amount of stiffness. Very pleased</li>
            <li> I like this brush ok but it would be much better if the head had an angle to it to make it easier to reach your back.</li>
            <li> I like the brush I just wish it didn&#x27;t grow mold/mildew so quickly.  I have to soak it in bleach water about every two weeks.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more in a back brush.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband.  He loves the length.</li>
            <li> Black mold on wood handle after 6 days of use</li>
            <li> High quality brush. Handle is natural, very smooth and doesn&#x27;t slip when wet. Weathers in color like shake siding with use. Bristles are firm and course boars hair with no loss after a few months. Heavy cord hanger will last. It should last a long time</li>
            <li> Great scrubbing brush… I would buy this brush again. The bristles are very firm, but all the better to get clean, in my humble opinion. UPDATE: This brush STILL works great from when I purchased it in 2013. It has a very small crack from dropping it, but it is still completely functional and that is to be expected after about 3 years. Would still buy again &amp; still would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Great brush will buy another</li>
            <li> Works very well; would recommend for a standard bath/shower brush.</li>
            <li> Nice and sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;Feels good on body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for while now and I love it! No mold. No mold. No mold. I leave the brush in the shower. I hang it by the string to let it dry between uses. It is worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I had it for 1 month and no issues yet. Works like the fist day I used it. It may darken a little but it&#x27;s to be expected given its wood. No warping or cracks.</li>
            <li> Money well spent. After receiving one, I ordered a second one. One thing I did do was to rub mineral oil on the handle to protect the wood</li>
            <li> When I viewed this brush online, I noticed the straight handle . . . which turns out to be a bit awkward for reaching all parts of my back in my narrow shower.  The bristles are just the right stiffness, and I&#x27;m hanging it out of the main stream of water, so the wood won&#x27;t discolor as rapidly as it might.  I also am spraying it with white vinegar or citric acid. as another reviewer suggested (again, to keep it from discoloring due to bacterial growth).</li>
            <li> Not good&lt;br /&gt;Too harsh to your skin</li>
            <li> Need a new back brush. Decided to upgrade and I am delighted with the whole brush.  Took my first shower with it this morning and it met all my expectations.</li>
            <li> Finally, a bath brush that doesn&#x27;t skimp on handle length. And it&#x27;s made by what is probably the last brushmaker in the world making a wide assortment of brushes in the old-fashioned handcrafted manner. Their online catalog is 200 pages. It&#x27;s a great pity that the only one we can buy in this country is this bath brush. If they were available, I&#x27;d buy the Sauna Brush, the Massage Brush, and 2-3 hairbrushes at a minimum.</li>
            <li> I wanted a stiff and hard brush but this is just like my old one.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality...as advertised.</li>
            <li> Will MOLD! I bought this because of all the reviews about the firmness of the bristles, which is perfect for what I wanted. The only problem I have is that it is NOT coated and absorbs water. I hang it in my shower to dry, towards the outside and leave the shower curtain pulled back to allow for ventilation. What is the bottom in the hanging position never dries out and I&#x27;m afraid it will become moldy soon. That is my only complaint, otherwise it&#x27;s a great brush.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to spend the extra money for this one when others were priced lower.  Now I&#x27;m glad I did. I use it everyday in the shower and really like it.  Once a week, I soak the bristles in water and clorox and then apply mineral oil to the wood.  I hang it to dry after each shower.</li>
            <li> Alittle stiffer than I thought it would be but now it feels good.</li>
            <li> A bit rough on the skin until broken in. Not bad but expensive</li>
            <li> Needs more protection on the wood to keep it from discoloring</li>
            <li> This is a great back brush.  I am tempted to buy another and cut the handle off to make it into a body brush.  The handle is long enough to use it on my back, but in a small shower enclosure, it can be too long to use it on the rest of my body.  The bristles are nice and soft, but not too soft - perfect.  And the hanging loop is just the right size for hanging on the shower head to dry.  it doesn&#x27;t shed so I expect it to last a long time.</li>
            <li> Not just good, Great! The bristles are firm, but don&#x27;t scratch. A long handle that allows you to brush your entire back without straining. Sturdy, and as it is a once piece handle, this should last for ages with proper care. If I need another, I will be back to the same vendor for the same brush.</li>
            <li> Handle a little rough - wood grain raised with water exposure. Brush is perfect</li>
            <li> Very well constructed brush. Minus 1 star for bristle softness - if you want a BRISK back scrub this is not your brush.</li>
            <li> It is so coarse I don&#x27;t suggest using this on your back and it isn&#x27;t long enough for me (I&#x27;m 6&#x27;1&amp;#34;). It made me very itchy and a few bristles fell out.  Returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Don&#x27;t buy a back scrubber, get this you will thank me later :)&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007IAE5WY/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o02_s00_i00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1</li>
            <li> This brush does the trick, reaches those hard to get spots and leaves the skin feeling good when finished.  The brush comes off hard at first, but after a few times and adjusting the pressure I apply, there are no issues, hands down a good brush for the price.</li>
            <li> i initially complained about this brush because the bristles came out after about 6 months of use.  manufacturer contacted me and offered a new brush.  it&#x27;s been over a year now, and the new brush has held up great.  i&#x27;m chalking up the initial defective brush as an anomaly.  would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this lovely 19.7 in. Bath brush a few weeks ago.It is made from a single piece of wood, not too heavy,bristles just right and hangs conveniently next to my shower.Just exactly what I was looking for.Oh, and I&#x27;m going to order one for a friend for Christmas!</li>
            <li> Really nice brush, excellent length and the bristles are just the right stiffness.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read reviews which mention a water effect on the wood, so I&#x27;ve applied 2 coats of Minwax polyurethane to seal the wood.  I&#x27;ll see how it holds up.</li>
            <li> Just received my brush yesterday. It is made of high quality solid wood and has a really nice long handle. The bristles are a little rough on my sensitive skin, and my liquid soap doesn&#x27;t lather up on it real well (I like a good lather)....but I still like this brush and will use it for a long time. It&#x27;s made to last, for sure. If you like a good vigorous scrub, you will love this one. And if you are tall or big, the long handle makes reaching your entire back easy.  A great brush!</li>
            <li> Best brush I ever owned! Nice and long and feels great! I had rotator cuff surgery on my right arm,(my dominant side). This made showers easy!!!</li>
            <li> Yeah. The long handle makes showering while asleep makes it a must but. Great quality!!</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it.  Bristles have just the right stiffness.  It has the longest handle I have been able to find.</li>
            <li> In about a year most of the bristles had fallen out of my old $12 brush and I couldn&#x27;t find another $12 brush at any of the mass marketers.  I found this brush on Amazon and decided to gamble the extra money.  I SCORED!  After 2 months of use - the bristles all still there and they maintain their firmness when wet.  I find them neither soft nor hard but instead they function well when stiffness is required on the soles of the feet and yet they are comfortably soft for all other areas of the body up to and including my face and nose. Excellent all around performance. No more adult acne. I use deodorant, but I don&#x27;t think I need to. If you shower with this brush, you will be clean.  My thanks go out to the numb skull mass marketers, none of whom were able to provide me a lifetime supply of their inferior product.</li>
            <li> I got tired of the bath brushed which come in two parts and the head is always falling off or cracking. This brush is one single piece of wood, well constructed and the bristles are just slightly stiff--enough to scrub but not hurt the skin. Couldn&#x27;t love it more.</li>
            <li> Now I can appropriately clean my back.</li>
            <li> This brush looks great and the handle has a nice length. However, upon first use, the bristles began to smell. It smells awful. After many uses the smell is still there and just as strong. This brush is not a winner at my house. I was so disappointed!</li>
            <li> My husband wanted a back brush with an extra long handle and extra strong bristles.  This brush fits the bill.  While the bristles are actually very soft, they are thickly spaced and stand up to his vigorous scrubbing.  He&#x27;s had this brush a couple months and by now other back brushes are usually scrubbed flat.  This one still looks new.  Looks like it will last quite a while before needing to be replaced, and when I do - it will be with another of one of these!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 5&#x27;10&amp;#34; guy and the long handle is helpful to reach the middle back.  If it had a slight curve it would be perfect, but it&#x27;s good enough.  The bristles are medium firm and packed densely.  The bristles feel soft when you run your finger across them but if you apply pressure while scrubbing you will feel a scratching effect (if you want it) and if you scrub hard for too long you can scrub your skin pink.</li>
            <li> The bristles on the brush are soft enough so that they don&#x27;t scratch, and stiff enough that they give the skin a good scrub. The wooden handle is long enough for people to get a through back scrub. This is a good brush that does the job well.</li>
            <li> A good product, well made, but it would be so much better if it had a curved handle.</li>
            <li> Bristles irritated my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I loved this brush. Well made. Well designed. But could not get past the fact that my skin was itching and getting tiny red spots where I used it. Tried to adjust over a period of a couple of weeks, but the problem remained. Minor irritation really, but caused me to discontinue use.</li>
            <li> Spend the extra money and get a real quality brush.  If you are serious about back brushing,  this is the one.  Spend the extra on yourself.  You are worth it!</li>
            <li> Good quality. But smells when wet.</li>
            <li> Finally, a brush that has the reach I need without bristles that draw blood.</li>
            <li> nice quality brush, dont like the finish of the wood handle, the raw unfinished feel is annoying. feels like you are going to get a splinter. would be better if the wood was finished and not raw, but the bristles are nice and worrks really well. i would probably not reccommend the wood handle the way it is finished</li>
            <li> Very nice brush - the bristles are not too soft, nor are they abrasive. Pretty much &#x27;just right&#x27; for the job. It does have a long handle which is nice for reaching one&#x27;s lower back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update once I&#x27;ve used it for a while to its durability.</li>
            <li> Nicest brush I have ever owned. You won&#x27;t be sorry, it&#x27;s well worth the price for real wood and real hog bristles.</li>
            <li> yes this is a great bathroom item for washing your back...I love it...been using it over 6 months.  will buy again</li>
            <li> The bristles on this brush are stiff enough for a good scrub but not so much they will turn your skin cherry red.  The handle is solid and this brush is really well made.  Just what I was hoping for!</li>
            <li> The bristles on this thing are stiff without being gouging. They are soft enough to scratch your back but not tough enough to leave you raw afterward. The wood is comfortable in your hand and is dry and treated. My wife, who is pregnant, has really dry skin and this brush is the best back-scratcher we&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s able to take the dead skin off, in or out of the shower, without be grating or having to push really hard. I&#x27;d recommend this bath brush to anyone and everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that it&#x27;s difficult to scratch your own back with.</li>
            <li> Wow...this brush is legit! Excellent construction and sturdy piece of wood. 5/5...would def recommend!</li>
            <li> I always use a bath brush; especially in the winter months, to help relieve itch, but to also exfoliate my skin.  I like to do spray tans when I need a little color, and exfoliation is key to not looking like a splotchy Oompa Loompa.  Besides the necessity, it feels great.  The bristle aren&#x27;t too abrasive.  My favorite feature of this brush, is it is a solid piece and doesn&#x27;t come apart, or break.  It&#x27;s always nice to get the most out of your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased many wooden bath brushes over the years and all of them have been flawed in some way, until now. The detachable ones detach when you don&#x27;t want them too. The ones that have bristles attached to a plastic disc that has been nailed on with tacks can come loose and fall off. (If you&#x27;re not careful, you can really hurt yourself badly on the nails.) The ones that look soft, often have bristles so rough they practically flay you alive. The ones that look firm turn mushy within a week. The short ones don&#x27;t cut it for reach. The ones that look like expensive polished wood are often cheaper than they appear and splinter/lose slivers, or the veneer starts cracking and flaking everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one has a nice, long handle. The entire thing is one piece of solid wood. I don&#x27;t expect it to break or wear out quickly, although of course, time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only comment that isn&#x27;t 100% positive is that if you have a very small shower area with solid doors, the handle might be TOO long. I wind up banging this around a bit (which is how I know it&#x27;s sturdy!) because we have a very compact shower, but that wouldn&#x27;t make me purchase one with a smaller handle after owning this one. If you have a normal-sized shower it should be fine. If you have a large shower or bath, this would be the ultimate luxury brush, even if it is just simple, unfinished wood. It&#x27;s actually better that way!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for a year now. Used daily and no real signs of wear. Bristles still in good shape, handle hasn&#x27;t warped, split, cracked, or changed shape. Simply rinse it well after use and let it dry. If it ever wears out, I&#x27;ll definitely buy another one.</li>
            <li> This item is evidence that you get what you pay for. Gets an A in functionality, quality, and comfort when in use. This item should never be brushed aside.</li>
            <li> I have this companys other brushes and will just say these people know how to make brushes and top quality ones at that. First off the brush density is apparent much more the cheaper ones . The brush is firm but not stiff  and personally I think they have the comfort just right with the Boar bristles The handles are well made and finished well I would have liked it better if the head was slightly angled  as it is straight and would contact the back at a a more comfortable and effective angle. I liked this brush so much  I ordered another and cut the handle off leaving a 6 inch handle as I like to scrub myself with a brush also and this brush is soft enough to really do such a fine job I rounded off the end of the handle drilled a 3/8 chamfered hole in  it and used the rope it came with and can now also hang it up in the shower. All in all this is one fine brush and while it is a little pricey This is one fine brush and should last quite some time</li>
            <li> Best back brush I&#x27;ve owned so far.  The bristles are not too soft and not too hard......just right.  I like that the handle is wood because the brushes with plastic handles always slip from my grip and eventually break. It would be nice to have a slight curve to the brush/handle, but it still does a fine job. Very pleased with the purchase. Delivered quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li> The brush was all I expected.  Delivered as promised.  I recommend the product and the supplier.</li>
            <li> Too soft and poor shape.</li>
            <li> Love at first scrub.  Firm enough but not too firm.  Nice long handle.  Super for a back scratcher on dry skin as well.</li>
            <li> I have started to &#x27;dry brush&#x27; and was using a shorter handled brush (also purchased on Amazon) but wasn&#x27;t able to access the back of me.  This brush not only is perfect for the job, but it is made exquisitely.  The wood is very smooth and the brush is lovely just-firm-enough natural bristles.  It feels like heaven on the tenderer parts of me like my décolletage and under arms.  Pair this with the sugar scrubs that are offered here by the 3&#x27;s and your dry brushing followed by scrub experience is complete.</li>
            <li> This brush does do the job.  Because of the long handle it can be a little tough if  you have only a small shower space but all in all I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> love it.  use it everyday</li>
            <li> well made but they should have curved the handle</li>
            <li> I really like this &amp;#34;Back Scrubber&amp;#34;. It has a nice long handle, is well made and does a great job. I recommend this bath brush.</li>
            <li> Just Right!  I like the natural finished wood.  I like the bristles...  Perfect for me!</li>
            <li> Being single this is a wonderful product</li>
            <li> After much research, I chose this brush and I am very happy about it. Beautifully made, the way the bristles are placed into the wood it does not look like they will ever separate as some reviewers have complained about in other brands. well balanced, the bristles are both smooth but firm enough to really scrub your back. Also, the middle of the bristles on the brush are slightly elevated for better skin to brush contact. The wood handle is also very nice, just a great brush, buy this one!</li>
            <li> So far, this is the best back brush I have ever purchased. It has a long handle which is great because my previous brushes weren&#x27;t long enough to reach all parts of my back. The bristles feel somewhat soft but they are densely packed and therefore firm and just right for folks who don&#x27;t like soft brushes.</li>
            <li> Beautifully made brush.  Strong with natural bristles.  Great for scrubbing back, but also for the bottom of your feet and lower legs.  Long wooden handle means you don&#x27;t have to bend down so far.  I was looking for brushes that last a long time and don&#x27;t break in half and this brush is perfect.</li>
            <li> I am glad I went with the reviews.  It is worth the price.  Well made.  Brush feels great - just right - not too hard &amp; not too soft.</li>
            <li> The bristles are just right but the humid environment made the wooden part turned black.  Overall, the quality is very good.</li>
            <li> Nice long handle so you can reach your entire back. Bristles aren&#x27;t too firm and cleans very well.</li>
            <li> I use this for dry body brushing to stimulate lymph fluid movement and it feels awesome!</li>
            <li> Great product will definitely only buy from them again. High quality and cool backstory.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush for my partner, and he&#x27;s enjoying it greatly &amp;#34;day after day&amp;#34;. He&#x27;s a big guy, and with this brush can now reach his whole back. Money well spent!</li>
            <li> The brush is sturdy and well made, but the brush bristle area is too narrow for a body bath or shower.  Please make it wider so it will be easier to use.  The bristles are a perfect strength, not too soft or hard, and the handle is a nice enough length to get to those hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> I really love this brush it cleans well without feeling pain.  Like the feeling of being truly clean when done in the shower!  It is made very well used it for about a month now no complaints.  Seems to be holding up very well. 07/07/14  Update 04/29/16  I purchased my second(replacement) brush.  The one I have still works fine holding up very well.  Beginning to notice head bristle side is turning black. Not bad for almost two years of use.</li>
            <li> Then this is the scrubber you have been looking for. I am 6&#x27;3&amp;#34; so I&#x27;ve got a lot of real estate I can&#x27;t reach with a standard length back scrubber without disconnecting my shoulder. Plus the bristles are not too soft and definitely not too stiff.  Top quality materials, well assembled, very happy I made the investment in this brush.</li>
            <li> its ok but not worht the price I paid for it</li>
            <li> This is the Best Bath Brush I&#x27;ve bought. It&#x27;s solid wood and long enough to reach everywhere. The bristles are just right.</li>
            <li> well made use allmost daily</li>
            <li> Great durable bath brush one of the best that I ever owned!</li>
            <li> Initially, this was almost too scratchy, but it has softened over a few weeks.  The brush is very dense and the handle good and long.</li>
            <li> Well crafted. I do mean crafted not manufactured. There are sooo many poor quality back brushes on the market. This one will be in the shower for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Handle is long - perfect for tall people.</li>
            <li> I really like this bath brush. The right size, a little scratchy but not harsh. One piece. Perfect</li>
            <li> The handle is plenty long enough to reach all the way down to the small of the back.  The bristles are just firm enough without being so firm that they hurt sensitive areas.  Unlike brushes with plastic handles, your grip actually gets better when your hands and/or the handle get wet!  Even if your gripping hand has some soap on it your grip on the beechwood handle is still far better than it would be on a plastic handle under the same conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This B&amp;uuml;rstenhaus Redecker brush is obviously very well put together, and I fully expect it to last a very long time with proper care.  Proper care is simply rinsing it well with hot water, shaking out the excess water and hanging it to dry.  I would definitely recommend this brush to a friend, or give it as a gift!</li>
            <li> Mildews after a week even when carefully dried, otherwise not bad if you don&#x27;t mind scrubbing your skin in that proximity to mold.</li>
            <li> Tried plastic brushes, they always break.  Too early to tell how long this will last, however I think the brushes will fall out before the handle breaks.  Long reach, sturdy and brushed tight enough that soap does not fall through the brushes.  Overall very happy</li>
            <li> Love it.  Had to replace my old one.  Bristles are stiff and the handle is plenty long.</li>
            <li> Finally--a back brush with a long handle that won&#x27;t fall apart or get mushy bristles in the first year. This is the first brush I could say that about since my late, beloved Bath &amp; Body Works brush died three years ago (after a six-year run). It&#x27;s not cheap, but it&#x27;s not outrageously expensive, either, and this seems to be a category where you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Very nice.  Best brush I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> Very high quality basic back brush.  Dense bristles that clean while floating over the skin.  I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Very nice brush with the boar bristles right in the wood, not in plastic.  Like that the brush is on piece so that the head does not fall off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK. Bristles are right for me (not to soft). Needs a curved handle.</li>
            <li> This brush replaced one that had the nubby scrubbers between the bristles. This has turned out to be just as good/better without the scrubbers. The bristles feel good, they clean well.&lt;br /&gt;The handle is a little too long in one respect (I keep hitting the shower wall), but is an improvement over the previous brush in reach for back scrubbing.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, well pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> This back brush helps me reach places I cannot get to with an ordinary brush. It feels good on my skin, wish I had known about this one long ago.</li>
            <li> Now THIS is a back scrubber!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are thick and firm. They aren&#x27;t too rough on the skin. It holds soap well. I have not had any issues with the bristles coming out of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is very long and made from good quality wood. I don&#x27;t see any issues with this product.</li>
            <li> Love handle length! The extra length in the handle makes it great to reach ALL my back. The bristles are firm enough to give a good scrub, yet soft enough they don&#x27;t rub off the hide. Strong handle. Don&#x27;t expect it will ever break. If this one wears out I will get another. The wood is smooth and feels great before using, but once exposed to water and drying it has a little fuzzy texture. I would have liked it sealed. My solution was to use paste type shoe polish (like Kiwi brand). I rubbed it all over the wood, avoiding the bristles. Then using a soft rags I buffed it up like you do shoes. This should be done before you ever get it wet so the grain doesn&#x27;t raise a little. This is working fine for me. Fussy point, but my fix.</li>
            <li> perfect for my 6ft 2inch husband</li>
            <li> A great bath brush with a smooth longer handle and plush bristles. I do wonder if I should put a coat of marine polyurethane on the wooden handle.</li>
            <li> Extremely rigid bristles.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy construction and the longest handle I have found in a bath brush.  I am so pleased with this item I ordered a second one for my other bathroom!</li>
