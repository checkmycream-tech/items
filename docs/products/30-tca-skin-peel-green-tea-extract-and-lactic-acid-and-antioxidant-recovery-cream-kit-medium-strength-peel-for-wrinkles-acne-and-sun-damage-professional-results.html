            <li>Did work great!!</li>
            <li>Awesome!</li>
            <li>Very good peel start out with a lower percentage,work your way up</li>
            <li>some stretch marks on my stomach works great</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, VERY good seller + VERY good product!</li>
            <li>I think it is best not to have that the first time because you can overdo.</li>
            <li>I sure do!  ðŸ˜€</li>
            <li>Great item and received very quickly.</li>
            <li>your own risk.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong and gives a good even peel if applied correctly</li>
            <li>This is a very strong peel.</li>
            <li>Very happy so far.</li>
            <li>Do research to see if this strength is suitable for your skin tone and skin issues like Sun spots.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t do more than 2 minutes</li>
            <li>Ok so I just started using this product.</li>
            <li>But it did leave me with more youthful looking skin - smooth, brighter looking, no spots!</li>
            <li>this product didn&#x27;t have any reviews, but I am beyond satisfied with this peel.  </li>
            <li>NO JOKE - this is STRONG.</li>
            <li>I let it do its process and after the results were beautiful but did not last</li>
            <li>If you use it properly, and do the appropriate research, and take the appropriate precautions, you will have AMAZING results.  </li>
            <li>But, the product and the cream that comes in this kit are fantastic.</li>
            <li>I think it would be best to only do had your face at a time so that you can remove it quickly and do the areas of thicker skin first.</li>
            <li>Works great, YOU MUST follow instructions and DONT leave it on for too long 1min n</li>
            <li>Product works well and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Do research, be prepared for the intense discomfort that comes with applying a strong acid to your skin (it passes relatively quickly), be patient through the peeling, and enjoy your new never-been-touched skin.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>Glad I only did a test area as suggested.</li>
            <li>Follow directions exactly.</li>
            <li>Follow directions exactly &amp; increase time</li>
            <li>This is exactly what it says it is.  </li>
            <li>Follow the directions exactly and go with the minimum time.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li>Works exactly as described.</li>
            <li>My age spots are lighting and my skin is super soft.</li>
            <li>but on certain spots I did it 3 times over a couple months.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>Thanks a lot</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really care much for the product.</li>
            <li>under til your skin adjusts, be prepared to peel as expected but it leaves skin beautiful, I was a picker at pimples and in one treatment it erased more than all products I&#x27;ve tried over last few years, I suggest buying extra of the cream n</li>
            <li>Is that normal?</li>
            <li>I started with just certain spots &amp; later sections of skin.</li>
            <li>Clearly they were fakes.</li>
            <li>Absolutely everyone&#x27;s skin is different</li>
            <li>Have used it twice so far for the minimum time recommended</li>
            <li>Be aware it&#x27;s not clear</li>
            <li>The result were only temporary, frickles came right back</li>
            <li>so definitely do the test on a place that doesn&#x27;t show first and remember that body &amp; face skin are different.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not willing to risk a higher strengths and cause burns</li>
            <li>Begin with a less powerful peel first &amp; wait at least 2 wks.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very painful. I can&#x27;t do more than 2 minutes so it takes a couple months to see the final results.Very happy so far. My age spots are lighting and my skin is super soft.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> Ok so I just started using this product. It burns but not unbearable. It does leave my skin hard though. Is that normal? When can I expect it to peel?  Centrally rate it because I just started using so I will give it a 1. Depending on the outcome, it may change.</li>
            <li> Product works well and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Very good peel start out with a lower percentage,work your way up</li>
            <li> Will not order again, it took the 10 days to heal, as the directions stated, BUT, while I was healing I looked like a burn victim. Glad I only did a test area as suggested.</li>
            <li> This peel works. Begin with a less powerful peel first &amp; wait at least 2 wks. so skin is conditioned to peeling. Absolutely everyone&#x27;s skin is different so definitely do the test on a place that doesn&#x27;t show first and remember that body &amp; face skin are different. Follow directions exactly. I did this peel for leg and arm skin which was dry, dull, scaly looking, &amp; has age spots. I started with just certain spots &amp; later sections of skin. I didn&#x27;t have skin turn white during peel all the time. I think it is best not to have that the first time because you can overdo. So I did this peel several times a couple weeks apart. Skin got flaky in some areas and in others turned brown and then flaky. It was ugly &amp; lasted 2 weeks so be prepared for that. But it did leave me with more youthful looking skin - smooth, brighter looking, no spots! Follow directions exactly &amp; increase time w/each peel. Must use sun block after! I think I did one peel on one area but on certain spots I did it 3 times over a couple months. Now I am using a hylauronic acid lotion and some oils on my skin. And sun block!</li>
            <li> I prolonged the use of this product. I ended up using it last week, and it burn my skin. I&#x27;m African-American this did my problem area no good. Use @ your own risk.</li>
            <li> Great item and received very quickly.</li>
            <li> I burned my face with this. I think it would be best to only do had your face at a time so that you can remove it quickly and do the areas of thicker skin first. Don&#x27;t do around your lips till last. Did work great!! I just had an issue with application.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying this product because there was only ONE review. I usually like to read other people&#x27;s reviews before buying a product. This product does what it says. I applied it earlier this week and I can now say that I am peeling!! I only did a test spot, but it is working. Will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what it says it is.  If you use it properly, and do the appropriate research, and take the appropriate precautions, you will have AMAZING results.  I was worried considering this product didn&#x27;t have any reviews, but I am beyond satisfied with this peel.  Do research, be prepared for the intense discomfort that comes with applying a strong acid to your skin (it passes relatively quickly), be patient through the peeling, and enjoy your new never-been-touched skin. I sure do!  ðŸ˜€</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  Have used it twice so far for the minimum time recommended but I am seeing results on my dark spots. I have very dark melasma.  They are fading.  Follow the directions exactly and go with the minimum time.  This is a very strong peel.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, VERY good seller + VERY good product! Thanks a lot</li>
            <li> Works great, YOU MUST follow instructions and DONT leave it on for too long 1min n under til your skin adjusts, be prepared to peel as expected but it leaves skin beautiful, I was a picker at pimples and in one treatment it erased more than all products I&#x27;ve tried over last few years, I suggest buying extra of the cream n remember it does burn, but beauty is pain!!!</li>
            <li> NO JOKE - this is STRONG. I would not do a 30% peel again. To harsh for me. But, the product and the cream that comes in this kit are fantastic.</li>
            <li> Awesome! I&#x27;ve ordered the same strength from other companies and I didn&#x27;t peel at all. Clearly they were fakes. This is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for. It&#x27;s strong and gives a good even peel if applied correctly</li>
            <li> Be aware it&#x27;s not clear it&#x27;s like tea colored. I used it on lightening my tattoo so I could get it covered up and some stretch marks on my stomach works great will have to use several treatments but I&#x27;m not willing to risk a higher strengths and cause burns</li>
            <li> Works exactly as described. Comes with instructions! Use as directed and you should have no problems. Again, follow instructions carefully. Will need to do test spot on face! Do research to see if this strength is suitable for your skin tone and skin issues like Sun spots.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really care much for the product. It burned my face really badly and I was like that for two weeks. Looked like someone dragged my face against the rug and looked like a seriously bad rug burned. I let it do its process and after the results were beautiful but did not last I did everything it said to do, keep out of the sun, put sun screen on I had 40SPF, etc. The result were only temporary, frickles came right back and my scars did not even go away.</li>
