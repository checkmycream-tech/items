            <li>Thank you for making them, Swisspers, along with your organic cotton rounds, which I also buy and love! :D</li>
            <li>Cotton swabs are great.</li>
            <li>I have been happy to even find these since Qtip dropped out of the market.  </li>
            <li>Great - organic and sturdy.  </li>
            <li>and they worked great at getting all the water out.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Sturdy and great quality.</li>
            <li>It feels good to know they aren&#x27;t made of plastic.  </li>
            <li>There is also a good amount of cotton, and I did not feel the stick poking through.</li>
            <li>is anything now manufactured quite as good as it &amp;#34;used to be&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>amount of cotton is good.  </li>
            <li>I struggled with off brands, some of which Amazon also sells, but none of them were nearly as good as the Q-Tip brand.  </li>
            <li>I would say almost as good as the J&amp;Js.</li>
            <li>Clean ears and no water &#x3D; Happy Me!</li>
            <li>not quite sure why they are using them like a jack-hammer on their ears though!  </li>
            <li>I am one of those people who LOVE cleaning my ears and those flimsy q-tips from the store always break!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>Good price, work great to clean out my ears because the shaft is wood, not cardboard.</li>
            <li>Their strength and firmness just seems to make them more pleasant and easier to use.  </li>
            <li>So nice to have a cotton swab that does not bend and flex all over the place.</li>
            <li>Not to mention that the crops, themselves, have been specifically engineered to BE a pesticide all on their own.</li>
            <li>But I liked this brand for the claims it makes.</li>
            <li>JUST GOT THESE TODAY, AND THEY ARE NICE.</li>
            <li>The cotton is full and they work great.</li>
            <li>The stick is very strong and they have lots of cotton on the ends.  </li>
            <li>I love these cotton swabs and will never buy another kind.</li>
            <li>Greatest cotton swabs available but buy soon because they sell out fast!</li>
            <li>Well, the first box received from Subscribe &amp; Save was great.</li>
            <li>These seem to work fine, are sturdy, not meager, and I&#x27;m happy they&#x27;re organic.</li>
            <li>So glad I got them.  </li>
            <li>(it is more rigid, there is no flexibility in the stick).</li>
            <li>The wooden part of the swab stays in tact, never splinters (like some others out there), and is reliably the best product of it&#x27;s type, period.</li>
            <li>Pluses   Wood sticks are perfectly formed and solid.</li>
            <li>Organic Cotton bleached with hydrogen peroxide, interesting.   </li>
            <li>As I continue to become more eco-conscious and buy items that are cruelty free, these fill the bill quite nicely.  </li>
            <li>The improvement would be more cotton on on the tips of the swabs</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been making the switch to more organic, all-natural products and decided to try these out</li>
            <li>I was expecting more based on the reviews here.  </li>
            <li>or you got more for your money...</li>
            <li>Q-tips brand is second best.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many of the wood stick cotton swabs and none come close to Q-tips.</li>
            <li>Compared to the leading in-store brand, these swabs are way more durable and seem to be better in quality.</li>
            <li>organic cotton swabs...whats not to love :-)</li>
            <li>best wooden stick swab since  Q tips are unavailable.  </li>
            <li>Even ignoring the fact that these saved me time and gas from not having to drive anywhere, these are simply the best &#x27;cotton swabs on sticks&#x27;</li>
            <li>This happens to any cotton swab so they are either comparable to Q-Tips and/or somehow better than the generics I tried, in this regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>BETTER</li>
            <li>and many of them have no cotton at all.</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>love them keep on making</li>
            <li>Fast Delivery, Great product</li>
            <li>What kind of person gets excited about wod stick cotton swabs?  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say there the softest as someone had said, but there pretty good.</li>
            <li>These are a great flash-back to the old days.</li>
            <li>Having said that, they are still better than the flexible swabs available elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>(they are also pretty good for the price) and I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;... for all other uses great product!</li>
            <li>Cotton has no substance and easily unravels.   </li>
            <li>So smooth and comfortable and absorbent, it is possibly better than the Q-Tip brand wood swabs.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re sturdy, strong, and I don&#x27;t go through 2-3 when all I should need is one swab.</li>
            <li>THESE ARE MADE OUT OF WOOD, AND THEY ARE STRONG.</li>
            <li>So... I will not be going near any GMO cotton, or anything else that is GMO; and so I&#x27;m THRILLED for these organic cotton swabs!  </li>
            <li>sufficient cotton ends for safe, adequate ends.  </li>
            <li>these weren&#x27;t exactly cheap.</li>
            <li>I wanted something sturdy to clean my cat&#x27;s ears and they work just fine.</li>
            <li>These are nicely made, soft and easy on the ear.</li>
            <li>I had hoped for an environmentally friendly product, but it comes wrapped in plastic, in addition to the box having a plastic window.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t recommend using this wood stick to clean ear.</li>
            <li>What this means - they break when trying to clean your ears out.  </li>
            <li>They are soft and strong; you couldn&#x27;t ask for more as far as usability, and they are organic, so good for the environment as well.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you if it&#x27;s all true</li>
            <li>I bought these in the store and they are just as good as qtips...since I guess they are the way qtips used to be before they stopped using wooden sticks.</li>
            <li>These are great though, just like the old J&amp;J as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li>Super value and quality.</li>
            <li>Love the look of the wooden sticks - love the fact they are organic swabs...</li>
            <li>Very consistent quality on all of them (?).</li>
            <li>The very first one I used after taking a shower literally felt like I was use a cloud instead of cotton.  </li>
            <li>Sturdy cotton swabs, better than the plastic ones by far!</li>
            <li>Will purchase again as I get both a practical and pretty product!</li>
            <li>but it has to be as good as the conventional product.</li>
            <li>I EXTRA great about using these because I simply throw them in the compost pile when I am done.  </li>
            <li>These do exactly what they are supposed to, and also are biodegradable  -</li>
            <li>I would never use anything but wooden Q-tips their much better than the others.</li>
            <li>Sure, the stems are wooden</li>
            <li>Yeah, I know that description is convoluted, but that&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for:</li>
            <li>/&gt;What makes these my favorite cotton swabs if the wooden sticks, however.  </li>
            <li>Equally important is that there isn&#x27;t shredding and unwinding right away, and no loose fibers on the exterior.  </li>
            <li>Cleans well and is useful with solid wood sticks, not flimsy cheap ones.</li>
            <li>stick swabs and want a high quality, comfortable, sturdy and very soft swab, these are your answer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>far superior to your other option.</li>
            <li>I bought &amp;#34;Curity&amp;#34; swabs in the 1000 pack from medical suppliers for years, but my latest shipment was made by some new company (Covidien) instead of Kendall.</li>
            <li>he really likes these.</li>
            <li>I have noticed there is not as much cotton on the tip.  </li>
            <li>The quality is very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the cotton part is likely synthetic chemical free.</li>
            <li>Now, I use these specifically for my ears only, and the flimsy, cheap ones for makeup etc.</li>
            <li>so they are much easier to use in cosmetic applications.  </li>
            <li>Really recommend them.</li>
            <li>but they are very brittle and break with the slightest force.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to all who reviewed these Swisspers</li>
            <li>I really want to use an organic product</li>
            <li>I find these to be 99% as good as qtips wood sticks, which sadly, aren&#x27;t available anymore.</li>
            <li>I had vacuum packed three boxes of the original wood stick</li>
            <li>So, the Swisspers is a worthy successor to our favorite Q-tips, but the Swisspers are hard to find...probably need to stock up when you find them.</li>
            <li>Complete garbage now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CVS has wooden sticks, but there is not one around me and they are cheap.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like wood swabs when I want to get in the deeper part of the ear without it bending like other cheap plastic brands.</li>
            <li>I have tried many inferior products where you end up with so little cotton that you poke your ear with a stick.</li>
            <li>, I now know these may be one of the last brands of wood stick Q-tips to be worth buying.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am a long time user of Q-Tips, because for me it seemed like generic cotton swabs tended more toward cotton shredding</li>
            <li>They are worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>The wooden sticks are great, but the cotton swabs aren&#x27;t as tight as other swabs.</li>
            <li>I like the feeling of positive control from the wooden sticks.</li>
            <li>I use these primarily for ear hygiene, being careful to be gentle because the sticks would allow you to push harder than normal cardboard-like ones, and for beauty/household purposes.</li>
            <li>but since my Q-tips had been bending lately, I can say I like the wooden sticks better!  </li>
            <li>They either were cheap wood that would break or flex or had so little cotton on them</li>
            <li>I guess I didn&#x27;t read the description very well because the wooden stick surprised me</li>
            <li>They do the job and they do really have wooden sticks in them.  </li>
            <li>Since I like Swisspers pads, I sort of &amp;#34;automatically&amp;#34; purchased these swabs - and yes, they really are on wooden sticks!!  </li>
            <li>WELL THIS IS FAR FROM THE TRUTH.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I need two things, a sturdy swab and a lot of soft</li>
            <li>I was pleased to find that they have firm wooden &amp;#34;sticks.&amp;#34; Purchased 2</li>
            <li>The cotton is not tightly rapped buy does the  job.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve looked high and low and these cannot be beat.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend them, just leave enough for me!</li>
            <li>and it is worth it to avoid conventional cotton.</li>
            <li>It seems silly that someone would make such a big deal out of a wood stick swab, but these things literally make me happy now after I take a shower.</li>
            <li>I prefer the more sturdy wooden base so I have more control while cleaning my ears or anything I use these for.</li>
            <li>For the few dollars these cost, they are SO WORTH IT.</li>
            <li>If you use these to clean delicate items they would probably break too.  </li>
            <li>RoundUp)--is currently sprayed at 10x the rate of former pesticide usage on non-GMO cotton, leaving a major chemical &amp;#34;imprint&amp;#34; on/in the plant.  </li>
            <li>The price is comparable to the more widely known brands in stores and I feel a little better knowing that the wood sticks are not going to be as bad for the landfill as the others I used to buy.  </li>

            <li> I had hoped for an environmentally friendly product, but it comes wrapped in plastic, in addition to the box having a plastic window.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t recommend using this wood stick to clean ear.</li>
            <li> What this means - they break when trying to clean your ears out.  </li>
            <li> They are soft and strong; you couldn&#x27;t ask for more as far as usability, and they are organic, so good for the environment as well.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you if it&#x27;s all true</li>
            <li> I bought these in the store and they are just as good as qtips...since I guess they are the way qtips used to be before they stopped using wooden sticks.</li>
            <li> These are great though, just like the old J&amp;J as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> Super value and quality.</li>
            <li> Love the look of the wooden sticks - love the fact they are organic swabs...</li>
            <li> Very consistent quality on all of them (?).</li>
            <li> The very first one I used after taking a shower literally felt like I was use a cloud instead of cotton.  </li>
            <li> Sturdy cotton swabs, better than the plastic ones by far!</li>
            <li> Will purchase again as I get both a practical and pretty product!</li>
            <li> but it has to be as good as the conventional product.</li>
            <li> I EXTRA great about using these because I simply throw them in the compost pile when I am done.  </li>
            <li> These do exactly what they are supposed to, and also are biodegradable  -</li>
            <li> I would never use anything but wooden Q-tips their much better than the others.</li>
            <li> Sure, the stems are wooden</li>
            <li> Yeah, I know that description is convoluted, but that&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for:</li>
            <li> /&gt;What makes these my favorite cotton swabs if the wooden sticks, however.  </li>
            <li> Equally important is that there isn&#x27;t shredding and unwinding right away, and no loose fibers on the exterior.  </li>
            <li> Cleans well and is useful with solid wood sticks, not flimsy cheap ones.</li>
            <li> stick swabs and want a high quality, comfortable, sturdy and very soft swab, these are your answer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> far superior to your other option.</li>
            <li> I bought &amp;#34;Curity&amp;#34; swabs in the 1000 pack from medical suppliers for years, but my latest shipment was made by some new company (Covidien) instead of Kendall.</li>
            <li> he really likes these.</li>
            <li> I have noticed there is not as much cotton on the tip.  </li>
            <li> The quality is very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the cotton part is likely synthetic chemical free.</li>
            <li> Now, I use these specifically for my ears only, and the flimsy, cheap ones for makeup etc.</li>
            <li> so they are much easier to use in cosmetic applications.  </li>
            <li> Really recommend them.</li>
            <li> but they are very brittle and break with the slightest force.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to all who reviewed these Swisspers</li>
            <li> I really want to use an organic product</li>
            <li> I find these to be 99% as good as qtips wood sticks, which sadly, aren&#x27;t available anymore.</li>
            <li> I had vacuum packed three boxes of the original wood stick</li>
            <li> So, the Swisspers is a worthy successor to our favorite Q-tips, but the Swisspers are hard to find...probably need to stock up when you find them.</li>
            <li> Complete garbage now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CVS has wooden sticks, but there is not one around me and they are cheap.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like wood swabs when I want to get in the deeper part of the ear without it bending like other cheap plastic brands.</li>
            <li> I have tried many inferior products where you end up with so little cotton that you poke your ear with a stick.</li>
            <li> , I now know these may be one of the last brands of wood stick Q-tips to be worth buying.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am a long time user of Q-Tips, because for me it seemed like generic cotton swabs tended more toward cotton shredding</li>
            <li> They are worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> The wooden sticks are great, but the cotton swabs aren&#x27;t as tight as other swabs.</li>
            <li> I like the feeling of positive control from the wooden sticks.</li>
            <li> I use these primarily for ear hygiene, being careful to be gentle because the sticks would allow you to push harder than normal cardboard-like ones, and for beauty/household purposes.</li>
            <li> but since my Q-tips had been bending lately, I can say I like the wooden sticks better!  </li>
            <li> They either were cheap wood that would break or flex or had so little cotton on them</li>
            <li> I guess I didn&#x27;t read the description very well because the wooden stick surprised me</li>
            <li> They do the job and they do really have wooden sticks in them.  </li>
            <li> Since I like Swisspers pads, I sort of &amp;#34;automatically&amp;#34; purchased these swabs - and yes, they really are on wooden sticks!!  </li>
            <li> WELL THIS IS FAR FROM THE TRUTH.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I need two things, a sturdy swab and a lot of soft</li>
            <li> I was pleased to find that they have firm wooden &amp;#34;sticks.&amp;#34; Purchased 2</li>
            <li> The cotton is not tightly rapped buy does the  job.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked high and low and these cannot be beat.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend them, just leave enough for me!</li>
            <li> and it is worth it to avoid conventional cotton.</li>
            <li> It seems silly that someone would make such a big deal out of a wood stick swab, but these things literally make me happy now after I take a shower.</li>
            <li> I prefer the more sturdy wooden base so I have more control while cleaning my ears or anything I use these for.</li>
            <li> For the few dollars these cost, they are SO WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> If you use these to clean delicate items they would probably break too.  </li>
            <li> RoundUp)--is currently sprayed at 10x the rate of former pesticide usage on non-GMO cotton, leaving a major chemical &amp;#34;imprint&amp;#34; on/in the plant.  </li>
            <li> The price is comparable to the more widely known brands in stores and I feel a little better knowing that the wood sticks are not going to be as bad for the landfill as the others I used to buy.  </li>
            <li> These cotton swabs have a decent amount of cotton, and it is tightly wound.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why wooden swabs are so hard to find these days, but they give better control and accuracy than plastic, which flex around too much.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t feel the wood stick through the cotton like you can with what has been available in wood swabs in the past few years.  </li>
            <li> Organic anything is just nice as too many products we buy now a days are just covered with all kinds of dangerous products and something some of us use daily can become a little scary to me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;BTW, Walgreens, doesn&#x27;t sell a single brand with wooden sticks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seemed like every time I tried a different brand of cotton swab, I was met with some flimsy, plastic swab with a thin layer of cotton that just pulled right</li>
            <li> It was just like old fashioned swabs but with a tightly wound tip.</li>
            <li> Be careful if you use these to (forgive me here) stick up your nose to apply Almond Oil or similar for sinus probs</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m betting this chemical smell and feel is likely due to the cotton being GMO,</li>
            <li> Often I feel like I need to use 2 tips to dry each ear after a shower.  </li>
            <li> In order to get them dry</li>
            <li> Obviously because they are so thin unable to handle any kind of stress exerted on them with the relatively long leverage arm you would apply force to in using these.  </li>
            <li> Cotton on tip of stick is loosely put and shreds when you use it.</li>
            <li> I have gotten tired of using the Qtip brand, as the middle part gets flexible when the humidity gets too high around here.</li>
            <li> The generic brands often also seemed to have less cotton padding on the sticks.  </li>
            <li> I still have a small stash of Q-Tip wooden swabs left, and I must say these Swisspers are not comparable.  </li>
            <li> The quality of the Swisspers second box, however, leaves little to be desired.</li>
            <li> like blue pill q tips  stiff</li>
            <li> Then I stayed with Q-Tips, but the quality has gone down so low that all they do is bend in half whenever I use them.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s dangerous when you use wood stick to clean the ear.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as soft and thick as traditional a tips</li>
            <li> I have not had any issues with breakage like other reviewers have had -</li>
            <li> I was not able to purchase organic cotton swabs at my local store.</li>
            <li> cotton swabs work like any other brand i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> other swabbing needs</li>
            <li> I use these for other things now</li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t have much cotton on the ends making them uncomfortable to use in the ear</li>
            <li> For some reason the older version wooden swabs have an annoying way of unraveling mid use.</li>
            <li> Any pressure applied at all results in the product snapping in half.</li>
            <li> Definitely not good, especially if it is in one&#x27;s ear.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s disappointing because I wanted organic to use with organic oil for this exact purpose.</li>
            <li> They were always breaking on me, sometimes suddenly poking me with the sharp broken ends.  </li>
            <li> The cotton will start to pull a little bit as you use them (depending on how vigorous), but not not in a way that has detracted from their effectiveness.  </li>
            <li> (this does rock in cold dry weather for your sinuses) because I have had 2 catch with splinters so far.</li>
            <li> I always try to buy green products...</li>
            <li> had any trouble with the cotton at the tip.</li>
            <li> They would break and a few times</li>
            <li> They are the only one I will use and I am addicted to them.</li>
            <li> The cotton swabs are less tightly packed, not as thick,  and have a tendency to slide off the stick.  </li>
            <li> It is a small container</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m serious about wood stick swabs.  </li>
            <li> Not good &amp;</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed when J&amp;J stopped making the wooden sticks.  </li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> my wife had to pick out the broken piece out of my ear with tweasers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> thick stuff like cold neosporin&lt;</li>
            <li> None lodged in there, but noses are delicate and it was PAINFUL.</li>
            <li> The other brands of wood sticks I tried were all using really nasty wood in their sticks.  </li>
            <li> One of the worst cotton Swabs......don&#x27;t waste your money. ....</li>
            <li> dangerous if you are groggy in the morning and don&#x27;t pay attention and inspect each q-tip before using it.</li>
            <li> Covidien ones break approximately 75% of the time; totally worthless.</li>
            <li> Hate the paper sticks because they bend.</li>
            <li> I hate having water in my ears.  </li>
            <li> Buy this product, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!  </li>
            <li> but it drives me absolutely insane.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These are the best cotton swabs ever!  So glad I got them.  It feels good to know they aren&#x27;t made of plastic.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Cotton on tip of stick is loosely put and shreds when you use it. That&#x27;s dangerous when you use wood stick to clean the ear. Cotton shreds inside ear and gets caught there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend using this wood stick to clean ear.</li>
            <li> These do exactly what they are supposed to, and also are biodegradable  - what not to like? I used to use generic plastic swabs for years, but these are wooden, so it took me a couple of times to get used to it. Wood of course does not band, so these swabs have a different feel to it (it is more rigid, there is no flexibility in the stick). Cotton stays on and does not unravel. Overall, I would suggest it to anyone!</li>
            <li> These are the best cotton swabs on wood sticks I can find!  Our entire family loves them.  We do not care for the cotton swabs on cardboard sticks.  I know cardboard is supposed to be safer to use, but if carefully used by an adult, I don&#x27;t see any reason for concern with the wooden sticks.  Please don&#x27;t stop making these!</li>
            <li> One of the worst cotton Swabs......don&#x27;t waste your money. ....</li>
            <li> If you miss the discontinued wooden Q-tips then these are for you.  I was really disappointed when J&amp;J stopped making the wooden sticks.  The paper sticks are just too flimsy for me.  The other brands of wood sticks I tried were all using really nasty wood in their sticks.  They were always breaking on me, sometimes suddenly poking me with the sharp broken ends.  These are great though, just like the old J&amp;J as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> My husband missed using the name brand that stopped making this style q-tip.......he really likes these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all, and this one, without a doubt, is the best earswab going.  The wooden part of the swab stays in tact, never splinters (like some others out there), and is reliably the best product of it&#x27;s type, period.</li>
            <li> Super value and quality. I&#x27;ve looked high and low and these cannot be beat.</li>
            <li> I have noticed there is not as much cotton on the tip.  Often I feel like I need to use 2 tips to dry each ear after a shower.  I&#x27;ve also noticed the tips are not as compressed and therefore do not provide as defined an edge for erasing mascara along the eyelid line.  I will probably try these again in 6 months to see if they&#x27;ve improved as I do want an organic cotton swab.</li>
            <li> I like the feeling of positive control from the wooden sticks. But there&#x27;s not a lot of cotton on them.</li>
            <li> I wanted something sturdy to clean my cat&#x27;s ears and they work just fine. They don&#x27;t bend or break. He hates them tho</li>
            <li> Cotton swabs are great.</li>
            <li> I prefer the more sturdy wooden base so I have more control while cleaning my ears or anything I use these for.</li>
            <li> 7/18/2016 Update  This product is not what it used to be,  With the last shipment I have noticed that some of the wooden sticks are prone to break.     Pluses   Wood sticks are perfectly formed and solid. They do the job and they do really have wooden sticks in them.  The cotton is not tightly rapped buy does the  job.  Minuses   Organic Cotton bleached with hydrogen peroxide, interesting.   Cotton has no substance and easily unravels.   It says don&#x27;t put these in your ear canal.  In my book that is the only reason to buy wooden qtips.</li>
            <li> I love these cotton swabs and will never buy another kind. They are soft and strong; you couldn&#x27;t ask for more as far as usability, and they are organic, so good for the environment as well.</li>
            <li> very sturdy tips, just what I was looking for !!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> So nice to have a cotton swab that does not bend and flex all over the place. I have gotten tired of using the Qtip brand, as the middle part gets flexible when the humidity gets too high around here. These are a great flash-back to the old days. There is also a good amount of cotton, and I did not feel the stick poking through.</li>
            <li> I always try to buy green products...especially, when I&#x27;m using them on myself or surfaces I&#x27;m coming into contact with regularly.</li>
            <li> I had hoped for an environmentally friendly product, but it comes wrapped in plastic, in addition to the box having a plastic window. Not happy.</li>
            <li> These are the BEST cotton swabs ever!!</li>
            <li> I used to buy Q-tips until every box I bought (from various stores) suddenly had a chemical odor to them that also bothered my ears and nose.  So did the store brands, which makes me think perhaps they&#x27;re all manufactured in the same place.  I&#x27;m betting this chemical smell and feel is likely due to the cotton being GMO, as currently 88% of all cotton crops grown in the US are GE crops.  The chemical sprayed on the crops--glyphosate (aka: RoundUp)--is currently sprayed at 10x the rate of former pesticide usage on non-GMO cotton, leaving a major chemical &amp;#34;imprint&amp;#34; on/in the plant.  Glyphosate is systemic; it can&#x27;t be washed off.  Not to mention that the crops, themselves, have been specifically engineered to BE a pesticide all on their own. So... I will not be going near any GMO cotton, or anything else that is GMO; and so I&#x27;m THRILLED for these organic cotton swabs!  They&#x27;re excellent!  Thank you for making them, Swisspers, along with your organic cotton rounds, which I also buy and love! :D</li>
            <li> The quality is very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the stick part is FSC certified and the cotton part is likely synthetic chemical free.</li>
            <li> I have been happy to even find these since Qtip dropped out of the market.  I have not had any issues with breakage like other reviewers have had - not quite sure why they are using them like a jack-hammer on their ears though!  May not be quite the quality as Qtips were back in the 1980&#x27;s but is anything now manufactured quite as good as it &amp;#34;used to be&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I find the padding sufficient and the stick sturdy.</li>
            <li> I was not able to purchase organic cotton swabs at my local store. I was grateful to find them on Amazon. I was pleased to find that they have firm wooden &amp;#34;sticks.&amp;#34; Purchased 2 so l have a spare.</li>
            <li> I am one of those people who LOVE cleaning my ears and those flimsy q-tips from the store always break! Now, I use these specifically for my ears only, and the flimsy, cheap ones for makeup etc. For the few dollars these cost, they are SO WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> As I continue to become more eco-conscious and buy items that are cruelty free, these fill the bill quite nicely.  The price is comparable to the more widely known brands in stores and I feel a little better knowing that the wood sticks are not going to be as bad for the landfill as the others I used to buy.  The wood stick swabs also are not flexible so they are much easier to use in cosmetic applications.  The improvement would be more cotton on on the tips of the swabs</li>
            <li> I guess I didn&#x27;t read the description very well because the wooden stick surprised me (yeah, yeah, I know).  Since I like Swisspers pads, I sort of &amp;#34;automatically&amp;#34; purchased these swabs - and yes, they really are on wooden sticks!!  I like it!  It is a small container but since my Q-tips had been bending lately, I can say I like the wooden sticks better!  I like they are organic, too.  I will be purchasing them again.</li>
            <li> Well, the first box received from Subscribe &amp; Save was great. It was just like old fashioned swabs but with a tightly wound tip. For some reason the older version wooden swabs have an annoying way of unraveling mid use. Definitely not good, especially if it is in one&#x27;s ear. The quality of the Swisspers second box, however, leaves little to be desired. Any pressure applied at all results in the product snapping in half.</li>
            <li> Sturdy cotton swabs, better than the plastic ones by far!</li>
            <li> I like the quality - no missed tips, stay on the stick, sturdy, I wish they came in larger packs!</li>
            <li> Ever since the local supermarket stopped selling wooden Q-tips I have been purchasing them on Amazon. I would never use anything but wooden Q-tips their much better than the others.</li>
            <li> cotton swabs work like any other brand i&#x27;ve ever used. compostable. i like the brown and wood.</li>
            <li> As a life-long Q-Tip brand buyer, I was hesitant to try these out.  It seemed like every time I tried a different brand of cotton swab, I was met with some flimsy, plastic swab with a thin layer of cotton that just pulled right off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been making the switch to more organic, all-natural products and decided to try these out (they are also pretty good for the price) and I was not disappointed.  They&#x27;re sturdy, strong, and I don&#x27;t go through 2-3 when all I should need is one swab.</li>
            <li> like blue pill q tips  stiff&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;really get in there&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;wood&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tip&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;apply thick stuff like cold neosporin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and other swabbing needs</li>
            <li> I will never go back to &amp;#34;Q-tips&amp;#34; now that I&#x27;ve tried these! They are the best!!!</li>
            <li> The best cotton swabs I have ever used.  The stick is very strong and they have lots of cotton on the ends.  Really recommend them.</li>
            <li> Great - organic and sturdy.  Love it!</li>
            <li> These are the only wooden-stick swabs of any quality I can find.  Very consistent quality on all of them (?).</li>
            <li> Sturdy&lt;br /&gt;Wood and cotton&lt;br /&gt;If you use in ears ( not advised per manufacturer)  the wood is scratchy and like sandpaper and will irritate outside of ear if it touches.&lt;br /&gt;... for all other uses great product!</li>
            <li> I was expecting more based on the reviews here.  These are different but not any &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; than traditional qtips.  Sure, the stems are wooden but they are very brittle and break with the slightest force.  Obviously because they are so thin unable to handle any kind of stress exerted on them with the relatively long leverage arm you would apply force to in using these.  What this means - they break when trying to clean your ears out.  If you use these to clean delicate items they would probably break too.  Not good &amp; these weren&#x27;t exactly cheap.</li>
            <li> I believe the review said something about the cotton falling off the wooded stick,  WELL THIS IS FAR FROM THE TRUTH.&lt;br /&gt;They are on the stick solidly.  I only wish they were a bit cheaper or you got more for your money...</li>
            <li> Excellent cotton swabs. I wouldn&#x27;t say there the softest as someone had said, but there pretty good. I really like wood swabs when I want to get in the deeper part of the ear without it bending like other cheap plastic brands. Q-tips brand is second best. But I liked this brand for the claims it makes. I can&#x27;t tell you if it&#x27;s all true but if it is, this is definitely a winner. Organic anything is just nice as too many products we buy now a days are just covered with all kinds of dangerous products and something some of us use daily can become a little scary to me.</li>
            <li> These cotton swabs have a decent amount of cotton, and it is tightly wound.  Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many of the wood stick cotton swabs and none come close to Q-tips. But the Swisspers Organic Cotton Swabs are quite comparable.  I had vacuum packed three boxes of the original wood stick Q-tips several years ago just before they went off the market.  I don&#x27;t know what I was saving them for, but I finally decided to open a pack.  So my comparison of the Swisspers and the Q-tips are with both in hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The amount of cotton is good.  You can&#x27;t feel the wood stick through the cotton like you can with what has been available in wood swabs in the past few years.  Equally important is that there isn&#x27;t shredding and unwinding right away, and no loose fibers on the exterior.  So, the Swisspers is a worthy successor to our favorite Q-tips, but the Swisspers are hard to find...probably need to stock up when you find them.</li>
            <li> The wooden sticks are great, but the cotton swabs aren&#x27;t as tight as other swabs.</li>
            <li> Yeah, I know that description is convoluted, but that&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for: A wood Q-tip that WON&#x27;T BREAK. I bought &amp;#34;Curity&amp;#34; swabs in the 1000 pack from medical suppliers for years, but my latest shipment was made by some new company (Covidien) instead of Kendall. (Does &amp;#34;Curity&amp;#34; actually MAKE anything anymore, or do they just keep getting bought out?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Covidien ones break approximately 75% of the time; totally worthless. Thanks to all who reviewed these Swisspers, I now know these may be one of the last brands of wood stick Q-tips to be worth buying. I&#x27;m keeping my fingers crossed that they remain so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t had any trouble with the cotton at the tip.</li>
            <li> Be careful if you use these to (forgive me here) stick up your nose to apply Almond Oil or similar for sinus probs (this does rock in cold dry weather for your sinuses) because I have had 2 catch with splinters so far. OWCH !! None lodged in there, but noses are delicate and it was PAINFUL. I use these for other things now and that&#x27;s disappointing because I wanted organic to use with organic oil for this exact purpose.</li>
            <li> Greatest cotton swabs available but buy soon because they sell out fast!</li>
            <li> I like that they are organic.  Not nearly as soft and thick as traditional a tips but they get the job done and it is worth it to avoid conventional cotton.</li>
            <li> Swabs were not on wooden sticks but on a paper/cardboard stick that bent when used. I discarded remainder of swabs because they were not useable for my purpose.</li>
            <li> What I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Compared to the leading in-store brand, these swabs are way more durable and seem to be better in quality. I&#x27;ll be purchasing them again in the future.</li>
            <li> What kind of person gets excited about wod stick cotton swabs?  I guess I do.  I&#x27;ve been looking for these for years.  Found my holy grail cotton swabs!</li>
            <li> Awesome!  I used to buy Q-Tip wooden sticks...they discontinued.  Then I stayed with Q-Tips, but the quality has gone down so low that all they do is bend in half whenever I use them.  Complete garbage now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CVS has wooden sticks, but there is not one around me and they are cheap.  They would break and a few times my wife had to pick out the broken piece out of my ear with tweasers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, Walgreens, doesn&#x27;t sell a single brand with wooden sticks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here I am...Swisspers just arrived and I love them!!!  Buy this product, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!  Sturdy and organic!</li>
            <li> I find these to be 99% as good as qtips wood sticks, which sadly, aren&#x27;t available anymore. This is my second order and I&#x27;d buy them again.</li>
            <li> Excellent Item. These are nicely made, soft and easy on the ear. Cleans well and is useful with solid wood sticks, not flimsy cheap ones.</li>
            <li> Good price, work great to clean out my ears because the shaft is wood, not cardboard.</li>
            <li> organic cotton swabs...whats not to love :-)</li>
            <li> Not sure why wooden swabs are so hard to find these days, but they give better control and accuracy than plastic, which flex around too much.&lt;br /&gt;Good for cleaning printer rollers and computer parts, not just ears.</li>
            <li> best wooden stick swab since  Q tips are unavailable.  sufficient cotton ends for safe, adequate ends.  far superior to your other option.</li>
            <li> I bought these when I ran out of name-brand Q-Tips, but wanted the convenience of having them delivered to my home.  Even ignoring the fact that these saved me time and gas from not having to drive anywhere, these are simply the best &#x27;cotton swabs on sticks&#x27; I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;m not kidding!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a long time user of Q-Tips, because for me it seemed like generic cotton swabs tended more toward cotton shredding/separating  as I used them.  The generic brands often also seemed to have less cotton padding on the sticks.  By comparison, these seem to have plenty of cotton on the tips.  The cotton will start to pull a little bit as you use them (depending on how vigorous), but not not in a way that has detracted from their effectiveness.  This happens to any cotton swab so they are either comparable to Q-Tips and/or somehow better than the generics I tried, in this regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes these my favorite cotton swabs if the wooden sticks, however.  Their strength and firmness just seems to make them more pleasant and easier to use.  I use these primarily for ear hygiene, being careful to be gentle because the sticks would allow you to push harder than normal cardboard-like ones, and for beauty/household purposes.</li>
            <li> Love the look of the wooden sticks - love the fact they are organic swabs... Will purchase again as I get both a practical and pretty product!</li>
            <li> The only cotton swabs that don&#x27;t break and have enough cotton on the ends...5 stars for me!</li>
            <li> All orders delivered on time and as required.&lt;br /&gt;WELL DONE!!&#x27;</li>
            <li> These are great swabs! They are sturdy, substantial, and don&#x27;t scratch my ears. Love them!</li>
            <li> The wood occasionally splinters and several did not have cotton on the tips...dangerous if you are groggy in the morning and don&#x27;t pay attention and inspect each q-tip before using it.</li>
            <li> I still have a small stash of Q-Tip wooden swabs left, and I must say these Swisspers are not comparable.  The cotton swabs are less tightly packed, not as thick,  and have a tendency to slide off the stick.  Having said that, they are still better than the flexible swabs available elsewhere.  I will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> I bought these because they were one of the only organic options here. The cotton is full and they work great.</li>
            <li> JUST GOT THESE TODAY, AND THEY ARE NICE. BETTER THEN THE ONES YOU GET, AT THE STORES. THESE ARE MADE OUT OF WOOD, AND THEY ARE STRONG. WOULD BUY THEM AGAIN. DEE</li>
            <li> I like that these are organic but they don&#x27;t have much cotton on the ends making them uncomfortable to use in the ear and many of them have no cotton at all. I really want to use an organic product but it has to be as good as the conventional product.</li>
            <li> These seem to work fine, are sturdy, not meager, and I&#x27;m happy they&#x27;re organic.</li>
            <li> Love these. Hate the paper sticks because they bend. These have the perfect amount of cotton tip. Boooo on Bed Bath and Beyond for not carrying these anymore. They are the only one I will use and I am addicted to them. Highly recommend them, just leave enough for me!</li>
            <li> love them keep on making</li>
            <li> Fast Delivery, Great product</li>
            <li> I arrived on time and works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m serious about wood stick swabs.  I hate having water in my ears.  I don&#x27;t know why but it drives me absolutely insane.  In order to get them dry I need two things, a sturdy swab and a lot of soft cotton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years I used the Q-Tip brand wooden swabs and they worked great at getting all the water out.  But then they suddenly disappeared.  I think J&amp;J does not make them anymore.  I struggled with off brands, some of which Amazon also sells, but none of them were nearly as good as the Q-Tip brand.  They either were cheap wood that would break or flex or had so little cotton on them you&#x27;d be jabbing your ear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I saw these and thought I&#x27;d give them a try.  The very first one I used after taking a shower literally felt like I was use a cloud instead of cotton.  It was like a sigh of relief that I cannot describe well.  So smooth and comfortable and absorbent, it is possibly better than the Q-Tip brand wood swabs.  Suffice it to say if you like the feel of wood stick swabs and want a high quality, comfortable, sturdy and very soft swab, these are your answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will only order these from now on.  It seems silly that someone would make such a big deal out of a wood stick swab, but these things literally make me happy now after I take a shower. Clean ears and no water &#x3D; Happy Me!</li>
            <li> Sturdy wood sticks.  More expensive than the swabs in the store.  They are worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> I bought these in the store and they are just as good as qtips...since I guess they are the way qtips used to be before they stopped using wooden sticks. I EXTRA great about using these because I simply throw them in the compost pile when I am done.  Sounds gross, but it beats putting them in a plastic bag in a landfill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sturdy and great quality.</li>
            <li> You can no longer get the Johnson and Johnson woodsticks. I have tried many inferior products where you end up with so little cotton that you poke your ear with a stick. These are the best I have found. I would say almost as good as the J&amp;Js.</li>
