            <li>I have to say this stuff is insanely amazing.</li>
            <li>This mascara found every lash and made it stand out on its own.  </li>
            <li>It never flakes, and it doesn&#x27;t smudge on its own...</li>
            <li>I will keep working with it since I paid so much, but yesterday I saw a girl with awesome lashes and asked her what she used</li>
            <li>I quickly dashed off the review below after one successful application.  </li>
            <li>I felt like I was rubbing needles on my eyes, which I might be able to stand if it had amazing results, but I&#x27;ve gotten better results from drugstore brands.  </li>
            <li>I really do love this.</li>
            <li>This is in my TOP 5 of Mascaras.</li>
            <li>I love it to death!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love the brush and it truly does coat every lash like the description says.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>*love*</li>
            <li>It is really phenomenal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok..</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try this product.</li>
            <li>My lashes are good on their own, but at 49, they don&#x27;t \\&quot;pop\\&quot; like the old days.  </li>
            <li>(how could it be anything other than great if it&#x27;s the top-selling mascara in the world?!).  </li>
            <li>The very best mascara due to the applicator.</li>
            <li>I found the ball applicator extremely easy to use</li>
            <li>I have nice lashes, but they are very straight.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a really great product.</li>
            <li>I love trying new mascaras, I was intrigued by this one because of it&#x27;s unique shape, and it seemed to have pretty good reviews</li>
            <li>, I have never had longer lashes after just one coat, so I can definatly say it is worth it!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to get is stellar.</li>
            <li>This is the first mascara I&#x27;ve ever owned that I immediately fell in love with.</li>
            <li>The applicator was a good idea, I guess, but the mascara stayed goopy and seemed to never dry.</li>
            <li>The applicator tip is a cool idea</li>
            <li>I am a loyal DiorShow wearing gal, and I recently ordered this because I loved the idea of the brush...</li>
            <li>I love the size, I love the wand, I love the blackness of the black.  </li>
            <li>but it is worth it for \\&quot;the look\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I think the price is pretty steep, too.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>The saleswoman applied it to my lashes over mascara I had applied earlier that morning, while telling me Phenomen&#x27;Eyes is the \\&quot;top selling mascara in the world.\\&quot;  Despite the fact it clumped on my lashes, I purchased it because (a)</li>
            <li>FIRST POST-PURCHASE APPLICATION:    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a pretty low-maintenance kinda gal.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like it very much.</li>
            <li>so, it&#x27;s great as long as you are careful.</li>
            <li>I was disappointed, fortunately I was able to take it back and exchange it for DiorShow, by far the BEST mascara ever made...</li>
            <li>The applicator works fairly well at getting those hard to reach lashes.  </li>
            <li>Nice if you want a super-dark mascara, but not really worth the high ticket price.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a really high-impact mascara, this is for you.</li>
            <li>Almost $30 for a tube of mascara is a bit much, even for department store brands.</li>
            <li>Also, I was very intrigued by the unusual applicator.      </li>
            <li>I really, really did.</li>
            <li>I looked like I got beat with a tire iron after showering and washing my face for 5 minutes straight.</li>
            <li>Determined to love this mascara, I tried applying it to clean lashes on several other occasions, always taking care to wipe the wand with kleenex first to get excess mascara off before applying.  </li>
            <li>The next morning, I applied it to clean lashes.  </li>
            <li>Product packaging (both the outside box and the actual mascara tube) are elegant.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to get it on my lashes without making a mess on my skin.</li>
            <li>This mascara is highly recommended for the \\&quot;bulky\\&quot; eyelash look.</li>
            <li>If you are going to spend that much, you might as well invest in Latisse and grow your natural eyelashes longer.    </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get used to it, and it stains my eyelid just under the brow after a few hours of wear...    </li>
            <li>It makes my lashes look super long.</li>
            <li>Normally, with all the mascaras I have used in the past (and there have been many)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about the other&#x27;s smudging complaints - I only wear mascara on the top lashes, and I had no smudges.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After all, $30 is more than I&#x27;d usually spend</li>
            <li>and it turns out she uses my old fave, Diorshow Blackout!</li>
            <li>For someone who already has full eyelashes, this might be more of a night-time/going out mascara, but for those of us who need a little help in the everyday: This is THE ONE.</li>
            <li>I really think this mascara is terrific.</li>
            <li>At 52, I had given up on ever appearing to have lush lashes.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really brings out the potential of your lashes.</li>
            <li>Also, it was sticky and NEVER dried after putting it on.</li>
            <li>It makes your natural lashes look voluminous as well as feathery.</li>
            <li>Some people may not like how thick it goes on, and the handling of the brush takes some getting used to, but I love it.</li>
            <li>The black is BLACK-- very true color if you want a high impact look.</li>
            <li>This mascara does give me long eyelashes and after using an eyelash curler, it actually holds the curl pretty well.  </li>
            <li>I am Asian and have had a CONSTANT problem with finding a mascara that I like and works well with my short and very straight eyelashes.</li>
            <li>The ball brush takes a little getting use to but its worth it.</li>
            <li>My natural lashes are pretty wimpy - asian lashes that are short and point down.</li>
            <li>I will keep using Trish some days - but this mascara is much easier to use than other reviews stated, and I had no problems with \\&quot;glops\\&quot; or smudging.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, with each subsequent use, I have experienced the same clumping, smudging and raccoon eyes mentioned in other reviews.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I am a natural blond and have light thin lashes.  </li>
            <li>It is a little pricey and can be tricky to use at first</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much too dark for daytime wear at the office.     </li>
            <li>The brush is strange and you will need to practice using it a little bit in order to get it right.</li>

            <li> TRY INSTEAD:  Precriptives False Eyelashes Plush Mascara or Maybelline&#x27;s Lash Stilleto - both which create long, full, lush lashes with maximum definition,  separation, and lift.</li>
            <li> touch your eyes too much and sure they will.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll only like this mascara if you like dramatic and thick lashes.</li>
            <li> I loaded a picture on this product&#x27;s page if you are interested in what I mean...</li>
            <li> Sadly, it does seem to smudge too easily.  </li>
            <li> I am living in Hawaii right now, so perhaps the humidity has something to do with this, but after wearing it for a few hours, I rubbed my eye a little and my eyelashes stuck together.</li>
            <li> OTHER GENERAL INFORMATION:  </li>
            <li> I figured the clumping was due to having mascara already covering my lashes from earlier in the morning, (b) the mascara is very deeply pigmented,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted the long lashed doe eyed look</li>
            <li> Never seems to dry</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t really dry.</li>
            <li> My lashes clumped, and were a constant sticky mess.</li>
            <li> It takes a little longer to put on because the brush is smaller, but the level of precision</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t think i would have spent 28bux on it.</li>
            <li> the list goes on and on along with the hundreds of dollars spent.     </li>
            <li> thin, straight lashes &amp; I thought it would give them a boost.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I use it sometimes alone and other times after my Rimmel 7.99 CVS mascara to get the tips and corners and thicken them up.</li>
            <li> Other mascaras are too clumpy, and eyelash curlers do not work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, if you want truly dramatic lashes stick with Diorshow, it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> It applied too thickly and made my eyelashes stick together in big clumps.  </li>
            <li> It might not look it, but the bristles are incredibly sharp!</li>
            <li> All of my previous mascaras never held the curl without 2-3 curl and coat steps, which ruins your curler.    </li>
            <li> Re: curling, it does have a slight curling effect, however, I could see someone needing to use a curler.</li>
            <li> And it helps you feel seriously glamorous in those times when you need that extra boost of confidence.</li>
            <li> Dior Diorshow Black Out Waterproof Mascara]]</li>
            <li> Its not for the faint of heart or those wanting a soft feathery natural look, this stuff plumps each lash and grabs even the finest lashes on the ends of the eyes and swear to god makes me look like I have false lashes on,</li>
            <li> My complaints as of now are: the mascara doesn&#x27;t seem to dry, it does stay a little tacky, it is hard to apply</li>
            <li> I tried wiping off just a little....</li>
            <li> and i bought into the marketing hype of the little round wand...</li>
            <li> The color is very very dark black too!    </li>
            <li> and I am not very adept at applying mascara.  </li>
            <li> Mine did not smudge or run even after being out late at a concert.  </li>
            <li> Overall this was a disappointing product.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worthless when you have to dip it into something that will leave you with black crescents under your eyes in an instant.</li>
            <li> I have seriously tried every mascara out there from cover girl mega lash &amp; maybelline colosal lash (the newest release) to YSL, Lancome, Lash Injection, Dior show &amp; blackout, Katie B and Kiss me...</li>
            <li> When dried on my lashes, it looked ridiculous....very thick at the ends of my lashes and not very visible at the base.    </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it was a total disappointment.    </li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed - especially for the price$$.&lt;br /&gt;--------------&lt;br</li>
            <li> People ask if I wear false lashes.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this was the porcupine of all mascara brushes.  </li>
            <li> says they did in the bad reviews.</li>
            <li> This is a horrible product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love the size, I love the wand, I love the blackness of the black.  My lashes are good on their own, but at 49, they don&#x27;t \\&quot;pop\\&quot; like the old days.  This mascara found every lash and made it stand out on its own.  Sadly, it does seem to smudge too easily.  Forget trying to touch it up.  Never seems to dry so it sticks lashes together...so, it&#x27;s great as long as you are careful.</li>
            <li> I really do love this. It is like using a lash enhancer under mascara without the extra step. It is a little pricey and can be tricky to use at first but it is worth it for \\&quot;the look\\&quot;. People ask if I wear false lashes.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a really high-impact mascara, this is for you. The brush is strange and you will need to practice using it a little bit in order to get it right. The black is BLACK-- very true color if you want a high impact look. This is a good choice for night wear or a \\&quot;Goth\\&quot; look-- it&#x27;s much too dark for daytime wear at the office.     I think the price is pretty steep, too. Almost $30 for a tube of mascara is a bit much, even for department store brands. If you are going to spend that much, you might as well invest in Latisse and grow your natural eyelashes longer.    Conclusion: Nice if you want a super-dark mascara, but not really worth the high ticket price.</li>
            <li> I really think this mascara is terrific. Some people may not like how thick it goes on, and the handling of the brush takes some getting used to, but I love it. Normally, with all the mascaras I have used in the past (and there have been many) I had to use two coats. This mascara is highly recommended for the \\&quot;bulky\\&quot; eyelash look. I loaded a picture on this product&#x27;s page if you are interested in what I mean...</li>
            <li> I am a loyal DiorShow wearing gal, and I recently ordered this because I loved the idea of the brush... I was disappointed, fortunately I was able to take it back and exchange it for DiorShow, by far the BEST mascara ever made...</li>
            <li> This mascara does give me long eyelashes and after using an eyelash curler, it actually holds the curl pretty well.  All of my previous mascaras never held the curl without 2-3 curl and coat steps, which ruins your curler.    My complaints as of now are: the mascara doesn&#x27;t seem to dry, it does stay a little tacky, it is hard to apply but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get used to it, and it stains my eyelid just under the brow after a few hours of wear...    Other than that, I have never had longer lashes after just one coat, so I can definatly say it is worth it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get the Raccoon Eyes like everyone else says they did in the bad reviews. It never flakes, and it doesn&#x27;t smudge on its own...touch your eyes too much and sure they will.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll only like this mascara if you like dramatic and thick lashes. Don&#x27;t get it if your looking for curl and max amount of separate lashes.&lt;br /&gt;If someone else didn&#x27;t buy it for me though, I don&#x27;t think i would have spent 28bux on it. I use it sometimes alone and other times after my Rimmel 7.99 CVS mascara to get the tips and corners and thicken them up.</li>
            <li> I quickly dashed off the review below after one successful application.  Unfortunately, with each subsequent use, I have experienced the same clumping, smudging and raccoon eyes mentioned in other reviews.  I am extremely disappointed - especially for the price$$.&lt;br /&gt;--------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a natural blond and have light thin lashes.  At 52, I had given up on ever appearing to have lush lashes.  This mascara is amazing.  One coat grabs even those invisible lower lashes.  I found the ball applicator extremely easy to use and I am not very adept at applying mascara.  Mine did not smudge or run even after being out late at a concert.  I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> This is in my TOP 5 of Mascaras. It seperates lashed GREAT forme...I love it to death!&lt;br /&gt;I also have a video on this mascara on my youtube channel check it out&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> My natural lashes are pretty wimpy - asian lashes that are short and point down. I have seriously tried every mascara out there from cover girl mega lash &amp; maybelline colosal lash (the newest release) to YSL, Lancome, Lash Injection, Dior show &amp; blackout, Katie B and Kiss me...the list goes on and on along with the hundreds of dollars spent.     I finally got my hands on this coveted tube of mascara after trolling my local Sephora over the course of a month. I lucked out today and picked up a tube - only 4 left in the store. I have to say this stuff is insanely amazing. Its not for the faint of heart or those wanting a soft feathery natural look, this stuff plumps each lash and grabs even the finest lashes on the ends of the eyes and swear to god makes me look like I have false lashes on, perfectly fanned out. The ball brush takes a little getting use to but its worth it. The color is very very dark black too!    I&#x27;ve always wanted the long lashed doe eyed look and I now can get it with just one coat of this stuff.  Its been sold out for several weeks and now I can see why.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this after reading the reviews. I love the brush and it truly does coat every lash like the description says. I have oily skin though and this was all over my face by the end of my work day. If I could get my DiorShow onto this brush I would be in Heaven LOL.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this.  It sounds so great in product advertisements, and the applicator looks interesting.  Unfortunately, it was a total disappointment.    MY TRYING/BUYING EXPERIENCE:  I tried Phenomen&#x27;Eyes during a department store visit in March 2009.  The saleswoman applied it to my lashes over mascara I had applied earlier that morning, while telling me Phenomen&#x27;Eyes is the \\&quot;top selling mascara in the world.\\&quot;  Despite the fact it clumped on my lashes, I purchased it because (a) I figured the clumping was due to having mascara already covering my lashes from earlier in the morning, (b) the mascara is very deeply pigmented, (c) it seemed to make my lashes \\&quot;pop\\&quot;, and (d) I was told it was the top-selling mascara worldwide (how could it be anything other than great if it&#x27;s the top-selling mascara in the world?!).  Also, I was very intrigued by the unusual applicator.      FIRST POST-PURCHASE APPLICATION:    The next morning, I applied it to clean lashes.  It was the goopiest, clumpiest masara I&#x27;ve ever used.      SUBSEQUENT ATTEMPTS:  Determined to love this mascara, I tried applying it to clean lashes on several other occasions, always taking care to wipe the wand with kleenex first to get excess mascara off before applying.  I tried wiping off just a little....wiping off a lot....swiping the wand in various ways....pumping the wand in the tube....scraping off excess mascara from the wand with an index card before using......nothing worked.  Every time I used it, this mascara was clumpy, goopy, and too-easily smeared.  It applied too thickly and made my eyelashes stick together in big clumps.  When dried on my lashes, it looked ridiculous....very thick at the ends of my lashes and not very visible at the base.    OTHER GENERAL INFORMATION:  Product packaging (both the outside box and the actual mascara tube) are elegant.  No detectable scent.  Non-irritating to my eyes.    TRY INSTEAD:  Precriptives False Eyelashes Plush Mascara or Maybelline&#x27;s Lash Stilleto - both which create long, full, lush lashes with maximum definition,  separation, and lift.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. It takes a little longer to put on because the brush is smaller, but the level of precision I&#x27;m able to get is stellar. I&#x27;m able to get it on my lashes without making a mess on my skin. It makes my lashes look super long.</li>
            <li> Expect smudges from the minute you put this mascara on. The applicator tip is a cool idea but it&#x27;s worthless when you have to dip it into something that will leave you with black crescents under your eyes in an instant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pretty low-maintenance kinda gal. However, I must confess that I *love* this mascara. This stuff really brings out the potential of your lashes. Re: curling, it does have a slight curling effect, however, I could see someone needing to use a curler. And there was a tendency to run after a prolonged period of time. So, awareness of your appearance (i.e., periodic trips to the ladies&#x27; room) is recommended.    Overall, it&#x27;s a really great product. I&#x27;ve had several compliments on the newly-acquired definition of my lashes. And it helps you feel seriously glamorous in those times when you need that extra boost of confidence.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this product. I have thin, straight lashes &amp; I thought it would give them a boost. The applicator works fairly well at getting those hard to reach lashes.  But the formula of the mascara itself, ends up leaving smudges.  So, by the end of the day I had \\&quot;Raccoon Eyes\\&quot;.  Also, there is no way to curl your lashes with this type of wand.  Overall this was a disappointing product.  I&#x27;m sticking with Diorshow. [[ASIN:B0018BAU7S Dior Diorshow Black Out Waterproof Mascara]]</li>
            <li> The very best mascara due to the applicator. It&#x27;s ingenius!! The bsrt mascara I\\&quot;ve tried in 28 years!!!</li>
            <li> I have nice lashes, but they are very straight.  Other mascaras are too clumpy, and eyelash curlers do not work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I tried this, I was amazed at the immediate effect.  No clumping and it curled my lashes effortlessly.  The applicator is great.  I don&#x27;t know about the other&#x27;s smudging complaints - I only wear mascara on the top lashes, and I had no smudges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I immediately bought another tube so I don&#x27;t run out. I am a happy girl!</li>
            <li> I am Asian and have had a CONSTANT problem with finding a mascara that I like and works well with my short and very straight eyelashes. This is the first mascara I&#x27;ve ever owned that I immediately fell in love with. It actually does make your lashes look noticeably fuller, thicker, and longer. It stays on all day. For someone who already has full eyelashes, this might be more of a night-time/going out mascara, but for those of us who need a little help in the everyday: This is THE ONE.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this mascara. I really, really did. After all, $30 is more than I&#x27;d usually spend and i bought into the marketing hype of the little round wand... Unfortunately, this was the porcupine of all mascara brushes.  I stabbed myself every time I tried to use this. And it hurt. A lot. These things are abnormally spikey. But let&#x27;s say that I have the shakes, and no one else has ever poked their eye, ever, with a mascara wand. I&#x27;d still give it 1 star. I had raccoon eyes within 2 hours, and washing it off is the hardest thing ever. I looked like I got beat with a tire iron after showering and washing my face for 5 minutes straight. Also, it was sticky and NEVER dried after putting it on. My lashes clumped, and were a constant sticky mess. Maybe I had a faulty tube, or maybe it is just a sucky, overpriced product. Regardless, take the same money and buy DIORSHOW. This is a horrible product.</li>
            <li> I have been a Trish McEvoy mascara girl for 10 years, and this mascara has taken 1st place.  I will keep using Trish some days - but this mascara is much easier to use than other reviews stated, and I had no problems with \\&quot;glops\\&quot; or smudging.</li>
            <li> This mascara is excellent. It makes your natural lashes look voluminous as well as feathery. I just brush it on my lashes as a regular mascara and it gives me impressive and beautiful lashes. It is really phenomenal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to stick to my Diorshow Blackout from now on. The applicator was a good idea, I guess, but the mascara stayed goopy and seemed to never dry. I am living in Hawaii right now, so perhaps the humidity has something to do with this, but after wearing it for a few hours, I rubbed my eye a little and my eyelashes stuck together. It just doesn&#x27;t really dry. I really don&#x27;t like it very much. It&#x27;s ok.. I will keep working with it since I paid so much, but yesterday I saw a girl with awesome lashes and asked her what she used and it turns out she uses my old fave, Diorshow Blackout!</li>
            <li> I love trying new mascaras, I was intrigued by this one because of it&#x27;s unique shape, and it seemed to have pretty good reviews so I went for it.  It might not look it, but the bristles are incredibly sharp! I felt like I was rubbing needles on my eyes, which I might be able to stand if it had amazing results, but I&#x27;ve gotten better results from drugstore brands.  Very disappointed, if you want truly dramatic lashes stick with Diorshow, it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
