            <li>This cleanser is pretty great.</li>
            <li>My wife loved it and even got me to try it on my shaved head and full beard.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin very smooth.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for 4 months and just love what it does for my skin.</li>
            <li>I normally love Garnier products but not this one.  </li>
            <li>about 6 months ago I started using Garnier&#x27;s moisture rescue refreshing gel moisturizer</li>
            <li>Found this face wash while searching for the moisturizer and decided to give it a go based on the reviews and my love of the moisturizer  </li>
            <li>Love this product wish it was not discontinued</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s definitely more of a cream.  </li>
            <li>Their moisture rescue gel is awesome too, especially the cooling sensation of the gel.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Buy more than one.</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot like Noxema but feels like it cleans better and doesn&#x27;t burn.  </li>
            <li>It smells lovely and cleans my face well without drying my skin.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>This is very rich and creamy.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing and the price is RIGHT!</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed!  </li>
            <li>It cleanses very well and works good with Clairsonic.</li>
            <li>, you get a ton for the price, and I feel like it would be good for any type of skin, even very oily skin.</li>
            <li>I am happy to say that this cleanser is gentle yet effective and does not irritate my sensitive skin or make me break out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s creamy and lightly scented, and leaves no residue.</li>
            <li>I accidentally used this on my hair one day with fantastic results.  </li>
            <li>A nice, gentle cleanser.  </li>
            <li>and I loved it For a girl with pores on the larger side and skin prone to becoming shiny this moisturizer</li>
            <li>WORKS!&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this cleanser</li>
            <li>FRESH AND CLEAN FEELING</li>
            <li>Good price for how long it lasts.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately , no luck !</li>
            <li>First, you don&#x27;t have to use much to get your face very clean.</li>
            <li>However, using this cleanser is almost therapeutic, it smells so fresh and fruity.</li>
            <li>I love Garnier products in general, and this is no exception.  </li>
            <li>I use this along with one of those silicone facial brushes that are popular in Asia, and that combo works very well</li>
            <li>I use it every morning and my face feels clean, fresh and very soft.</li>
            <li>but I use it on the rest of my body (back, mostly)</li>
            <li>I bought garnier to try it out because its pretty inexpensive.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to see that I could get it on amazon now that my local stores have stopped stocking it.  </li>
            <li>This product along with Palmer&#x27;s coco butter has made my skin smooth and clear.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a very rich lather but it has enough to get the job done.</li>
            <li>this wash moisturizes just enough so that the dry areas go away and during the summer it does NOT make my skin more oily--which is what most moisturizing face washes do.  </li>
            <li>Gets me clean and doesn&#x27;t strip my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I live in Salt Lake City, if that tells you the kind of dry air</li>
            <li>JUST WHAT EXPECTED I LOVE IT THANKS FOR THE PRODUCT</li>
            <li>thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>Within four or five days, my skin was so much clearer, and it reduces redness so well.</li>
            <li>This product makes my face feel clean, but not dry.  </li>
            <li>It cleanses really well</li>
            <li>Of course, you should always moisturize after cleansing, but with this cleanser it&#x27;s not as much of a necessity.</li>
            <li>I have used Garnier products before and they have never broken me out..</li>
            <li>I purchased this as a set with the dailt lotion and really like them both.</li>
            <li>I really like this cleanser.</li>
            <li>This is too harsh for my face (though it would probably be great with oily skin, mine is dry)</li>
            <li>Next, the smell is mild and non offensive.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very foamy, which is fine by me.</li>
            <li>Most cleansers left those dry patches on my face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as acne-preventing as my 30s combination skin needs, and it stings like a mother if you get it in your eye at all, even with them closed, so I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars, but for clean but not parched skin, and a bottle that lasts quite a while, if you have the Pro X brush or a Mia, this will leave you with soft, clean skin that is balanced enough you can run out the door without moisturizing first if you are short on time.</li>
            <li>and I began the search for something new.  </li>
            <li>I like it so much that I bought 4 tubes that will last me the whole year.</li>
            <li>I usually try products like this because I love my wife and can&#x27;t say no.</li>
            <li>It has clear break outs I had.</li>
            <li>My skin stays clear while I use this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used this product to clear remaining make-up residue on the occasions that I did wear make-up.</li>
            <li>My skin is luminous and soft.  </li>
            <li>but I was surprised when it worked in the summer also.  </li>
            <li>my skin feeling  soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I have always had sensitive skin and break outs.</li>
            <li>I really wish they would restock back in stores.</li>
            <li>Wouldnt recomend this for any one who has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I think my skin is a bit oily, as far as a skin type.</li>
            <li>It provides enough moisture without it being so much that you will breakout</li>
            <li>if you have sensitive</li>
            <li>It is thick and slippery for lack of a better description.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful cleanser as I just hate &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; stuff and this is just cleansing without smelling like perfume or leaving any cosmetic residue.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling clean but not dry or tight, it has a very reasonable price especially considering the size and how well the product works</li>
            <li>Garnier Moisture Rescue Fresh Cleansing Foam is not exactly foamy...  </li>
            <li>, my face feels clean, moist but not greasy or heavy like when I have moisturizer&#x27;s on.  </li>
            <li>Makes my face feel clean without feeling harshly stripped.  </li>
            <li>Needed a new facial wash after I felt like I was breaking out a lot.</li>
            <li>My combo-skin is sensitive and prone to break outs, especially with cream cleansers.</li>
            <li>I have flat limp hair and this made my hair full and shiny.  </li>
            <li>It cleans my face and makes it soft without feeling dry afterwards</li>
            <li>At first I was put off by the misleading description, but after using the product for a few days, I knew I had finally found my replacement.  </li>
            <li>Definitely try this product, it&#x27;s worth the small price.</li>
            <li>This does everything I need for my sensitive skin: it cleans thoroughly, and it doesn&#x27;t make my face sting, dry up, or turn red.</li>
            <li>I still break out when I am stupid and don&#x27;t take care of my skin or eat good food, but my face has clearly improved since my last cleanser (</li>

            <li> I have dry/combination skin that&#x27;s oily in the T-Zone during the summer and dry all around in the winter.</li>
            <li> You only need a little dab.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long long way....</li>
            <li> This is not very moisturizing</li>
            <li> A few years ago, my prefered facial cleanser disappeared from store shelves</li>
            <li> so it is not exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> , I can feel it getting rid of excess dirt and oil, and it doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling too dry or tight.</li>
            <li> and this does not irritate my skin like other cleansers that I have tried.</li>
            <li> I used to have super bad acne on my forehead and in between my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday on my face to take off makeup.</li>
            <li> Broke out after a few uses of this.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s just been a few days, so I&#x27;m liking it a lot!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything negative to say about it.</li>
            <li> (I would recommend the silicone brush thing with any cleansing foam, at least to try out).</li>
            <li> It is very hard to find this product in the store.  </li>
            <li> Just not happy with it at all.  </li>
            <li> I tend to get flaky patches even where it&#x27;s oily though, which is frustrating.</li>
            <li> Not a happy customer.</li>
            <li> Sorry Garnier...need to can this one.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had to buy another cleanser</li>
            <li> I hate the consistency.  </li>
            <li> this product must have something in it that broke me out terribly.</li>

            <li> I have been using this product for 4 months and just love what it does for my skin. It&#x27;s like washing with a moisturizer.  My skin is luminous and soft.  Very nice!</li>
            <li> this is the best face wash I have ever used--and believe me I&#x27;ve tried a lot!! I have oily skin and during the winter I have combo skin with dry flaky patches.  this wash moisturizes just enough so that the dry areas go away and during the summer it does NOT make my skin more oily--which is what most moisturizing face washes do.  I started using this last winter and thought I probably would have to stop using it during the summer but I was surprised when it worked in the summer also.  soooo happy with this product and the subscribe and save price helps too.  thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is pretty great. It&#x27;s creamy and lightly scented, and leaves no residue. I use it with an Olay Pro X brush, daily, in my shower during my morning routine. It&#x27;s not as acne-preventing as my 30s combination skin needs, and it stings like a mother if you get it in your eye at all, even with them closed, so I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars, but for clean but not parched skin, and a bottle that lasts quite a while, if you have the Pro X brush or a Mia, this will leave you with soft, clean skin that is balanced enough you can run out the door without moisturizing first if you are short on time. I live in Salt Lake City, if that tells you the kind of dry air it stands up to!</li>
            <li> Lathers great, makes my skin soft and smooth, and it did a great job of removing all of my make-up! :-) Will be buying it again!</li>
            <li> My combo-skin is sensitive and prone to break outs, especially with cream cleansers. I am happy to say that this cleanser is gentle yet effective and does not irritate my sensitive skin or make me break out.</li>
            <li> This cleansing foam smells so good!  I love it!</li>
            <li> I normally love Garnier products but not this one.  I hate the consistency.  It is thick and slippery for lack of a better description.  Did not foam well and did not do a good job removing makeup.  Burns the eyes.  Just not happy with it at all.  Will not recommend to anyone.  Sorry Garnier...need to can this one.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and the price is RIGHT!</li>
            <li> about 6 months ago I started using Garnier&#x27;s moisture rescue refreshing gel moisturizer and I loved it For a girl with pores on the larger side and skin prone to becoming shiny this moisturizer was a miracle!  Found this face wash while searching for the moisturizer and decided to give it a go based on the reviews and my love of the moisturizer  I was not disappointed!  Leaves my face feeling clean but not dry or tight, it has a very reasonable price especially considering the size and how well the product works Highly recommend</li>
            <li> This is the best cleanser on the market by Garnier. I don&#x27;t have anything negative to say about it. It works well and absorbs my facial oil.</li>
            <li> Love this product wish it was not discontinued</li>
            <li> Great cleanser! I use it everyday on my face to take off makeup. It has clear break outs I had.</li>
            <li> This cleanser may be discontinued(was discontinued in October of 2013) but this is the only one that works for me. It cleans my face and makes it soft without feeling dry afterwards and this does not irritate my skin like other cleansers that I have tried. I am glad amazon has this and will buy more when the need arises! Thank You Amazon!</li>
            <li> This is not very moisturizing so it is not exactly what I expected but I do like it. It cleanses very well and works good with Clairsonic. I gave 4 stars because it isn&#x27;t so moisturizing as you would think from the name.</li>
            <li> Great lather and smells great makes your face feel really nice.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful face cleaner. I use it every morning and my face feels clean, fresh and very soft. I won&#x27;t use anything else. 😀</li>
            <li> This is too harsh for my face (though it would probably be great with oily skin, mine is dry) but I use it on the rest of my body (back, mostly) and it&#x27;s great for that. Good price for how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> I used to have super bad acne on my forehead and in between my eyebrows. I had tried everything from  spot treatments to face masks, and I still had acne for about a year. I bought garnier to try it out because its pretty inexpensive. Within four or five days, my skin was so much clearer, and it reduces redness so well. I definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice, rich and creamy cleanser. Removes makeup and leaves  my skin feeling  soft and moisturized.  It is now part of my daily regimen along with the smoothing cream cleanser and moisture rescue gel cream in the morning. I use this and the ultra lift miracle sleeping cream at night.</li>
            <li> A few years ago, my prefered facial cleanser disappeared from store shelves and I began the search for something new.  I tried 4 or 5 different products before this one.  Garnier Moisture Rescue Fresh Cleansing Foam is not exactly foamy...  it&#x27;s definitely more of a cream.  At first I was put off by the misleading description, but after using the product for a few days, I knew I had finally found my replacement.  This product makes my face feel clean, but not dry.  It is inexpensive and one tube lasts a long time, about 2 months.  My skin stays clear while I use this product.  I was pleased to see that I could get it on amazon now that my local stores have stopped stocking it.  Buying it with subscribe and save makes a lot of sense and I don&#x27;t have to worry about running out.</li>
            <li> This does everything I need for my sensitive skin: it cleans thoroughly, and it doesn&#x27;t make my face sting, dry up, or turn red.</li>
            <li> I have been looking all over the place for this cleanser, only to find out it is discontinued in stores. My mom buys in bulk and gave me a couple of bottles of this cleanser, so I just finished this product a week or two ago and went out in stores to look for it. Unfortunately , no luck ! I have always had sensitive skin and break outs. This product didn&#x27;t irritate my skin and I didn&#x27;t have any breakouts. I&#x27;ve also used this product to clear remaining make-up residue on the occasions that I did wear make-up. My face never felt dry or &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; after using it. This product along with Palmer&#x27;s coco butter has made my skin smooth and clear. It doesn&#x27;t have a very rich lather but it has enough to get the job done. Although the product wasn&#x27;t targeted for acne, it cleared any acne problems that I had with my skin. Unfortunately, I had to buy another cleanser and now I&#x27;m back to breaking out around my eyebrows and on my cheeks. I really wish they would restock back in stores. Guess I&#x27;ll buy on here but now I have to find a qualifying item lol. Their moisture rescue gel is awesome too, especially the cooling sensation of the gel.</li>
            <li> I accidentally used this on my hair one day with fantastic results.  I have flat limp hair and this made my hair full and shiny.  So now I use it on my face and hair!! Amazing accidental discovery!!  A little goes a long long way....</li>
            <li> This face wash has a nice creamy feeling to it.  It leaves my skin feeling nice and smooth.  It does burn your eyes if it gets in them though.</li>
            <li> WORKS!&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this cleanser, my face feels clean, moist but not greasy or heavy like when I have moisturizer&#x27;s on.  Please don&#x27;t discontinue.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is amazing. It&#x27;s affordable, you get a ton for the price, and I feel like it would be good for any type of skin, even very oily skin. I have dry/combination skin that&#x27;s oily in the T-Zone during the summer and dry all around in the winter. I tend to get flaky patches even where it&#x27;s oily though, which is frustrating. However, using this cleanser is almost therapeutic, it smells so fresh and fruity. It cleanses really well, I can feel it getting rid of excess dirt and oil, and it doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling too dry or tight. Of course, you should always moisturize after cleansing, but with this cleanser it&#x27;s not as much of a necessity. Definitely try this product, it&#x27;s worth the small price. Also try their Gel-Creams, they&#x27;re great!</li>
            <li> Broke out after a few uses of this. Not a happy customer.</li>
            <li> Great product, discounted in stores happy to find it and at good price. Buy more than one.</li>
            <li> JUST WHAT I WANTED. JUST WHAT EXPECTED I LOVE IT THANKS FOR THE PRODUCT TOO. LOVE I LOVE IT. T</li>
            <li> It is very hard to find this product in the store.  I like it so much that I bought 4 tubes that will last me the whole year.</li>
            <li> Found this product while on vacation in a teenie-tiny town in Michigan. My wife loved it and even got me to try it on my shaved head and full beard. Wonderful cleanser as I just hate &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; stuff and this is just cleansing without smelling like perfume or leaving any cosmetic residue. No one in our city of 425,000 people carries it so Amazon to the rescue. I usually try products like this because I love my wife and can&#x27;t say no. Garnier Moisture Rescue Fresh Cleansing Foam is in my bathroom where I happily use it every evening. If you knew me that alone would be testament to this cleanser&#x27;s awesomeness. Or, as we were wont to say back in the &#x27;60s, grooveadelic.</li>
            <li> FRESH AND CLEAN FEELING</li>
            <li> ...face wash! It&#x27;s great for makeup removal. I hope they never stop selling it. I don&#x27;t see it at the stores anymore! Yikes! Lathers well and feels good on skin. I apply their BB lotion after.</li>
            <li> I have used Garnier products before and they have never broken me out.. this product must have something in it that broke me out terribly. Wouldnt recomend this for any one who has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> this product is great for when you want to just strip away your grundgy day. I purchased this as a set with the dailt lotion and really like them both.</li>
            <li> Needed a new facial wash after I felt like I was breaking out a lot. I think my skin is a bit oily, as far as a skin type. I use this along with one of those silicone facial brushes that are popular in Asia, and that combo works very well (I would recommend the silicone brush thing with any cleansing foam, at least to try out). I still break out when I am stupid and don&#x27;t take care of my skin or eat good food, but my face has clearly improved since my last cleanser (Yes To Grapefruit exfoliating cleanser)! This tube seems to hold a good amount of cleanser for the price.</li>
            <li> This is very rich and creamy.  You only need a little dab.  It  has a pleasant light fragance.  It makes my skin very smooth.  It&#x27;s not very foamy, which is fine by me.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser!  Just wish Garnier hadn&#x27;t discontinued it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot like Noxema but feels like it cleans better and doesn&#x27;t burn.  Gets me clean and doesn&#x27;t strip my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I really like this cleanser. First, you don&#x27;t have to use much to get your face very clean. A dab will do you when using this product. Next, the smell is mild and non offensive. It&#x27;s not chemical and it isn&#x27;t too herbal/floral. Lastly, after washing with this, I did not have dry skin patches around my mouth or my nose. Most cleansers left those dry patches on my face. It provides enough moisture without it being so much that you will breakout if you have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just been a few days, so I&#x27;m liking it a lot! I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love Garnier products in general, and this is no exception.  It smells lovely and cleans my face well without drying my skin.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel clean without feeling harshly stripped.  A nice, gentle cleanser.  I love it and I can use it year-round without any issues.</li>
