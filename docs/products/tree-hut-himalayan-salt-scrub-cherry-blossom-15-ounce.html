            <li>I love Tree Hut sugar scrubs.  </li>
            <li>Love this --</li>
            <li>Scrap better than sugar scrub salts</li>
            <li>This body scrub along with another one by Tree Hut are the best $10 I&#x27;ve ever spent on a body scrub.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling smooth, creamy, silky and moisturized and smelling lovely.</li>
            <li>, butting doesn&#x27;t last and the result is always great.</li>
            <li>Silky smooth and smells decadent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was</li>
            <li>The salt in this is very fine and it has made my skin feel much softer.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  </li>
            <li>The smell is a bit strong as it is very florally.  </li>
            <li>There wasn&#x27;t very much salt in the scrub.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin super soft and it smells divine!</li>
            <li>but this is a bit too much for me.</li>
            <li>the salt sinks to bottom, with liquid on top.  </li>
            <li>so they roll gently over your skin.  </li>
            <li>I had swollen eyelids, using this product helped to massage gently the glands under the skin to release toxins and allergens.  </li>
            <li>Not a ton, but enough to make the packaging kind of oily and gross.</li>
            <li>It has a good smell and not as oil feeling as some other similar products.</li>
            <li>Based on that, I&#x27;d say this is a great body scrub, but it might be a bit harsh on the face (and perhaps not harsh enough for anything calloused and extra</li>
            <li>Made my hands so soft!</li>
            <li>It has a warming effect on your skin and the Dead Sea Salt crystals are ground perfectly fine</li>
            <li>but you still get the effects of a scrub, just not harsh.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it can sting if you use it on a sensitive or scratched area</li>
            <li>It is not harsh but rather,  smoothing.</li>
            <li>Skin felt soft after use.</li>
            <li>She said the scrub had just the right amount of gritty-ness to exfoliate but not so much that you leave your skin raw.</li>
            <li>Aroma could have been a little stronger, but it was adequate.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s gentle enough to use daily</li>
            <li>so excited to try this, but just a huge disappointment.  </li>
            <li>rough).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing worth mentioning is that the one I ordered leaked a little bit in transit.</li>
            <li>so perhaps this is what truly resembles natural cherry blossom, mixed with salt!</li>
            <li>The smell is unique and hard to describe.  </li>

            <li> Usually get the Brazil nut.  </li>

            <li> This body scrub along with another one by Tree Hut are the best $10 I&#x27;ve ever spent on a body scrub. And I buy lots of them to try out. It is rich and creamy and smells beautiful. It leaves my skin feeling smooth, creamy, silky and moisturized and smelling lovely. I will never let myself run out of this. I think it&#x27;s gentle enough to use daily but you still get the effects of a scrub, just not harsh. no complaints, nothing but praise for this awesome product.</li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t very much salt in the scrub.</li>
            <li> Smells great and works great.</li>
            <li> Like the smell. Feels good on the skin. Although you do have to mix it every usage.</li>
            <li> The scrub is great, and I love all of the Tree Hut products.</li>
            <li> Product doesn&#x27;t have enough salt (abrasion) to my liking.  The smell is a bit strong as it is very florally.  I like a hint of a floral smell but this is a bit too much for me.</li>
            <li> This has a very nice scent to it. Love Himalayan salt and its known to have a lot of good benefits. The salt in this is very fine and it has made my skin feel much softer. I wish they would make this product in a tube for easier application.</li>
            <li> the scrub separates.  the salt sinks to bottom, with liquid on top.  needs to be manually stirred to apply.  smells great &amp; is a good scrub, but a pain to have to literally stir it.</li>
            <li> Awesome scrub, makes the skin glow from within. Sometimes it can sting if you use it on a sensitive or scratched area, butting doesn&#x27;t last and the result is always great.</li>
            <li> Horrible product do not buy.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product.  It&#x27;s gelly like and separates from the salt, so you have to stir it each time you use it. I also did not like its warming effect.  I threw it out after about four uses(half a jar).</li>
            <li> Smells so good!! Made my hands so soft!</li>
            <li> I love Tree Hut sugar scrubs.  Usually get the Brazil nut.  So yummy and effective.  Silky smooth and smells decadent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was so excited to try this, but just a huge disappointment.  No grit.  Just the smallest amount possible.  The smell is divine, and the the base velvety, but there&#x27;s no scrub.  Just goop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be adding coarse raw sugar to the base, or some pink Himalayan salt.  However, I don&#x27;t think I should pay to add quality products to get a scrub effect from a scrub, and I&#x27;m not entirely certain it will work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend the sugar scrubs.  This smells good, but it&#x27;s not a scrub.</li>
            <li> This feels so good and smells so good.  It is not harsh but rather,  smoothing.</li>
            <li> Very nice product. It has a good smell and not as oil feeling as some other similar products.</li>
            <li> The only thing you need to know is that you need to mix this product thoroughly before using it as the salt settles to the bottom.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  It has a warming effect on your skin and the Dead Sea Salt crystals are ground perfectly fine so they roll gently over your skin.  It helps to detoxify and open allergies held under the skin.  I had swollen eyelids, using this product helped to massage gently the glands under the skin to release toxins and allergens.  I am very happy I found this product and you will be too.  I guarantee you will take 5 to 10 years off your face and body after using it once!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!! It makes my skin super soft and it smells divine!</li>
            <li> Love this -- it&#x27;s creamy and yet gritty in a velvety way. Other salt scrubs can be too abrasive and burn.  This one has a heat factor to it which I like-- wonderful for all over your body, face too!  The smell is unique and hard to describe.  Not exactly cherry blossom to me... But then again I have been overstimulated by synthetic versions of cherry blossom-- so perhaps this is what truly resembles natural cherry blossom, mixed with salt! I&#x27;m overjoyed with all my Tree Hut products.  Brazilian Nut is a longtime fav!</li>
            <li> I do not care for the consistency of this at all! It is very compact and it is hard to spread on your body.  Big clumps slide off and it is just not what I would have expected....</li>
            <li> It did a great job exfoliating, but all the salt separated ad settled at the bottom. It was a pain in the butt to mix too because the salt wuld stick to the bottom. Otherwise it was wonderful and I do recommend it.</li>
            <li> Scrap better than sugar scrub salts</li>
            <li> Affect on the skin was wonderful. Aroma could have been a little stronger, but it was adequate.</li>
            <li> It was a gift and the recipient loved it.</li>
            <li> I bought this as part of a Christmas gift for my sister, and she loved the scrub. It does have a tendency to settle and need stirring, but if you&#x27;re going to spread it all over yourself, what&#x27;s the harm in stirring with your finger?  The smell is very strong, and it would be a bit overwhelming to me, but she liked it. She said the scrub had just the right amount of gritty-ness to exfoliate but not so much that you leave your skin raw. Based on that, I&#x27;d say this is a great body scrub, but it might be a bit harsh on the face (and perhaps not harsh enough for anything calloused and extra rough).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing worth mentioning is that the one I ordered leaked a little bit in transit. Not a ton, but enough to make the packaging kind of oily and gross. You might want to consider ordering this item by itself so you don&#x27;t have to return other items in the event that yours leaks.</li>
            <li> Nice scent,  Scrub worked well without being too harsh.  Skin felt soft after use.</li>
