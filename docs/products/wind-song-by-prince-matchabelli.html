            <li> Love this scent.  Great price.</li>
            <li> This is just a classic scent that is airy and feminine.  I&#x27;ve used Windsong for years and it&#x27;s my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; perfume.</li>
            <li> I purchase this powder for a disabled person. It is the only one she likes. Evrytime I have purchased from Amazon.com I have have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> The body poweder smells great. Although it arrived after Christmas.IT sould have been because of the Christmas rush, but it was ordered well in advance.</li>
            <li> I purchased Wind Song By Prince Matchabelli dusting powder for my mom.  She has used this product for MANY years and can no longer find it in stores. She says it keeps her dry and soft and I think the smell is light and fresh.</li>
            <li> I have used Wind Song Powder for many years. It is not a drying powder like so many others. It has a light fragrance. I get several compliments on how fresh and clean it smells.</li>
            <li> I recently found this bath powder and started using it again.  It was my favorite many years ago.  I hope they never stop producing this wonderfully fragrant bath powder and the perfume.</li>
            <li> Mother cannot use perfumes or colognes due to allergies, but she&lt;br /&gt;LOVES this powder.  However, it is extremely hard to find locally.&lt;br /&gt;This seller is an excellent vendor with a very nice&lt;br /&gt;product line.  THANKS!</li>
            <li> I ordered this on the 2nd and it arrived on the 8th. This was 1 day earlier than the estimated arrival. It was great. My grandmother told me it was wrapped in gold paper.It was nice since this product wasn&#x27;t eligible for gift wrap. She said when she unwrapped it that it smelt so good. She was very pleased with the present.</li>
            <li> I must say that I ordered this powder blindly and hoped not to be disappointed. WELLLLLLLL I sure was not. It smells awesome, I had to hide from my husband, YES he wanted to use it everytime after his bath and I wasn&#x27;t having. It smells great. Buy it you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Living and working in the heat in Nevada is much easier with Windsong Powder.  Keeps my body drier and more fragrant.  I use it daily and have never found anything I like better.  I can&#x27;t ever imagine not having it- it is a must for me!</li>
            <li> I love it. Always have, always will.</li>
            <li> love it wish the packaging had been less tight and more roomy for easier opening and closing.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife to use as just a powder box with the puff but she liked the powder in it as well. Very clean scent.</li>
            <li> Wind song has a nice flowery fragrance that I enjoy plus it makes you feel good and helps with perspiration.  However, Wal-mart has it for $11.</li>
            <li> Wind Song is such a wonderful memory!! So glad to have, it oncec again!! Thank you! Be BLESSED,  IN JESUS NAME!</li>
            <li> Great powder with wonderful scent. Very good shipping.</li>
            <li> Smells just the same as I remember. I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this item for a friend that has been using it for many years.  It continues to have the nice clean smell that it always had.  So glad it is still available for purchase.</li>
            <li> Scent is barely there.  Not of the quality I remembered.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Even though I no longer use dusting powder, my elderly mom wanted this for her 93rd bday.  Even tho many retail stores carried it, no one had it in stock.  Almost gave up, but tried Amazon &amp; there it was!  Shipping was quick &amp; easy.  The smile on her face when she opened it was priceless!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Body powder is hard to fine. Shower to Shower is great but wanted something more. I can&#x27;t believe that Bath &amp; Body along with their shower gel and body sprays do not sell dusting powder . So very happy to wind this dusting powder. Smells great, not gritty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for everyday use for many years.  It has a light surprising scent and doesn&#x27;t leave a musky scent as many drug store perfumes might.  It&#x27;s been hard to find locally recently, but I&#x27;m grateful I found it on Amazon.  I can let my daughter use it and not worry about wasting expensive products.  I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s inferior in any way.  This is the powder, but I&#x27;d recommend the sprays, too.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this for many years and when I once again sought it out, it was nice to see it&#x27;s still around. After I ordered it through Amazon though, I did find it at my local Walmart which I will purchase from there in the future so that I can save myself the shipping costs.</li>
            <li> This is my wifes favorite bath powder, and has been since were married 56 years ago! Our local supplier quit stocking it, so we are very pleased that Amazon carries it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it very hard to find dusting powders in stores so I was very happy to find it here.</li>
            <li> I REMEMBER MY FIRST JOB IN 1952 AT HOOD&#x27;S DRUGSTORE AS A PHARMACIST. ONE PRODUCT THAT THEY STOCKED WAS  Prince Matchabelli . I RECENTLY ORDERED DUSTING POWDER.  I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> The scent is divine and the ease is wonderful.  I forgot how much I missed a powder puff!  Would make an excellent gift as well.  Now I&#x27;ll have to look for Wind Song scent.</li>
            <li> Have used it for years.  Always pleased.</li>
            <li> My wife has used this for years. I have been buying this from Amazon for the last ten years. Their price is well within line and the service, as always, is great.</li>
            <li> I shopped around before buying and this seller has the best deal around. They DO NOT charge sales tax nor do they double their shipping charges on each one you buy.  I bought 4 of them and they only added and additional $2.10 shipping.&lt;br /&gt;On to the powder, I love this scent. It&#x27;s a very soft and pretty scent and is not as strong as their perfume.  You do smell the Wind Song perfume scent but it is not over-powering.</li>
            <li> This is a product that my wife cares for and I enjoy the fragrance. It is a product that we cannot find any other place.</li>
            <li> It arrived in very good shape and in a very timely manner. Was very glad to find it on internet because all the stores in our city quit carrying it. I really  like the Wind Song bath powder by Prince MatchabelliThank you for carrying it.</li>
            <li> Perfect gift... perfect timing</li>
            <li> Nicely packaged, I have used this for years.  It must be fairly popular, because when I&#x27;m running low it is usually sold out locally.  Nice light fragrance; fast ship.</li>
            <li> Really nice. Smelled just like I remembered.</li>
            <li> I love the Wind Song fragrance and it has gotten difficult to find.  I was glad to be able to order it online.</li>
            <li> was disappointed with  the fragance</li>
            <li> I have used Prince Matchabeli for years and years and years.  As with so many things, that I have used for years, all of the stores have discontinued it.  Now I am telling my age, but I am not ashamed of it.  I am in my 80&#x27;s.  So much for the elderly people!!!.</li>
            <li> this has talc and parabens in it. It also smells old ladylike to me. I ended up throwing away. .</li>
            <li> Great product and delivered as promised...</li>
