    <ol>
            <li>I have been wanting a hooded dryer for my curly hair and was so happy to purchase.</li>
            <li>However, it works great.  </li>
            <li>Product was great.</li>
            <li>I love this item!!</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>This product is truly amazing.  </li>
            <li>So now I&#x27;m stuck with this piece of mess!Purchase at your own risk.</li>
            <li>It is a good quality product and quite easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very easy to operate.  </li>
            <li>I have been using now for about a month, and I love it.</li>
            <li>I am glad I purchase.  </li>
            <li>It is all plastic and seemed like it would break easily.  </li>
            <li>The settings seems to work fine: even the highest setting is still comfortable.</li>
            <li>and if I put rollers in my hair then my head doesn&#x27;t fit underneath it.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this dryer hoping I would be spared the same fate others experienced.  </li>
            <li>The clip at the top that holds the hood popped out early on, and while I was able to reinsert the spring and fix it, it needs to be jiggled into place sometimes.  </li>
            <li>When I first saw it, I thought it was made a bit cheaply.  </li>
            <li>I purchased it at my local beauty supply store because it looked nice</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s loud while in use, but it heats ok which is why I gave it three stars and not two stars.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light for carrying, the bonnet is large enough that you get good head coverage, the different temperatures are actually different, and it&#x27;s a good size to store away in even a linen closet.</li>
            <li>I actually didn&#x27;t mind that the dryer is made of cheap plastic, because it is lightweight and easy to fold up and carry .</li>
            <li>The high setting can be really hot and canister can barely fit my head with the rollers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it seems most of the ones on the market in this price range have similar issues.</li>
            <li>She said it gets hot enough and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But again, the dryer does essentially dry the hair (it can reach) completely and effectively.</li>
            <li>This has made my life much easier.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this to dry and style my hair.  </li>
            <li>Second, as with most hooded dryers, it doesn&#x27;t distribute the heat evenly toward the back of your head.</li>
            <li>I brought this hair dryer about a year ago, first the hair dryer is very loud, and it has only 2 settings.</li>
            <li>The problem is that there is what appears to be height adjustment slots on the front, however, when lowered the  bonnet frequently collapses on your head!</li>
            <li>I only attempted to use this item once, and it stopped blowing hot air after approx 5 minutes...</li>
            <li>I do not like the way it is design far as abjusting the hood</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve taken to sitting on a pillow, which still doesn&#x27;t place me high enPugh for proper drying.</li>
            <li>I have to sit on three pillows to get my head high enough.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this pretty little dryer that gets hot and the hood drops.</li>
            <li>and it was supposedly of a higher quality than the one I owned previously.  </li>

            <li> I had this dryer for little over a year and the adjustment for the bonnet will not stay in place so while you are under the dryer the bonnet will fall down on your face without warning</li>

            <li> Wastes of money</li>

            <li> Waste of my time and money</li>
            <li> Not so, because the hood&#x27;s locking latch is very flimsy which makes the latch very difficult to unlock and lower the hood.  </li>
            <li> In sending the request as directed the email bounce back -- the email address is no good!!!  </li>
            <li> useless if you use big rollers.</li>

            <li> I actually didn&#x27;t mind that the dryer is made of cheap plastic, because it is lightweight and easy to fold up and carry . The settings seems to work fine: even the highest setting is still comfortable. The problem is that there is what appears to be height adjustment slots on the front, however, when lowered the  bonnet frequently collapses on your head! The most annoying thing ever. I&#x27;ve taken to sitting on a pillow, which still doesn&#x27;t place me high enPugh for proper drying. Wastes of money but it seems most of the ones on the market in this price range have similar issues.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in February and it stopped working a few weeks ago. I am not sure how a dryer overheats and burns out when it&#x27;s a dryer! And I only use it once a week. At any rate, I won&#x27;t purchase from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this pretty little dryer that gets hot and the hood drops. Dryer is poorly constructed plastic that softens when it heats up. Latches won&#x27;t hold. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I would not buy this product as it is poorly made.  I also would not buy from the vendor.  The hood of the hair dryer would not adjust up or down.  And, after only two attempts to get the hood to adjust down the hood would not stay in open position.  Also, when I turned the dryer on it immediately turned itself off.  I contacted the Beauty in Black vendor for a return and they do not have a contact # only email.  Their return policy has a 20% return restock fee and their email address to request a RMA (return merchandize authorization) #actually is with a different vendor called [...].  In sending the request as directed the email bounce back -- the email address is no good!!!  So, I am at a lost how to get this issue resolved.</li>
            <li> This dryer is very attractive from the outside, but it works terribly. For starters, it&#x27;s waaaay too hot!I have to lift the hood several times just to get any relief from the hotness of this dryer. Second, as with most hooded dryers, it doesn&#x27;t distribute the heat evenly toward the back of your head. I don&#x27;t know what the makers were thinking when they designed such a dryer! Did they even bother trying it out before distributing to the market? Last, I can&#x27;t return this item because the beauty supply store I purchased it at, doesn&#x27;t have a return policy. So now I&#x27;m stuck with this piece of mess!Purchase at your own risk.</li>
            <li> The all-plastic construction means that it&#x27;s not incredibly sturdy.

            <li> I enjoy using this to dry and style my hair.  It is a good quality product and quite easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting a hooded dryer for my curly hair and was so happy to purchase. This has made my life much easier. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I would not buy this product again and would caution others not to.  I purchased it at my local beauty supply store because it looked nice and it was supposedly of a higher quality than the one I owned previously.  When I opened the box I first noticed the very poor quality of the plastic used to make the dryer and that it only has two settings, unbearably hot and not hot enough.  It has no height adjustment.  It doesn&#x27;t dry the back of my hair and if I put rollers in my hair then my head doesn&#x27;t fit underneath it.  Do not purchase this product it is a waste of money.  Like the other reviewer, I tried to return it to my local beauty supply store and they would not take it back.</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer hoping I would be spared the same fate others experienced.  Not so, because the hood&#x27;s locking latch is very flimsy which makes the latch very difficult to unlock and lower the hood.  It&#x27;s loud while in use, but it heats ok which is why I gave it three stars and not two stars.</li>
            <li> I only attempted to use this item once, and it stopped blowing hot air after approx 5 minutes... Waste of my time and money and now I am stuck with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas.  She loves it.  She said it gets hot enough and easy to use.  I would recommend this item to anyone.</li>
            <li> Hood will not come down far enough. I have to sit on three pillows to get my head high enough. Don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> I do not like the way it is design far as abjusting the hood and it doesn&#x27;t dry your hair in the back or evenly.  Poorly designed. You have to abjust the hood to the point where it covers your face in order for your hair to evenly and the back.</li>
            <li> I love this item!! It works just like the salon hair dryers.</li>
            <li> The dryer does what I need it to do. Small issues like the heat doesn&#x27;t reach the back of my hair line. I have to use a hand dryer to finish drying the back. The high setting can be really hot and canister can barely fit my head with the rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But again, the dryer does essentially dry the hair (it can reach) completely and effectively.</li>
            <li> useless if you use big rollers.</li>
            <li> When I first saw it, I thought it was made a bit cheaply.  It is all plastic and seemed like it would break easily.  However, it works great.  I have been using now for about a month, and I love it.</li>
            <li> I brought this hair dryer about a year ago, first the hair dryer is very loud, and it has only 2 settings. I had this dryer for little over a year and the adjustment for the bonnet will not stay in place so while you are under the dryer the bonnet will fall down on your face without warning, please do not buy this dryer, it&#x27;s a piece of junk.</li>
            <li> This product took about two weeks to arrive. Product was great. It comes actually the way it is displayed on the site. I was very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This product is truly amazing.  I am glad I purchase.  Very easy to operate.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
