            <li>this product is interesting and good product.</li>

            <li>Love it and love the price.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for my Irish ivory skin.</li>
            <li>I have used it on top of a cream based foundation and corrector too, and it did not get cakey, but I prefer to use it with no makeup under it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Either way, it has my thumbs up! :)</li>
            <li>This is literally my favorite translucent powder</li>
            <li>great for setting foundation and concealer, still prefer pressed powder because of the messiness with loose powder, good value for amount of product needed.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I think it works great as a setting powder!</li>
            <li>I apply it lightly with a brush.</li>
            <li>Light and smooth.</li>
            <li>It goes on silky smooth, and looks matte.</li>
            <li>is important have this product</li>
            <li>It does not add unwanted color, but it does set my foundation beautifully for hours of long wear.  </li>
            <li>:) No, I am not saying you will smell like an old lady.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very light and sheer.</li>
            <li>It can make a huge difference between blown out highlights on the forehead and natural looking skin.</li>
            <li>, I am just about to finish up my first container of this powder</li>
            <li>Just got it yesterday and used it today for the first time.</li>
            <li>Too pale of a color for my fair skin</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find it on Amazon, and surely hope I can continue to find it there for awhile at least!</li>
            <li>it will really be a shame if they discontinue it.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t stand the smell.</li>
            <li>also really don&#x27;t care for the architecture  of the product.</li>
            <li>I tend to get shiny on my nose and chin, and really thought this would help.</li>
            <li>I tend to use only natural products and always fragrance free.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The powder is very light, very natural and \\&quot;powdery\\&quot; (as opposed to \\&quot;synthetic\\&quot; and \\&quot;sand-like\\&quot; - as some newer and more expensive powders are these days) and for me the main plus is the smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very natural looking!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried high end brands.</li>
            <li>The powders are in right color and fineness for my skin, lighter Asian skin.</li>
            <li>I think it actually falls rather flat and gets cakey easily.</li>
            <li>It has a very old school powder smell.</li>
            <li>The only con I could say is that, I have oily skin and it doesn&#x27;t really help in that regard!</li>
            <li>In my quest to find the perfect matte powder, I was disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li>this product help for complete anything.</li>
            <li>I always like to know how long a product is going to last me to determine if it worth the cost</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal loose translucent powder is my main go to in my beauty bag to finish off my look.  </li>
            <li>When this first arrived, I was a little dismayed to see that, in the container, what was supposed to be translucent had a pinkish cast to it.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of my childhood, my grandma and other older ladies...</li>

            <li> and I have used it almost every single day for the past 4 years.</li>
            <li> I like that it does not feel heavy or leave a caked on heavy powdery look.  </li>
            <li> I have been wearing this powder for several years, and was terribly disappointed when it suddenly just disappeared from the shelves of the store I bought from.</li>
            <li> I hate they discontinued them in my local store.</li>
            <li> So sad.</li>

When this first arrived, I was a little dismayed to see that, in the container, what was supposed to be translucent had a pinkish cast to it. My skin tone is yellow based. However, when I put it on, there&#x27;s not a trace of pinkness. It virtually disappears into my skin without a trace of cakiness, removes all shine, and I love the fragrance!</li>

            <li> I love this product. It makes.  My makeup look airbrushed.</li>
            <li> I have used this powder for years. I hate they discontinued them in my local store. So happy to find it on here. I alternate between the three shades depending on what time of year it is.</li>
            <li> Just got it yesterday and used it today for the first time. It goes on silky smooth, and looks matte. My skin looks great!!</li>
            <li> I love that this powder comes on! The only con I could say is that, I have oily skin and it doesn&#x27;t really help in that regard! Other than that, I think it works great as a setting powder!</li>
            <li> Like both the quality and quantity of this product. The powders are in right color and fineness for my skin, lighter Asian skin. Its cap with doting holes on it made it very easy to apply with the pad comes within. Love it and love the price.</li>

            <li> this powder has a formulation unlike any other (main ingredient is not talc, starch, or titanium dioxide) that keeps it from being horribly whitening/chalky like most other powders. although i have medium-toned skin, the \\&quot;translucent\\&quot; color is not whitening on me. it truly deserves the \\&quot;translucent\\&quot; label, unlike basically every other talc, starch, or titanium dioxide powder out there. the finish is not deathly matte but still fights shine. i&#x27;ve been using for over ten years, trying other products here and there, but always coming back to this one. it will really be a shame if they discontinue it.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!  So happy to have found this online since I can&#x27;t find it in the stores any longer.</li>
            <li> me gusta que sean muy eficientes  y rapidos con el envio sigan de esa manera para que les sigan comprando.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal makeup is usually a hit and miss for me, but this one is superb quality and a great value for the money. I ordered this based on Paula&#x27;s review (the website) and I was not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear it on days when I don&#x27;t wear makeup only sunscreen, which makes my skin look oily and overly shiny. This powder helps absorb that shine ad keeps my skin matte until I reapply the sunscreen. I have used it on top of a cream based foundation and corrector too, and it did not get cakey, but I prefer to use it with no makeup under it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The powder is very light, very natural and \\&quot;powdery\\&quot; (as opposed to \\&quot;synthetic\\&quot; and \\&quot;sand-like\\&quot; - as some newer and more expensive powders are these days) and for me the main plus is the smell. It has a very old school powder smell. It reminds me of my childhood, my grandma and other older ladies... :) No, I am not saying you will smell like an old lady. The fragrance is a very sophisticated, \\&quot;put together\\&quot; smell that may remind you of your childhood... Or not. Either way, it has my thumbs up! :)</li>
            <li> When L&#x27;Oreal quit making Photogenic loose translucent I switched to their Luminous Loose Powder.  I switch foundation colors summer and winter and this is a great finishing powder with either foundation so I hope L&#x27;Oreal doesn&#x27;t quit making this.</li>
            <li> Does not give me the luminous sheen that I&#x27;m looking for.  Too pale of a color for my fair skin</li>
            <li> I keep this in my camera bag when shooting portraits. It can make a huge difference between blown out highlights on the forehead and natural looking skin.</li>
            <li> i have oily skin and i use this over my face and eyelids.......colorless and workd for me........it is a staple in my make up line</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe it is the same product and maybe that is why it can no longer be bought on drugstore/supermarket shelves. Something has changed chemically with this face powder.</li>
            <li> this product is interesting and good product. good factory. this product help for complete anything. is important have this product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my own fault for not noting that this has added fragrance before purchasing it. I really can&#x27;t stand the smell. I tend to use only natural products and always fragrance free. It might have gotten 3 stars if not for the over-powering smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really don&#x27;t care for the architecture  of the product. I ended up removing the application pad they give you, and I instead dump some of the product into the lid and use a brush to apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get a lot of it for your money, so that is one plus I suppose. But I personally can&#x27;t wait to get rid of it so that I can buy a product which does not stink in such an unnatural way. When it comes to applying something around my eyes and nose, I&#x27;d rather not have to worry about what kind of harmful additives are included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s also not very &#x27;luminous&#x27; at all. I think it actually falls rather flat and gets cakey easily. I don&#x27;t recommend this product,</li>
            <li> This is literally my favorite translucent powder and I&#x27;ve tried high end brands. Great price, great quality, does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to do. Sets my foundation and controls shine all day.</li>
            <li> great for setting foundation and concealer, still prefer pressed powder because of the messiness with loose powder, good value for amount of product needed.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I have used it for over 10 years.  L&#x27;Oreal has discontinued the product.  So sad.</li>
            <li> In my quest to find the perfect matte powder, I was disappointed with this product. I tend to get shiny on my nose and chin, and really thought this would help. I still shine, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to give a good amount of coverage when compared to the pressed powders.</li>
