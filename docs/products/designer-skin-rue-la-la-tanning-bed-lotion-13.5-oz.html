            <li>It smells AMAZING too.</li>
            <li>I cannot tell it gets warm.</li>
            <li>It is honestly the best lotion on the market and is worth every penny full retail price of $80</li>
            <li>i got this lotion at first as a sample.l0ved it so moisturizing and smells great</li>
            <li>I got amazing color from it, after just the very first time!</li>
            <li>But it smells better after you get out of the bed.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I love designer skin product.</li>
            <li>It is ok.</li>

            <li>and I LOVE that it doesn&#x27;t contain bronzers.  </li>
            <li>This lotion works wonders- such a great purchase!</li>
            <li>The scent was too light, and had kind of a vegetable smell</li>
            <li>After reading reviews I was very excited about this lotion.</li>
            <li>As far as helping you get darker, it works great.</li>
            <li>I love designer skin just not crazy about rue la la.</li>
            <li>The smell is light, you don&#x27;t have to worry about ATO at all.</li>
            <li>I purchased Rue La La tanning lotion from this seller, knowing it has no bronzers and that it is N anti aging lotion filled with collagen.</li>
            <li>Partly because i love the bottle,but i really didnt love it.</li>
            <li>Its your true skin color since there are NO bronzers in this bottle.</li>
            <li>After using products that had more bronzer in them, I was very dissatisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>It smells like incense, sandalwood, and a sweet smell.</li>
            <li>The product was authentic and matched up exactly to the same bottle I purchased for more from my tanning salon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been tanning for years and have used so many different lotions I&#x27;ve lost count.</li>
            <li>I like Kardashian glow Intensifier (Blue Bottle) better than this one.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not an avid tanner</li>
            <li>and you can really tell the difference!&lt;br /&gt;The warming affect isn&#x27;t prominent but it is definitely there.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Bought this cream on Saturday 14feb for a wee change the smell is lovely and a can see a slight difference in my colour after 1 try of this cream am well chuffed this price was not bad £15</li>
            <li>I previously used Phoenician and liked it but wanted to increase intensity and got this one.</li>
            <li>It is very greasy but does moisturize well.</li>
            <li>I really cannot give a review because I do not use this stuff.  </li>
            <li>i really wanted to like this lotion  </li>
            <li>and i dont care much for the way i smell.</li>
            <li>It kind of went overboard to the point where thats all you smell in the the tanning</li>
            <li>Actually like mr big time better.</li>
            <li>Very soft and moisturizing!</li>
            <li>gave me a very natural looking tan</li>
            <li>Like many other people, I only notice the tingling on my face, nowhere else.  </li>
            <li>I use this product on my face because it doesn&#x27;t break me out with the lack of cosmetic bronzers and it leaves my skin feeling extremely soft.</li>
            <li>it gave me a dark golden brown</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve used lots and lots of different types of lotions, this one is by far one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>already so dark i cant notice much of a differance</li>
            <li>It smelled amazing going on dont get me wrong, but I hate not being able to go home right away to shower and then spend the rest of the day smelling like a tanning salin</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lotion- kind of thick and hard to rub</li>

            <li> /&gt;Lotion- kind of thick and hard to rub</li>
            <li> Works fast, and I usually take a long time to tan.</li>
            <li> it just has warming which is a cool feature to have on a cold day when you don&#x27;t want to be blood red from using a tingle.</li>
            <li> not much of a warming sensation</li>
            <li> Feels like silk going on NOT greasy like some other reviews mentioned.</li>
            <li> only thing negative</li>
            <li> It gets me really dark</li>
            <li> I feel as dark as i would with a bronzer</li>
            <li> and it still got me verrrrrry dark!</li>
            <li> I was extremely dark in no time!</li>
            <li> It just smells like a plain lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m past my base tan and this added a little bit to it but not by much.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells GROSS and it&#x27;s extremely awkward..</li>
            <li> When I say brown, I mean BROWN.</li>
            <li> this product is alright .. very thick and hard to rub in.</li>
            <li> I say use this if your trying to build your base tan or if your trying to work your way up to using a tingle because it does get you used to being a little hotter in the booth.</li>
            <li> Which means no streaks and silly looking brown hands.</li>
            <li> but without that feeling like ill wash off my tan if i shower.</li>
            <li> one of those smells that is nasty</li>

            <li> Bought this cream on Saturday 14feb for a wee change the smell is lovely and a can see a slight difference in my colour after 1 try of this cream am well chuffed this price was not bad £15</li>
            <li> Even after one use I was amazed by the results.&lt;br /&gt;It gave me a very natural looking tan and you can really tell the difference!&lt;br /&gt;The warming affect isn&#x27;t prominent but it is definitely there.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing negative I can think of is the smell. It just smells like a plain lotion. But it smells better after you get out of the bed.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done! Very soft and moisturizing! That&#x27;s why I love designer skin product. The only thing was that I would have a stronger scent! It smelled amazing going on dont get me wrong, but I hate not being able to go home right away to shower and then spend the rest of the day smelling like a tanning salin</li>
            <li> Hello all,&lt;br /&gt;I never take the time to post my opinions on products I&#x27;ve used but in this case, I have to. I&#x27;ve been tanning for years and have used so many different lotions I&#x27;ve lost count. This lotion is UNDERRATED. I saw my skin become the deepest brown that I didn&#x27;t even think was possible. When I say brown, I mean BROWN. Its your true skin color since there are NO bronzers in this bottle. Which means no streaks and silly looking brown hands. Feels like silk going on NOT greasy like some other reviews mentioned. It is honestly the best lotion on the market and is worth every penny full retail price of $80+ .. Also, did I mention it smells AMAZING? Ive been asked by a handful of people what \\&quot;purfume\\&quot; I was wearing running errands after my tanning session. It&#x27;s a MUST BUY!</li>
            <li> After reading reviews I was very excited about this lotion. I previously used Phoenician and liked it but wanted to increase intensity and got this one. It is ok. I cannot tell it gets warm. It is very greasy but does moisturize well. Smell is very nice. Doesn&#x27;t smell like a tanning bed at all. I love designer skin just not crazy about rue la la. Actually like mr big time better.</li>
            <li> Best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. Works fast, and I usually take a long time to tan. It smells AMAZING too.</li>
            <li> After using products that had more bronzer in them, I was very dissatisfied with this product. Not only did it take forever to rub in, but I didn&#x27;t feel any tanner when I stepped out of the tanning salon. The lotion was white and I found that to turn me off too.</li>
            <li> This lotion ROCKS!! The smell is light, you don&#x27;t have to worry about ATO at all. I got amazing color from it, after just the very first time! It claims to have a \\&quot;warming\\&quot; affect to it, but I didn&#x27;t notice it at all. Overall for the price point, this lotion is a must buy!!</li>
            <li> I purchased Rue La La tanning lotion from this seller, knowing it has no bronzers and that it is N anti aging lotion filled with collagen. The product was authentic and matched up exactly to the same bottle I purchased for more from my tanning salon. Very pleased</li>
            <li> I really cannot give a review because I do not use this stuff.  My daughter does like it though and it&#x27;s a lot cheaper purchasing from Amazon Prime!</li>
            <li> Scent- The scent on this one gives me a headache. It smells like incense, sandalwood, and a sweet smell. It kind of went overboard to the point where thats all you smell in the the tanning booth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lotion- kind of thick and hard to rub in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warming- This lotion isn&#x27;t a tingle it just has warming which is a cool feature to have on a cold day when you don&#x27;t want to be blood red from using a tingle. I do feel the warming in this but it&#x27;s not hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results- I&#x27;m past my base tan and this added a little bit to it but not by much. I like Kardashian glow Intensifier (Blue Bottle) better than this one. I say use this if your trying to build your base tan or if your trying to work your way up to using a tingle because it does get you used to being a little hotter in the booth.</li>
            <li> It arrived just as advertised</li>
            <li> Great lotion. Arrived on time and condition was as described. Love this lotion. It is NOT for bronzing, non-greasy and stays on your skin.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not an avid tanner ofcourse you&#x27;re not going to understand how an intensifier works... these lotions are good for people who tan well and need to shock their skin to surpass their plateau, so to speak. This lotion smells GROSS and it&#x27;s extremely awkward..one of those smells that is nasty but you can&#x27;t put your finger on it type smell. As far as helping you get darker, it works great. This lotion is a good one to have in your rotation that you use once or twice a week. I use this product on my face because it doesn&#x27;t break me out with the lack of cosmetic bronzers and it leaves my skin feeling extremely soft.</li>
            <li> The lotion has a great smell and a great feel.  It&#x27;s not sticky, it feels like a regular lotion.  Like many other people, I only notice the tingling on my face, nowhere else.  Buuut, it does a great job as an accelerator and I LOVE that it doesn&#x27;t contain bronzers.  I&#x27;ll for sure buy another bottle when I run out!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this tanning lotion! I&#x27;ve been tanning for years and I&#x27;ve used lots and lots of different types of lotions, this one is by far one of my favorites. It gets me really dark and I love the warming sensation.. much better than using a tingle lotion in my opinion and gives great results!</li>
            <li> this product is alright .. very thick and hard to rub in. not much of a warming sensation but I do like the fact its not a bronzer and it still got me verrrrrry dark!</li>
            <li> This lotion works wonders- such a great purchase! I was extremely dark in no time! Its great for anyone who is looking for a quality tanning lotion but does not want the bronzers in it. I feel as dark as i would with a bronzer but without that feeling like ill wash off my tan if i shower. Pleasant scent too! Reminds me of a perfume,</li>
            <li> i really wanted to like this lotion  Partly because i love the bottle,but i really didnt love it. The scent was too light, and had kind of a vegetable smell and i didnt notice any warming effect. Im already so dark i cant notice much of a differance but i feel a bit oily and i dont care much for the way i smell.</li>
            <li> i got this lotion at first as a sample.l0ved it so moisturizing and smells great it gave me a dark golden brown n0t a phony bronzer.the best part is the tanmann 0n amazon g0t the l0tion to me in less than a week!hes awesome and has the best lotions.0h yeah tanning yeah!</li>
