            <li>Very good stuff thank you</li>
            <li>I will be very honest and rate this product fairly!  </li>
            <li>I was so happy with my shima Oil.  </li>
            <li>I guess it didn&#x27;t work so great for me.  </li>
            <li>Anyway some people will say great, but not for me...  </li>
            <li>This is another great scalp and hair moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This oil made my hair grow, shine and has given me great lengths.  </li>
            <li>IT HAS A GREAT SMELL AND</li>
            <li>Shima Shampoo and conditioner was ok, and smell is delicious....</li>
            <li>Good reviews after all.  </li>
            <li>Her products have a tolerable smell but they do not smell good.</li>
            <li>I said No way this could be her hair looking this good.</li>
            <li>Good deal.</li>
            <li>This is an exceptional product.  </li>

            <li>The oil is very nice and extremely light.  </li>
            <li>Also, who ever said her products smell good is a bold face lie.</li>
            <li>Shima oil is very lite on the hair gives a great shine</li>
            <li>Once I I completed the bottles, I invested in the Aphrogee line did a protein treatment, trimmed my ends, and started a healthy hair journey that is working for me.</li>
            <li>Okay - I read a lot of reviews before I just jumped on board with Shima.  </li>

            <li>Truly, this product is worth every dime/drop.</li>
            <li>It is economically priced which is a plus</li>
            <li>This may very well be a great product however it is extremely oily and will stain your pillow cases.</li>
            <li>It was not the right product for me.  </li>
            <li>My hair was very moisturized with this oil, not greasy not heavy very light.</li>
            <li>I have used many oils before, but non of them have left my hair feeling moisturized.  </li>

            <li>I love this product, not only for me &amp; my daughter&#x27;s hair but for my skin too.  </li>

            <li>i even give myself hot oil treatments.</li>
            <li>(Personally I use it twice a day) and it has a light fresh sent.</li>
            <li>As long as it keeps my hair looking shiny and healthy I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>Also, my locks feel light and not heavy as well as the color is beginning to look vibrant again.</li>
            <li>People say When u turn a certain age ur hair falls out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s  very moisturizing without leaving  your  hair  oily.</li>
            <li>The shedding was just too much</li>
            <li>Very greasy and hair shredded alot.</li>
            <li>no matter how much of the leave-in I put on my hair.</li>

            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>This oil really keeps my hair shiny without being greasy.</li>
            <li>IT REALLY PENETRATES THE HAIR.</li>
            <li>Products came on time and packaged very thuroughly.</li>
            <li>Thanks Shima</li>
            <li>My hair felt fine until it was time to blow dry it.  </li>
            <li>Because of this I&#x27;m going back to my tried and true JBCO</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve only used it a few times, but i can say it does a good job with adding moisture to my hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product; It truly works.</li>
            <li>It is much more silky and there is far less breakage when I am combing it out.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soooo soft!</li>
            <li>My hair always blow dry very soft, fluffy and nice with lots of natural body to it.  </li>
            <li>I have all natural afro kinky/curly hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used all natural pomades and never had to wrap my hairline.</li>
            <li>OMG I was ready to do a Jig outside my front door.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t assume because your hair is natural</li>
            <li>makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li>So I have been growing my hair back for the past two years; My hair is natural and I press and flat iron it to straighten it when I wear it straight; but it hit the shoulder length plateau and wouldn&#x27;t get healthy length beyond that.</li>
            <li>i see this Women with long thick black beautiful hair.</li>
            <li>So i hope this helps anyone that would like to have Strong, Natural growing ,Shiny, Soft, Thick hair Buy the Shima Products.</li>
            <li>So i hope this helps anyone that would like to have Strong, Natural growing ,Shiny, Soft, Thick hair Buy the Shima Products.</li>
            <li>The oil leaves my hair soft, manageable, and moisturized like no other product.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care about a products&#x27; smell so long as it isn&#x27;t offensive and the product does what it says.</li>
            <li>My hair was dry, dull and very unattractive (baseball caps to the rescue), and after one week of use I could see the differene in the shine, softness and bounce the SHIMA OIL gave my hair and it has continuallly gotten better with each wash and daily application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d prefer wash with the Shampoo and go back to using my Clear Conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I associated it with the different elements or ingredients being in the leave in conditioner and me being natural putting heat to my hair.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought it was because I used it with my jamaican black castor oil (JBCO)</li>
            <li>The shampoo is very stripping as well and left my hair very very dry.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it on my hair wet because my hair is super fragile wet.</li>
            <li>First time I tried I realize It was little bit oily, but I didn&#x27;t care.  </li>
            <li>Not only was my hair Manageable, Soft, Shiny, Non Greasy, I gave up using blow dryers, flat irons, and i stop combing my hair like i was raking a garden loaded with Weeds.</li>
            <li>I used this product as directed and instructed completely for 2 months and was very consistent, it didn&#x27;t give me any results, but did cause unnecessary shedding.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d heard a lot (good and bad) about the Shima hair line and when she was featured in Sister2Sister magazine I thought I&#x27;d give her products a try.</li>

            <li> My hair has been sisterlocked for 3 years and a year ago due to stress in my life my hair was shedding uncontrollably.</li>
            <li> I used this once a day, depending on your hair&#x27;s porousness you may want to use it every other day.</li>
            <li> It is an oil unlike any other I have ever used before.  </li>
            <li> Today, my hair is very heavy after washing it last night with Shima products.  </li>
            <li> For my work I have to wear every single day a white blouse, and after shower I dried my hair and put some oil on my hair, really small amount</li>
            <li> This product weighed my hair down</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and the smell is not overbearing.</li>
            <li> No matter what I&#x27;ve done in the past my hair is always dry.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I got this oil and started using it on March 17, 2015 and today I checked my length, my hair grew 3 inches. This oil is really amazing. In a little over one month, the growth is awesome​.</li>
            <li> shima oil was too greasy and I just did not like it . Maybe it was just because I did not use it properly. I gave the oil away.</li>
            <li> Shima oil is very lite on the hair gives a great shine I will be purchasing this again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  very moisturizing without leaving  your  hair  oily. It  absorbs into the  hair shaft very nicely!</li>
            <li> My hair was very moisturized with this oil, not greasy not heavy very light. Just started using it so will write another review later.</li>
            <li> I used this product as directed and instructed completely for 2 months and was very consistent, it didn&#x27;t give me any results, but did cause unnecessary shedding. Once I I completed the bottles, I invested in the Aphrogee line did a protein treatment, trimmed my ends, and started a healthy hair journey that is working for me. The shedding was just too much and I didn&#x27;t understand why I was getting it, especially since I had my ends trimmed prior to using this product. NEVER AGAIN I was too disappointed and ended up with less hair than I started with.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soooo soft! No matter what I&#x27;ve done in the past my hair is always dry. The oil retains my moisture and makes my hair feel like silk!</li>
            <li> Very greasy and hair shredded alot.</li>
            <li> Okay - I read a lot of reviews before I just jumped on board with Shima.  I will be very honest and rate this product fairly!  After this product arrived in the mail I decided to use the oil while I waited on my next wash date.  The oil is very nice and extremely light.  I had no issues with the oil at all.  In fact, I wanted to just use the oil but I decided to purchase the Shampoo and Leave-In Conditioner.  Honestly, my hair wasn&#x27;t cut out for Leave in anything so hopefully my next statement make sense.  Anyway, I used the Shampoo with no problem at all.  It doesn&#x27;t have a bad order or anything. I used it as directed by the DVD (apply to your hair strands, allow it to set for 5-10 and then wash out).  Next I used the Leave-In Conditioner.  My hair felt fine until it was time to blow dry it.  My hair always blow dry very soft, fluffy and nice with lots of natural body to it.  This product weighed my hair down but I could feel the thickness and the texture of it.  My hair also began to SHED like NEVER before when I started to blow dry it.  I associated it with the different elements or ingredients being in the leave in conditioner and me being natural putting heat to my hair.  I could literally see strands of my hair all over the sink.  I thought I was going crazy at first.  Each time I flat ironed a section, it felt like it was melting and I could see a few strands on my CHI flatiron.  My hair is accustomed to heat but this was different.  I can&#x27;t say the oil didn&#x27;t work but I refuse to use the leave in conditioner again.  I&#x27;d prefer wash with the Shampoo and go back to using my Clear Conditioner.  Today, my hair is very heavy after washing it last night with Shima products.  There is no bounce to it at all.  However, I will wash it again tonight without the Leave-In conditioner to see how it works.  Stand by for updates!</li>
            <li> It may kill bugs or something; smells like something you can buy off the shelf at Home Depot, Ace or Lowe&#x27;s. Enough said! It broke my daughters hair off &amp; made it weak. Still have a lot left from the 2 bottles. Will probably use it on my cat (Bengal) 4 bug control. LOL!</li>
            <li> I have used many oils before, but non of them have left my hair feeling moisturized.  They would only make my hair feel greasy or oiling.  Not this product.  Shima Oil SOAKS into my hair and stays there.  No Geri Curl bag using this product.  The oil leaves my hair soft, manageable, and moisturized like no other product.  Do yourself a favor and just try 1 bottle.  I know you would like it.  I started with a small bottle and now I have 8 LARGE bottles in my closet. I won&#x27;t use anything else.  I even take this on vacation with me.  When I started, my hair was touching the top of my shoulders, but now it&#x27;s almost at my bra strap.  See ladies, this product keeps your hair moisturized to help prevent breakage (actually all Shima products do).  It has helped me.  Thanks Shima!</li>
            <li> A co-worker told me about the product and I immediately ordered, since I was having a hard time maintaiing my NEW nature doo.  My hair was dry, dull and very unattractive (baseball caps to the rescue), and after one week of use I could see the differene in the shine, softness and bounce the SHIMA OIL gave my hair and it has continuallly gotten better with each wash and daily application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one down-side is that it leaves my face oily and at night it soaks into my pillow, thus bumping my face.</li>
            <li> I LOVE HER PRODUCTS.  I WILL ALWAYS BE A LOYAL CUSTOMER.  THE PRICES ARE WORTH THE THE RESULTS FOR YOUR HAIR.</li>
            <li> First time I tried I realize It was little bit oily, but I didn&#x27;t care.  I was so happy with my shima Oil.  Good reviews after all.  I guess it didn&#x27;t work so great for me.  For my work I have to wear every single day a white blouse, and after shower I dried my hair and put some oil on my hair, really small amount, my hair was still ok, but my blouse was not so good.  Anyway some people will say great, but not for me...  Shima Shampoo and conditioner was ok, and smell is delicious....</li>
            <li> This is an exceptional product.  I used it on my daughter&#x27;s afro texture hair and it worked amazingly.... but I also used it on my fine color treated hair and realized it true value.  I love this product, not only for me &amp; my daughter&#x27;s hair but for my skin too.  I use a drop on my wet skin and it made my skin softer than any skin product I&#x27;ve used thus far.  Truly, this product is worth every dime/drop.</li>
            <li> A great light weight and good smelling oil. I have always enjoyed this product as it make my hair smooth and soft. This is another great scalp and hair moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I used this product as directed and my hair began shedding terribly. At first I thought it was because I used it with my jamaican black castor oil (JBCO) but even when I used it by its self my hair was still shedding. Because of this I&#x27;m going back to my tried and true JBCO and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have never written a review of any product.  However, I must say this is one hair oil I will definately continue bying as long as it is made.  Shima thanks You for discovering and sharing this oil with all your Shima GIRLZ!  This oil made my hair grow, shine and has given me great lengths.  Thanks!! Liz</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d heard a lot (good and bad) about the Shima hair line and when she was featured in Sister2Sister magazine I thought I&#x27;d give her products a try. I have all natural afro kinky/curly hair. I received the items quickly. They were packaged nicely. I knew the hairline cream was a joke as soon as I saw how thin and runny it was. The one and only way the hairline cream would lay down my hairline is if I wrapped my edges after I put it on. I could&#x27;ve used plain water and wrapped my hairline and gotten the same results. I&#x27;ve used all natural pomades and never had to wrap my hairline. The leave-in left my hair feeling stripped...it was a weird feeling. It made my hair tangle very badly I mean absolutely no slippage no matter how much of the leave-in I put on my hair. I used it once on one section of my hair and that was it. I had to use another product on top of the leave in. The shampoo is very stripping as well and left my hair very very dry. The only thing I did like was the oil and I will probably continue to use it. Also, who ever said her products smell good is a bold face lie. I don&#x27;t really care about a products&#x27; smell so long as it isn&#x27;t offensive and the product does what it says. Her products have a tolerable smell but they do not smell good. Shima&#x27;s hair products are a joke.</li>
            <li> I love all Shima Products. I am and will be a Shimagirl. I just wish before i cut my hair to shoulder length i ran into her products. After my hair was Cut and still was not able to control the thickness, dryness, hard to manage hair i was giving up and was thinking about another cut, The halle berry cut. I was on vacation got on the internet did some searching on hair and Pop i see this Women with long thick black beautiful hair. I said No way this could be her hair looking this good. So i went on click on her video and saw how she takes care of her hair using her silk scarfs at nite to sleep in, keeping her hair in a protective style, keeping the ends trim. So i said Hmmm I went on and click on another video. This was about females wanted her to Pull her hair to prove it was her hair, Comb it real hard all kinds of crazyness which you will see also if you click on her videos on her site. But make the long story short. I continue to look at more videos and said Ok im not going to cut my hair. Im going to follow Shima RULES and order her line of products. So i did and when i saw the difference OMG I was ready to do a Jig outside my front door. Not only was my hair Manageable, Soft, Shiny, Non Greasy, I gave up using blow dryers, flat irons, and i stop combing my hair like i was raking a garden loaded with Weeds. No 2day as i type this to u. My whole family uses her products also friends and ppl i don&#x27;t even know come up to me and ask about my hair and what i use and i give them the Shima site to go check it out and order and they kept in contact with me on there progress with NO COMPLAINTS. I have pictures of when i started in Nov 2010 up till July 5th 2012 and my hair is on my Azz. Yes it is and its all Mine and All REAL!!!. I am on FaceBook if you would like to see my beginning and still going results.Phillypeach is my name there.  People say When u turn a certain age ur hair falls out. Not true.

            <li> Good deal. Product smells nice. I hope my hair likes it</li>
            <li> nope, not really for me</li>
            <li> I came across this product through amazon recommendations and was intrigued. I had alopecia caused by the psoriasis on my scalp as a result I lost my hair 5 times in 4 years. Now my doctor has me on Humaira so it corrected the psoriasis and the resulting alopecia. So I have been growing my hair back for the past two years; My hair is natural and I press and flat iron it to straighten it when I wear it straight; but it hit the shoulder length plateau and wouldn&#x27;t get healthy length beyond that. I started using this product about a year ago and the length and fullness that I had in my youth has now been recaptured. Shima oil is lightweight non-greasy can be used every day. (Personally I use it twice a day) and it has a light fresh sent. I highly recommend this product; It truly works. I figure once I hit the mid-back below the bra line level, I&#x27;ll be content and maybe I will put my friends and family one to my \\&quot;Shima\\&quot; secret as for you out in amazon land get this product it works.</li>
            <li> This may very well be a great product however it is extremely oily and will stain your pillow cases. It&#x27;s simply way too... oily unless you plan to stay home for the day and maybe shampoo it out later.  It was not the right product for me.  Might be worth a try to see if it is a good fit for you. It is economically priced which is a plus since I purchased a number of bottles. Just be fore warned that it is oily, oily, oily...</li>
            <li> My hair has been sisterlocked for 3 years and a year ago due to stress in my life my hair was shedding uncontrollably. I&#x27;ve tried every thing and it didn&#x27;t slow down the shedding. I came across this a month ago and have been using it for about 3 weeks and the shedding has tapered off a lot. I use this as a moisturizer when my hair is dry. I don&#x27;t use it on my hair wet because my hair is super fragile wet. I also use protective hair styles even though I have locked hair. A little goes a long way with this product. Don&#x27;t assume because your hair is natural it&#x27;s going to require more. Also, my locks feel light and not heavy as well as the color is beginning to look vibrant again. I wash my hair once a week and in the summer twice. I do not use this to grease my scalp I have another oil that I use for that. I used this once a day, depending on your hair&#x27;s porousness you may want to use it every other day. One more thing...I also started using Shima Shampoo in conjunction, so this may also be helping with the tapering off of my hair shedding as well.</li>
            <li> I give this oil 5 star&#x27;s because my hair has always been at the same length and has never moved but now that I use the shima oil it has grown pass my shoulders and is very long i like to call it crack in a bottle because I have never used anything like it i use it every morning and night it&#x27;s like a drug that you have to use every day i love it</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve only used it a few times, but i can say it does a good job with adding moisture to my hair. I will have to continue to use it to be able to write up a better report.</li>
            <li> just received it today used it going to see what the result going to be if work I&#x27;ll continue to use it give it 5 stars</li>
            <li> Ive been using oil on and off for 2 years and from my experience it has grown my hair tremendously. I trimmed off 1.5-2 inches of hair off and once I put the oil on along with protective styling, my hair started to grow like weeds! I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This oil really keeps my hair shiny without being greasy. I think it&#x27;s making my hair grow, but maybe I&#x27;m just being hopeful. It is an oil unlike any other I have ever used before.  As long as it keeps my hair looking shiny and healthy I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Love Shima&#x27;s oil. I&#x27;ve been using it since 2010. My hair grew longer than it ever had before.</li>
            <li> SHIMA OIL IS THE BEST AROUND BELIEVE ME I&#x27;VE TRIED THEM ALL BUT THIS ONE IS THE BEST IT REALLY PENETRATES THE HAIR. IT DOES NOT STAY ON TOP IT GOES INSIDE WHERE IT SHOULD BE.. THERE IS NO OIL FILL TO YOUR HANDS IT HAS A GREAT SMELL AND A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY.. THAT IS WHY SHIMA GETS 5 STARS ALL DAY.</li>
            <li> Products came on time and packaged very thuroughly. I have only been using it for a month, but I can definitely feel a difference in my hair. It is much more silky and there is far less breakage when I am combing it out.</li>
            <li> This is the most moisture my hair has ever had.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and the smell is not overbearing. Thanks Shima</li>
            <li> makes my hair soft. love the product. i even give myself hot oil treatments. i will be buying myself more of her products. thaxs shima</li>
            <li> Very good stuff thank you</li>
