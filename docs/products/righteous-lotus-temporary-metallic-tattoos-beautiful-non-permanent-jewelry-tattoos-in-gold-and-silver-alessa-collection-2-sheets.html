            <li>But, after trying one of the bracelets first and then the beautiful necklace second, I&#x27;m sold.  </li>
            <li>Bought these for a female friend and she looks really good with them</li>
            <li>When I agreed to review these in exchange for a review, I really wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  </li>

            <li>These are very easy to apply, simply follow the instructions.  </li>
            <li>These are fun for summer, wish real tattoos looked like this!</li>

            <li>holidays on the beach where you don’t want to risk losing real jewellery, or for just having fun</li>

            <li>I was under no obligation to post a review or give positive feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, first off, two packs arrived, well protected and ready to use.</li>
            <li>/twist too much and if you avoid soap, sunscreen, lotions, oils, etc.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have nor want real tattoos because I don&#x27;t want to be stuck in a long-term relationship with one.  </li>
            <li>They look great and last long enough, the picture I attached is after 3 showers and 4-5 days</li>
            <li>These tattoos almost look like individual stenciled designs that took hours instead of quick jewelry tattoos that took seconds to apply.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These tattoos went on very easy to get on with just a damp towel, and they stick very well so long as they do not get wet.  </li>
            <li>(In other words, it&#x27;s a pretty quick process.)  </li>
            <li>They look such fun.</li>
            <li>Such fun to put on and create a funky look.</li>
            <li>Get so many compliments everyday!</li>
            <li>near the tattoos.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by how classy these looked.  </li>
            <li>I try to provide you with simple reviews that get straight to the point without a lot of jargon or repeating the product description.</li>
            <li>The simple instructions are printed right on the back of the package, and even I, a self-avowed dunce when it comes to all things makeup, etc., had no trouble applying these tattoos.  </li>
            <li>Went on easily and lasted a few days!</li>
            <li>but I had no previous experience).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are reasonably priced, and also stay on for a long time.  </li>
            <li>The opaque paper backing made it a bit tricky to get them exactly where you want so be careful with your positioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>instructions are very easy - remove the clear sheet, place tattoo face down on dry skin, wet tattoo with sponge or towel, remove after 30 seconds and let dry.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a little bit worn out, but still pretty visible.</li>
            <li>Peel off the clear backing, apply to skin, wet the paper backing and remove after about ten seconds.</li>

            <li> Since I typically use one or several of these products, my tattoos only lasted a day or two before fading and peeling.</li>
            <li> They last several days, but less if you scrub a lot during bath or dishwashing.  </li>
            <li> -- especially the rings, as other fingers get in the way.  </li>
            <li> Once you move if they are not dry yet can stretch and look off a little.</li>
            <li> tried them on myself and three daughters, and even the four-year-old didn&#x27;t have any trouble holding still long enough for her tattoo to go on.  </li>

            <li> We can&#x27;t wait to try some other designs!&lt;br</li>
            <li> quite dark skinned</li>
            <li> They ARE a little tricky if you&#x27;re applying them AROUND something (the ones that go around a wrist, etc.)</li>
            <li> I also like placing 2 small designs by the collarbone.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no right or wrong with these and just depends on the look you&#x27;re trying to achieve.&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love jewelry tattoos and am so glad to finally see them at a better price here on Amazon! (I paid over $20 for 2 sheets before on various sites) I always get compliments whenever I wear these and can&#x27;t wait to take them with me on a beach vacation. These tattoos almost look like individual stenciled designs that took hours instead of quick jewelry tattoos that took seconds to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are very easy - remove the clear sheet, place tattoo face down on dry skin, wet tattoo with sponge or towel, remove after 30 seconds and let dry. I&#x27;ve used these as &amp;#34;cuffs&amp;#34; around my upper arms, as &amp;#34;bracelets&amp;#34; around my wrists, as &amp;#34;necklaces&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;ankle bracelets&amp;#34; - you name it. I also like placing 2 small designs by the collarbone. There&#x27;s no right or wrong with these and just depends on the look you&#x27;re trying to achieve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wore these for several days in a row and saw no skin irritation. They can last several days if you place them somewhere where the skin doesn&#x27;t stretch/twist too much and if you avoid soap, sunscreen, lotions, oils, etc. near the tattoos. Since I typically use one or several of these products, my tattoos only lasted a day or two before fading and peeling. Tattoos can be removed by soaking the area in some kind of oil for about a minute (baby, olive, argan - I use whatever I have around) and then carefully scrubbing them off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product as a sample in exchange for an honest review. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with both the service and quality of tattoos- easy to apply, stays on long, easy to come off when you&#x27;re ready to wash</li>
            <li> These metallic temporary tattoos are fun to wear - better than glitter.  I don&#x27;t have nor want real tattoos because I don&#x27;t want to be stuck in a long-term relationship with one.  ;)  I tried the gold ones for fun and they look blingy.  I wish there were more metallic colors.  These tattoos are easy to apply.  They last several days, but less if you scrub a lot during bath or dishwashing.  I plan to buy some as stocking stuffers and unique additions to birthday gifts. These look very shiny -  great for girls&#x27; parties, going out, for holidays or just an extra decorative touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received sample in exchange for honest review.</li>
            <li> Bought these for a female friend and she looks really good with them on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An excellent substitute for the actual ones on chicks who want to &amp;#34;stay classy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Very pretty. Loved it!</li>
            <li> I’ve never had a tattoo – don’t fancy the pain and – a biggie for me – what if I don’t like it after a while? So when offered the chance to review these I jumped. They look such fun. I love jewellery and anything sparkly or glittery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, first off, two packs arrived, well protected and ready to use. Its really simple. Peel off the clear backing, apply to skin, wet the paper backing and remove after about ten seconds. Simples! They looked great and lasted well, I kept mine on for four days before the bracelet started to peel a bit, but that was because it was rubbed by a real bracelet – I tend to wear several permanently and of course it’s best of the tattoos are worn alone.  the ad days they are fine for 10-14 days and I can believe that easily. Removal was simple, but needed a bit of scrubbing. I used one of those net bathroom scrubs and some soap, but I think you could use a body polish or maybe even nail varnish remover. I’m quite dark skinned so the silver looked really good, but the gold didn’t stand out so much. I used a bracelet and one of the butterfly tattoos which I put on my shoulder. Its was easy to do alone but would be even easier if someone else helped. I was lucky in getting the butterfly straight and I did find I’d put the bracelet not quite right, so the two ends didn’t quite match up underneath. I made Him Indoors try one too – just the little stars, so that I could see if male skin made a difference...Poor man, he puts up with a lot from me Winking smile&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For holidays on the beach where you don’t want to risk losing real jewellery, or for just having fun these are great value. The grandkids want to play with them next! They love seeing what I have for review and products get a thorough testing from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product supplied for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I have always wanted a tattoo but never had the courage to get one. These jewelry tattoos are sparkly and so much fun to wear. I can’t say if they are the longest lasting as I have not tried others, but they are water resistant and I kept my on for a week before taking it off with alcohol. Even then it didn’t come off easily.  They are super easy to apply and are a great alternative to wearing a heavy chain around your neck. The price is great and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> These are very easy to apply and MUCH fun. They look great and last long enough, the picture I attached is after 3 showers and 4-5 days (yo don&#x27;t judge).</li>
            <li> When I agreed to review these in exchange for a review, I really wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  But, after trying one of the bracelets first and then the beautiful necklace second, I&#x27;m sold.  These temporary tattoos are simply gorgeous.  They last a lot longer than I thought they might and even after a day, did not have any cracks or chipping.  When we went out as I wore these, I received many compliments, so I know it was just me who thought they looked good.  These are very easy to apply, simply follow the instructions.  I would suggest attempting one of the smaller ones until you understand how they work (and you many already know - but I had no previous experience).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I will be using these again and my daughter dumpling is already begging for a set for herself.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by how classy these looked.  The simple instructions are printed right on the back of the package, and even I, a self-avowed dunce when it comes to all things makeup, etc., had no trouble applying these tattoos.  They ARE a little tricky if you&#x27;re applying them AROUND something (the ones that go around a wrist, etc.) -- especially the rings, as other fingers get in the way.  This meant we ended up with the ends not meeting up perfectly.  Other than that, they went on beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried them on myself and three daughters, and even the four-year-old didn&#x27;t have any trouble holding still long enough for her tattoo to go on.  (In other words, it&#x27;s a pretty quick process.)  We can&#x27;t wait to try some other designs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had some scraps, and I applied those to my journal just to test them out.  That works great, too, so these could be a fun addition to journal pages.  (Just make sure the paper is heavy enough that it can handle getting a bit wet for a few minutes.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product as a sample in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> Beautiful tattoos! They are easy to apply and wonderfully accessorize any outfit. The turnaround time between order and delivery was quick. Thank you.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:db8f2fc3109b980d1fdd0571f0e86788]] Such fun to put on and create a funky look.

            <li> Fun to wear! Went on easily and lasted a few days!</li>
            <li> These tattoos went on very easy to get on with just a damp towel, and they stick very well so long as they do not get wet.  The opaque paper backing made it a bit tricky to get them exactly where you want so be careful with your positioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited to add: Just went in the water and it is still staying on.  So it will stick even when swimming!</li>
            <li> delivery was fast, the product are amazing looking on my skin and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. thank you and I will def. work with your store again. I have gotten so many compliment because its so visible and nice touch to my skin</li>
            <li> I bought these for my wife and am so looking forward to beach weather!  These look like really good quality jewelry tattoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did some research on these and everyone stated they stayed on for several days.  I&#x27;m wondering how well they&#x27;ll do in salt water.  Once we&#x27;ve went to the shore, I&#x27;ll leave more feedback as to how well they withstand the ocean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they hold up I&#x27;ll be buying additional ones.  Happy wife, Happy life!</li>
            <li> Great color and seller even sent instructions via email for best results!</li>
            <li> These are fun for summer, wish real tattoos looked like this! Very easy to apply, last a little less time that other temp tatts due to metaillic paint but I expected that. fast shipping and good customer service.&lt;br /&gt;would like to see more design choices and more silver vs. gold colors available,</li>
            <li> Beautiful and lasted a long time! Get so many compliments everyday!</li>
            <li> How fun!  Can&#x27;t wait to try them.</li>
            <li> The best metallic tattoos I have had so far...everyone wanted to know where we purchased them!</li>
            <li> amazing product, got these set when there was a promotion&lt;br /&gt;did not expect deliver in a box, arrive on time&lt;br /&gt;checked review before place order&lt;br /&gt;customers stated that this tattoos will last long for days&lt;br /&gt;this is what I want all the time&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much for provide great delivery/service/product</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, looks awesome but kinda hard to put on with out moving! Once you move if they are not dry yet can stretch and look off a little. Definitely plan ahead of time!</li>
            <li> Loved the tattoos - especially the bracelet tattoos.  They are reasonably priced, and also stay on for a long time.  I&#x27;ve had one on for over a week and it&#x27;s a little bit worn out, but still pretty visible.</li>
            <li> I got these metallic tattoos for my 11 year old granddaughter and she was THRILLED with them and so were her friends!  Super cute designs, easy to put on and easy to take off.  All in all, a fun gift!</li>
            <li> Loved these tattoos. I bought them for my bachelorrette party in Palm Springs. They were really fun for me and my bridesmaids to put on and wear around town. Definitely recommend them!</li>
            <li> Nice variety in this set. They last a lot longer if you don&#x27;t use spray on oil sunscreen (my fault).</li>
            <li> Arrived really quickly, so pretty, too!</li>
