            <li> Before I even transferred my things into the Lyceem bag both inside zippers were broken. Needless to say I will be returning it and NOT buying anymore of their products.</li>
            <li> High quality product,Great size, Great features. It holds everything that I need for travel.There are enough compartments to organize nicely without having so many that you have no idea where you put stuff!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s able to pack full size shampoo, conditioner, toothpaste, face cleanser, hand lotion, sunscreen, electric tooth brush, moisturizer . well I think you get the idea. The bag is very well made and looks like it can stand up to years of abuse.</li>
            <li> The product was good quality and a good price.  However wasn&#x27;t quite big enough for what I needed it for.</li>
            <li> One of the zippers broke immediately and another zipper looks like it will break as well.  It was not as big as I had anticipated.</li>
            <li> Had it for one week now. I loved it. It&#x27;s portable but spacious, just the right size for me. Several pockets keeps things organize with a spacious central compartment. You can put regular sized toiletry in it, shampoo, conditionals, deodorizer, shaving gel, facial creams, sunscreens, and of course toothpaste and tooth brush, etc. The four side pockets provide easier access to items you use often. You can put cellphone and portable batteries on one side, while keys and hand sanitize on the other. It&#x27;s not only a toiletry bag, it can also be used as a lunch bag, too. You can take it to your picnic or camping trip. I also use it to carry toiletry to the swimming pool. It&#x27;s a handy bag to have, either on a day trip or a week long vacation. No more fumbling around. &amp;#34;All things been considered&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time. I initially searched for large toiletry bags and found this item. It turned out to be smaller than what I had originally so it didn&#x27;t meet my expectation. It seems like a nice bag but it&#x27;s small and didn&#x27;t fit a few items that I wanted to. It was hard to zip up the zippers but I managed to bare with it. This bag should not be placed in the search for large toiletry bags because it&#x27;s small.  So I used this bag for my trip.  The zipper broke on the 1st day I used it.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Got it for my husband being that he goes outa town every week and he says it&#x27;s perfect for all his toiletrie needs, he has more room for extra things.</li>
            <li> Able to combine 3 bags into one with bag being good quality and nice looking. would recommend to anyone living out of  a suitcase like myself.</li>
            <li> Compact but with a good amount of room for all of my bottles and creams, etc. Variety of pocket sizes. Packs nicely, takes up less room than my old bag.. The  zipper on the plastic &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; pouch broke on my first trip but it wasn&#x27;t that much of an inconvenience. I bought a second (different) version and I&#x27;m pleased with both of them.</li>
            <li> Great bag with Lots of room and many compartments.</li>
            <li> It was much smaller than I anticipated! The product is not as heavy material that I wished it to be either. Right now it&#x27;s just sitting in my cabinet. I&#x27;m not sure what to do with it.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product, competitive price and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with product. Zippers are difficult to use and side pockets are difficult. Considering returning item</li>
            <li> This handles all of my needs for a long or short trip. Not too large or too small.</li>
            <li> Item is as described. Everything seems to fit.</li>
            <li> Not as big as it says it&#x27;s going to be barely fits everything you need. Should be larger if it&#x27;s going to say large</li>
            <li> I received this product for testing and review purposes.&lt;br /&gt;This toiletry bag is not only for men but woman can use it too. What I like about this bag is that it&#x27;s compact but yet it has many zippered compartments and a roomy interior middle pocket. The mesh pockets are strong and the mini hanger is not bulky and lays on the mesh pockets. I can&#x27;t wait to use it on our cruise in October. It would fit perfectly in the cruise&#x27;s small bathroom space. This toiletry bag can also be used just for storing makeup and brushes which is great for an aspiring MUA on the road or on a flight. I give the Lyceem bag 5 stars not only is it roomy and compact but it&#x27;s a great design and the material fabric is very sturdy.</li>
            <li> It came with a broken zipper but there was no problem returning it.</li>
            <li> Very nice bag, but as others have experienced, the zippers don&#x27;t hold up. Two days into my trip one of the side pocket zippers gave out. I have it working, marginally. Otherwise a great bag for the purpose.</li>
            <li> OCONUS worker bought product for a hanging shower bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a touch disappointed by the product when I received it because I couldn&#x27;t fit any full size shampoo/conditioner or body wash bottles in this case. That being said it wasn&#x27;t a deal breaker. I bought some smaller 4oz travel bottles which I would just have to refill occasionally. Started it&#x27;s use and by mid-May and by July the hanging hook strap has already seemed to come unsown from the main compartment which defeats the entire purpose of purchasing the hanging toiletry bag. The zippers seem to constantly jump off their alignment which makes wrestling with this bag even more annoying. All in all it&#x27;s a cheap product which may or may not last you more than a month and a half. Move on to another product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who travels a lot and needed a hanging hygiene bag. The metal hook ripped off the minute it was hung up and the bag was empty (no extra weight).</li>
            <li> perfect bag!  I was amazed to see how much can fit in this bag!  The side pockets are very useful.  I liked the fact that you cold hang it or put it on a counter/shelf.  it looks very strong.  Time will tell</li>
            <li> Great bag! Unlike the toiletry bags I have had in the past, where everything was piled into one compartment, this one makes it easy to organize everything into the separate compartments. I love the way I can hang it up with the hook.</li>
            <li> Perfect size. Many compartments to fit just about everything. Sturdy material that easily wipes clean. Great way to organize travel needs.</li>
            <li> Would leave no stars if I could. Zippers are weak and go off track.  Picture looks great. Actually quality of product is bad.</li>
