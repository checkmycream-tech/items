            <li>Good bargain.</li>
            <li>As the brand is known they make good bladed.  </li>
            <li>These seem to be good quality.</li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>Good blade and good price.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>These blades seem to work well for me and they are at a good price.</li>
            <li>A verry good buy.</li>
            <li>This time I received them they were out of the original packaging and don&#x27;t seem to be the best quality.</li>
            <li>Item was delivered on time as promised I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I am always impressed with the inventive design and quality of Gillette razors and blades and this is their best so far.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with my order.</li>
            <li>These are the first generation Fusion blades which for me is the best.</li>
            <li>When first using this cartridge I was really impressed.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for the guy that loves a good shave and a great deal!</li>
            <li>Compact, great for travel, close smooth shave.</li>
            <li>This worked amazing and for the price who can complain</li>
            <li>even better then the mach 3 wich I loved.</li>
            <li>It sure does a good job.  </li>
            <li>The razors are nice and they arrived on time just when we needed them.  </li>
            <li>The shave was good, but at these prices and this many blades ....</li>
            <li>She said it was great and super</li>
            <li>the cartridge is very easy to change.</li>
            <li>It was catching the hair and pulling it more and the shave in the end didn&#x27;t feel as close.</li>
            <li>wife liked it better than I did ...</li>
            <li>But if you can afford it, go right ahead, order this amazingly great razor blade.</li>
            <li>It gave a very smooth shave with no nicks.</li>
            <li>What can I say I got facial hair I need to shave and these blades provide an excellent shave.</li>
            <li>But, this is truly an outstanding razor.  </li>
            <li>If you get a \\&quot;good\\&quot; batch, more power to you; but</li>
            <li>just know it&#x27;s a bit of a gamble because many of us have not.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I was chosen to review it for them.</li>
            <li>I have to shave more often that I would like to.</li>
            <li>Love this product and I love getting them on my subscribe and save and shipped to my house</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that I will be getting this many again at one time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these blade, purchased retail for many years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not 100% sure what this coating does</li>
            <li>so just beware that these may not be authentic.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t purchase these, as they are only good for 1 or 2 shaves!!</li>
            <li>but they cost more in the store</li>
            <li>I WOULD LOVE</li>
            <li>This is better than the going to the store.</li>
            <li>Its so substantially better of a shave</li>
            <li>I will not hesitate to purchase more of these from Amazon again.</li>
            <li>You are better off going to woot or schnoops and getting a deal there for the razors.</li>
            <li>every time I discard a blade, thinking that I probably could have eked out one more day, and one more shave out of it.</li>
            <li>They are working just as well as the store bought packs and a better price.</li>
            <li>I love my fusion power.</li>
            <li>, in my book, and I&#x27;ll wager you&#x27;ll love them too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m grateful for the free shave, but if I&#x27;m being honest, I can&#x27;t recommend them.  </li>
            <li>Sure they say Gillette and come in Gillette packaging</li>
            <li>It is a great value blade refilled set for people who need to replace the new blade regularly.&lt;br /&gt;Great purchase!</li>
            <li>I save time and have a better, closer, more comfortable shave every time with these.</li>
            <li>This is a good razor cartridges, in fact I would rate it among the top 5 because you do not cut yourself as much as you do with another razor carridge.</li>
            <li>They work fine &amp; the price is much better than elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>well they are razor blades and they work well, especially for the Fusion razor which is a very good razor....</li>
            <li>It does a great job on facial hair and is very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m cleanly shaven as I write this. :)</li>
            <li>I love it when a blade shaves clean and saves time too.</li>
            <li>Seem fine...</li>
            <li>and they work fine.</li>
            <li>Amazon makes it easy to buy the blades to fit my Fusion Power Razor.</li>
            <li>i used to get about 20 great easy shaves from these-but these (cheaper) ones are cheaper-not the same</li>
            <li>By far the best disposable razor on the market this far.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;- 5 blades makes the process smooth</li>
            <li>The blades provided a smooth, close shave, with fewer passes.</li>
            <li>it for free from Gillette.</li>
            <li>I was elated when I received the Gillette Fusion Power to test for free.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy it</li>
            <li>Tha blades are great,it feels really smooth</li>
            <li>I got the chance to try this Gillette Fusion razor free from Gillette.</li>
            <li>The Price &amp; Service &amp; Quaklity Is Fantastic...</li>
            <li>They come on a regular basis and at a great price.</li>
            <li>This is the genuine article, Gillette cartridges.</li>
            <li>i would definitely recommend this product again, great buy ...</li>
            <li>Gillette Fusion refills were provided to me free to charge as a trial from Gillette.  </li>
            <li>I had a totally smooth shave.</li>
            <li>These are excellent razors, and the low-cost packaging version is much easier to deal with than the standard store packages.</li>
            <li>I got the Gillette Fusion Power razor for free from Bzzagent, it is a great razor that fit perfectly into your hand, the blades last for quite a few shaves and make for a perfectly smooth and close shave.</li>
            <li>First they look authentic, packaging seemed to be fine.</li>
            <li>new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade cuts clean and there is no pulling or tugging (something I&#x27;ve experienced too many times with other razors I&#x27;ve tried).</li>
            <li>the past 5 years,i&#x60;ve been using the Gillette Fusion Power Cartridge,and i&#x60;m getting the best shave since i&#x60;ve</li>
            <li>They could be better for how much $$$$$ you have to spend on them!</li>
            <li>If I were a rich man I would still get these.</li>
            <li>I can get a clean close shave in one pass with these.</li>
            <li>It is nice that you can buy so many cartridges for a razor and reuse that one razor multiple times.</li>
            <li>The Fusion razor blades provide a clean, close shave.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I felt this razor provided a good smooth shave with no irritation.</li>
            <li>That being said, these blades provide a more than adequate professional shave to help trim the edges of my beard and keep my neck smooth!</li>
            <li>But the first few shaves were great!</li>
            <li>But Gillette blades into regular design&#x27;s cartridges are still good.</li>
            <li>It was a clean and quick shave.</li>
            <li>The blades give a good shave but not close enough as I would like.</li>
            <li>but they sure don&#x27;t feel like the real deal.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have the re-sharpening stone, but I can easily get two weeks out of a blade if I lather and use hot water correctly.</li>
            <li>5 blades does the trick awesomely and the little lotion strip thingy works very well and</li>
            <li>I am used to getting many many shaves from my regular proguide fusion razor so to me</li>
            <li>but I am a loyal gillette fan.</li>
            <li>only contra I have is the price of the cartridge, but besides that, I would use it as my regular razor, I think is great!</li>
            <li>Adding more blades does not necessarily give you a better shave, plus these are cheaper.</li>
            <li>The lotion strip runs out about twice as quick as well as the sharpness of the blades.  </li>
            <li>They work great, just like the ones from the store for a lot less $$$.  </li>
            <li>First couple days are good, after that you can definitely tell they&#x27;ve lost their edge.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying from Amazon next time for sure!</li>
            <li>They never fail!</li>
            <li>I got one of these from Gillette, and was pretty excited to use it .</li>
            <li>I normally use an old school safety razor, and that is the best shave you can possibly get.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>the frustration-free packaging was pretty cool.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have as much stubble as say someone twice my age, but my father uses these same blades and his shave is just as good as mine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>One blade lasts me around 2 months, and I shave every day (in rare cases I may skip a day though).</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;m sharing these 8 blades among three people, my share gets me around 6 months worth of shaving.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using them for nearly 2 years and can say that I&#x27;m extremely happy I found something that doesn&#x27;t cause my neck / chin to irritate following a shave.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>As much as I believe that all razor cartridges are good, my preference has been the aforementioned Gillettes.</li>
            <li>Well worth it</li>
            <li>I have been using the Gillette Mach 3 and am pretty loyal to the Gillette brand.</li>
            <li>A good amount of blades, as these do not clog as much as other razors do.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, and the product is original.</li>
            <li>They are several blades that gives a nice cute but you have to keep going over the same area over and over.</li>
            <li>Great shave quality as usual.</li>
            <li>you Gillette Fusion for letting me try this new razor for free via bzz agent.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much .</li>
            <li>was very happy that I did not get any cuts from the new blades, like I have in the past from new razors that I have used.&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette Fusion Power for about a week now, and as a daily shaver, it&#x27;s made shaving quick and easy.</li>
            <li>I have been using them since they first came out.  </li>
            <li>At first, I thought it was just a gimmick because it had 5 blades, as if they were just trying to one up Schick with their 4 bladed razor.  </li>
            <li>Gillette is the best although they are getting too expensive.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t even release many different kinds of gel like they did with mach 3.</li>
            <li>I suggest anyone looking to buy these cartridges to either go to a different brand altogether, or maybe try a store - hopefully the quality will be better than what these ones have become.</li>
            <li>I have found that cleaning the blade with HOT water after each shave lengthens the time between needing a replacement.</li>
            <li>As the other reviewers state, make sure this is what you want!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this same product before with much better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In this case, you get exactly what you pay for...cheap blades.</li>
            <li>Sometimes they go on sale at Amazon and they are much cheaper than in the stores or Costco, so keep your eyes out when they lower the prices and stock up!</li>
            <li>The first thing I want to note is the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll be changing to a more generic brand.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t realize it until after my first shave.</li>
            <li>I do recommend it though if you are willing to pay the price</li>
            <li>Immediately I noticed all the coating wore off on the first shave with these.</li>
            <li>I finished this first shave pretty cut up.</li>
            <li>sure enough I cut myself again</li>
            <li>This is the first time I purchased the Gillette Fusion Power Cartridges through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Already from my first shave I can feel there is a difference between store bought and what amazon has.  </li>
            <li>Also cost difference between Amazon and Store is about same, w/ Amazon being slightly more costly.</li>
            <li>I still get a close shave from the first one</li>
            <li>Each tends to last 2 weeks at most.</li>
            <li>These razor blades are so much better price here than I was buying for at my local store.</li>
            <li>I love these razors as they give me the closest shave with no abrasions or red marks afterwards.</li>
            <li>so figured the extra blades themselves would provide a better shave.</li>
            <li>on the first day anyway.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved these razor blades and been using them for a few years.</li>
            <li>Product is okay but don&#x27;t really see the savings promised versus buying the product from a big box store.</li>
            <li>harry&#x27;s blades (www.harrys.com) are much cheaper, better and last longer</li>
            <li>shave was good --- close enough, no call to 911 for medical attention.  </li>
            <li>blades are costly but your shave time is reduced significantly and as long as you keep a fresh blade, you rarely get cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the fusion razor (mine is the buzzer one - love it) for as long as they have been out.</li>
            <li>The first time you use with, you will feel it gently glide against your skin.</li>
            <li>so well I barely even feel anything and leaves my face baby smooth.</li>
            <li>but these are good their a little cheaper than the pro glide all Gillette blades are high</li>
            <li>overall the razor is good and these cartridges which i got from gillette for free to try out and review are pretty expensive but isn&#x27;t silky smooth skin worth it?</li>
            <li>I decided to try to purchase here at Amazon because of the compelling price difference after buying the Power Fusion at my drugstore ever since Gilette introduced this new product into the market.</li>
            <li>They are pure JUNK.  </li>
            <li>This product is just like from the drug store only it was much cheaper and just as easy to acquire.</li>
            <li>Great close shave with that little extra power glide.</li>
            <li>Store bought razors provides a smooth shave, and the conditioner strip last much longer than one use.  </li>
            <li>The shave with this blade is very close.</li>
            <li>These are the real deal; one might even say a real steal.</li>
            <li>they know you need them and don&#x27;t have much choice....</li>
            <li>&#x27;s the real story:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, please disregard any reviews suggesting you pay twice as much for this product from Target or Walmart.  </li>
            <li>Of course I am not demanding much from the blade.  </li>
            <li>It is alight demand compared with person with a tick beard who uses the blade to shave the whole face.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I really like the flip over straight razor, for lining up my sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge does the job really well.  </li>
            <li>but these feel much nicer than others I have used and don&#x27;t give a raspy feeling while shaving.</li>
            <li>fast delivery</li>
            <li>Gillette,  do we really need 5 blades?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Keep them dry and clean and they will last a good long time.</li>
            <li>Never a complaint about the product!</li>
            <li>Now, I know this isn&#x27;t a magical indicator of some kind, but every other fusion blade I&#x27;ve used from the store has had the blue bar on there for about as long as the razor quality lasts.</li>
            <li>and I was ready, when normally I have to pass it 2 or even 3 times</li>
            <li>Better than spending a half hour</li>
            <li>Hubby loves - even more than previous model.</li>
            <li>I change my blades every five to six months, because I find that is how long they last with daily use at optimum performance.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t feel a single nick or scratch with this blade, it is so smooth and cuts your hairs all the way down for a very clean look.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Absolutely love the 5th blade for tight spots.</li>
            <li>I I highly recommend the Gillette Fusion Power Cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the rest, are well gentle with the face (if new or almost new they are).</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t normally use a regular razor more than a couple times a week with out major irritation, but with this razor and blades (combined with some Gillette sensitive skin shave gel)</li>
            <li>Great blades -.just too expensive.</li>
            <li>The razor blades are expensive and even though i think they are great</li>
            <li>Great razors but too expensive.</li>
            <li>Just like the replacement blade cartridges you would buy in the store, just a couple of dollars cheaper than what I normally buy them for.</li>
            <li>I am also pleased because I get quite a few shaves out of each cartridge and</li>
            <li>I do believe the cartridges are worth using and the price is about the same as all the others.</li>
            <li>my facial grows back pretty quickly and densely but this razor pulls through.</li>
            <li>packaging you get in the department store is designed to be attractive and very hard to open.  </li>
            <li>They arrive in a rather large box, considering the size of the actual product, which seems a bit wasteful, but they&#x27;re the real deal.</li>
            <li>They might not be quite as smooth as Gillette Fusion, and I do miss the power, but now I can afford to always have consistently sharp razors.</li>
            <li>Unmarked box containing eight brand new blades.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see anything new or improved with these blades.</li>
            <li>My thought is maybe these would be the same as buying factory seconds - if Gillette would even sell them and Amazon greedy enough to sell them as genuine.  </li>
            <li>The blades are long lasting, don&#x27;t rust, and are easy to change.</li>
            <li>First off they were colored orange while the ones I get at the drugstore are blue.</li>
            <li>this makes sense because they are THE SAME EXACT PRODUCT.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the exact same product.  </li>
            <li>This product is quite cheaper than others I have used in the past and having an option of how many blades you want to purchase is rather convenient.</li>
            <li>I find fusion last longer than many other razors.</li>
            <li>I had hoped to receive the new green-bar version designed for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Gillette Fusion is the best for shaving but the cartridges can be expensive and but they don&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li>I am not sure why they are more expensive then just paying for a really good electric, reusable, razor.</li>
            <li>,i don&#x27;t know why,,,looks new,, but when i use it, i feel very pain like used several weeks already,dont&#x27;</li>
            <li>blades dont last as long as original</li>
            <li>I thought this was the pro glide version which are better in they last longer between blade changes and a little on smoothness</li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion Power works great but these razors can get expensive, especially if you buy them from the grocery store.</li>
            <li>This is by far the smoothest blades I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Because these razors are so high-priced, they would walk out the door frequently if they weren&#x27;t secured in their package.  </li>
            <li>Since Amazon ships these directly to you after you pay, there is no need for theft-resistant packaging.  </li>
            <li>It combines the luxury of a professional shave with home convenience.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 21 years old</li>
            <li>Most of the places I looked for cartridges seemed to have every brand but Fusion Power; at least when I was looking.</li>
            <li>and I think my old razor may just find its way into the trash.</li>
            <li>As far as the Cartridges go I like them.</li>
            <li>next day: not so much.</li>
            <li>She said it wasn&#x27;t near as close as the day before.</li>
            <li>I am not returning because it was Gillette&#x27;s fail that tricked me and honestly don&#x27;t know if there is really going to be a difference when shaving.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, but I definitely wouldn&#x27;t make it my everyday razor.</li>
            <li>After shaving, rinse with hot water, blow out excess water from the front and dry the blades with a hair dryer from the front...cutting side.</li>
            <li>Amazon razor pulled and snagged my facial hair, and the blue conditioner strip was almost completely done after the first use.  </li>
            <li>Good at first bad after that.  </li>
            <li>same as higher priced blades from big box stores.  </li>
            <li>I have shaved 2 times and the first time my facial hair was very short</li>
            <li>These work well and last a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Based on the above I&#x27;m highly suspicious of these.</li>
            <li>(I hadn&#x27;t shaved 3 or 4 days this time) and my razor blade felt like it was becoming dull while I was shaving with it.</li>
            <li>In fact, these blades are not better then cheap no-name or some store&#x27;s brands.</li>
            <li>There have been a few reviews suggesting that these razors are not genuine because they were \\&quot;repackaged.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others have suggested these don&#x27;t last as long as those great razors from Target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shave isn&#x27;t super smooth, and I got some serious shave bumps compared to my other razor.</li>
            <li>The new version is blue not orange like these...</li>
            <li>Had purchased razors from Amazon before but for some reason, the lastest batch of razors only lasts 3-4 days when they used to last a whole week.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is the real Power Fusion as it is very different than the ones you can buy at the local drugstore.</li>
            <li>The first shave with this was close, but I noticed my shave didn&#x27;t last as long as when I shave with my safety razor.</li>
            <li>and they last a pretty long time before becoming dull enough to replace.</li>
            <li>I used the new extra expensive Gillette Pro Glide Power razors for first time from Amazon as the seller, hassle free packaging.  </li>
            <li>I usually use thi blade to further smooth my face after saving with an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t said anything so far, continuing to give them a chance, but today, I shaved and the blue bar that tells you to replace the razor is gone.</li>
            <li>Got my order on Christmas Eve much quicker than I expected.</li>
            <li>Spend the extra few dollars &amp; find a seller who offers the new blade design, you&#x27;ll be much happier.</li>
            <li>I got the Fusion as a sample when it first came out, and I found it irritated my face much less than the Mach 3.  </li>
            <li>These blades last a long time and I have no negative statements about this product.</li>
            <li>And the blue strip wore completely off during the second shave.  </li>
            <li>The result is a plain white box that is easy to open and can be re-used for shipping or storing small items (an added bonus...as you certainly can&#x27;t re-use the packaging from the store).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You get the exact same product for less price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using an old Gillette razor for a long while now.</li>
            <li>I usually use one a month, so they&#x27;re worth the price to me.</li>
            <li>And even though they are sold at a price that is good comparable to stores locally, razors in general lately have been ridiculously overpriced.</li>
            <li>This blade does not shave as well or last as long as the new blades that are currently being sold in stores.</li>
            <li>After two shaves the blades get dull really quick.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> These seem to be good quality.</li>
            <li> Good luck.</li>
            <li> Good blade and good price.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> These blades seem to work well for me and they are at a good price.</li>
            <li> A verry good buy.</li>
            <li> This time I received them they were out of the original packaging and don&#x27;t seem to be the best quality.</li>
            <li> Item was delivered on time as promised I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I am always impressed with the inventive design and quality of Gillette razors and blades and this is their best so far.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with my order.</li>
            <li> These are the first generation Fusion blades which for me is the best.</li>
            <li> When first using this cartridge I was really impressed.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for the guy that loves a good shave and a great deal!</li>
            <li> Compact, great for travel, close smooth shave.</li>
            <li> This worked amazing and for the price who can complain</li>
            <li> even better then the mach 3 wich I loved.</li>
            <li> It sure does a good job.  </li>
            <li> The razors are nice and they arrived on time just when we needed them.  </li>
            <li> The shave was good, but at these prices and this many blades ....</li>
            <li> She said it was great and super</li>
            <li> the cartridge is very easy to change.</li>
            <li> It was catching the hair and pulling it more and the shave in the end didn&#x27;t feel as close.</li>
            <li> wife liked it better than I did ...</li>
            <li> But if you can afford it, go right ahead, order this amazingly great razor blade.</li>
            <li> It gave a very smooth shave with no nicks.</li>
            <li> What can I say I got facial hair I need to shave and these blades provide an excellent shave.</li>
            <li> But, this is truly an outstanding razor.  </li>
            <li> If you get a \\&quot;good\\&quot; batch, more power to you; but</li>
            <li> just know it&#x27;s a bit of a gamble because many of us have not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I was chosen to review it for them.</li>
            <li> I have to shave more often that I would like to.</li>
            <li> Love this product and I love getting them on my subscribe and save and shipped to my house</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that I will be getting this many again at one time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these blade, purchased retail for many years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not 100% sure what this coating does</li>
            <li> so just beware that these may not be authentic.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t purchase these, as they are only good for 1 or 2 shaves!!</li>
            <li> but they cost more in the store</li>
            <li> I WOULD LOVE</li>
            <li> This is better than the going to the store.</li>
            <li> Its so substantially better of a shave</li>
            <li> I will not hesitate to purchase more of these from Amazon again.</li>
            <li> You are better off going to woot or schnoops and getting a deal there for the razors.</li>
            <li> every time I discard a blade, thinking that I probably could have eked out one more day, and one more shave out of it.</li>
            <li> They are working just as well as the store bought packs and a better price.</li>
            <li> I love my fusion power.</li>
            <li> , in my book, and I&#x27;ll wager you&#x27;ll love them too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m grateful for the free shave, but if I&#x27;m being honest, I can&#x27;t recommend them.  </li>
            <li> Sure they say Gillette and come in Gillette packaging</li>
            <li> It is a great value blade refilled set for people who need to replace the new blade regularly.&lt;br /&gt;Great purchase!</li>
            <li> I save time and have a better, closer, more comfortable shave every time with these.</li>
            <li> This is a good razor cartridges, in fact I would rate it among the top 5 because you do not cut yourself as much as you do with another razor carridge.</li>
            <li> They work fine &amp; the price is much better than elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> well they are razor blades and they work well, especially for the Fusion razor which is a very good razor....</li>
            <li> It does a great job on facial hair and is very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m cleanly shaven as I write this. :)</li>
            <li> I love it when a blade shaves clean and saves time too.</li>
            <li> Seem fine...</li>
            <li> and they work fine.</li>
            <li> Amazon makes it easy to buy the blades to fit my Fusion Power Razor.</li>
            <li> i used to get about 20 great easy shaves from these-but these (cheaper) ones are cheaper-not the same</li>
            <li> By far the best disposable razor on the market this far.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- 5 blades makes the process smooth</li>
            <li> The blades provided a smooth, close shave, with fewer passes.</li>
            <li> it for free from Gillette.</li>
            <li> I was elated when I received the Gillette Fusion Power to test for free.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy it</li>
            <li> Tha blades are great,it feels really smooth</li>
            <li> I got the chance to try this Gillette Fusion razor free from Gillette.</li>
            <li> The Price &amp; Service &amp; Quaklity Is Fantastic...</li>
            <li> They come on a regular basis and at a great price.</li>
            <li> This is the genuine article, Gillette cartridges.</li>
            <li> i would definitely recommend this product again, great buy ...</li>
            <li> Gillette Fusion refills were provided to me free to charge as a trial from Gillette.  </li>
            <li> I had a totally smooth shave.</li>
            <li> These are excellent razors, and the low-cost packaging version is much easier to deal with than the standard store packages.</li>
            <li> I got the Gillette Fusion Power razor for free from Bzzagent, it is a great razor that fit perfectly into your hand, the blades last for quite a few shaves and make for a perfectly smooth and close shave.</li>
            <li> First they look authentic, packaging seemed to be fine.</li>
            <li> new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade cuts clean and there is no pulling or tugging (something I&#x27;ve experienced too many times with other razors I&#x27;ve tried).</li>
            <li> the past 5 years,i&#x60;ve been using the Gillette Fusion Power Cartridge,and i&#x60;m getting the best shave since i&#x60;ve</li>
            <li> They could be better for how much $$$$$ you have to spend on them!</li>
            <li> If I were a rich man I would still get these.</li>
            <li> I can get a clean close shave in one pass with these.</li>
            <li> It is nice that you can buy so many cartridges for a razor and reuse that one razor multiple times.</li>
            <li> The Fusion razor blades provide a clean, close shave.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I felt this razor provided a good smooth shave with no irritation.</li>
            <li> That being said, these blades provide a more than adequate professional shave to help trim the edges of my beard and keep my neck smooth!</li>
            <li> But the first few shaves were great!</li>
            <li> But Gillette blades into regular design&#x27;s cartridges are still good.</li>
            <li> It was a clean and quick shave.</li>
            <li> The blades give a good shave but not close enough as I would like.</li>
            <li> but they sure don&#x27;t feel like the real deal.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the re-sharpening stone, but I can easily get two weeks out of a blade if I lather and use hot water correctly.</li>
            <li> 5 blades does the trick awesomely and the little lotion strip thingy works very well and</li>
            <li> I am used to getting many many shaves from my regular proguide fusion razor so to me</li>
            <li> but I am a loyal gillette fan.</li>
            <li> only contra I have is the price of the cartridge, but besides that, I would use it as my regular razor, I think is great!</li>
            <li> Adding more blades does not necessarily give you a better shave, plus these are cheaper.</li>
            <li> The lotion strip runs out about twice as quick as well as the sharpness of the blades.  </li>
            <li> They work great, just like the ones from the store for a lot less $$$.  </li>
            <li> First couple days are good, after that you can definitely tell they&#x27;ve lost their edge.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying from Amazon next time for sure!</li>
            <li> They never fail!</li>
            <li> I got one of these from Gillette, and was pretty excited to use it .</li>
            <li> I normally use an old school safety razor, and that is the best shave you can possibly get.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> the frustration-free packaging was pretty cool.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have as much stubble as say someone twice my age, but my father uses these same blades and his shave is just as good as mine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> One blade lasts me around 2 months, and I shave every day (in rare cases I may skip a day though).</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m sharing these 8 blades among three people, my share gets me around 6 months worth of shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for nearly 2 years and can say that I&#x27;m extremely happy I found something that doesn&#x27;t cause my neck / chin to irritate following a shave.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> As much as I believe that all razor cartridges are good, my preference has been the aforementioned Gillettes.</li>
            <li> Well worth it</li>
            <li> I have been using the Gillette Mach 3 and am pretty loyal to the Gillette brand.</li>
            <li> A good amount of blades, as these do not clog as much as other razors do.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, and the product is original.</li>
            <li> They are several blades that gives a nice cute but you have to keep going over the same area over and over.</li>
            <li> Great shave quality as usual.</li>
            <li> you Gillette Fusion for letting me try this new razor for free via bzz agent.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much .</li>
            <li> was very happy that I did not get any cuts from the new blades, like I have in the past from new razors that I have used.&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette Fusion Power for about a week now, and as a daily shaver, it&#x27;s made shaving quick and easy.</li>
            <li> I have been using them since they first came out.  </li>
            <li> At first, I thought it was just a gimmick because it had 5 blades, as if they were just trying to one up Schick with their 4 bladed razor.  </li>
            <li> Gillette is the best although they are getting too expensive.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t even release many different kinds of gel like they did with mach 3.</li>
            <li> I suggest anyone looking to buy these cartridges to either go to a different brand altogether, or maybe try a store - hopefully the quality will be better than what these ones have become.</li>
            <li> I have found that cleaning the blade with HOT water after each shave lengthens the time between needing a replacement.</li>
            <li> As the other reviewers state, make sure this is what you want!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this same product before with much better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In this case, you get exactly what you pay for...cheap blades.</li>
            <li> Sometimes they go on sale at Amazon and they are much cheaper than in the stores or Costco, so keep your eyes out when they lower the prices and stock up!</li>
            <li> The first thing I want to note is the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll be changing to a more generic brand.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize it until after my first shave.</li>
            <li> I do recommend it though if you are willing to pay the price</li>
            <li> Immediately I noticed all the coating wore off on the first shave with these.</li>
            <li> I finished this first shave pretty cut up.</li>
            <li> sure enough I cut myself again</li>
            <li> This is the first time I purchased the Gillette Fusion Power Cartridges through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Already from my first shave I can feel there is a difference between store bought and what amazon has.  </li>
            <li> Also cost difference between Amazon and Store is about same, w/ Amazon being slightly more costly.</li>
            <li> I still get a close shave from the first one</li>
            <li> Each tends to last 2 weeks at most.</li>
            <li> These razor blades are so much better price here than I was buying for at my local store.</li>
            <li> I love these razors as they give me the closest shave with no abrasions or red marks afterwards.</li>
            <li> so figured the extra blades themselves would provide a better shave.</li>
            <li> on the first day anyway.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved these razor blades and been using them for a few years.</li>
            <li> Product is okay but don&#x27;t really see the savings promised versus buying the product from a big box store.</li>
            <li> harry&#x27;s blades (www.harrys.com) are much cheaper, better and last longer</li>
            <li> shave was good --- close enough, no call to 911 for medical attention.  </li>
            <li> blades are costly but your shave time is reduced significantly and as long as you keep a fresh blade, you rarely get cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the fusion razor (mine is the buzzer one - love it) for as long as they have been out.</li>
            <li> The first time you use with, you will feel it gently glide against your skin.</li>
            <li> so well I barely even feel anything and leaves my face baby smooth.</li>
            <li> but these are good their a little cheaper than the pro glide all Gillette blades are high</li>
            <li> overall the razor is good and these cartridges which i got from gillette for free to try out and review are pretty expensive but isn&#x27;t silky smooth skin worth it?</li>
            <li> I decided to try to purchase here at Amazon because of the compelling price difference after buying the Power Fusion at my drugstore ever since Gilette introduced this new product into the market.</li>
            <li> They are pure JUNK.  </li>
            <li> This product is just like from the drug store only it was much cheaper and just as easy to acquire.</li>
            <li> Great close shave with that little extra power glide.</li>
            <li> Store bought razors provides a smooth shave, and the conditioner strip last much longer than one use.  </li>
            <li> The shave with this blade is very close.</li>
            <li> These are the real deal; one might even say a real steal.</li>
            <li> they know you need them and don&#x27;t have much choice....</li>
            <li> &#x27;s the real story:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, please disregard any reviews suggesting you pay twice as much for this product from Target or Walmart.  </li>
            <li> Of course I am not demanding much from the blade.  </li>
            <li> It is alight demand compared with person with a tick beard who uses the blade to shave the whole face.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I really like the flip over straight razor, for lining up my sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge does the job really well.  </li>
            <li> but these feel much nicer than others I have used and don&#x27;t give a raspy feeling while shaving.</li>
            <li> fast delivery</li>
            <li> Gillette,  do we really need 5 blades?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Keep them dry and clean and they will last a good long time.</li>
            <li> Never a complaint about the product!</li>
            <li> Now, I know this isn&#x27;t a magical indicator of some kind, but every other fusion blade I&#x27;ve used from the store has had the blue bar on there for about as long as the razor quality lasts.</li>
            <li> and I was ready, when normally I have to pass it 2 or even 3 times</li>
            <li> Better than spending a half hour</li>
            <li> Hubby loves - even more than previous model.</li>
            <li> I change my blades every five to six months, because I find that is how long they last with daily use at optimum performance.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t feel a single nick or scratch with this blade, it is so smooth and cuts your hairs all the way down for a very clean look.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Absolutely love the 5th blade for tight spots.</li>
            <li> I I highly recommend the Gillette Fusion Power Cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the rest, are well gentle with the face (if new or almost new they are).</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t normally use a regular razor more than a couple times a week with out major irritation, but with this razor and blades (combined with some Gillette sensitive skin shave gel)</li>
            <li> Great blades -.just too expensive.</li>
            <li> The razor blades are expensive and even though i think they are great</li>
            <li> Great razors but too expensive.</li>
            <li> Just like the replacement blade cartridges you would buy in the store, just a couple of dollars cheaper than what I normally buy them for.</li>
            <li> I am also pleased because I get quite a few shaves out of each cartridge and</li>
            <li> I do believe the cartridges are worth using and the price is about the same as all the others.</li>
            <li> my facial grows back pretty quickly and densely but this razor pulls through.</li>
            <li> packaging you get in the department store is designed to be attractive and very hard to open.  </li>
            <li> They arrive in a rather large box, considering the size of the actual product, which seems a bit wasteful, but they&#x27;re the real deal.</li>
            <li> They might not be quite as smooth as Gillette Fusion, and I do miss the power, but now I can afford to always have consistently sharp razors.</li>
            <li> Unmarked box containing eight brand new blades.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see anything new or improved with these blades.</li>
            <li> My thought is maybe these would be the same as buying factory seconds - if Gillette would even sell them and Amazon greedy enough to sell them as genuine.  </li>
            <li> The blades are long lasting, don&#x27;t rust, and are easy to change.</li>
            <li> First off they were colored orange while the ones I get at the drugstore are blue.</li>
            <li> this makes sense because they are THE SAME EXACT PRODUCT.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the exact same product.  </li>
            <li> This product is quite cheaper than others I have used in the past and having an option of how many blades you want to purchase is rather convenient.</li>
            <li> I find fusion last longer than many other razors.</li>
            <li> I had hoped to receive the new green-bar version designed for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Gillette Fusion is the best for shaving but the cartridges can be expensive and but they don&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why they are more expensive then just paying for a really good electric, reusable, razor.</li>
            <li> ,i don&#x27;t know why,,,looks new,, but when i use it, i feel very pain like used several weeks already,dont&#x27;</li>
            <li> blades dont last as long as original</li>
            <li> I thought this was the pro glide version which are better in they last longer between blade changes and a little on smoothness</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion Power works great but these razors can get expensive, especially if you buy them from the grocery store.</li>
            <li> This is by far the smoothest blades I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Because these razors are so high-priced, they would walk out the door frequently if they weren&#x27;t secured in their package.  </li>
            <li> Since Amazon ships these directly to you after you pay, there is no need for theft-resistant packaging.  </li>
            <li> It combines the luxury of a professional shave with home convenience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 21 years old</li>
            <li> Most of the places I looked for cartridges seemed to have every brand but Fusion Power; at least when I was looking.</li>
            <li> and I think my old razor may just find its way into the trash.</li>
            <li> As far as the Cartridges go I like them.</li>
            <li> next day: not so much.</li>
            <li> She said it wasn&#x27;t near as close as the day before.</li>
            <li> I am not returning because it was Gillette&#x27;s fail that tricked me and honestly don&#x27;t know if there is really going to be a difference when shaving.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but I definitely wouldn&#x27;t make it my everyday razor.</li>
            <li> After shaving, rinse with hot water, blow out excess water from the front and dry the blades with a hair dryer from the front...cutting side.</li>
            <li> Amazon razor pulled and snagged my facial hair, and the blue conditioner strip was almost completely done after the first use.  </li>
            <li> Good at first bad after that.  </li>
            <li> same as higher priced blades from big box stores.  </li>
            <li> I have shaved 2 times and the first time my facial hair was very short</li>
            <li> These work well and last a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Based on the above I&#x27;m highly suspicious of these.</li>
            <li> (I hadn&#x27;t shaved 3 or 4 days this time) and my razor blade felt like it was becoming dull while I was shaving with it.</li>
            <li> In fact, these blades are not better then cheap no-name or some store&#x27;s brands.</li>
            <li> There have been a few reviews suggesting that these razors are not genuine because they were \\&quot;repackaged.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others have suggested these don&#x27;t last as long as those great razors from Target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shave isn&#x27;t super smooth, and I got some serious shave bumps compared to my other razor.</li>
            <li> The new version is blue not orange like these...</li>
            <li> Had purchased razors from Amazon before but for some reason, the lastest batch of razors only lasts 3-4 days when they used to last a whole week.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is the real Power Fusion as it is very different than the ones you can buy at the local drugstore.</li>
            <li> The first shave with this was close, but I noticed my shave didn&#x27;t last as long as when I shave with my safety razor.</li>
            <li> and they last a pretty long time before becoming dull enough to replace.</li>
            <li> I used the new extra expensive Gillette Pro Glide Power razors for first time from Amazon as the seller, hassle free packaging.  </li>
            <li> I usually use thi blade to further smooth my face after saving with an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t said anything so far, continuing to give them a chance, but today, I shaved and the blue bar that tells you to replace the razor is gone.</li>
            <li> Got my order on Christmas Eve much quicker than I expected.</li>
            <li> Spend the extra few dollars &amp; find a seller who offers the new blade design, you&#x27;ll be much happier.</li>
            <li> I got the Fusion as a sample when it first came out, and I found it irritated my face much less than the Mach 3.  </li>
            <li> These blades last a long time and I have no negative statements about this product.</li>
            <li> And the blue strip wore completely off during the second shave.  </li>
            <li> The result is a plain white box that is easy to open and can be re-used for shipping or storing small items (an added bonus...as you certainly can&#x27;t re-use the packaging from the store).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You get the exact same product for less price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an old Gillette razor for a long while now.</li>
            <li> I usually use one a month, so they&#x27;re worth the price to me.</li>
            <li> And even though they are sold at a price that is good comparable to stores locally, razors in general lately have been ridiculously overpriced.</li>
            <li> This blade does not shave as well or last as long as the new blades that are currently being sold in stores.</li>
            <li> After two shaves the blades get dull really quick.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These blades are about 20% cheaper on Amazon.com than they are in any other store near me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lotion Strip is pretty meaningless, it does not last very long&lt;</li>
            <li> Standard pricing on these, but they last a really long time.</li>
            <li> They also last me a long time since I only shave once a day.</li>
            <li> For the price tag:  They didn&#x27;t last long enough, the shave wasn&#x27;t close enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found that this razor had a smooth glide and only caught and pulled a few times, much less often that other razors through three days of manly gruff.</li>
            <li> Single blade on the top of the cartridge is useless in my opinion.</li>
            <li> They would last a LONG time, up to 6-12 shaves depending on frequency and amount needed to be shaved.</li>
            <li> I once used a blade for an entire year, just to see how long they hold up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got thick, stubborn hairs on my next that lay sideways and reverse direction in certain spots.  </li>
            <li> it is very long lasting adn i dont have to change out the cartrigedges that often.</li>
            <li> I knick myself just about every third shave with a single cartridge.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- Severely less tug and pull during the first few uses of each blade</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed with these, and should have paid more attention to the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;The box does come with a picture from the Fusion Power cartridges, but these not look nothing like the real deal, they also have a totally different comfort stripe, and last a few days at best.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> No complaints from me, and i&#x27;ll continue to buy these for a long time.</li>
            <li> I can usually get through about 3 weeks before needing a new blade.</li>
            <li> I usually become very dedicated to a single product and will use it for years until someone makes me try something different, so I was a little uneasy trying something</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too small and not sharp enough to do anything</li>
            <li> They do the trick and I have purchased these multiple times due to their quality.</li>
            <li> However by my 2nd shave my facial hair was a little bit longer</li>
            <li> These can be a little cheaper at some places, but the price seemed to be the same as or lower than the local stores.</li>
            <li> Shaving every other day and one will last two weeks.</li>
            <li> Only one detail: both the razor itself, as the gel stick should last a little longer.</li>
            <li> They are a different color than other blades that seems to also be a cheaper plastic.  </li>
            <li> My advice is to stay away from buying these - bite the bullet and pay a few extra bucks from your local retailer.  </li>
            <li> I used the single blade to trim my sideburns.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use a single blade razor anymore.  </li>
            <li> The first blade was dull after a few uses.</li>
            <li> Yes, these are fairly expensive compared to some other razors, even from Gillette, but they are worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> Whereas before I could get at least a month&#x27;s use out of one cartridge, the last two packages I bought had cartridges that barely lasted a week, MAYBE two weeks if I ignored how rough the shave was getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I notice pretty quickly when these get dull, and the razors from Gillette through Amazon take just as long to dull as do the razors from Gillette through the grocery store...</li>
            <li> (I had shaved 2 days prior) and there was no issues minus a little razor burn.</li>
            <li> He claims with the vibration, if he moves slowly, he only needs to go over each spot once for a completely clean shave - no more needless abuse on his skin.  </li>
            <li> These last on average 2-3 shaves before they start becoming painful.</li>
            <li> Spend the extra few bucks and buy from your local store to save yourself the trouble.</li>
            <li> Of course, just be careful when using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate the regular Fusion cartridge, but I am paying more for Power and not getting them as advertised.</li>
            <li> last at least 4-5 shaves before they start wearing down - the first one I used didn&#x27;t even last one shave before irritating my skin.  </li>
            <li> Fusion blades are relatively expensive; but, they last much longer than other blades.  </li>
            <li> These are very dull and can not provide one decent shave.</li>
            <li> You will receive a plain white box with two cartridges inside.</li>
            <li> I have seen that about half praise these razors, and half find them unsatisfactory, so I felt I had to throw in my vote as well in order to possibly help someone making this purchase.</li>
            <li> Too bad, it would have been an awesome deal if they were the same quality :(</li>
            <li> Buying new blades for your razor is never a pleasant experience.</li>
            <li> and I could not imagine using any other razor.  </li>
            <li> these are not &amp;#34;fakes&amp;#34; as some seem to be in other listings.</li>
            <li> There is other options that are cheaper</li>
            <li> Extremely pissed off.</li>
            <li> usually a blade will last 3 to 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> I am going to call P&amp;G per some of the comments on other reviews.</li>
            <li> and I usually shave in the shower with water only and no shave cream or gel.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, I&#x27;m just not willing to pay anymore.</li>
            <li> I would never use any other type of blade.</li>
            <li> Some deals you can get the razor itself for next to nothing, but the blades are a bit expensive to replace, but last resonably long, so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if half of the people on here are unlucky with what they got, or what, but I definitely fall under the \\&quot;unlucky\\&quot; category.</li>
            <li> Purchased from Amazon directly (not a third party seller) but was super disappointed when using these.</li>
            <li> far as longevity, I&#x27;m probably about as tough of a test case as you can imagine.  </li>
            <li> I have a hard beard to cut and can only use razors not electric ones.</li>
            <li> This stupid company somehow ended mach 3 and now most stores don&#x27;t sell anymore.  </li>
            <li> But the Amazon Frustration-Free packaging makes it a whole lot easier to get into them, no scissors or broken fingernails required!</li>
            <li> I found this strange as usually it lasts 3 to 4 shaves.</li>
            <li> Not worth returning as the blades will get used.</li>
            <li> Recently I became an amazon fanatic, buying almost everything from them</li>
            <li> Why and when did we become such suckers in America?</li>
            <li> I have far less issues irritating my skin and don&#x27;t have to resort to an electric razor as often.</li>
            <li> The price went up, and the quality went way, way down.</li>
            <li> put down the effort to get that premium shave.</li>
            <li> purchase was money down the drain.</li>
            <li> Look Sharp!</li>
            <li> Feel Sharp!</li>
            <li> Be Sharp!</li>
            <li> I had been previously using disposable ones, and the difference is night and day.</li>
            <li> I tried going back to less expensive and had to spend the extra for these.  </li>
            <li> They may seem a bit expensive, but they last and last.</li>
            <li> but i think they are expensive, gillette must do something  with the orice because i live the close it gets when i shave</li>
            <li> These little battery operated razors shave like an electric, but you don&#x27;t have to worry about dropping it and busting it in the shower and blowing a bunch of money.</li>
            <li> Either way, they are not the same quality as the ones I usually buy...  STAY AWAY!!</li>
            <li> And, if you will still be shaving in a few months, do yourself a favor an subscribe for additional savings.</li>
            <li> but for one to use everyday, I am still hooked on my safety razor.</li>
            <li> Work well with few cuts</li>
            <li> But the item itself is different and work a lot worse than the product in the picture (the Proglide).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not really sharp from the start, in few days they becames useless.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if these blades are fake, but they doesn&#x27;t cost even half regular price.</li>
            <li> Not sure how Amazon is letting this one slide, seems there is a few reviews on this topic.</li>
            <li> After just a few uses to me the blades begun to dull.</li>
            <li> It has been a reliable indicator in the past.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Then, within the past year, something changed.</li>
            <li> I have ordered these razors in the past and have no reason to complain.</li>
            <li> These blades aren&#x27;t as expensive on amazon as they are in local stores.</li>
            <li> These were for my dad who is elderly and usually ends up with lots of razor nicks.  </li>
            <li> It seems a bit pointless otherwise.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I just didn&#x27;t read carefully enough.</li>
            <li> Same as the expensive packs without all the hoopla.</li>
            <li> i jump on it and save them for a stocking stuffer, small gift, etc for my husband.  </li>
            <li> No more guilt</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is the razor or the blades</li>
            <li> The cartridges I usually buy</li>
            <li> these are certainly not the same blades i got with my Gillette Fusion-after just a few shaves they become painful and need to be replaced-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very annoyed with these razors and finally had to say something.</li>
            <li> I hardly write reviews - but something needs to be said about these cartridges.  </li>
            <li> The blade was completely dull.  </li>
            <li> despite all of the negative reviews, I bought these.</li>
            <li> I had a close shave, no catching of the blade</li>
            <li> that being said, can&#x27;t justify a 5 because i still don&#x27;t understand why razor&#x27;s are so ridiculously expensive...  has never made sense other than for those that shave...</li>
            <li> So just under 4 dollars a blade that begun to feel dull after a few shaves to me is a bit on the expensive side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and i only get about 5 before they get painful.</li>
            <li> When a razor is too worn, it is a painful experience and leads to immense amounts of irritation.  </li>
            <li> Merely replacements for my usual brand.</li>
            <li> This is the worse razor I ever purchased in my life.</li>
            <li> This was something I was not happy with.</li>
            <li> Horrible for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I was proven wrong when they released the Fusion line of razors.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Blades are always expensive...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Considering that these things are obscenely expensive and the quality has deteriorated</li>
            <li> They are expensive and your struggle with justifying the cost each time.</li>
            <li> why so expensive</li>
            <li> Sadly.  </li>
            <li> buy,,this is fake,,</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t face any problems with it except it is expensive for a RAZOR.</li>
            <li> Another thing to consider is the cartridges are EXPENSIVE.</li>
            <li> Too expensive, though.</li>
            <li> Razors are so expensive nowadays whenever i find a deal on amazon</li>
            <li> soooo freakin expensive</li>
            <li> I find these difficult to get in the store, they are either locked in a cabinet or sold out.</li>
            <li> I felt it was a bit awkward to use, but probably because I was not use to holding my razor that way.</li>
            <li> Very expensive.</li>
            <li> For a razor to use if you&#x27;re in a hurry in the morning, this isn&#x27;t bad...</li>
            <li> It was painful because the razors would get stuck midway during a stroke.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed with the quality of these blades.</li>
            <li> I hate blister packaging and all of that wasteful junk that goes with it.</li>
            <li> The price they charge in the store is outrageous.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> What can I say I got facial hair I need to shave and these blades provide an excellent shave. end of discussion...lol</li>
            <li> Item was delivered on time as promised I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> If you want to save money then buy it from amazon. The same thing at Target was $37.98 You get the exact same product for less price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved these razor blades and been using them for a few years. But the Amazon Frustration-Free packaging makes it a whole lot easier to get into them, no scissors or broken fingernails required! I&#x27;ll be buying from Amazon next time for sure!</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion line of razors is the best line of razors I have ever used.  I have been using them since they first came out.  i started shaving with a Gillette Sensor, then I moved on to the Sensor Excel.  When the Mach 3 came out, I thought to myself, this is the best razor ever.  I was proven wrong when they released the Fusion line of razors.  At first, I thought it was just a gimmick because it had 5 blades, as if they were just trying to one up Schick with their 4 bladed razor.  But, this is truly an outstanding razor.  I shave my face and my head 5-6 times a week and I could not imagine using any other razor.  Yes, these are fairly expensive compared to some other razors, even from Gillette, but they are worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> Comparing to regular Gillette blades, these ones are very low quality, obviously. You will receive a plain white box with two cartridges inside. In fact, these blades are not better then cheap no-name or some store&#x27;s brands. Not really sharp from the start, in few days they becames useless. Some blades has the burrs therefore scratches and blood are inevitable. I don&#x27;t know if these blades are fake, but they doesn&#x27;t cost even half regular price. But Gillette blades into regular design&#x27;s cartridges are still good.</li>
            <li> Had purchased razors from Amazon before but for some reason, the lastest batch of razors only lasts 3-4 days when they used to last a whole week. So I&#x27;m cancelling my subscription for these razors. Too bad, it would have been an awesome deal if they were the same quality :(</li>
            <li> these are certainly not the same blades i got with my Gillette Fusion-after just a few shaves they become painful and need to be replaced-i used to get about 20 great easy shaves from these-but these (cheaper) ones are cheaper-not the same and i only get about 5 before they get painful.</li>
            <li> Gillette is the best although they are getting too expensive.</li>
            <li> Product is okay but don&#x27;t really see the savings promised versus buying the product from a big box store.</li>
            <li> By far the best disposable razor on the market this far.  Costly but one cartridge can be used several times so it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> This stupid company somehow ended mach 3 and now most stores don&#x27;t sell anymore.  Now comes Gilette fusion which isn&#x27;t even close to its predecessor.  They don&#x27;t even release many different kinds of gel like they did with mach 3.</li>
            <li> Great Razor&lt;br /&gt;Blades are always expensive...but online is a savings over local.&lt;br /&gt;Another star if they were a bit cheaper.</li>
            <li> I&#x60;ve been shaving for over 50 years,and i&#x60;ve tried every shaving product on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the past 5 years,i&#x60;ve been using the Gillette Fusion Power Cartridge,and i&#x60;m getting the best shave since i&#x60;ve been shaving.I I highly recommend the Gillette Fusion Power Cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alan H.Myers,Wheeling,IL.</li>
            <li> Saved $7,00 which equates into about 26.5%&lt;br /&gt;I can get about 14 close shaves from each blade. twenty two cents a shave</li>
            <li> What a great invention! These little battery operated razors shave like an electric, but you don&#x27;t have to worry about dropping it and busting it in the shower and blowing a bunch of money. Some deals you can get the razor itself for next to nothing, but the blades are a bit expensive to replace, but last resonably long, so.., I guess they always get you somehow. Compact, great for travel, close smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I have seen that about half praise these razors, and half find them unsatisfactory, so I felt I had to throw in my vote as well in order to possibly help someone making this purchase. I&#x27;m not sure if half of the people on here are unlucky with what they got, or what, but I definitely fall under the \\&quot;unlucky\\&quot; category. I&#x27;ve been using the fusion razor (mine is the buzzer one - love it) for as long as they have been out. They would last a LONG time, up to 6-12 shaves depending on frequency and amount needed to be shaved. These last on average 2-3 shaves before they start becoming painful. I hadn&#x27;t said anything so far, continuing to give them a chance, but today, I shaved and the blue bar that tells you to replace the razor is gone. One shave, and gone. Now, I know this isn&#x27;t a magical indicator of some kind, but every other fusion blade I&#x27;ve used from the store has had the blue bar on there for about as long as the razor quality lasts. It has been a reliable indicator in the past. One shave! I&#x27;m very annoyed with these razors and finally had to say something. If you get a \\&quot;good\\&quot; batch, more power to you; but just know it&#x27;s a bit of a gamble because many of us have not.</li>
            <li> This is by far the smoothest blades I have ever used. I shave about three times a week. One blade lasts me two weeks or longer. No nicks at all. Look Sharp! Feel Sharp! Be Sharp!</li>
            <li> Great blades -.just too expensive.</li>
            <li> I used to buy these all the time, because they were cheaper on Amazon than in the stores, and I could get them to last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, within the past year, something changed. The price went up, and the quality went way, way down. Whereas before I could get at least a month&#x27;s use out of one cartridge, the last two packages I bought had cartridges that barely lasted a week, MAYBE two weeks if I ignored how rough the shave was getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering that these things are obscenely expensive and the quality has deteriorated, it was a no-brainer for me to switch to a high-quality electric Braun shaver. I suggest anyone looking to buy these cartridges to either go to a different brand altogether, or maybe try a store - hopefully the quality will be better than what these ones have become.</li>
            <li> I have ordered these razors in the past and have no reason to complain. This time I received them they were out of the original packaging and don&#x27;t seem to be the best quality. Spend the extra few bucks and buy from your local store to save yourself the trouble.</li>
            <li> Buying new blades for your razor is never a pleasant experience. They are expensive and your struggle with justifying the cost each time. However, I will say that Amazon has once again come to the rescue with the price of the Gillette Fusion Power blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades are about 20% cheaper on Amazon.com than they are in any other store near me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product, these blades give you a great shave. I can usually get through about 3 weeks before needing a new blade. I have found that cleaning the blade with HOT water after each shave lengthens the time between needing a replacement. The shave with this blade is very close. The first time you use with, you will feel it gently glide against your skin. I have yet to receive a cut with using this blade. Of course, just be careful when using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Amazon has the best price anywhere for these blades&lt;br /&gt;- Severely less tug and pull during the first few uses of each blade&lt;br /&gt;- 5 blades makes the process smooth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Price&lt;br /&gt;- Lotion Strip is pretty meaningless, it does not last very long&lt;br /&gt;- Single blade on the top of the cartridge is useless in my opinion. It&#x27;s too small and not sharp enough to do anything meaningful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/5 Stars...price the only downside but you will not find it cheaper anywhere else. Amazon has the best price for these blades and I have been using them for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never go back to fewer blades</li>
            <li> Great blades for the money.  Fusion blades are relatively expensive; but, they last much longer than other blades.  Received on time and in superb condition.  These are the real deal; one might even say a real steal.</li>
            <li> They work great, just like the ones from the store for a lot less $$$.  Don&#x27;t know what else to say.... they are razor blades!  LOL!</li>
            <li> The box that the product arrived in was labelled Fusion Power but when I opened the box the cartridges looked different from the ones I normally&lt;br /&gt; purchase at my neighborhood drugstore. First off they were colored orange while the ones I get at the drugstore are blue. Secondly on the actual plastic package where the cartridges are embedded the label says Gillette Fusion while the ones I get at my drugstore colored blue says Gilette Fusion Power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary I don&#x27;t think this is the real Power Fusion as it is very different than the ones you can buy at the local drugstore. I decided to try to purchase here at Amazon because of the compelling price difference after buying the Power Fusion at my drugstore ever since Gilette introduced this new product into the market.</li>
            <li> well they are razor blades and they work well, especially for the Fusion razor which is a very good razor.... that being said, can&#x27;t justify a 5 because i still don&#x27;t understand why razor&#x27;s are so ridiculously expensive...  has never made sense other than for those that shave... they know you need them and don&#x27;t have much choice.... still a big question to me though ... why so expensive</li>
            <li> As the other reviewers state, make sure this is what you want!  In the photo it says both Fusion Power AND Fusion ProGlide Power, but it is the former.  These are the orange heads without the \\&quot;microcomb\\&quot; teeth that the blue ones have.  The photo is showing both the correct product AND an advertisement telling you to TRY the ProGlide ones.  I am not returning because it was Gillette&#x27;s fail that tricked me and honestly don&#x27;t know if there is really going to be a difference when shaving.  Either way, great deal, and the frustration-free packaging was pretty cool.</li>
            <li> Purchased from Amazon directly (not a third party seller) but was super disappointed when using these. It was painful because the razors would get stuck midway during a stroke. I&#x27;ve used this same product before with much better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I was in a rush and just used the package they sent. One blade only lasted me about 2 shaves.</li>
            <li> There have been a few reviews suggesting that these razors are not genuine because they were \\&quot;repackaged.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others have suggested these don&#x27;t last as long as those great razors from Target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the real story:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging you get in the department store is designed to be attractive and very hard to open.  Because these razors are so high-priced, they would walk out the door frequently if they weren&#x27;t secured in their package.  Since Amazon ships these directly to you after you pay, there is no need for theft-resistant packaging.  And since you&#x27;ve already bought the item, there is no need for overly attractive packaging either.  The result is a plain white box that is easy to open and can be re-used for shipping or storing small items (an added bonus...as you certainly can&#x27;t re-use the packaging from the store).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as longevity, I&#x27;m probably about as tough of a test case as you can imagine.  I&#x27;ve got thick, stubborn hairs on my next that lay sideways and reverse direction in certain spots.  Every time I shave these razors get a good workout.  When a razor is too worn, it is a painful experience and leads to immense amounts of irritation.  Needless to say, I notice pretty quickly when these get dull, and the razors from Gillette through Amazon take just as long to dull as do the razors from Gillette through the grocery store...this makes sense because they are THE SAME EXACT PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, please disregard any reviews suggesting you pay twice as much for this product from Target or Walmart.  This is the exact same product.  And, if you will still be shaving in a few months, do yourself a favor an subscribe for additional savings.</li>
            <li> Standard pricing on these, but they last a really long time. Best razor I&#x27;ve ever used (and yes, I&#x27;m a girl). I usually use one a month, so they&#x27;re worth the price to me. They never fail!</li>
            <li> These are the best blades I have ever used, even better then the mach 3 wich I loved. I just wish they lasted longer...</li>
            <li> Good blades  but i think they are expensive, gillette must do something  with the orice because i live the close it gets when i shave but my economy it gets affected.</li>
            <li> After two shaves the blades get dull really quick.  Good at first bad after that.  Sadly.  Then it pulls and hurts.</li>
            <li> Gillette Fusion Power Men&#x27;s Razor is a wonderful product.  It combines the luxury of a professional shave with home convenience.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed with the quality of these blades. The first blade was dull after a few uses. Would not recommend to anyone. In this case, you get exactly what you pay for...cheap blades.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t normally use a regular razor more than a couple times a week with out major irritation, but with this razor and blades (combined with some Gillette sensitive skin shave gel) I have far less issues irritating my skin and don&#x27;t have to resort to an electric razor as often.</li>
            <li> BUYER BEWARE.... THIS IS LAST YEARS CARTRIDGE DESIGN. This blade does not shave as well or last as long as the new blades that are currently being sold in stores. Spend the extra few dollars &amp; find a seller who offers the new blade design, you&#x27;ll be much happier. The new version is blue not orange like these...</li>
            <li> same as higher priced blades from big box stores.  these are not &amp;#34;fakes&amp;#34; as some seem to be in other listings.</li>
            <li> close shave is important to me as i am bald and these are the best ones out there</li>
            <li> Need Razors? Look no further than Amazon. I&#x27;ve bought these on multiple occasions on Amazon and these razors are always cheaper to purchase on this end and the product is what you&#x27;d expect if you went to the store. Good bargain.</li>
            <li> These are excellent razors, and the low-cost packaging version is much easier to deal with than the standard store packages.</li>
            <li> As the brand is known they make good bladed.  I usually use thi blade to further smooth my face after saving with an electric shaver.  It sure does a good job.  Of course I am not demanding much from the blade.  It is alight demand compared with person with a tick beard who uses the blade to shave the whole face.</li>
            <li> I got the Fusion as a sample when it first came out, and I found it irritated my face much less than the Mach 3.  I&#x27;ve since made the switch and use the Fusion as my daily razor.  Sometimes they go on sale at Amazon and they are much cheaper than in the stores or Costco, so keep your eyes out when they lower the prices and stock up!</li>
            <li> I have been using the fusion power razor for almost 2 years now. I had been previously using disposable ones, and the difference is night and day. You don&#x27;t feel a single nick or scratch with this blade, it is so smooth and cuts your hairs all the way down for a very clean look. I&#x27;m 21 years old so I don&#x27;t have as much stubble as say someone twice my age, but my father uses these same blades and his shave is just as good as mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price listed on Amazon, it simply cannot be beat anywhere else. If you go to somewhere like walmart, you get four of these for around $20. With Amazon&#x27;s subscribe and save, you can get 8 blades for $23. There is no reason not to get these. One blade lasts me around 2 months, and I shave every day (in rare cases I may skip a day though). Although I&#x27;m sharing these 8 blades among three people, my share gets me around 6 months worth of shaving. No complaints from me, and i&#x27;ll continue to buy these for a long time.</li>
            <li> despite all of the negative reviews, I bought these. I&#x27;d buy again and again.... Great razors. Same as what you would get in the retail stores but a fraction of the cost. They aren&#x27;t knock offs, they are legit and you should buy them.</li>
            <li> harry&#x27;s blades (www.harrys.com) are much cheaper, better and last longer</li>
            <li> I am always impressed with the inventive design and quality of Gillette razors and blades and this is their best so far. It does a great job on facial hair and is very comfortable to use. The blades are long lasting, don&#x27;t rust, and are easy to change. I once used a blade for an entire year, just to see how long they hold up. I change my blades every five to six months, because I find that is how long they last with daily use at optimum performance. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The blades provided a smooth, close shave, with fewer passes. The razor came assemble so I did not have to fuss with adding the cartridge. I really like the flip over straight razor, for lining up my sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;I was very happy that I did not get any cuts from the new blades, like I have in the past from new razors that I have used.&lt;br /&gt;Got it for free from Gillette.</li>
            <li> I am a BzzAgent and received I recieved some coupons for these from Gillette to try them out, #GotADiscount. These blades are awesome! I can get a clean close shave in one pass with these. No need to go over the same spot 3 or 4 times with these because the 5 blades get every last hair! I save time and have a better, closer, more comfortable shave every time with these. Keep them dry and clean and they will last a good long time.</li>
            <li> it feels like used...,i don&#x27;t know why,,,looks new,, but when i use it, i feel very pain like used several weeks already,dont&#x27; buy,,this is fake,,</li>
            <li> What a deal. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever buy blades in a store again.</li>
            <li> Unmarked box containing eight brand new blades. They do the trick and I have purchased these multiple times due to their quality.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product from the brand. it is very long lasting adn i dont have to change out the cartrigedges that often. I will continue to purchase only this brand.</li>
            <li> The first thing I want to note is the price. These blades aren&#x27;t as expensive on amazon as they are in local stores. So this is a plus. But 8 blades for 30 bucks. So just under 4 dollars a blade that begun to feel dull after a few shaves to me is a bit on the expensive side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades I give them 3 starts. I don&#x27;t see anything new or improved with these blades. I have shaved 2 times and the first time my facial hair was very short (I had shaved 2 days prior) and there was no issues minus a little razor burn. I had a close shave, no catching of the blade and it felt like a regular razor. However by my 2nd shave my facial hair was a little bit longer (I hadn&#x27;t shaved 3 or 4 days this time) and my razor blade felt like it was becoming dull while I was shaving with it. It was catching the hair and pulling it more and the shave in the end didn&#x27;t feel as close. I am used to getting many many shaves from my regular proguide fusion razor so to me this was a bit of a disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Gillette Fusion for letting me try this new razor for free via bzz agent.</li>
            <li> I like them but let&#x27;s face it Blades are over priced...&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be changing to a more generic brand.</li>
            <li> These are very dull and can not provide one decent shave. Horrible for sensitive skin and I would never recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great place to get blade refills and at a great price. Most of the places I looked for cartridges seemed to have every brand but Fusion Power; at least when I was looking. Now I have a place I can count on and I receive prompt service. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Just like the replacement blade cartridges you would buy in the store, just a couple of dollars cheaper than what I normally buy them for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an old Gillette razor for a long while now. I was elated when I received the Gillette Fusion Power to test for free. I usually become very dedicated to a single product and will use it for years until someone makes me try something different, so I was a little uneasy trying something new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade cuts clean and there is no pulling or tugging (something I&#x27;ve experienced too many times with other razors I&#x27;ve tried). I didn&#x27;t experience any razor burns or cuts. It was a clean and quick shave. The vibration reverberating to the blade seemed to make for a closer cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette Fusion Power for about a week now, and as a daily shaver, it&#x27;s made shaving quick and easy. I really enjoy it and I think my old razor may just find its way into the trash. It&#x27;s time for a change!</li>
            <li> It is nice that you can buy so many cartridges for a razor and reuse that one razor multiple times. This product is quite cheaper than others I have used in the past and having an option of how many blades you want to purchase is rather convenient.</li>
            <li> I got to try the razor from gillette. I&#x27;m glad I was chosen to review it for them. I would recommend these blades for the gillette fusion power razors. The blades give a good shave but not close enough as I would like. I have to shave more often that I would like to. Also, I think the replacement blades are costly but what isn&#x27;t these days. There is other options that are cheaper but I am a loyal gillette fan. They are several blades that gives a nice cute but you have to keep going over the same area over and over. They could be better for how much $$$$$ you have to spend on them!</li>
            <li> Love this product and I love getting them on my subscribe and save and shipped to my house so I am never out.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using these for years. It seems he has found a razor to stick with. These can be a little cheaper at some places, but the price seemed to be the same as or lower than the local stores. These seem to be good quality. Shaving every other day and one will last two weeks. A good amount of blades, as these do not clog as much as other razors do.</li>
            <li> Sent the fusion razors in Fusoin POWER razor box! Extremely pissed off. Didn&#x27;t realize it until after my first shave.</li>
            <li> overall the razor is good and these cartridges which i got from gillette for free to try out and review are pretty expensive but isn&#x27;t silky smooth skin worth it? 5 blades does the trick awesomely and the little lotion strip thingy works very well and the cartridge is very easy to change. i&#x27;d recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> I got the Gillette Fusion Power razor for free from Bzzagent, it is a great razor that fit perfectly into your hand, the blades last for quite a few shaves and make for a perfectly smooth and close shave. The razor blades are expensive and even though i think they are great i dont think i will purchase them on regular basis because of the price. I do recommend it though if you are willing to pay the price</li>
            <li> As far as the Cartridges go I like them. The problem I have is with the price. Very expensive. The price is about the same as I would pay at my local store. I don&#x27;t think that I will be getting this many again at one time.</li>
            <li> Tha blades are great,it feels really smooth and i didn&#x27;t have to pass it several times to get the result I wanted. Just one pass and I was ready, when normally I have to pass it 2 or even 3 times (disposable).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only contra I have is the price of the cartridge, but besides that, I would use it as my regular razor, I think is great!</li>
            <li> These were for my dad who is elderly and usually ends up with lots of razor nicks.  These are the only blades he can use.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, and the product is original. I haven&#x27;t face any problems with it except it is expensive for a RAZOR.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all in the packaging for me. I hate blister packaging and all of that wasteful junk that goes with it. What you see is what you get. These are the first generation Fusion blades which for me is the best. Adding more blades does not necessarily give you a better shave, plus these are cheaper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these blade, purchased retail for many years. I read the reviews here and finally after signing up for Prime decided to order a package. First they look authentic, packaging seemed to be fine. Here is my experience and it&#x27;s all I can share. Giving it 3 stars but it probably should be 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I only shave once a week, usually a blade will last 3 to 4 weeks. Immediately I noticed all the coating wore off on the first shave with these. I found this strange as usually it lasts 3 to 4 shaves. It was all worn off. I&#x27;m not 100% sure what this coating does but I alway sussed it as a guide in terms of changing blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second I have never cut myself shaving with these retail blades, never. I finished this first shave pretty cut up. I didn&#x27;t write this review until I tried a second shave and sure enough I cut myself again today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the above I&#x27;m highly suspicious of these. I think I&#x27;ll go back to purchasing in retail packaging. I guess you get what you pay for so just beware that these may not be authentic. I am going to call P&amp;G per some of the comments on other reviews. Good luck.</li>
            <li> The Fusion razor blades provide a clean, close shave.  You should probably buy these blades only if you have the Gillette fusion razor.  It seems a bit pointless otherwise.  That being said, these blades provide a more than adequate professional shave to help trim the edges of my beard and keep my neck smooth!</li>
            <li> It is a great value blade refilled set for people who need to replace the new blade regularly.&lt;br /&gt;Great purchase!</li>
            <li> Product was delivered promptly and was as described. Unfortunately, I just didn&#x27;t read carefully enough. I wanted the Fusion PROGLIDE Power Cartridges. Not worth returning as the blades will get used.</li>
            <li> Great shave quality as usual. My husband loves them and accepts nothing but these razors.</li>
            <li> Good blade and good price.</li>
            <li> These cartridges DO NOT last. Bought same product @ Target that shave well. Don&#x27;t purchase these, as they are only good for 1 or 2 shaves!!</li>
            <li> Just started getting these regularly!  Will continue!  Better than spending a half hour finding someone at Walmart to unlock them for you!</li>
            <li> I got the chance to try this Gillette Fusion razor free from Gillette. I have been using the Gillette Mach 3 and am pretty loyal to the Gillette brand. I had a three day beard when I tried this razor and I usually shave in the shower with water only and no shave cream or gel. I found that this razor had a smooth glide and only caught and pulled a few times, much less often that other razors through three days of manly gruff. I used the single blade to trim my sideburns. I felt it was a bit awkward to use, but probably because I was not use to holding my razor that way. Overall, I felt this razor provided a good smooth shave with no irritation.</li>
            <li> Excellent blades used in the power razor.</li>
            <li> I got one of these from Gillette, and was pretty excited to use it . I normally use an old school safety razor, and that is the best shave you can possibly get. The first shave with this was close, but I noticed my shave didn&#x27;t last as long as when I shave with my safety razor. The shave isn&#x27;t super smooth, and I got some serious shave bumps compared to my other razor. For a razor to use if you&#x27;re in a hurry in the morning, this isn&#x27;t bad... but for one to use everyday, I am still hooked on my safety razor. Another thing to consider is the cartridges are EXPENSIVE. It&#x27;s okay, but I definitely wouldn&#x27;t make it my everyday razor. With my safety razor, I can get about 100 blades for about $20-$30. The price comparison doesn&#x27;t even compare.</li>
            <li> Work well with few cuts</li>
            <li> Seem fine...I have always felt that these blades should last longer for the cost but they cost more in the store so this is the best way to get them.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Always comes on time.</li>
            <li> Too expensive, though.</li>
            <li> Great bang for the buck.</li>
            <li> Our family like it . Thank you very much .</li>
            <li> They cut my beard well and they work fine. I have a hard beard to cut and can only use razors not electric ones. These work well and last a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li> blades dont last as long as original</li>
            <li> ...The ONLY Reason I Did Not Give 5 Stars Is That I Do Not Understand The Difference Between \\&quot;Fusion Power\\&quot; &amp; \\&quot;Fusion\\&quot;. It Came With \\&quot;Fusion\\&quot; &amp; I Chose \\&quot;Power\\&quot; Because Mine Is Battery Powered...AND I Cannot Find Out What The Difference Seems To Be...Huh?  Overall The Price &amp; Service &amp; Quaklity Is Fantastic...I WOULD LOVE To Know WHAT The Difference Is Relative To The Products...Thanx!!!...AL.</li>
            <li> Does the business. I&#x27;m cleanly shaven as I write this. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are costly but your shave time is reduced significantly and as long as you keep a fresh blade, you rarely get cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely love the 5th blade for tight spots.</li>
            <li> As described and work well.  A great value.</li>
            <li> The razors are nice and they arrived on time just when we needed them.  This is better than the going to the store.</li>
            <li> Men, a great way to save on Gillette Cartridges. They come on a regular basis and at a great price.</li>
            <li> He doesn&#x27;t go through them a lot but, it seems like when he needs them, is when i have no money to get them. He switched from a different brand to the Gillette and has never looked back! Never a complaint about the product!</li>
            <li> Nothing else compares to shaving with these.  I tried going back to less expensive and had to spend the extra for these.  Its so substantially better of a shave and they last a pretty long time before becoming dull enough to replace.</li>
            <li> Always a great product</li>
            <li> This is the first time I purchased the Gillette Fusion Power Cartridges through Amazon.  They work fine &amp; the price is much better than elsewhere.  I will not hesitate to purchase more of these from Amazon again. I am also pleased because I get quite a few shaves out of each cartridge and the shaves are very good.</li>
            <li> These are the only razors that I&#x27;ve ever used that didn&#x27;t irritate my skin. The Gillette Fusion Power works great but these razors can get expensive, especially if you buy them from the grocery store. I decided to Subscribe to them and receive them monthly at a discounted rate. I&#x27;ve been using them for nearly 2 years and can say that I&#x27;m extremely happy I found something that doesn&#x27;t cause my neck / chin to irritate following a shave.</li>
            <li> It is great, but a bit overprice IMO.  You are better off going to woot or schnoops and getting a deal there for the razors.</li>
            <li> Not sure how Amazon is letting this one slide, seems there is a few reviews on this topic. Ordering this product you are NOT receiving the Power cartridges, which Gillette has come out to say are different than the regular cartridges because they&#x27;re designed to work with the power handle. The differences are a different aloe strip and a different beard comb strip (rubber part at the bottom). I don&#x27;t hate the regular Fusion cartridge, but I am paying more for Power and not getting them as advertised.</li>
            <li> Misleading Photos and package&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item shows a picture of Gillette Fusion Proglide on the web and also in the package I received. But the item itself is different and work a lot worse than the product in the picture (the Proglide).&lt;br /&gt;I will never buy this item again</li>
            <li> Gillette Fusion is the best for shaving but the cartridges can be expensive and but they don&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> Same as the expensive packs without all the hoopla. Highly recommended for the guy that loves a good shave and a great deal!</li>
            <li> Gillette Fusion Series is terrific.  I can&#x27;t use a single blade razor anymore.  The 4-blade razor is awesome and gives a close shave.  Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Razors are so expensive nowadays whenever i find a deal on amazon i jump on it and save them for a stocking stuffer, small gift, etc for my husband.  he hasn&#x27;t had to buy razors in years and he is happy!</li>
            <li> Good product. delivered as promised.</li>
            <li> This is the worse razor I ever purchased in my life. It&#x27;s like a disposable razor. I regret that I purchased this low quality product. Please don&#x27;t buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;Krishna, Cypress, USA</li>
            <li> Keep coming back to these for a reason.  They work great!</li>
            <li> This worked amazing and for the price who can complain</li>
            <li> The Fusion Power Blade is the best shave ever. Don&#x27;t stop making it Gillette!!!!  Got my order on Christmas Eve much quicker than I expected. Great customer service.Very satisfied with my order.</li>
            <li> This is the best way to get your replacement blades. You don&#x27;t have to remember to add them to your list. Get them automatically sent to your mail box. Order from Amazon!</li>
            <li> I used the new extra expensive Gillette Pro Glide Power razors for first time from Amazon as the seller, hassle free packaging.  Already from my first shave I can feel there is a difference between store bought and what amazon has.  Amazon razor pulled and snagged my facial hair, and the blue conditioner strip was almost completely done after the first use.  Store bought razors provides a smooth shave, and the conditioner strip last much longer than one use.  Recently I became an amazon fanatic, buying almost everything from them, I am learning that not everything is what you expect.  Also cost difference between Amazon and Store is about same, w/ Amazon being slightly more costly.</li>
            <li> This is the genuine article, Gillette cartridges. They arrive in a rather large box, considering the size of the actual product, which seems a bit wasteful, but they&#x27;re the real deal. And even though they are sold at a price that is good comparable to stores locally, razors in general lately have been ridiculously overpriced. They&#x27;re not made of titanium.</li>
            <li> I had hoped to receive the new green-bar version designed for those with sensitive skin. How might I order this version next time?</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, I&#x27;m just not willing to pay anymore. If I were a rich man I would still get these. Since I am not, what is the point off getting the sharpest and smoothest razor, if I find myself unwilling to change the blade as often as I should? Now I buy Dorco razors (what I believe Shave Club uses) in bulk. They might not be quite as smooth as Gillette Fusion, and I do miss the power, but now I can afford to always have consistently sharp razors. No more guilt every time I discard a blade, thinking that I probably could have eked out one more day, and one more shave out of it. But if you can afford it, go right ahead, order this amazingly great razor blade.</li>
            <li> its my fault I thought this was the pro glide version which are better in they last longer between blade changes and a little on smoothness but these are good their a little cheaper than the pro glide all Gillette blades are high may try the Schick Hydro Hydro 5</li>
            <li> After shaving, rinse with hot water, blow out excess water from the front and dry the blades with a hair dryer from the front...cutting side. This will keep rust from forming on the blades. My comfort strip is shot after about 3-4 shaves. The blades are working great after 3 weeks. I use Nivea lubricating gel shave and it works like the comfort strip is still on the blade.</li>
            <li> Great buy and razor work good.  This is a good razor cartridges, in fact I would rate it among the top 5 because you do not cut yourself as much as you do with another razor carridge.</li>
            <li> I use these way longer than recommended probably before changing, and I shave every day. I still get a close shave from the first one so I haven&#x27;t swapped it out yet. They are working just as well as the store bought packs and a better price.</li>
            <li> I love my fusion power. It shave so well I barely even feel anything and leaves my face baby smooth.</li>
            <li> Great blades delivered to my door. Amazon makes it easy to buy the blades to fit my Fusion Power Razor.</li>
            <li> Shave my face in comfort? Yes!</li>
            <li> Great razors but too expensive.</li>
            <li> the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge does the job really well.  I like that the five blades get you closer than ever.  I love it when a blade shaves clean and saves time too.</li>
            <li> First couple days are good, after that you can definitely tell they&#x27;ve lost their edge.  Each tends to last 2 weeks at most.</li>
            <li> No doubt this is the best razor . put down the effort to get that premium shave. my facial grows back pretty quickly and densely but this razor pulls through.</li>
            <li> soooo freakin expensive</li>
            <li> if this is your brand you just can&#x27;t beat this deal PERIOD!</li>
            <li> My husband continues to order these and they work great!</li>
            <li> they are great but I thought amazon would have lower prices.  take care....all  Doug</li>
            <li> This product is just like from the drug store only it was much cheaper and just as easy to acquire.</li>
            <li> Merely replacements for my usual brand. These blades seem to work well for me and they are at a good price.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000BUUVTY Gillette Fusion Power Replacement Cartridges, 8-Count Package]] As much as I believe that all razor cartridges are good, my preference has been the aforementioned Gillettes. They may seem a bit expensive, but they last and last. Well worth it, in my book, and I&#x27;ll wager you&#x27;ll love them too. Great close shave with that little extra power glide.</li>
            <li> Product was as stated!</li>
            <li> Great razor, signed up for auto ship of the eight count to share with my husband, but needed to move up to the 12 count.</li>
            <li> Best blades out there.</li>
            <li> this is a great product, never got any issues with it.  i would definitely recommend this product again, great buy ...</li>
            <li> These razor blades are so much better price here than I was buying for at my local store. I love these razors as they give me the closest shave with no abrasions or red marks afterwards. They also last me a long time since I only shave once a day.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is the razor or the blades but these feel much nicer than others I have used and don&#x27;t give a raspy feeling while shaving.</li>
            <li> Only one detail: both the razor itself, as the gel stick should last a little longer. For the rest, are well gentle with the face (if new or almost new they are).</li>
            <li> great product and price. fast delivery</li>
            <li> I do believe the cartridges are worth using and the price is about the same as all the others. I am not sure why they are more expensive then just paying for a really good electric, reusable, razor.</li>
            <li> Before receiving this razor from Gillette to review, I had been using a Gillette three blade disposable razor so figured the extra blades themselves would provide a better shave. The cartridge itself is definitely an upgrade over the three blade disposable razor I had been using. It gave a very smooth shave with no nicks. I would keep using the system.</li>
            <li> last for a month!!!!!</li>
            <li> These are the best blades ever. I would never use any other type of blade. I find these difficult to get in the store, they are either locked in a cabinet or sold out. The price they charge in the store is outrageous. These blades last a long time and I have no negative statements about this product. I would buy these again</li>
            <li> Gillette,  do we really need 5 blades?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a time when we only needed one.  Then two.  Then 3.  Now 5.  Stop the madness!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette Fusion refills were provided to me free to charge as a trial from Gillette.  I&#x27;m grateful for the free shave, but if I&#x27;m being honest, I can&#x27;t recommend them.  For the price tag:  They didn&#x27;t last long enough, the shave wasn&#x27;t close enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave was good --- close enough, no call to 911 for medical attention.  The shave was good, but at these prices and this many blades .... it should have been spectacular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife liked it better than I did ... on the first day anyway.  She said it was great and super close.&lt;br /&gt;The next day: not so much. She said it wasn&#x27;t near as close as the day before.</li>
            <li> I get an excellent shave using gillette fusion power men razer blades. A verry good buy.</li>
            <li> Amazon use to offer good prices! Not the case with these over priced razor blades!  Why and when did we become such suckers in America? Seems to me it started about the time Obama took office.</li>
            <li> Best deal on razors I can find! I find fusion last longer than many other razors. I can go 2 weeks with these and with all others I can only go 1 week before replacing.</li>
            <li> When first using this cartridge I was really impressed. I had a totally smooth shave. After just a few uses to me the blades begun to dull. This left the feeling of hair being pulled while I shaved. This was something I was not happy with. But the first few shaves were great!</li>
            <li> I use these on my head and face. I don&#x27;t have the re-sharpening stone, but I can easily get two weeks out of a blade if I lather and use hot water correctly.</li>
            <li> I hardly write reviews - but something needs to be said about these cartridges.  They are pure JUNK.  They definitely are not the same as the refills you buy at your local drugstore.  Sure they say Gillette and come in Gillette packaging but they sure don&#x27;t feel like the real deal.  The cartridges I usually buy last at least 4-5 shaves before they start wearing down - the first one I used didn&#x27;t even last one shave before irritating my skin.  The blade was completely dull.  And the blue strip wore completely off during the second shave.  I thought it was a fluke so I tried another one - same results.  My advice is to stay away from buying these - bite the bullet and pay a few extra bucks from your local retailer.  I learned my lesson.  My thought is maybe these would be the same as buying factory seconds - if Gillette would even sell them and Amazon greedy enough to sell them as genuine.  Or maybe they are just outright fakes.  Either way, they are not the same quality as the ones I usually buy...  STAY AWAY!!</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed with these, and should have paid more attention to the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;The box does come with a picture from the Fusion Power cartridges, but these not look nothing like the real deal, they also have a totally different comfort stripe, and last a few days at best.&lt;br /&gt;This purchase was money down the drain.</li>
            <li> Hubby loves - even more than previous model. He claims with the vibration, if he moves slowly, he only needs to go over each spot once for a completely clean shave - no more needless abuse on his skin.  I just might have to steal this razor from him!</li>
            <li> Seem to be cheaper quality than what you buy in the store. They are a different color than other blades that seems to also be a cheaper plastic.  The lotion strip runs out about twice as quick as well as the sharpness of the blades.  I knick myself just about every third shave with a single cartridge.  You get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> Great product and equally great service!</li>
            <li> Very Good razors I have been using all variety of Gillette for over 20 years.</li>
