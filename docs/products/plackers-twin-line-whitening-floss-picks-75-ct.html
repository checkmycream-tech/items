            <li>but they floss great!</li>
            <li>Got what I paid for....a GREAT product!!!</li>
            <li>What I find to be the very best feature is the rounded protected tooth pick.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product great to have in the car and at home.</li>
            <li>Great product and great price.  </li>
            <li>The minty-ness is great</li>
            <li>Great product, use it every day.</li>
            <li>As a prime member and subscribed and saved, this was a great deal.</li>
            <li>These are the best floss i have found to date, very strong.</li>
            <li>Pluckers make it easy and the twinlines are just the best floss products out there.</li>
            <li>I bought this because price/count is good.</li>
            <li>This twin line flosser seems to do a good job.  </li>
            <li>I loved these dental flossers.  </li>
            <li>I find this to be the best of available flossers.</li>
            <li>Once in they clean wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>These Are Nice And Handy !</li>
            <li>Makes Everything Run Better !</li>
            <li>Love Em !</li>
            <li>I love these Placker&#x27;s Twin Line Flossers!</li>
            <li>They worked great, easy to use and did not fall apart like some of the others that I have bought.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like these, I have used crest ones that I loved so much more, the crest ones I like</li>
            <li>As an added bonus, there is a nice fold out pick to get those pesky food particles that are wedged in there.  </li>
            <li>Reliable and cost effective.</li>
            <li>and I came across this whitening kind.</li>
            <li>effective with 2-strings</li>
            <li>I find it very easy to get food particles out from between my teeth with these because it gets hooked in between the two lines.  </li>
            <li>So Easy !</li>
            <li>They are so easy to use and get the job done famously!</li>
            <li>Good product, easy to use, changed my habbit to fross my teeth and keep the dental hygienist happy, 75 pieces in a bag is a bit too much, it will be better to be packed in 50 pieces.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product and I would highly recommend it to any one interested in good dental health and keeping the dentist happy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already ordered more to stock up.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are comfortable, sized nicely and even have a minty taste.</li>
            <li>I ran out and wanted to order more</li>
            <li>Two line cleans much better than one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I feel as if this causes more plaque to be displaced than with 1-string.)&lt;br /&gt;-Can</li>
            <li>Love my flossers.....</li>
            <li>So I figured that Twin Line must be better, however that was not the case.  </li>
            <li>Love the twin line..</li>
            <li>(Well, OK, once.)  </li>
            <li>I always knew I should be flossing more</li>
            <li>I loved them right away.</li>
            <li>They make flossing my teeth easy and they really work great.  </li>
            <li>The twine is strong and the twin lines make sure that no food particles are missed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was hesitant to purchase these because they don&#x27;t follow the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; design for flossers with a single strand, but i&#x27;m very happy i chose to try these out.  </li>
            <li>These picks keep your chompers clean!</li>
            <li>Easy to carry in your pocket or briefcase.</li>
            <li>easy to get between teeth.  </li>
            <li>I have yet to find a stranded flosser that doesn&#x27;t lose its wax easily.</li>
            <li>So Quick !</li>
            <li>These little flossers are just perfect.</li>
            <li>Awesome little picks, not break proof, but they get the job done.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great product and I definitely recommend a purchase if you&#x27;re in the market for flossers</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>These are really strong and I can&#x27;t believe how clean my teeth feel after flossing with these.  </li>
            <li>The line is super strong and never breaks it connection to the plastic body.</li>
            <li>Not sure about whitening, but they are good flossers at a good price</li>
            <li>But these really make flossing so easy and convenient that I&#x27;m flossing a lot more often</li>
            <li>NOW amazon stopped selling it and price was raised to 250% of original price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried multiple flosser brands and these are by far the best out there.</li>
            <li>assured my teeth are clean with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does a great job of getting between the teeth, and it&#x27;s far more convenient and comfortable than regular floss.</li>
            <li>I can just do one quick pick and rest</li>
            <li>I love the 2 strings, as it gets the food out so much better than one, surprisingly enough.</li>
            <li>Plackers uses \\&quot;super tuffloss\\&quot; and claims to be the world&#x27;s strongest floss.  </li>
            <li>you love your teeth and the people you live with, Plackers.  </li>
            <li>He is pretty picky, but these are his absolute favorite.</li>
            <li>The Plackers are strong and really get all the stuck stuff from your teeth.</li>
            <li>I actually floss more because of how easy they are to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didnt want the \\&quot;twin line\\&quot; ones, just the regular kind with one one piece of floss.</li>
            <li>Gross, but effective.  </li>
            <li>These rarely break and the double string seems to clean better.  </li>
            <li>The twin lines trap food particles efficiently, thereby ensuring you&#x27;re left with clean and healthy teeth after each use.</li>
            <li>I feel like these clean better than the regular ones, also, the floss terminations on both sides are well &#x27;finished&#x27;</li>
            <li>These flossers are superior to regular tool flosser, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Size is right.  </li>
            <li>They have two lines of floss, which really gets your teeth clean.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak for how effective the whitening aspect is as my teeth are pretty white already</li>
            <li>home, we leave a pack next to the TV remote, since after dinner, catching a few shows is the perfect time to floss</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t sell anymore, so I tried these, I find them flimsy, compared to the crest ones, and the crest ones I used were angled so they worked better on my back teeth.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon !</li>
            <li>I first used them when I entered a bathroom at a dance while out of town.</li>
            <li>These, to me, are better than regular floss, both in functionality and convenience.</li>
            <li>tried many others and this one works without having to use multiple ones per cleaning.</li>
            <li>Easy to control and rarely digs too deep except when it&#x27;s my fault :</li>
            <li>They are great and I always keep a small ziplock bag in purse with some spares!</li>
            <li>and I have really liked how much cleaner my teeth feel after using them, compared to any single line flossers.</li>
            <li>Makes flossing a super quick and easy job without the mess and hassle.</li>
            <li>They easily get in tight spaces with just enough glide,  and most importantly, don&#x27;t they sag halfway through using one.</li>
            <li>I tried the single line flosser and they break easily and end up using 2 - 3 each time, so this is also better price overall</li>
            <li>The twin line flossers work a lot better than the single line.</li>
            <li>And the \\&quot;twin line\\&quot; (i.e. two pieces of floss side by side) really does seem to get out more stuff from between my teeth than a single piece of floss.  </li>
            <li>particular variant (the &amp;#34;twin line&amp;#34;) sounds like a gimmick, and it probably is, but I like it.  </li>
            <li>I really like this brand of the floss pickers.</li>
            <li>I didnt pay much attention when I bought these.</li>
            <li>These are very convenient and durable for immediate flossing.  </li>
            <li>These dental picks do everything I need them to do and it is so much easier than using floss.</li>
            <li>These are the real deal.</li>
            <li>According to him, they really get between the teeth</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li>The floss remains taunt and  one pic can do the whole mouth.</li>
            <li>Very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Measure out some string (too much?  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Egg Cooker Deluxe!&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>Have used this product many times and never had the floss break, or any other flossing mishaps.</li>
            <li>Grabs more stuff between teeth than other floss.</li>
            <li>There are other Plackers products that have grits on the floss and cleans stains better than this one.</li>
            <li>I find the double lines clean quite well between the teeth.  </li>
            <li>and I got a new house!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item</li>
            <li>so I love these little guys for the car and at work.</li>
            <li>At less than &amp;#60;$3 for a month&#x27;s supply, these flossers are worth much more than their minor cost.</li>
            <li>Also, the plastic is strong enough so they won&#x27;t bend when trying to reach the molars on the back.</li>
            <li>They also leave a subtle minty taste in your mouth as well, which is nice.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty big difference in my opinion.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re fine to have a few in your purse for when you eat out and have a pesky bit of food stuck in your teeth</li>
            <li>That may be true... but having two \\&quot;super tuffloss lines\\&quot; in one tooth pick hurts my gums and it&#x27;s harder to get in and out of tight spaces.</li>
            <li>The plastic is body solid and won&#x27;t bend much</li>
            <li>Not only do I only need one to make it through my whole set of chompers, but to date I have had no shredding and no broken lines.  </li>
            <li>(I can&#x27;t find them in stores near me anymore)</li>
            <li>They have two fine strands of floss, rather than the usual one strand.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these at their current prince point</li>
            <li>When I travel, I take 5 of these in my dopkit - smaller than normal floss and disposable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Twin line really made these flosssers much more sturdy while remaining thin enough.</li>
            <li>It takes a very short period of time to floss without the awkwardness of trying to get one&#x27;s whole fist in one&#x27;s mouth to reach back teeth.</li>
            <li>With a single strand, i found that i really had to work the floss around to ensure everything was cleaned.  </li>
            <li>(Though I have heard Plackers started making generic store brands a couple of years ago so that might be less true</li>
            <li>Nice Thin Tooth Pick !</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and hard enough to use all of your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Simple to use and no mess, or overuse of product</li>
            <li>My dentist says I need to floss at least once a day to clean off the tarter and the Plackers</li>
            <li>/&gt;In general, the Plackers brand is the only one I have found where the floss doesn&#x27;t break.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if these are effective in whitening, it&#x27;s hard to tell on such a small scale.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m starting sound like one of those infomercials where people are like, &amp;#34;Cooking eggs is hard!  </li>

            <li> they don&#x27;t sell anymore, so I tried these, I find them flimsy, compared to the crest ones, and the crest ones I used were angled so they worked better on my back teeth.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon !</li>
            <li> I first used them when I entered a bathroom at a dance while out of town.</li>
            <li> These, to me, are better than regular floss, both in functionality and convenience.</li>
            <li> tried many others and this one works without having to use multiple ones per cleaning.</li>
            <li> Easy to control and rarely digs too deep except when it&#x27;s my fault :</li>
            <li> They are great and I always keep a small ziplock bag in purse with some spares!</li>
            <li> and I have really liked how much cleaner my teeth feel after using them, compared to any single line flossers.</li>
            <li> Makes flossing a super quick and easy job without the mess and hassle.</li>
            <li> They easily get in tight spaces with just enough glide,  and most importantly, don&#x27;t they sag halfway through using one.</li>
            <li> I tried the single line flosser and they break easily and end up using 2 - 3 each time, so this is also better price overall</li>
            <li> The twin line flossers work a lot better than the single line.</li>
            <li> And the \\&quot;twin line\\&quot; (i.e. two pieces of floss side by side) really does seem to get out more stuff from between my teeth than a single piece of floss.  </li>
            <li> particular variant (the &amp;#34;twin line&amp;#34;) sounds like a gimmick, and it probably is, but I like it.  </li>
            <li> I really like this brand of the floss pickers.</li>
            <li> I didnt pay much attention when I bought these.</li>
            <li> These are very convenient and durable for immediate flossing.  </li>
            <li> These dental picks do everything I need them to do and it is so much easier than using floss.</li>
            <li> These are the real deal.</li>
            <li> According to him, they really get between the teeth</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> The floss remains taunt and  one pic can do the whole mouth.</li>
            <li> Very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Measure out some string (too much?  </li>
            <li> Thanks, Egg Cooker Deluxe!&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> Have used this product many times and never had the floss break, or any other flossing mishaps.</li>
            <li> Grabs more stuff between teeth than other floss.</li>
            <li> There are other Plackers products that have grits on the floss and cleans stains better than this one.</li>
            <li> I find the double lines clean quite well between the teeth.  </li>
            <li> and I got a new house!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item</li>
            <li> so I love these little guys for the car and at work.</li>
            <li> At less than &amp;#60;$3 for a month&#x27;s supply, these flossers are worth much more than their minor cost.</li>
            <li> Also, the plastic is strong enough so they won&#x27;t bend when trying to reach the molars on the back.</li>
            <li> They also leave a subtle minty taste in your mouth as well, which is nice.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty big difference in my opinion.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re fine to have a few in your purse for when you eat out and have a pesky bit of food stuck in your teeth</li>
            <li> That may be true... but having two \\&quot;super tuffloss lines\\&quot; in one tooth pick hurts my gums and it&#x27;s harder to get in and out of tight spaces.</li>
            <li> The plastic is body solid and won&#x27;t bend much</li>
            <li> Not only do I only need one to make it through my whole set of chompers, but to date I have had no shredding and no broken lines.  </li>
            <li> (I can&#x27;t find them in stores near me anymore)</li>
            <li> They have two fine strands of floss, rather than the usual one strand.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these at their current prince point</li>
            <li> When I travel, I take 5 of these in my dopkit - smaller than normal floss and disposable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Twin line really made these flosssers much more sturdy while remaining thin enough.</li>
            <li> It takes a very short period of time to floss without the awkwardness of trying to get one&#x27;s whole fist in one&#x27;s mouth to reach back teeth.</li>
            <li> With a single strand, i found that i really had to work the floss around to ensure everything was cleaned.  </li>
            <li> (Though I have heard Plackers started making generic store brands a couple of years ago so that might be less true</li>
            <li> Nice Thin Tooth Pick !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and hard enough to use all of your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Simple to use and no mess, or overuse of product</li>
            <li> My dentist says I need to floss at least once a day to clean off the tarter and the Plackers</li>
            <li> /&gt;In general, the Plackers brand is the only one I have found where the floss doesn&#x27;t break.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if these are effective in whitening, it&#x27;s hard to tell on such a small scale.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting sound like one of those infomercials where people are like, &amp;#34;Cooking eggs is hard!  </li>
            <li> The price is a little high, as there are $2 at my local stores.</li>
            <li> Not sure if they really helps whiten teeth.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve only had a couple instances of the floss breaking/coming loose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve went through four or five different brands and styles and have come up empty until now.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying these as long as they make them.</li>
            <li> These are the only flossers I have found that can survive my tight teeth.</li>
            <li> Once it gets wet, it slips off my fingers.  </li>
            <li> Sick of using regular floss, I&#x27;ve been looking for a flosser that allowed me to clean between my close teeth for a while now.  </li>
            <li> I will never use any other floss or dental picks ever again.  </li>
            <li> Too bad they are not available as Subscribe and Save any more.</li>
            <li> My bottom teeth are very crowded and slightly crooked, which makes getting in between them quite difficult, but these do the trick!</li>
            <li> While they generally got the job done, I would usually break at least two or three picks in a single flossing session.  </li>
            <li> I have a hard time with regular floss.  </li>
            <li> + years ago I&#x27;ve had the pleasure of having straight teeth, but that also that makes them extremely difficult to floss.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tight fitting teeth and hate using floss that wraps around my fingers.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve even noticed a slight improvement in whiteness between teeth.</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re not good for daily flossing.</li>
            <li> NOT COOL AMAZON.</li>
            <li> well if there are tight spaces between the teeth.  </li>
            <li> design of the toothpick section is pretty neat, and prevents you from stabbing your finger when reaching into the bag (having a flosser toothpick under your fingernail is NOT comfortable, i can assure</li>
            <li> They may shred a little bit in some cases but I&#x27;ve never had one of these break in the two years I&#x27;ve been using them.</li>
            <li> I burned down my house!  </li>
            <li> I keep one in my wallet and a few in my car</li>
            <li> I can tell the difference already behind my front teeth where I&#x27;ve always had a plaque buildup no matter how much I brushed or flossed.  </li>
            <li> Food particles get trapped between the two pieces of floss and out they come.  </li>
            <li> I have very tight teeth, and i have zero problems getting this floss inbetween</li>
            <li> The pick is a little thick, but does the job.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t ever use any other flossing product after using these!!!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The flossers I&#x27;ve used in the past all got stuck between my teeth and broke off of the plastic handle.  </li>
            <li> you might be guilty of with regular floss.</li>
            <li> I have been using them a few weeks now and have already noticed a difference!</li>
            <li> I have never enjoyed flossing my teeth</li>
            <li> Because I am too lazy to get out string floss and use it.</li>
            <li> has I still have troubled getting to my back teeth with these.</li>
            <li> Plackers flossers get into very tight spaces between teeth, remove the maximum of food build up and DON&#x27;T TEAR!</li>
            <li> I dont know if its just my teeth but its so hard to get both pieces between my teeth and its so hard to get them out.</li>
            <li> reuse one toothpick for at least 2 weeks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> hence negative stars.</li>
            <li> The convenience to cost ratio for these is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> This is not a good product to go looking for cheaper alternatives.  </li>
            <li> Not too thick and not too thin</li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t have the ends sticking out, which was cutting me some times inside the cheeks when using other brands.  </li>
            <li> A Safer Reset Without Something Too Hard !</li>
            <li> These things are not going to break like some weak flossers.</li>
            <li> Now I floss every day, and I&#x27;m disgusted by the old me who didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> .  Difficult to find on Amazon</li>
            <li> I hate flossing</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These rarely break and the double string seems to clean better.  I also prefer this type of pick because it doesn&#x27;t jam into my hand like the picks that are placed at the end.</li>
            <li> I really like this brand of the floss pickers. I didnt pay much attention when I bought these. I didnt want the \\&quot;twin line\\&quot; ones, just the regular kind with one one piece of floss. I cant stand these ones. I dont know if its just my teeth but its so hard to get both pieces between my teeth and its so hard to get them out.</li>
            <li> Great product and great price.  If you like to floss but don&#x27;t want to stick your fingers in your mouth these are for you. The also have a toothpick on them.  Easy to carry in your pocket or briefcase.</li>
            <li> I hate flossing but it&#x27;s necessary.  Pluckers make it easy and the twinlines are just the best floss products out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the type of person that can&#x27;t stand to have stuff stuck between my teeth so I love these little guys for the car and at work. Makes flossing a super quick and easy job without the mess and hassle.</li>
            <li> These are very convenient and durable for immediate flossing.  I can carry some in my purse and I keep a pack in my drawer at work.</li>
            <li> Everyone needs to floss, but it isn&#x27;t always convenient.  When I travel, I take 5 of these in my dopkit - smaller than normal floss and disposable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At home, we leave a pack next to the TV remote, since after dinner, catching a few shows is the perfect time to floss too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used about 20 of them and none have ever broke.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like these, I have used crest ones that I loved so much more, the crest ones I like they don&#x27;t sell anymore, so I tried these, I find them flimsy, compared to the crest ones, and the crest ones I used were angled so they worked better on my back teeth. but I have a couple bags and will use them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and hard enough to use all of your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Also, It has toothpick that I like.</li>
            <li> Radio legend Robb Spewak wouldn&#x27;t lead you astray.  Got corn? Spinach? Spider&#x27;s legs stuck in your teeth?  These picks keep your chompers clean!</li>
            <li> The convenience to cost ratio for these is ridiculous. I would have thought they the tring would dislodge from the plastic handle, NOPE. I would highly recommend these at their current prince point</li>
            <li> These are the only flossers I have found that can survive my tight teeth. The plastic is body solid and won&#x27;t bend much and I&#x27;ve only had a couple instances of the floss breaking/coming loose.</li>
            <li> These Plackers are the best.  They have two lines of floss, which really gets your teeth clean.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Good product, easy to use, changed my habbit to fross my teeth and keep the dental hygienist happy, 75 pieces in a bag is a bit too much, it will be better to be packed in 50 pieces.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple flosser brands and these are by far the best out there. They don&#x27;t shred and the twin fosters ensure all the plaque is taken care of.</li>
            <li> Sick of using regular floss, I&#x27;ve been looking for a flosser that allowed me to clean between my close teeth for a while now.  I&#x27;ve went through four or five different brands and styles and have come up empty until now.  Since having my braces taken off 10+ years ago I&#x27;ve had the pleasure of having straight teeth, but that also that makes them extremely difficult to floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flossers I&#x27;ve used in the past all got stuck between my teeth and broke off of the plastic handle.  They also shredded as I worked my way through &amp;#34;looser&amp;#34; teeth.  The Plackers Twin Line Flosser has finally solved my problem.  Not only do I only need one to make it through my whole set of chompers, but to date I have had no shredding and no broken lines.  As an added bonus, there is a nice fold out pick to get those pesky food particles that are wedged in there.  They also leave a subtle minty taste in your mouth as well, which is nice.  I&#x27;ve already ordered more to stock up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase, and I&#x27;ll continue my use of these for quite some time.</li>
            <li> I have very tight teeth, and i have zero problems getting this floss inbetween them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to purchase these because they don&#x27;t follow the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; design for flossers with a single strand, but i&#x27;m very happy i chose to try these out.  I find it very easy to get food particles out from between my teeth with these because it gets hooked in between the two lines.  With a single strand, i found that i really had to work the floss around to ensure everything was cleaned.  I can just do one quick pick and rest assured my teeth are clean with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design of the toothpick section is pretty neat, and prevents you from stabbing your finger when reaching into the bag (having a flosser toothpick under your fingernail is NOT comfortable, i can assure you)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product and I definitely recommend a purchase if you&#x27;re in the market for flossers</li>
            <li> If you need dental floss, get this product. Simple to use and no mess, or overuse of product you might be guilty of with regular floss. Reliable and cost effective. Have used this product many times and never had the floss break, or any other flossing mishaps.</li>
            <li> I have tight fitting teeth and hate using floss that wraps around my fingers.  These little flossers are just perfect.</li>
            <li> These are the best floss i have found to date, very strong. I tried the single line flosser and they break easily and end up using 2 - 3 each time, so this is also better price overall</li>
            <li> I will never use any other floss or dental picks ever again.  These dental picks do everything I need them to do and it is so much easier than using floss.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. This is my third purchase. Does a great job of getting between the teeth, and it&#x27;s far more convenient and comfortable than regular floss.</li>
            <li> These things are not going to break like some weak flossers. These are the real deal. They may shred a little bit in some cases but I&#x27;ve never had one of these break in the two years I&#x27;ve been using them.</li>
            <li> These are best floss picks on the market, period.  I&#x27;ve tried Oral B and DenTek brands, among others.  While they generally got the job done, I would usually break at least two or three picks in a single flossing session.  Plackers do not break.  One floss pick cleans all my teeth.  And the \\&quot;twin line\\&quot; (i.e. two pieces of floss side by side) really does seem to get out more stuff from between my teeth than a single piece of floss.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> These flossers are superior to regular tool flosser, highly recommend. The line is super strong and never breaks it connection to the plastic body.</li>
            <li> My husband is a placker/flossing aficionado and has to have tried every brand, every variation. He is pretty picky, but these are his absolute favorite. According to him, they really get between the teeth well and don&#x27;t shred.</li>
            <li> These are the best flossers Ive ever used. Ive had others break on my fillings, or get wedged between my teeth and cause discomfort. These are comfortable, sized nicely and even have a minty taste. The price is a little high, as there are $2 at my local stores.</li>
            <li> Flosses So Quick ! So Easy ! Double Line ! Incase One Brakes ! Nice Thin Tooth Pick ! Not Only For The Chunks ! But For Those Tiny Reset Buttons ! A Safer Reset Without Something Too Hard ! Can Tell By Bent Tip ! So Tiny ! Makes Everything Run Better ! Awesome ! Thanks Amazon ! Keep A Bunch On You ! These Are Nice And Handy ! Love Em !</li>
            <li> I have been using Plackers Twin Line flossers for over a year now and I have really liked how much cleaner my teeth feel after using them, compared to any single line flossers. I ran out and wanted to order more (I can&#x27;t find them in stores near me anymore) and I came across this whitening kind. I have been using them a few weeks now and have already noticed a difference! My bottom teeth are very crowded and slightly crooked, which makes getting in between them quite difficult, but these do the trick! The taste isn&#x27;t the nicest but it&#x27;s not enough to deter me from using these for years to come.</li>
            <li> Excellent product great to have in the car and at home. The Plackers are strong and really get all the stuck stuff from your teeth.</li>
            <li> These are the best flossers I have ever purchased. I first used them when I entered a bathroom at a dance while out of town. I loved them right away. They are so confortable because of the 2 lines. I keep one in my wallet and a few in my car so I can use them all the time. My dentist says I need to floss at least once a day to clean off the tarter and the Plackers keep me doing this.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t ever use any other flossing product after using these!!!  They make flossing my teeth easy and they really work great.  I have never enjoyed flossing my teeth and I think it was because of inferior floss.  It would break and get stuck in between my teeth.  One time I had to go to my dentist to get the floss unstuck.  These are really strong and I can&#x27;t believe how clean my teeth feel after flossing with these.  I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> The twin line flossers work a lot better than the single line. It&#x27;s a pretty big difference in my opinion. These, to me, are better than regular floss, both in functionality and convenience. I keep some in my car, and in my bathroom, and my gums definitely appreciate it.</li>
            <li> Plackers flossers get into very tight spaces between teeth, remove the maximum of food build up and DON&#x27;T TEAR! The twine doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;slide&amp;#34;; it has grip.The twine is strong and the twin lines make sure that no food particles are missed. It takes a very short period of time to floss without the awkwardness of trying to get one&#x27;s whole fist in one&#x27;s mouth to reach back teeth. The minty-ness is great and I&#x27;ve even noticed a slight improvement in whiteness between teeth. This is just a superb product!</li>
            <li> They claim to be fray-resistant but they aren&#x27;t.  After just one or two teeth they&#x27;re falling to bits.  They&#x27;re fine to have a few in your purse for when you eat out and have a pesky bit of food stuck in your teeth but they&#x27;re not good for daily flossing.</li>
            <li> Make flossing a bit easier. Easy to control and rarely digs too deep except when it&#x27;s my fault :/.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth a shot</li>
            <li> Floss picks are great! Because I am too lazy to get out string floss and use it. I can just sit and chomp on one of these instead.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if these are effective in whitening, it&#x27;s hard to tell on such a small scale. However, these are the nicest floss pics I&#x27;ve ever purchased. They have two fine strands of floss, rather than the usual one strand. They easily get in tight spaces with just enough glide,  and most importantly, don&#x27;t they sag halfway through using one. The floss remains taunt and  one pic can do the whole mouth. I&#x27;ll be buying these as long as they make them.</li>
            <li> The twin lines trap food particles efficiently, thereby ensuring you&#x27;re left with clean and healthy teeth after each use. At less than &amp;#60;$3 for a month&#x27;s supply, these flossers are worth much more than their minor cost.</li>
            <li> Twin line really made these flosssers much more sturdy while remaining thin enough. Too bad they are not available as Subscribe and Save any more.</li>
            <li> Doesnt fall apart. Grabs more stuff between teeth than other floss. easy to get between teeth.  I highly recommend this item</li>
            <li> Cleans the muck out from between your teeth with ease and also whitens while you floss or so it says... I can&#x27;t speak for how effective the whitening aspect is as my teeth are pretty white already but they floss great!</li>
            <li> I have yet to find a stranded flosser that doesn&#x27;t lose its wax easily. I love the 2 strings, as it gets the food out so much better than one, surprisingly enough. The pick is a little thick, but does the job.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Easier to use than regular floss. I actually floss more because of how easy they are to use.&lt;br /&gt;- Two line cleans much better than one.&lt;br /&gt;- Size is right.  Not too thick and not too thin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Not sure if they really helps whiten teeth. There are other Plackers products that have grits on the floss and cleans stains better than this one. I use those once in a while because they hurt my gums.  I bought this because price/count is good.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;-Highly effective with 2-strings (I feel as if this causes more plaque to be displaced than with 1-string.)&lt;br /&gt;-Can reuse one toothpick for at least 2 weeks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-None.  Difficult to find on Amazon is my only issue!</li>
            <li> This twin line flosser seems to do a good job.  I have a hard time with regular floss.  Once it gets wet, it slips off my fingers.  The flossers are easier to use.</li>
            <li> Not sure about whitening, but they are good flossers at a good price</li>
            <li> when using product  it was like scratching nails on a chalkboard but only in your mouth!! if thats what yu like this product is for you</li>
            <li> I feel like these clean better than the regular ones, also, the floss terminations on both sides are well &#x27;finished&#x27; so they don&#x27;t have the ends sticking out, which was cutting me some times inside the cheeks when using other brands.  Also, the plastic is strong enough so they won&#x27;t bend when trying to reach the molars on the back.</li>
            <li> Great product, use it every day. tried many others and this one works without having to use multiple ones per cleaning. As a prime member and subscribed and saved, this was a great deal. NOW amazon stopped selling it and price was raised to 250% of original price. NOT COOL AMAZON. hence negative stars.</li>
            <li> Love my flossers..... Got what I paid for....a GREAT product!!!</li>
            <li> I hate string dental floss! I just always have.&lt;br /&gt;But I love these Placker&#x27;s Twin Line Flossers! They are great and I always keep a small ziplock bag in purse with some spares! They are so easy to use and get the job done famously! 5/5</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product and I would highly recommend it to any one interested in good dental health and keeping the dentist happy.</li>
            <li> I tried the Plackers Micro Mint flossers and they seemed to work for me.  So I figured that Twin Line must be better, however that was not the case.  These don&#x27;t seem to work well if there are tight spaces between the teeth.  Plackers uses \\&quot;super tuffloss\\&quot; and claims to be the world&#x27;s strongest floss.  That may be true... but having two \\&quot;super tuffloss lines\\&quot; in one tooth pick hurts my gums and it&#x27;s harder to get in and out of tight spaces.</li>
            <li> Love the twin line..I like that they came 3 in a packet..</li>
            <li> I loved these dental flossers.  They worked great, easy to use and did not fall apart like some of the others that I have bought.  I will buy these again.</li>
            <li> Awesome little picks, not break proof, but they get the job done.</li>
            <li> I can tell the difference already behind my front teeth where I&#x27;ve always had a plaque buildup no matter how much I brushed or flossed.  I hope they come out with an angled version has I still have troubled getting to my back teeth with these.</li>
            <li> I never flossed before Plackers.  Just couldn&#x27;t do it.  Now I floss every day, and I&#x27;m disgusted by the old me who didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, the Plackers brand is the only one I have found where the floss doesn&#x27;t break.  Ever.  (Well, OK, once.)  This is not a good product to go looking for cheaper alternatives.  Tried that once, snapped the floss on four or five in one flossing session.  Threw the package away and went back to Plackers.  (Though I have heard Plackers started making generic store brands a couple of years ago so that might be less true now.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular variant (the &amp;#34;twin line&amp;#34;) sounds like a gimmick, and it probably is, but I like it.  Food particles get trapped between the two pieces of floss and out they come.  Gross, but effective.  Very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you love your teeth and the people you live with, Plackers.  That is all.</li>
            <li> I always knew I should be flossing more but it always seemed like such a chore.  Measure out some string (too much?  not enough?), wrap it around fingers... I&#x27;m starting sound like one of those infomercials where people are like, &amp;#34;Cooking eggs is hard!  I burned down my house!  Now it&#x27;s a breeze and I got a new house!  Thanks, Egg Cooker Deluxe!&amp;#34;  Probably psychological?  But these really make flossing so easy and convenient that I&#x27;m flossing a lot more often and I think that&#x27;s the bottom line.</li>
            <li> I find the double lines clean quite well between the teeth.  I do note some additional resistance sliding between the teeth. Once in they clean wonderfully.  What I find to be the very best feature is the rounded protected tooth pick.  Having it protected this way allows this flosserr to be placed in a pocket, purse or wallet with out the fear of being stabbed by the tooth pick point.  I find this to be the best of available flossers.</li>
