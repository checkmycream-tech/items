            <li>I was very excited to receive my Fash 88 US Palette with no broken colors and with a wonderful array of options for different looks.  </li>
            <li>She found it thoughtful and for a guy who has absolutely no clue about makeup, she said I made a very good choice, so that prompted me to write this review.</li>
            <li>makes you feel like you have found a fantastic bargain and guess what you have.</li>

            <li>Lots of fun colors for any occasion.</li>

            <li>Cheap enough to buy extras :-)</li>

            <li>Will be looking into more of these in the future.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented!</li>
            <li>As a first time buyer from this vender I will not be ordering from them again.</li>
            <li>Came on time and was not broken in the slightest!</li>
            <li>As for shipping I was also pleased it took less than a week for me to get my goodies which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>The picture for me didn&#x27;t give it full credit but just wait till you open your palette and touch some with your finger tip (POW) so bold and shimmery.</li>
            <li>I ordered 3 of them &amp; nothing was broken and the price was really great as well much cheaper then CS</li>
            <li>A++ Fast shipping as well.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t need much on your brush.</li>
            <li>Came in the mail in about 5 days including the weekend, so shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>They are shimmering, but not too much.  </li>
            <li>My 15 year old wanted a large palette.</li>
            <li>and I wish it would have lasted more that a few hours on the eyes</li>
            <li>and so is my 13 year old daughter who is now the one who uses it ( because she growls at me if I try to get close to it )</li>
            <li>the eyeshadow are the same as the coastal scents 88 palette they are very pigmented</li>
            <li>bought for my 13 year old sister and she LOVES them.</li>
            <li>I love the colors even though one was broken.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed with my choice and the price helped seal the deal, coming in at a few dollars less that</li>

            <li> I wear it everyday and the colors stay on from morning to night never a smudge.</li>
            <li> However when I opened up the package today several of the eyeshadows were broken.</li>
            <li> at least I think so.</li>
            <li> someone else who likes makeup, look no more!</li>
            <li> I figure 1 out of 88 isn&#x27;t bad.</li>

            <li> Got the palette for a friend on her birthday. She found it thoughtful and for a guy who has absolutely no clue about makeup, she said I made a very good choice, so that prompted me to write this review. For all the guys who are clueless about buying something for their friend/girlfriend/sister/someone else who likes makeup, look no more! You&#x27;ve found a winner in this product. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention she is verrrrryyyy picky about her makeup and clothes (she&#x27;s works in the fashion industry!)?</li>
            <li> Omg people if you want a truly shimmer eye shadow palette look no farther because this is it. This Palette has more colors than a rainbow and the price makes you feel like you have found a fantastic bargain and guess what you have. The picture for me didn&#x27;t give it full credit but just wait till you open your palette and touch some with your finger tip (POW) so bold and shimmery. As for shipping I was also pleased it took less than a week for me to get my goodies which is a huge plus. Over all I am very happy and so is my 13 year old daughter who is now the one who uses it ( because she growls at me if I try to get close to it ) lol. I&#x27;m 35 so this palette will make many ages happy. Love it, and Love you guys, Adara</li>
            <li> Awesome colors... I had been looking for a eyeshadow palette for years... Never found any thing better than this.. Shipping took a few days... But all in all a great product.. :)</li>
            <li> the eyeshadow are the same as the coastal scents 88 palette they are very pigmented the only problem I had was the sipping took kinda long but it was packaged up really good b/c I ordered 3 of them &amp; nothing was broken and the price was really great as well much cheaper then CS</li>
            <li> I wasnt to sure of buying this product considering there were so many colors for little money but the eye shadow is amazing!! I wear it everyday and the colors stay on from morning to night never a smudge. Such a great product with a great price! Defintely reccommend this makeup!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive my Fash 88 US Palette with no broken colors and with a wonderful array of options for different looks.  The shadows are quite pigmented and lasted all day with no creasing.  I was a bit leery about purchasing, as there are quite a few companies that sell similar products with mixed reviews. I was not disappointed with my choice and the price helped seal the deal, coming in at a few dollars less that the rest.  Shipping was also very quick. Will be looking into more of these in the future.</li>
            <li> bought for my 13 year old sister and she LOVES them. A++ Fast shipping as well. Would definitely purchase again from buyer</li>
            <li> Has lasted a while.  Lots of fun colors for any occasion. Going to look for more product in this brand to try out.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow is not bad, just wish it had more shimmer in it and I wish it would have lasted more that a few hours on the eyes</li>
            <li> Very pigmented! Love all the colors</li>
            <li> The colors are as shown on the pictures. However when I opened up the package today several of the eyeshadows were broken. As a first time buyer from this vender I will not be ordering from them again. I will not be recommending them either. If I&#x27;m paying for shipping and handling I expect to get unbroken merchandise. Either their going to send me another one or I want a refund.</li>
            <li> I ordered this palette after receiving brushes when I ordered a Shany palette. I love the colors even though one was broken. I figure 1 out of 88 isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> I purchased this palette after seeing some videos on YouTube of makeup tutorials. It&#x27;s very well pigmented for the amount of product you get ( small, a dime is slightly larger then each eyeshadow) so you don&#x27;t need much on your brush. They blend fairly well also. My only gripe was that when it came in the mail, a few of the eyeshadows were broken, but I just put as much back in each pot as I could and fixed it with alcohol. Came in the mail in about 5 days including the weekend, so shipping was fast. Great eyeshadow palette overall though, can&#x27;t wait to use some of the brighter colors for my Halloween costume!</li>
            <li> My 15 year old wanted a large palette. This is perfect.  They are shimmering, but not too much.  Lot of fun.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for the money. Not a lot of any one color but a big selection. Cheap enough to buy extras :-)</li>
            <li> Colors are shimmery and bright. Use your finger for application and it will come out at its brightest... at least I think so.</li>
            <li> Happy with my purchase.  Arrived on time and was packaged well.  This is a gift for my grand-daughter and have not given to her yet but sure she will be happy.  A lot of colors to pick from.</li>
            <li> Work awesome!! Very bold colors. I love them :)</li>
            <li> Just got this makeup palette and I&#x27;m in love really pretty colors and well pigmented will be buying more.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for the money it has all the colors I need and is my price range.</li>
            <li> Came on time and was not broken in the slightest! Packed nicely, looks nice and works a treat!</li>
