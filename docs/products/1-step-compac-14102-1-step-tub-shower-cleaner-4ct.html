            <li>I don&#x27;t have to search any more.  </li>
            <li>I love this product because it is one-step: sponge, scrubber brush, &amp; cleanser all in one.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that there is no chemical smells when cleaning.</li>
            <li>Very easy, so I just ordered more and ordered the one step car to see if it&#x27;s as easy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a great little product for a good price.</li>
            <li>I have a fiberglass tub with a smooth finish.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li>And it is a great cleaner too that actually does work!!</li>
            <li>They are gentle enough not to scratch,  but perfect for the cleaning job needed.</li>
            <li>Tried cleaning my tub, which is relatively clean and this product sucked bigtime.</li>
            <li>It comes out really clean.</li>
            <li>and they stayed clean for a longer period of time.  </li>
            <li>It is a pretty good cleaning product for light cleaning, as far as I can see.  </li>
            <li>fast and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>My Soft scrub does much better job.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth ordering online if you can&#x27;t find it in stores.</li>
            <li>and it will clean my whole tub.</li>
            <li>I really like these soap pads to clean the tub with.</li>
            <li>This is a great little product that is perfect for a situation where you just need to get the tub/shower clean, though it seems a bit much for daily cleaning, especially when one considers there are only four pads in a package.  </li>
            <li>so they are fast and economical to use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve ever been able to use without using a face mask and gloves.</li>
            <li>It arrived promptly in 2 days, and I was ready to scrub months worth of grime and dirt away.      </li>
            <li>I guess I expected something more powerful.</li>
            <li>However, there are no harsh chemicals, and the pre-soaping is quite mild</li>
            <li>Some cleaners have such a strong smell, that I get a headache but not these soap pads.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone that wants the ease of cleaning and look of shine!</li>
            <li>A complete success, these cleaners are highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Cleans very well without fumes and burning to face hands, etc.</li>
            <li>My only problem is that I can no longer purchase it in the store where I originally bought it.</li>
            <li>I proceeded to clean my entire bathroom and kitchen counter with just one scrub.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend to anyone who has allergies to chemical cleaners.  </li>
            <li>I love these little pads, they work so well in my shower.</li>
            <li>moved in my new place</li>
            <li>It got my needing to be scrubbed glass,tile, and fiberglass looking new again.  </li>
            <li>I thought I would try this product and to my amazement it looked like I had new doors</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to fumes from cleaning products.  </li>
            <li>My sensitive skin didn&#x27;t show any reactions to the scrubber material or the soap, and there was no offensive scent either.  </li>
            <li>so I wanted to scrub pretty much everything down in my shower.</li>
            <li>and I guess the people before didn&#x27;t clean their mess..</li>
            <li>With little notice, my parents were caming to visit, and I needed to clean my apartment (especially kitchen and bathroom) and fast.  </li>
            <li>so you&#x27;re not left with even more soap scum.  </li>
            <li>After the kitchen and bathroom were finished, the scrub was still completely intact, but I tossed it anyway knowing what a giant battle is had just fought.  </li>
            <li>The only trouble I have is if I don&#x27;t clean it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>But it does the job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a simple idea, little more than your average scrubbing pad that includes soap.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s soap on the scrubber, so no other cleaning products were necessary.  </li>
            <li>I had a heavy duty job on my hands, due to an intense work schedule that left much of my apartment in complete disarray for months.  </li>

            <li> You definitely don&#x27;t want to wet the sponge.</li>
            <li> My bathroom tiles dry and look  like glass after using these pads.</li>
            <li> That is where you will have trouble with the soap not lasting very long.</li>
            <li> I use it a couple times a week in my bathroom sinks....</li>
            <li> It even scrubbed off SOME of a deep water stain (which I knew I would need a stronger heavy duty product for)</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s enough soap to do the scrubbing, and very little rinsing</li>
            <li> just wet down the tub, and scrub away.</li>
            <li> If I just wet down the tub and walls and not the sponge</li>
            <li> That helps a lot to wet down the walls.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The accumulated grime on my tub, which was impossible to fully remove with some other scrubs, came off easily with this little scrubber.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised how well it cleans using only cold water.  </li>
            <li> Because I usually get out of work after stores are closed, I Amazon-Primed the 1 Step Rub &amp; Shower Cleaner to work.  </li>
            <li> This is for heavy duty situations.</li>
            <li> A waste of money and aggravation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything to clean the glass shower doors but they still had water spots because we have very hard water in our area and the other products fumes were terrible.  </li>
            <li> I also use the \\&quot;1 Step Car Cleaner\\&quot; pads and they take all of the hard work out of car washing.</li>
            <li> I have yet to find a product that can cut through the hard water stains like Zep does and still allow me to breath (I like breathing).</li>
            <li> The soap scum doesn&#x27;t come off as well.</li>
            <li> I have well water which is very hard.</li>
            <li> Tackles the worst soap scum, lasts long and no fumes.</li>
            <li> Useless, didn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> It cleans as well as other products I have tried that have terrible fumes.</li>
            <li> This should be removed because it is crap.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> But for those nasty water stains, it just didn&#x27;t work.  </li>

            <li> Useless, didn&#x27;t do anything. Tried cleaning my tub, which is relatively clean and this product sucked bigtime. Doesnt deliver what it promises.</li>
            <li> This is a great little product that is perfect for a situation where you just need to get the tub/shower clean, though it seems a bit much for daily cleaning, especially when one considers there are only four pads in a package.  This is for heavy duty situations. But it does the job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a simple idea, little more than your average scrubbing pad that includes soap.  However, there are no harsh chemicals, and the pre-soaping is quite mild so you&#x27;re not left with even more soap scum.  There&#x27;s enough soap to do the scrubbing, and very little rinsing I had to afterwards.  Really, it&#x27;s the perfect combination of scrubbing and soap without trying to figure it out yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great little product for a good price.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me. I have well water which is very hard. May work better for someone with treated water.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to fumes from cleaning products.  This product is perfect.  It cleans the shower with no fumes.  I had been searching forever for a product I could use that didn&#x27;t make me start coughing and gagging when I cleaned the bathroom.  I don&#x27;t have to search any more.  This product does a Great job cleaning without fumes!</li>
            <li> I love this product because it is one-step: sponge, scrubber brush, &amp; cleanser all in one. However, bottom line - it does the job!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I love the fact that there is no chemical smells when cleaning. Everything is definitely one step. I have a fiberglass tub with a smooth finish.&lt;br /&gt;We get a lot of soap that sticks to out bathtub and soap scum.&lt;br /&gt;I just wet down the tub, and scrub away. You definitely don&#x27;t want to wet the sponge. That is where you will have trouble with the soap not lasting very long. If I just wet down the tub and walls and not the sponge and it will clean my whole tub. It comes out really clean. The only trouble I have is if I don&#x27;t clean it on a regular basis. The soap scum doesn&#x27;t come off as well. I also have a removable shower head that I can take on and off. That helps a lot to wet down the walls.&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t deserve even one star. Very disappointed. Followed the direction but didn&#x27;t work. My Soft scrub does much better job.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this cleaner. Tackles the worst soap scum, lasts long and no fumes. It&#x27;s worth ordering online if you can&#x27;t find it in stores.</li>
            <li> My bathroom tiles dry and look  like glass after using these pads. I highly recommend this product to anyone that wants the ease of cleaning and look of shine!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. Not only does it make cleaning the bathtub/shower an easier chore than ever, you don&#x27;t have to deal with any fumes while doing it!! I used to spray my cleaner and then go running from the bathroom in search of breathe-able air. Not anymore. And it is a great cleaner too that actually does work!! I swear by this product. &lt;br /&gt;I also swear by the same manufacturers similar product - the one step car wash sponge. AWESOME!</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;1 Step Tub and Shower Cleaner\\&quot; works great!  I use it a couple times a week in my bathroom sinks....fast and easy to use.  I also get about three or four uses from each pad so they are fast and economical to use.  I also use the \\&quot;1 Step Car Cleaner\\&quot; pads and they take all of the hard work out of car washing.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Cleans very well without fumes and burning to face hands, etc. I highly recommend to anyone who has allergies to chemical cleaners.  It&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve ever been able to use without using a face mask and gloves. It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I was surprised how well it cleans using only cold water.  It cleans as well as other products I have tried that have terrible fumes.</li>
            <li> This product is basically 2 in. Cleaning product, and &#x27;tool&#x27;. Does actually scrub great!&lt;br /&gt;I moved in my new place and I guess the people before didn&#x27;t clean their mess.. Im a germ freak so I wanted to scrub pretty much everything down in my shower. Got everything out with just one. It even scrubbed off SOME of a deep water stain (which I knew I would need a stronger heavy duty product for)</li>
            <li> I really like these soap pads to clean the tub with. They are gentle enough not to scratch,  but perfect for the cleaning job needed. Some cleaners have such a strong smell, that I get a headache but not these soap pads. That makes them the perfect cleaner for me!</li>
            <li> I had a heavy duty job on my hands, due to an intense work schedule that left much of my apartment in complete disarray for months.

After the kitchen and bathroom were finished, the scrub was still completely intact, but I tossed it anyway knowing what a giant battle is had just fought.  My tub and the rest of the bathroom were restored to its sparkling condition prior to my move-in.      Because each bag comes with 4 scrubs (great deal!), I am well stocked for future cleaning projects.  A complete success, these cleaners are highly recommended!</li>
            <li> One step tub &amp; shower works great.  It got my needing to be scrubbed glass,tile, and fiberglass looking new again.  Even my kids noticed.  Very easy, so I just ordered more and ordered the one step car to see if it&#x27;s as easy.</li>

            <li> I love these little pads, they work so well in my shower. I have always been looking for something that didn&#x27;t take my breath away (not in a good way) . And the Tub&amp;Shower Cleaner has done that, in a good way too!</li>
            <li> Do not buy. A waste of money and aggravation. This should be removed because it is crap. I can&#x27;t believe I fell for the bulls*** it said it would do.</li>
