            <li>I always shake it first to mix it up; as it will settle a bit.</li>
            <li>I looked at several different aloe vera gels, and I found that this one was the best to buy because there are no toxic/unhealthy additives as with the other products.</li>

            <li> Very nice aloe vera gel.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best Aloe Vera gel I have used. I use it on my face as a follow up moisturizer to my facial regimen and I love it. I also use it with my homemade body butter. Aloe has such great qualities. The gel consistency is very good. I always shake it first to mix it up; as it will settle a bit. I&#x27;ll definitely buy this again and again.</li>
            <li> Help to heal my chapped fingers</li>
            <li> Thank you for creating a product that is effective and healthy to use.</li>
            <li> Love this pure aloe gel. Skin does feel slightly tight after it dries  (as to be expected but does not cause skin to dry out like other products with alcohol in it. ) I always put a small amount of jojoba oil over the aloe to take away the tightness. I use this daily on my face and periodically on any surfaces injuries, scratches, etc.  Hoping it will help combat dark spots from acne scars over time. Will report back later as to whether this worked or not.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to find aloe Vera without all the weird additives.  Love it!</li>

            <li> This is about as pure an aloe that you can get and it feels as cooling and as good as the real thing.
