            <li>But my teen son liked the scent.</li>
            <li>the name makes me laugh a lot.</li>
            <li>As for blackheads on the face... nothing is better than a face brush (not too soft...</li>
            <li>The product also came quickly and was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>I live in a semi-tropical area and this easily removes the oil from your face.  </li>
            <li>I use my hands only, it lathers very easily.</li>
            <li>After trying many things for years I&#x27;m always skeptical and nothing is great as it sounds.</li>
            <li>This stuff really does the job!  </li>
            <li>It looked funny</li>
            <li>I wish it was more solid.</li>
            <li>I use a brush for legs and back and under arms which uses more soap than hand</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t brushed my teeth with it, i&#x27;m thinking about trying it:)</li>
            <li>does a good job of cleaning the body but it was really harsh on my face and made me itch a bit and break out</li>
            <li>The soap does sting when first using it, and it felt very drying to me after I washed it off.</li>
            <li>I suggest super refined clear emu oil</li>
            <li>... get your face nice and hot from splashing hot water or a hot washcloth... then scrub a thick foam of this on your blackheads in CIRCLES to lift out the waxy plugs in your pores.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really amazed by this soap.</li>
            <li>This soap works very well for me.</li>
            <li>My husband who has very oily and porous skin has been using the soap for about a week now.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping too.</li>
            <li>while it&#x27;s gentle in some respects...</li>
            <li>while it&#x27;s gentle in some respects...</li>
            <li>a nice firm one)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about any other claims, I&#x27;ve been using for about 6 weeks, but not daily, and my face feels so good afterwards.  </li>
            <li>This soap works as well or better than any of the other face wash products i have used.  </li>
            <li>I kinda appreciate it since I normally have really oily skin.</li>
            <li>The KEY to this being successful is putting a thin coat of healthy oil back on your skin...</li>
            <li>A most have in my daily facial routine regiment.</li>
            <li>This soap basically removed all dead skin from my face and made my skin very very smooth.</li>
            <li>This soap was so highly recommended I decided to try a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is highly &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; in its PH so it cuts through grease &amp; wax like gangbusters.  </li>
            <li>It is highly &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; in its PH so it cuts through grease &amp; wax like gangbusters.  </li>
            <li>First off: I love using black soap and any chemical-free soap, in general.  </li>
            <li>When you strip off the sebum (natural skin wax... oily wax) from your face &amp; pores to clean out blackheads the holes of your pores are now open &amp; that will tell your body &amp;#34;Make a bunch of sebum fast!&amp;#34; so it will invite in bacteria &amp; sebum and cause blackheads and acne.  </li>
            <li>It also really helps to clear up acne, and brightens up my skin.    </li>
            <li>Go natural, it really works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used 6 bars so far and sent the same amount to a friend who was pregnant.</li>
            <li>and they look brand new again.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve completely ended all my adult acne doing this &amp; being super careful not to contact other acne sufferers because it&#x27;s one of the most contagious &amp;#34;bugs&amp;#34; on the planet.  </li>

            <li>This product is much cheaper and has all natural ingredients vs. the other products which were full of synthetic/chemical ingredients.  </li>
            <li>It is also a very soft soap</li>
            <li>but beware if you have very very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>whether your of dark or light complexion.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The amount of lather that keeps growing is unique to other soaps IMHO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also does what african black soap does, makes you squeaky clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>When I wash my face with it in the morning, I moisturize with 100% pure African shea butter, but at night I don&#x27;t since I wake up witch</li>
            <li>The only ingredients are: pure honey, shea butter, osum, palm kernal oil, cocoa pod ash, palm bunch ash, glycerine, aloe vera, lime juice, water, fragrance.    </li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s not the original tribal black soap you can get</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s not the original tribal black soap you can get</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to use a lot for bathing or washing my hands; it also leaves my skin soft and moist.</li>
            <li>If you do travel with it, make sure you take your own wash cloths so that the hotel housekeeping won&#x27;t get angry with you when the hotel wash cloths are black!  </li>
            <li>Fortunately the small scratches fade away after an hour or so and don&#x27;t scratch below the skin surface.  </li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t help with my dry itchy skin.</li>
            <li>I believe black soap helps with backne (back acne) and leaves the skin feeling clean but not stripped.  </li>
            <li>Last night during a conversation with someone I don&#x27;t know very well asked if I had hit the Big 40 yet!</li>
            <li>Major Improvement, all his pours have tightened and his skin is gleaming.</li>
            <li>When I think of the word &#x27;cleanliness&#x27;, the first thing that springs to mind is a cow patty.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used another brand of black soap and, while I love the other brand, the smell of this keeps me coming back.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this soap for 4 weeks and my back and chest are clear.</li>
            <li>I have adult acne and have used numerous skin care products to treat it.  </li>
            <li>When you wash your face with black soap always put a thin layer of light oil back on so that your pores stay free of wax plugs that cause blackheads and acne.</li>
            <li>When you wash your face with black soap always put a thin layer of light oil back on so that your pores stay free of wax plugs that cause blackheads and acne.</li>
            <li>It cleans my face so clean that it feels so tight and dry afterwards.</li>
            <li>But this was my first time trying African Black soap</li>
            <li>of nasty, but it leaves you with a really good clean feeling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually thinking of using this bar as a base for my homemade laundry detergent instead of the usual Zote bar soap because I&#x27;m so impressed with this new stain lifter experience</li>

            <li> First off: I love using black soap and any chemical-free soap, in general.  </li>
            <li> When you strip off the sebum (natural skin wax... oily wax) from your face &amp; pores to clean out blackheads the holes of your pores are now open &amp; that will tell your body &amp;#34;Make a bunch of sebum fast!&amp;#34; so it will invite in bacteria &amp; sebum and cause blackheads and acne.  </li>
            <li> It also really helps to clear up acne, and brightens up my skin.    </li>
            <li> Go natural, it really works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 6 bars so far and sent the same amount to a friend who was pregnant.</li>
            <li> and they look brand new again.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve completely ended all my adult acne doing this &amp; being super careful not to contact other acne sufferers because it&#x27;s one of the most contagious &amp;#34;bugs&amp;#34; on the planet.  </li>

            <li> This product is much cheaper and has all natural ingredients vs. the other products which were full of synthetic/chemical ingredients.  </li>
            <li> It is also a very soft soap</li>
            <li> but beware if you have very very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> whether your of dark or light complexion.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The amount of lather that keeps growing is unique to other soaps IMHO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also does what african black soap does, makes you squeaky clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> When I wash my face with it in the morning, I moisturize with 100% pure African shea butter, but at night I don&#x27;t since I wake up witch</li>
            <li> The only ingredients are: pure honey, shea butter, osum, palm kernal oil, cocoa pod ash, palm bunch ash, glycerine, aloe vera, lime juice, water, fragrance.    </li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s not the original tribal black soap you can get</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s not the original tribal black soap you can get</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to use a lot for bathing or washing my hands; it also leaves my skin soft and moist.</li>
            <li> If you do travel with it, make sure you take your own wash cloths so that the hotel housekeeping won&#x27;t get angry with you when the hotel wash cloths are black!  </li>
            <li> Fortunately the small scratches fade away after an hour or so and don&#x27;t scratch below the skin surface.  </li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t help with my dry itchy skin.</li>
            <li> I believe black soap helps with backne (back acne) and leaves the skin feeling clean but not stripped.  </li>
            <li> Last night during a conversation with someone I don&#x27;t know very well asked if I had hit the Big 40 yet!</li>
            <li> Major Improvement, all his pours have tightened and his skin is gleaming.</li>
            <li> When I think of the word &#x27;cleanliness&#x27;, the first thing that springs to mind is a cow patty.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used another brand of black soap and, while I love the other brand, the smell of this keeps me coming back.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for 4 weeks and my back and chest are clear.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne and have used numerous skin care products to treat it.  </li>
            <li> When you wash your face with black soap always put a thin layer of light oil back on so that your pores stay free of wax plugs that cause blackheads and acne.</li>

            <li> It cleans my face so clean that it feels so tight and dry afterwards.</li>
            <li> But this was my first time trying African Black soap</li>
            <li> of nasty, but it leaves you with a really good clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually thinking of using this bar as a base for my homemade laundry detergent instead of the usual Zote bar soap because I&#x27;m so impressed with this new stain lifter experience</li>
            <li> Also combine small almost used up bars with new ones for no waste of soap.  </li>
            <li> I would swear I just reviewed this and referred to the thick lather, mild fragrance that seems to be floral/planty but unisex, and moisturizing quality for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Also, sometimes the bar does scratch my skin due to natural pieces inside the soap.  </li>
            <li> I generally do not like scented anything.  </li>
            <li> Oils that stay liquid without making a wax when they dry are KEY to keeping blackheads away.  </li>

            <li> Also it lasts a long time because just a tiny bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> so I did a little research on it and found it to be all natural.</li>
            <li> Some things would work but not for long.</li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t dry and create a problem when I reenter the shower.  </li>
            <li> The only downside I can think of has to do with the dark streaks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other African black soaps, I&#x27;ve tried other handmade moisturizing soaps, but this is the soap that I keep coming back to.  </li>
            <li> I threw the Proactive away and went to an African Store and got some Dudu-Osun Black Soap.</li>
            <li> After about two weeks of my new beauty regime my skin looks unbelievable!  </li>
            <li> I tried Proactive for 2 years and it cleared face for a few weeks and than the acne would always come back.</li>
            <li> Just get wet and press together.  </li>
            <li> But I also purchased some vegetable glycerin and I&#x27;m using that to make a moisturizer with plain water &amp; a tiny bit of jojoba oil...</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I typically splash cold water on my clean face, then put a drop of emu oil on wet hands and massage that all over my face.  </li>

            <li> just lifted all that dark ground in stain out</li>

    <ol>
            <li> ...someone described it as cleaning \\&quot;squeaky clean\\&quot;. heck yes. It cleans my face so clean that it feels so tight and dry afterwards. Although a lot of ppl do not like a drying effect like that...I kinda appreciate it since I normally have really oily skin. When I wash my face with it in the morning, I moisturize with 100% pure African shea butter, but at night I don&#x27;t since I wake up witch my face oil anyway. I think it helped a bit with my under the skin pimples; not significantly, but a little. I have been using this product for almost 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> When I think of the word &#x27;cleanliness&#x27;, the first thing that springs to mind is a cow patty.  That&#x27;s why I chose a bar of soap that looks like one.  This stuff really does the job!  If rubbing something that looks like a block of manure against your body doesn&#x27;t spice up your showers, I don&#x27;t know what will!  The only possible improvement I can think of is the addition of a rope to the bar.  I keep dropping my Dudu.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite soap out there.  I&#x27;ve tried other African black soaps, I&#x27;ve tried other handmade moisturizing soaps, but this is the soap that I keep coming back to.  Everything else dries out my skin but this.  It also really helps to clear up acne, and brightens up my skin.    The only ingredients are: pure honey, shea butter, osum, palm kernal oil, cocoa pod ash, palm bunch ash, glycerine, aloe vera, lime juice, water, fragrance.    It has an expiration date, and the soap that was sent to me expires 2 years from when I received it.  There are liquid versions available, but I have not tried them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap for 20 years!  It is truly a head to soap. You can wash your hair, wash your face to keep blemishes away, shave, and wash the rest of your body. It can be strong so dont leave it on your face for any length of time.  It is also a very soft soap so make sure you get a well ventilated, well draining soap dish. If it does suffer from getting water logged, set it in a well draining dish and leave until it dries out...a couple of days. This soap travels well and trust me, once you discover you love it, you will want to take it with you.  If you do travel with it, make sure you take your own wash cloths so that the hotel housekeeping won&#x27;t get angry with you when the hotel wash cloths are black!  Yep, it stains and it can stain bad so do youself a favor and get a navy colored wash cloth.</li>
            <li> Excellent item. Price is good and the product is great. I bought a lot for the extended family too. Good buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really amazed by this soap. After trying many things for years I&#x27;m always skeptical and nothing is great as it sounds. But this was my first time trying African Black soap and I could see instant results. It was bringing deep-down gunk to the surface. The soap does sting when first using it, and it felt very drying to me after I washed it off. But I also purchased some vegetable glycerin and I&#x27;m using that to make a moisturizer with plain water &amp; a tiny bit of jojoba oil... Perfect combo that doesn&#x27;t clog pores and isn&#x27;t greasy. Forget doctors and expensive chemical products. Go natural, it really works.</li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase this soap again.  The lather is great and I don&#x27;t have to use a lot for bathing or washing my hands; it also leaves my skin soft and moist.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this soap for myself. It really didn&#x27;t help with my dry itchy skin. But my teen son liked the scent. He started using it, and we both couldn&#x27;t believe how his acne started clearing. Maybe just a fluke but he ran out and the acne came back. My son swears by this soap now.</li>
            <li> Best facial soap I have ever used. Leaves your skin feeling squeaky clean. I prefer soaps over liquid, and I prefer that completely clean feeling after.</li>
            <li> This soap is awesome! It washes my skin squeaky clean, gives my skin an even tone and clears blemishes.  A most have in my daily facial routine regiment.</li>
            <li> This soap works very well for me. It makes my skin &#x27;bright&#x27; and smooth, and clean. A little goes a long way. I am so pleased with this soap, I ordered a dozen even before my first order was finish. I do recommend it. Hope it works well for you as it&#x27;s working for me.</li>
            <li> This is my second order.  I use it for face soap, love the smell.  I live in a semi-tropical area and this easily removes the oil from your face.  I don&#x27;t know about any other claims, I&#x27;ve been using for about 6 weeks, but not daily, and my face feels so good afterwards.  I use my hands only, it lathers very easily.</li>
            <li> I have had issues with acne on my face, chest and back for 17 years. I have tried everything. Some things would work but not for long. I tried Proactive for 2 years and it cleared face for a few weeks and than the acne would always come back. It also made my skin look and feel like snake skin. I threw the Proactive away and went to an African Store and got some Dudu-Osun Black Soap. It looked funny so I did a little research on it and found it to be all natural. I&#x27;ve been using this soap for 4 weeks and my back and chest are clear. My face is getting alot better. I also use the 100% African Shae butter for the drying. I love this soap. I don&#x27;t think I will use anything else on my face and body. I have to say I wash my body with my regular soap (Dove, Dial, etc.) than I use this soap after wards.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne and have used numerous skin care products to treat it.  This soap works as well or better than any of the other face wash products i have used.  This product is much cheaper and has all natural ingredients vs. the other products which were full of synthetic/chemical ingredients.  When i told my husband that i had purchased dudu soap he said \\&quot;you bought WHAT!\\&quot; Now he uses it too.</li>
            <li> I tried this soap, now it is the only soap I use. It is not overly fragrant, it looks&lt;br /&gt;kind of nasty, but it leaves you with a really good clean feeling. It also tones clears&lt;br /&gt;your skin of darks spots, and evens your color out whether your of dark or light complexion.&lt;br /&gt;I even use this soap in my hair, it doesnt strip it and leave it stringy and flat.&lt;br /&gt;This soap can be used for anything, but use it sparingly because it is a commodity.</li>
            <li> This soap lathers better than a liquid body wash. I bought this soap because I had body acne especially on my back, this soap cleared it all up within a 2 week period. It also balanced out my skin tone. My relatives have started stealing it from me it&#x27;s so good.</li>
            <li> This soap feels very nice it makes the skin smooth. But the soap breaks up wierdly I wish it was more solid. But it&#x27;s still good quality.</li>
            <li> I purchased this soap along with some Argon oil and the Baiden Mitten. I am 52 and my skin is fair and has always looked good but I have been starting to show my age. After about two weeks of my new beauty regime my skin looks unbelievable!  Last night during a conversation with someone I don&#x27;t know very well asked if I had hit the Big 40 yet! My husband who has very oily and porous skin has been using the soap for about a week now.  Major Improvement, all his pours have tightened and his skin is gleaming. I will NEVER go back to using regular soap again.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells and the way it made my skin feel. This soap basically removed all dead skin from my face and made my skin very very smooth. I would recommend it but beware if you have very very sensitive skin. It could cause irritation.</li>
            <li> Having used this soap for almost a year now, I thought it was time to review it.  First off: I love using black soap and any chemical-free soap, in general.  I believe black soap helps with backne (back acne) and leaves the skin feeling clean but not stripped.  I&#x27;ve used another brand of black soap and, while I love the other brand, the smell of this keeps me coming back.  After showering, the bathroom smells SO good.  It&#x27;s a distinct smell that some may not like, but I believe most will love.  You know, smells are a personal preference.  But everyone I&#x27;ve introduced the soap to has loved the smell.    The only downside I can think of has to do with the dark streaks it can leave in the tub when you put it back into the soap holder and the water runs.  Usually I take the shower head and wash the lines away so they don&#x27;t dry and create a problem when I reenter the shower.  That may bother some people, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.  Also, sometimes the bar does scratch my skin due to natural pieces inside the soap.  Fortunately the small scratches fade away after an hour or so and don&#x27;t scratch below the skin surface.  By no means does this happen every shower either.  But I would recommend to those who use the bar on their face to rub it in their hands first to avoid small scratches.  Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this soap to anyone.  It&#x27;s inexpensive, non-drying, and the quality and smell are wonderful.  Love the benefits from using it as well!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a soap to even your skin tone and dry out oily skin, this is the perfect product. The results aren&#x27;t immediate but after about a month of use you will see a difference. The product also came quickly and was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> Great product for itchy skin &amp; acne. I use it for my psoriasis my kids use it for their acne.</li>
            <li> Simply put I like it. It has a great fresh scent and doesnt leave any weird/filmy residue on the body afterwards for me. Also has been a helpful supplement in helping with skin discoloration</li>
            <li> Still great soap. I would swear I just reviewed this and referred to the thick lather, mild fragrance that seems to be floral/planty but unisex, and moisturizing quality for dry skin. It&#x27;s all still true!</li>
            <li> Great smell and product. I will not use with light color cloth since it does stain. Makes my skin feel refresh. My son use for his acne prone skin and likes it. Fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> the name makes me laugh a lot. the soap make me feel refresh, and clean. I love it and will buy some more.</li>
            <li> I generally do not like scented anything.  This soap was so highly recommended I decided to try a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I am used to the smell which isn&#x27;t unpleasant.  The soap lathers and lathers and lathers.  One bar lasts weeks in the shower.  I use a brush for legs and back and under arms which uses more soap than hand use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acidic level may be a tad higher than most soaps?  In shower lathered my face and left on while I washed the rest of me.  After five minutes my lips felt a string from this lather.  No big deal and rinsing made it go away.  The amount of lather that keeps growing is unique to other soaps IMHO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like all soaps after use put in holder that allows dripping off.  Sitting on parallel wires after a week I noticed the soap had formed stalactites below wires.  I brush them off and brush me in next shower.  Also combine small almost used up bars with new ones for no waste of soap.  Just get wet and press together.  Great soap.  I also like squeeze bottles of liguid soap for convenience and travel.  At home I only use these bars.</li>
            <li> I also have the abs in the blocks, so I liked these formed ones because of the scent added. Very light and zesty for me. It also does what african black soap does, makes you squeaky clean and fresh. If you want your abs to be scented I highly recommend these, the 6 pack is a good value buy too.</li>
            <li> I love this soap, talking about squeaky clean. Washing my hair is such a pleasure with this soap. I haven&#x27;t brushed my teeth with it, i&#x27;m thinking about trying it:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 6 bars so far and sent the same amount to a friend who was pregnant. She absolutely loved it! It softens and reduces the appearance of stretch marks. Just ordered another 6 bars and cannot wait until I receive them.</li>
            <li> Since I use this soap I don&#x27;t use moisturizing lotions. And it is very important for me - I&#x27;m a nurse and washing&lt;br /&gt;my hands hundred times a day at my job. Using this soap at home enough to nourish and restore my hand&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m on my last bar of this marvelous smelling soap.  I love it.  My oily skin loves it.  My feet and heels love it.  My dogs love it.  Just when I thought I knew everything this soap was good for...  I found out that it is a powerhouse at handwashing dirty socks to make them look brand new.  You know those footie socks that double as house slippers?  Yeah mine get good and grody on the bottom from going outside and so forth.  Washing in the washer still leaves them dark on the bottom.  In a pinch when the washer was being used I tossed some socks in the sink and washed them up with the Dudu-Osun and lo and behold this stuff just lifted all that dark ground in stain out and they look brand new again.  Now I&#x27;m trying it on all sorts of stains and I find it is wonderful for getting out stubborn stains.  I&#x27;m actually thinking of using this bar as a base for my homemade laundry detergent instead of the usual Zote bar soap because I&#x27;m so impressed with this new stain lifter experience I&#x27;m  having.  As for blackheads on the face... nothing is better than a face brush (not too soft... a nice firm one) and this make a paste of this soap... get your face nice and hot from splashing hot water or a hot washcloth... then scrub a thick foam of this on your blackheads in CIRCLES to lift out the waxy plugs in your pores.  The KEY to this being successful is putting a thin coat of healthy oil back on your skin... I suggest super refined clear emu oil but if you don&#x27;t have that put sunflower oil ... or even olive oil.  Acne is caused by BACTERIA, not oil.  Oils that stay liquid without making a wax when they dry are KEY to keeping blackheads away.  Your skin produces wax.  Thinner oils like sunflower will stop this wax from plugging your pores.  When you strip off the sebum (natural skin wax... oily wax) from your face &amp; pores to clean out blackheads the holes of your pores are now open &amp; that will tell your body &amp;#34;Make a bunch of sebum fast!&amp;#34; so it will invite in bacteria &amp; sebum and cause blackheads and acne.  The myth about oily skin is that adding oil will make it worse. It makes it BETTER.  When you wash your face with black soap always put a thin layer of light oil back on so that your pores stay free of wax plugs that cause blackheads and acne. I typically splash cold water on my clean face, then put a drop of emu oil on wet hands and massage that all over my face.  I&#x27;ve completely ended all my adult acne doing this &amp; being super careful not to contact other acne sufferers because it&#x27;s one of the most contagious &amp;#34;bugs&amp;#34; on the planet.  Wash you linen and your furniture &amp; keep your hands off your face. Black soap is a miracle for a lot of people who know how to use it &amp; understand the process.  It is highly &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; in its PH so it cuts through grease &amp; wax like gangbusters.  This is a soap with a lot of lye in it... while it&#x27;s gentle in some respects... you can use it on baby skin... you can also use it to power off stains &amp; blast through blackheads.... even remove that dead ashy skin on feet.  You simply have to know how to use it. I will always have some of this brand of black soap in my house now.  I know it&#x27;s not the original tribal black soap you can get but I&#x27;ve had bad experiences with rocks in my soap and even hair in it so I&#x27;m not buying tribal soap again.  This Dudu-Osun comes in a nice bar that is uniform &amp; I love the tropical fragrance version.  When I shower my whole bathroom and master bedroom smell wonderful from this soap.  Also it lasts a long time because just a tiny bit goes a long way.  I cut the bars in 3 for the shower because it lasts better that way.&amp; sebum and cause blackheads and acne.

This is a soap with a lot of lye in it... while it&#x27;s gentle in some respects... you can use it on baby skin... you can also use it to power off stains &amp; blast through blackheads.... even remove that dead ashy skin on feet.  You simply have to know how to use it. I will always have some of this brand of black soap in my house now.  I know it&#x27;s not the original tribal black soap you can get but I&#x27;ve had bad experiences with rocks in my soap and even hair in it so I&#x27;m not buying tribal soap again.  This Dudu-Osun comes in a nice bar that is uniform &amp; I love the tropical fragrance version.  When I shower my whole bathroom and master bedroom smell wonderful from this soap.  Also it lasts a long time because just a tiny bit goes a long way.  I cut the bars in 3 for the shower because it lasts better that way.</li>
            <li> does a good job of cleaning the body but it was really harsh on my face and made me itch a bit and break out</li>
            <li> This soap is awesome, does not leave u dry afterwards. It smells nice too. Have not had any staining from it. would&#x27;ve given 5 stars if only it lasted a little longer...tends to get expensive!</li>
