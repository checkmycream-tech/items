            <li>This product is great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year, with great results.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s gooey appearance, this works great as a weekend treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Received  these  ointments  from  this company  at  a  great  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more impressed with this product&#x27;s results and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>Love it the best miracle for my acne</li>
            <li>Works price service all good</li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s no cure, but it&#x27;s a good treatment when breakouts occur)</li>
            <li>good  moisturiser.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>My acne has greatly improved using this (even better than the prescription).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably the most drying acne treatment I&#x27;ve ever used and it has great effect on cystic acne.</li>
            <li>I received it very fast and in excellent condition.</li>
            <li>The product itself is pretty awesome.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>This stuff is okay, but not as good as the sulfur cleansers and masks.</li>
            <li>Would be nice if it came in a non greasy cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Best acne product I&#x27;ve used by far.</li>
            <li>(if used as a mask, I have great success).</li>
            <li>Its ok, but very strong smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been pretty happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>great product - does exactly what it says it wil</li>
            <li>Love  </li>
            <li>okay..</li>
            <li>This is the best acne product ive used, it actually works, you will see the difference in a week.</li>
            <li>Have tried many products, from prescription, to subscription, to over the counter, but this has been my break through product for my oily, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>The good thing is, the sulfur products are not expensive.  </li>
            <li>Working on my ingrowns is what made me most excited about this product.</li>
            <li>The odor is not too strong, but when you use sulfur you already have in mind how it smells.</li>
            <li>I think this is a great product for once a month to clean and clear your breakouts.</li>
            <li>Apparently, many are having success with the soap also.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product as it does work and it is cost effective.</li>
            <li>They have changed the product over time and now it has a perfume smell that while I don&#x27;t really enjoy, anything is better than the straight sulfur smell.</li>
            <li>This sulfar ointment will definitely clean your skin up.  </li>
            <li>Really, this stuff is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s no noticeable smell, but the ointment is bright yellow.</li>
            <li>The store we went to doesnt have it on the regular anymore and have found the 3 pack online to be a good deal.</li>
            <li>My skin has not looked this good in ten years.</li>
            <li>A true miracle bottom line.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s gotten great results, as long as she uses it consistently.</li>
            <li>I put on a pea size amount after washing with a mild cleanser (Cetaphil) and leave it on overnight.</li>
            <li>Overall, very satisfied and will purchase from here again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled with skin problems since I was in elementary school and have tried dozens of prescribed medications from the dermatologist and even tried accutane.</li>
            <li>However, those areas don&#x27;t breakout so it&#x27;s worth it!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This  ointment  will  clear  most /any</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very greasy and has a light odor, but if you use a pea size amount on your whole face it absorbs into your skin and the smell dissipates.</li>
            <li>Just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t something clearing up my face, I stopped using for a while and the acne came back.  </li>
            <li>But is everyone aware Walmart sells this stuff for about $3?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a process and doesn&#x27;t get all better overnight, but I saw noticable results within a week.  </li>
            <li>The ointment, as it turned out, isn&#x27;t exactly neat.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit sticky &amp; greasy--for some reason, it doesn&#x27;t get absorbed much by the skin.</li>
            <li>He still has areas of acne, but new pustules quickly heal.</li>
            <li>I have been usin it for an year already and found positive results.</li>
            <li>I actually used this product for Scabies, which took care of them very quickly, within three days.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t  have cystic acne, but lots of scars, large pores, whiteheads, and blackheads.  </li>
            <li>If its a huge pimple I use as a spot treatment and makes my pimple smaller.</li>
            <li>As others have mentioned, it is very drying, so I&#x27;ve been using Cetaphil to wash my face and Eucerin as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Had to buy this pack of three because I use it that much.</li>
            <li>My skin is very oily, hormonal, and acne prone.  </li>
            <li>this really fits the bill.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product along with Grisi Sulfur Soap and have seen much improvement in my skin and my breakouts have cleared up.  </li>
            <li>I hope it really works like it&#x27;s said to be</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried over the counter and prescriptions from dermatologists without much improvement.</li>
            <li>i am very acne prone, whether its something i ate ,time of the month,bad makeup, or just because,i breakout and its been my life since i went through puberty.</li>
            <li>Really helped his skin.</li>
            <li>real  </li>
            <li>This product will dry your skin and make it peel, which is a good thing, but you  must get rid of the dry flaky skin.  </li>
            <li>After enjoying 3 months of positive effects after the last month of Accutane, my son&#x27;s acne came back with a vengeance!</li>
            <li>This ointment really is not worth more than Walmart&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li>In the morning I wash my face with a mild cleanser and use a warm, wet washcloth to exfoliate because this makes my skin peel a little bit.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It has been much more effective than other, far more expensive products my teenage daughter has used for her acne.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend has break outs from caffeine and coffe (which he works with), this stuff really helps clear his face.  </li>
            <li>but my new insurance wouldn&#x27;t cover it because I was &amp;#62;25 years old.  </li>
            <li>That was disappointing because I really loved it for those first 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>ordered this product a little over a month ago, along with a sulfur cleansing bar and zinc powder to add to my oil free moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that really worked for my adult acne.</li>
            <li>I am 44 years old and I have suffered from acne since I was in my teens.  </li>
            <li>Does epic things for my skin.</li>
            <li>Warning: Do not get near eyes and when washing off don&#x27;t let your water stray into your eyes.</li>
            <li>She was put on months of antibiotics with initial success that later weren&#x27;t effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>every few days, makes my skin better than any other product has, and I&#x27;ve been going to a derm since 6th grade,</li>
            <li>I had clear skin for almost a year before it started to come back.</li>
            <li>After her first use her acne improved and it helped with the dark spots.</li>
            <li>It definitely cleared up my acne, but after about 3 weeks use, it started making the sensitive skin around my eyes swell and blister.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and there may be other conditions that it would work for as well.</li>
            <li>This product is NOT for dry or sensitive skin as it is somewhat drying.  </li>
            <li>I tried using it for only a few minutes, and I tried slathering aloe around my eyes first.</li>

            <li> We also have been using it for small skin blemishes/acne and it works very well.</li>
            <li> I leave it on for 10 minutes twice a day, and now instead of being a deep red with with pus-filled bumps, I&#x27;m just slightly pink.</li>
            <li> I bought this at a local Rite Aid, it makes my skin slightly itchy, but it is definitely a miracle ointment.</li>
            <li> I use this ointment, I avoid applying any other acne treatments in the same area.</li>
            <li> I use it once or twice a day depending on how dry or oily my skin is.  </li>
            <li> When she added the Clinique dark spot corrector twice a day to this regimen her face has almost totally cleared up.</li>
            <li> She has been using this for a year and a half with the initial order and still hasn&#x27;t finished the 3-pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to keep paying for expensive prescription medications and luckily found this product on amazon and decided to give it a go.</li>
            <li> I have not experience the peeling and dried skin the previous users mentioned,may be it because i moisturize with extra virgin olive oil and vitamin E regularly or</li>
            <li> It is slightly gritty, and goes on a little greasy but does absorb into your skin after about 20-30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Many say the smell is bad</li>
            <li> Package was on time as expected.</li>
            <li> Sulfur was not what I had expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent lots of money on dermatologists over the years.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> It works.  After a few weeks of use, face cleared up.  Just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t something clearing up my face, I stopped using for a while and the acne came back.  Started using the ointment again and they were gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does have an odor but who cares if it works.</li>
            <li> Wash face then apply for 20 min and rinse.</li>
            <li> Package was on time as expected. The product itself is pretty awesome.  My boyfriend has break outs from caffeine and coffe (which he works with), this stuff really helps clear his face.  It dries out your skin as part of it so don&#x27;t get if you&#x27;re looking for a moisture as well. It&#x27;s difficult to find in stores. The store we went to doesnt have it on the regular anymore and have found the 3 pack online to be a good deal. Overall, very satisfied and will purchase from here again.</li>
            <li> Best acne product I&#x27;ve used by far. I&#x27;ve struggled with skin problems since I was in elementary school and have tried dozens of prescribed medications from the dermatologist and even tried accutane. Accutane works, but the side effects are terrible. I had clear skin for almost a year before it started to come back. I didn&#x27;t want to keep paying for expensive prescription medications and luckily found this product on amazon and decided to give it a go. I couldn&#x27;t be more impressed with this product&#x27;s results and the price can&#x27;t be beat. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year and recommend that you give it a try.</li>
            <li> I bought this at a local Rite Aid, it makes my skin slightly itchy, but it is definitely a miracle ointment. It gets rid of pimples over night &amp; guess what, I decided to test it on my ingrown hairs &amp; it pushed out the ingrown 2 days after I started using it!! Working on my ingrowns is what made me most excited about this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a bad case of papulopustular rosacea for a number of years. This is the only thing that has ever worked for me. I leave it on for 10 minutes twice a day, and now instead of being a deep red with with pus-filled bumps, I&#x27;m just slightly pink. My face is also a lot less itchy and painful. As others have mentioned, it is very drying, so I&#x27;ve been using Cetaphil to wash my face and Eucerin as a moisturizer. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This helps acne a ton.  Works well if you wash laundry frequently, especially pillow and use sulfur soap for hair</li>
            <li> This stuff is okay, but not as good as the sulfur cleansers and masks. I prefer salicylic acid as a spot treatment. But is everyone aware Walmart sells this stuff for about $3? It&#x27;s usually where all of the ethnic skin and hair care items are. This ointment really is not worth more than Walmart&#x27;s price. At all.</li>
            <li> I have been suffering from Rosacea for years and this is the best product I&#x27;ve used.  If you have this condition, give it a shot.  You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> My wife suffers from rosacea. We tried everything including multiple trips to the dermatologist to find something that would work. She was put on months of antibiotics with initial success that later weren&#x27;t effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She now puts a tiny amount on her face in the morning and evening for 5 minutes and her breakouts have disappeared!  She has been using this for a year and a half with the initial order and still hasn&#x27;t finished the 3-pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her confidence has returned and she looks great!</li>
            <li> The only thing that really worked for my adult acne. Had to buy this pack of three because I use it that much.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great product for once a month to clean and clear your breakouts. The smell is not a pleasant smell. It does have a touch of latex smell. I just put a thin layer on my face for about an hour and rinse. If its a huge pimple I use as a spot treatment and makes my pimple smaller.</li>
            <li> Love  this  product  would  recommend  it  to  you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently broken out due to what I think are hormones and hair products.  I&#x27;ve been getting stubborn acne in my cheeks and on my chin.  I used a salicylic acid peel to try and tame it but it ended up making it worse.  I don&#x27;t want to use benzoyl peroxide products since they irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this product a little over a month ago, along with a sulfur cleansing bar and zinc powder to add to my oil free moisturizer.  I&#x27;ve been pretty happy with the results.  I still have a small  pimple here and there but everything is slowly drying up.  It&#x27;s definitely a process and doesn&#x27;t get all better overnight, but I saw noticable results within a week.  I just follow the directions but leave it on for up to an hour, instead of ten minutes.  I like to feel it working.  Also, after it&#x27;s rinsed off, I wash with my sulfur bar and spot treat with Proactive sulfur mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased zinc powder to add to my moisturizer and find it helps immensely with the redness associated with acne.  It has drying properties so it helps with shine throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, a must do while using this product is to EXFOLIATE.  This product will dry your skin and make it peel, which is a good thing, but you  must get rid of the dry flaky skin.  I bought some microdermabrasion crystals and mix them in with my Neutrogena Acne Stress Relief scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s def a keeper in my arsenal of acne products.</li>
            <li> After enjoying 3 months of positive effects after the last month of Accutane, my son&#x27;s acne came back with a vengeance! We have been diligently using the ointment for a month now. He still has areas of acne, but new pustules quickly heal. He has been leaving it on for one to two hours. We have been experiencing the two steps forward and one step back scenario. However, I will not put him back on Accutane! Between the monthly blood tests and increased aggression, I would rather apply this inexpensive topical ointment any day! Accutane doesn&#x27;t deal with blackheads, but the ointment brings EVERYTHING  to the surface!!</li>
            <li> This is definitely a must have for my acne fighting kit. I use it not only on my face, but on my chest and back as well. They have changed the product over time and now it has a perfume smell that while I don&#x27;t really enjoy, anything is better than the straight sulfur smell. I typically apply this product when I wake up, and let sit on my skin for about 30 minutes or so before my morning shower. I combine the sulfur ointment with Salicylic acid body wash and a Salicylic acid topical astringent. The Salicylic acid alone wasn&#x27;t enough to tackle my acne problems, but once I added the sulfur, it was game over.</li>
            <li> Sulfur was not what I had expected. It was to hard to return. so I&#x27;m stuck with a product I don&#x27;t need.</li>
            <li> Item as described, great deal.</li>
            <li> Its working okay..it haven&#x27;t been a month yet..</li>
            <li> I am 44 years old and I have suffered from acne since I was in my teens.  I have tried just about everything.  I&#x27;ve spent lots of money on dermatologists over the years.  I stumbled upon this product by accident.  My skin is very oily, hormonal, and acne prone.  After using it just a few days, I can see a dramatic difference in my skin.  I don&#x27;t  have cystic acne, but lots of scars, large pores, whiteheads, and blackheads.  My skin is just always breaking out and seems so inflamed all the time.  This product is NOT for dry or sensitive skin as it is somewhat drying.  It is slightly gritty, and goes on a little greasy but does absorb into your skin after about 20-30 minutes.  A little goes a long way.  You need to use a moisturizer with it.  I put a thin coat on at night after washing my face for bed.  It also seems to be lightening my scarred areas.  I also plan to use a sulfur soap which I haven&#x27;t ordered yet.  Apparently, many are having success with the soap also.  The good thing is, the sulfur products are not expensive.  Many say the smell is bad but I didn&#x27;t think so.  So, if you have acne and like me, have tried everything, give this product  or a product with 10% sulfur a try.

            <li> Holy grail of acne and rosacea products. However this does have a very odd odor to it and it sticky. If you read the directions it says to apply for 10 minutes. (if used as a mask, I have great success). If you are trying to use this as a cream and leave on the face I don&#x27;t think it would be possible. Does epic things for my skin. Warning: Do not get near eyes and when washing off don&#x27;t let your water stray into your eyes. If you do run cold water into them until irritation is gone. It makes my eyes water non stop if it gets into them.&lt;br /&gt;Despite the cons, spending 10 min. every few days, makes my skin better than any other product has, and I&#x27;ve been going to a derm since 6th grade, (I&#x27;m well past 30 now)</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter, she has suffered with acne since her teenage years. She has tried everything prescription including accutane. After her first use her acne improved and it helped with the dark spots. When she added the Clinique dark spot corrector twice a day to this regimen her face has almost totally cleared up. These two products have been miracles for her. She is 26 and nothing has ever worked like this except for the time she was on accutane. Truly a miracle!</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic. If you&#x27;re looking for an alternative to what you&#x27;ve been using (benzoyl peroxide in my case) this really fits the bill. It doesn&#x27;t smell great, but who cares. Put it on, leave it for 10-20 minutes, wash it off, and go about your daily face routine. I will say, this is DRYING!!! So have a great moisturizer. I recommend a mixture of 80% acne.org with 20% cetaphil.</li>
            <li> I bought the ointment b/c I thought the powder would be messy. The ointment, as it turned out, isn&#x27;t exactly neat. It&#x27;s a bit sticky &amp; greasy--for some reason, it doesn&#x27;t get absorbed much by the skin. But it smells good, not the nasty sulfur smell.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but ordered this product based on the positive reviews. It has been much more effective than other, far more expensive products my teenage daughter has used for her acne. She&#x27;s gotten great results, as long as she uses it consistently. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> great product - does exactly what it says it wil</li>
            <li> I have been using this product along with Grisi Sulfur Soap and have seen much improvement in my skin and my breakouts have cleared up.  It is an ointment so it is a little greasy but does not stain.  Would be nice if it came in a non greasy cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Was helpful in in clearing up my acne but dried my face out some.</li>
            <li> I hope it really works like it&#x27;s said to be I have tried it all expecting my shipment soon...</li>
            <li> This product is great.  I used to use the prescription clarifoam ef for my cystic acne but my new insurance wouldn&#x27;t cover it because I was &amp;#62;25 years old.  I didn&#x27;t want to pay $200 a month so I tried OTC sulfur products.  This stuff is excellent for the money.  My acne has greatly improved using this (even better than the prescription).  I use it once or twice a day depending on how dry or oily my skin is.  I use only a small amount on my face and neck, I typically don&#x27;t wash it off.  Everybody&#x27;s skin is different, hope this was helpful.</li>
            <li> This sulfur ointment is the only topical preparation which calms the inflammation of my seborrheic dermatitis. When this skin condition flares, my pores enlarge.  The sulfur ointment shrinks my pores and fights the underlying cause of the dermatitis.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome and works the best for me. I&#x27;ve tried over the counter and prescriptions from dermatologists without much improvement. In fact some products made it worse. This is the best for me.  My skin has not looked this good in ten years. Acne rosecea no more. I highly recommend this product as it does work and it is cost effective.</li>
            <li> This product helps tame problem spots. It&#x27;s very greasy and has a light odor, but if you use a pea size amount on your whole face it absorbs into your skin and the smell dissipates. I put on a pea size amount after washing with a mild cleanser (Cetaphil) and leave it on overnight. In the morning I wash my face with a mild cleanser and use a warm, wet washcloth to exfoliate because this makes my skin peel a little bit. However, those areas don&#x27;t breakout so it&#x27;s worth it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller had my product to my door within a week. Very good seller!</li>
            <li> benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, you name it i have tried it. both miserably failed, and then came Sulfur ointment. A true miracle bottom line. i am very acne prone, whether its something i ate ,time of the month,bad makeup, or just because,i breakout and its been my life since i went through puberty. i use sulfur ointment all over like a mask or a spot treatment,and both application does wonders. It brings everything to the surface and within a day or two that pimple is dried. I have not experience the peeling and dried skin the previous users mentioned,may be it because i moisturize with extra virgin olive oil and vitamin E regularly or just my skin i dont know. Over all 5 star....</li>
            <li> I bought this for a rash and it was excellent. The odor is not too strong, but when you use sulfur you already have in mind how it smells. My daughter uses it for pimples, acne, and she only put at nights before go to bed, then washes her face and next day, not acne or pimples.</li>
            <li> This sulfar ointment will definitely clean your skin up.  My only problem with it is that it will definitely clog your plumbing over time and stink it up, which is why I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> Great for acne! On face and skin. Apply at night before bed!</li>
            <li> Its ok, but very strong smell.</li>
            <li> Works price service all good</li>
            <li> This is the best acne product ive used, it actually works, you will see the difference in a week.</li>
            <li> Not a miracle in our home. Still had to follow up with a Doctor visit and prescriptions. Did not make it worse but didn&#x27;t help either.</li>
            <li> Really, this stuff is pretty amazing. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year, with great results. It&#x27;s probably the most drying acne treatment I&#x27;ve ever used and it has great effect on cystic acne. (It&#x27;s no cure, but it&#x27;s a good treatment when breakouts occur) I just daub it on thickly over any problem areas for 2-3 days, and they disappear - given it&#x27;s gooey appearance, this works great as a weekend treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use this ointment, I avoid applying any other acne treatments in the same area. I&#x27;ve found that mixing this with any other applications causes a lot of redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no noticeable smell, but the ointment is bright yellow.</li>
            <li> My son loves this. Really helped his skin.</li>
            <li> It works. It definitely cleared up my acne, but after about 3 weeks use, it started making the sensitive skin around my eyes swell and blister. (No, I didn&#x27;t put the ointment around my eyes). I tried diluting it. I tried using it for only a few minutes, and I tried slathering aloe around my eyes first. My eyes continued to swell. I became afraid of it and I had to give up. That was disappointing because I really loved it for those first 3 weeks. If you buy it, be careful with it.</li>
            <li> Received  these  ointments  from  this company  at  a  great  price&lt;br /&gt;on time  as  promised. This  ointment  will  clear  most /any skin&lt;br /&gt; condition. The  only  draw back  is  dryness  of  the  skin  after  use&lt;br /&gt;But, you can get round  that  by drinking  lots of  water  and using&lt;br /&gt;a real  good  moisturiser.</li>
            <li> Love it the best miracle for my acne</li>
            <li> The Pomada De Azufre Sulfur Ointment is an awesome product. I received it very fast and in excellent condition. I actually used this product for Scabies, which took care of them very quickly, within three days. We also have been using it for small skin blemishes/acne and it works very well. I highly recommend this product and there may be other conditions that it would work for as well.</li>
            <li> Have tried many products, from prescription, to subscription, to over the counter, but this has been my break through product for my oily, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product. I would recommend it. I have been usin it for an year already and found positive results.</li>
