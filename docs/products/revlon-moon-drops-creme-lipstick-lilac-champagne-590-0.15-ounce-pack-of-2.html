            <li>Thank you for making it available!</li>

            <li>and I LOVE this color.  </li>
            <li>It arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>Revlon&#x27;s lipsticks are always fantastic.  </li>
            <li>it goes on so smooth.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 91 year old senior friend because this is her favorite lipstick and her favorite shade..</li>
            <li>It arrive quickly</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great shade of pink/fuschia &amp; not too dark to wear in the daytime.  </li>
            <li>The price is great, the product is terrific &amp; I highly recommend this lipstick.</li>
            <li>, I think it was a little pricy, but it is still great.</li>
            <li>It stays on well &amp; is a nice cool shade of pink.  </li>
            <li>The only thing is that if u kiss someone it smudges very easily</li>

            <li>I will be back for more.</li>
            <li>This lipstick has been discontinued and I have not been able to find a similar color in new lipsticks -</li>
            <li>it is the \most perfect shade of pink, not purple at least on my lips, as the name suggests.</li>
            <li>My mother and I have used this color since the dawn of time and we literally have people catching us dead in our tracks to ask us what color we are wearing.</li>
            <li>right wearing this color makes you shine like no other!</li>
            <li>Found a new source for buying it through Amazon...whee!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s actually a hot bubblegum pink, and really pretty!  </li>
            <li>It would probably look fantastic on someone with darker skin tones or even pink undertones.</li>
            <li>picture of the color, Lilac Champagne, is pretty close to the actual color.  </li>
            <li>This is a really great pink color, but very hard to find.  </li>
            <li>This discontinued color is clearly a show-stopper.</li>
            <li>She was so surprised that I found it.</li>
            <li>she loves this color, has been using it for almost her entire adult life she loves it</li>
            <li>~ it&#x27;s nothing short of perfection and you can only buy it from a 3rd party since it&#x27;s completely out of commission in retail.</li>

            <li> My 86 y/o mom loves this discontinued shade. She was so surprised that I found it. She&#x27;s so happy to have it.</li>
            <li> This is a gift my mother-in-law she loves this color, has been using it for almost her entire adult life she loves it</li>
            <li> This is a really great pink color, but very hard to find.  It is probably discontinued, which usually happens when I really like a product.  The color is a pinky coral and stays on great.  It arrived very quickly. Very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this lipstick for quite awhile as one of my &amp;#34;go-to&#x27;s&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s a great shade of pink/fuschia &amp; not too dark to wear in the daytime.  Actually, it goes from day to night with no problems at all. It stays on well &amp; is a nice cool shade of pink.  The price is great, the product is terrific &amp; I highly recommend this lipstick. It&#x27;s a perfect color for anyone &amp; would compliment any skin tone. Love it!</li>
            <li> My mother has been using this lipstick for many years and is very happy with the quality of the product and the color. She lives in a small town in NC and the store where she has been buying it for many years stopped carrying this color - I was glad to find it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The picture of the color, Lilac Champagne, is pretty close to the actual color.  It is a somewhat bright lilac/pink shade.  My mom likes the quality of this lipstick- it has some sheen to it and makes her lips feel moist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have anything negative to say about the product or the packaging.</li>
            <li> Been using this shade of lipstick for years only to have Revlon drop it from this area and so I&#x27;ve hunted it down time and again.  Found a new source for buying it through Amazon...whee!</li>
            <li> This discontinued color is clearly a show-stopper. My mother and I have used this color since the dawn of time and we literally have people catching us dead in our tracks to ask us what color we are wearing. It&#x27;s simply gorgeous and an evening out with your hair/makeup all done up right wearing this color makes you shine like no other! Thank me now for all the heads you will be turning to look your way ~ it&#x27;s nothing short of perfection and you can only buy it from a 3rd party since it&#x27;s completely out of commission in retail. Buy it now before they are all gone!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find this anywhere, they said it was discontinued, I think it was a little pricy, but it is still great.</li>
            <li> just what I expected,quick delivery! Great treat to find it since it is out of the department stores.I will be back for more.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this lipstick that you can not find in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> This lipstick has been my favorite for years.  Everyone always comments about how great I look when I wear this color.  Other&lt;br /&gt;friends have tried it and just don&#x27;t have the same result.  My skin color is perfect for this lipstick.</li>
            <li> This is my very favorite lipstick color and couldn&#x27;t find a satisfactory substitute when Avon discontinued it. I am so glad Amazon has them. I can&#x27;t tell any difference between these and a &amp;#34;brand new&amp;#34; lipstick you buy at the drugstore. I&#x27;d better hurry and get some more before they are gone!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 91 year old senior friend because this is her favorite lipstick and her favorite shade..</li>
            <li> This is my Mom&#x27;s favorite shade of lipstick.  It is very hard to find!  Thank you for making it available!</li>
            <li> Love this color.....hard to find anymore as it was discontinued.</li>
            <li> This lipstick has been discontinued and I have not been able to find a similar color in new lipsticks - so I&#x27;m very happy that Amazon. com had a few left in stock.  They should last me for a few years.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, one of the two lipsticks I ordered looked old &amp; partially melted. It broke inside the tube when  I tried to use it. I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> So happy to get this shade after 50 years.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years. The order that I request from you is because Revlon discontinued this shade. and I LOVE this color.  So keep it in stock for me.  Do you have any left? I will take it...</li>
            <li> Revlon&#x27;s lipsticks are always fantastic.  This shade is described as lilac champagne but it&#x27;s actually a hot bubblegum pink, and really pretty!  But it&#x27;s definitely not lilac.</li>
            <li> This is  fine lipstick, and the color is great and looks lovely, smooth and stays on, passed this on to a friend,&lt;br /&gt;who will order it also.  thank you</li>
            <li> The picture it looks like it has a lighter peachish undertones to the pink lipstick. It arrive quickly it goes on so smooth. my lips feel great but It&#x27;s a very pink color looking at the color it looks like an obnoxious 80&#x27;s pink. The color goes on and isn&#x27;t so obnoxious as it looks on but is still a very pink color. I&#x27;m not sure what I think of this color on me because I&#x27;m a pale redhead with yellow undertones. It would probably look fantastic on someone with darker skin tones or even pink undertones.</li>
            <li> This is an old color that is hard to find. My elderly aunt used it until she died at 94. I&#x27;d like to do the same.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my Aunt that could no longer find it in the stores in her area.  She couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
