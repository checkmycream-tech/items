    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The Schick blades provide virtually perfect shaves for over a week and continue to do so until, I don&#x27;t know, the blades just sort of quit.</li>
            <li>Probably the best blades I used so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This has to be the best razor I have ever used!</li>
            <li>The 4 blade Schick gives a perfect shave.</li>
            <li>The blades gave me an excellent shave.  </li>
            <li>Also, the price was great!</li>
            <li>All in all, he is very happy with them</li>
            <li>but I can say is that 2 years into my quest for finding the perfect blade.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Excellent blades.</li>
            <li>Quattro Titanium blades, however, are very impressive.  </li>
            <li>These blades are perfect.  </li>
            <li>Best Blade Ever.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Almost always the best price and best service</li>
            <li>My fianc√©e has been using these blades for years, so I already knew they were good!</li>
            <li>I got a good deal is what I got!</li>
            <li>I know this is a great item (titanium) but</li>
            <li>Great value.</li>
            <li>Work great.</li>
            <li>Also, Amazon has great prices on the Quattro bladfes.</li>
            <li>and I am happy with the price on amazon.</li>
            <li>Great value and a close shave</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to guess he&#x27;s happy.  </li>
            <li>He was happy, and so am I.</li>
            <li>Great value...</li>
            <li>Great product - great price.</li>
            <li>The price is good on these, but I ordered once</li>
            <li>As the product is a good product either way, I gave it a 2 star instead of a 1 star rating.</li>
            <li>Just be prepared to shell out a good amount of money for a 4 pack every month if you have any kind of beard growth.</li>
            <li>The L&#x27;Occitane shaving cream is pretty awesome so give that a try.</li>
            <li>Not to mention, we got the boxes with 2 more bonus cartridges in them (yay!), totaling 12 in this purchase.</li>
            <li>These blades are everything they are advertised to be and more!  </li>
            <li>The price for this pack is good &amp; I always love the Quattro blades.</li>
            <li>I even prefer these to a safety razor, go ahead and buy them from Amazon, great price, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be pleased.</li>
            <li>The great news is that received bonus packs that were actually 6 packs, (not 4) which made this a very good deal!</li>
            <li>The 5th trimmer blade is handy, too.  </li>
            <li>These cartridges are a great way of getting a clean close shave without nicks and razor burns.</li>
            <li>This is definitely the best price for these razors, and it&#x27;s not the off brand, it&#x27;s the real deal! :D</li>
            <li>Very good product at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Best razor blades I have found so far.  </li>
            <li>These blades are by far the best on the market.</li>
            <li>good clean shave with these blands</li>
            <li>(I haven&#x27;t done the Schick/Gillette test again, however, so I can&#x27;t be sure they didn&#x27;t take my advice.)    </li>
            <li>Nice and smooth shave....</li>
            <li>I have these on auto order and have always been pleased with the quality.  </li>
            <li>With Amazon the price makes them worthwhile.</li>
            <li>I read all these reviews and really was happy that I had just bought this product.</li>
            <li>I travel, I make sure to take my Quattro:</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m sure I will like it if I get a chance an see a need</li>
            <li>When it comes to razors I&#x27;ve tried them all, as most guys have</li>
            <li>and I definitely know these are the best.</li>
            <li>The titanium blades last the longest and give the best shave without nicks,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll type more because my review has to be longer.</li>
            <li>He gets many many uses out of each cartridge (he changes like every 8 weeks, maybe even longer?).</li>
            <li>But for shaving, he insists that he gets these :)    </li>
            <li>It turns out that 3 may be a magic number.</li>
            <li>that means there will be 8 - COUNT &#x27;EM, EIGHT (8) - CARTRIDGES.  </li>
            <li>I used to buy a bag of cheapie BIC razors but they always pulled and never lasted for more than a couple of shaves.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;d rather buy them in the store and pay more knowing where they came from.</li>
            <li>Glad I risked it.</li>
            <li>non-stick) coating make all the difference; it&#x27;s better living through science!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do like the razor blade on top, makes shaving under my nose a lot easier.</li>
            <li>Subscribe and save even more and have automatic delivery just when you need them.</li>
            <li>The Titanium ones are better than the cheaper Schick blades.</li>
            <li>Even after 6 months it was still better.</li>
            <li>I go through a cartridge a week so that would be perfect, especially not to have to worry about running out.  </li>
            <li>I just ordered 2 more in hopes that they are 6 packs as well.</li>
            <li>Much better price than in the store.</li>
            <li>to add six more words.</li>
            <li>The process is a lot slower, with three or four passes, and if you try to hurry, you will bleed even more.  </li>
            <li>better than the newer blades.</li>
            <li>Nice clean shave, no nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li>I embarked on a months long effort to find the best razor/blade combination.  </li>
            <li>It would be an impossibility for me to recommend the Quattro Titanium blades more strongly than I do.</li>
            <li>I have been a Gillette user for more than 10 years and bought this after I tried my free razor from Schick.</li>
            <li>If you want a really good shave and a really lower price, give these a try.</li>
            <li>The combination of the razor and the blades makes for easy shaving.</li>
            <li>I love these Schick blades because they give me a lot of smooth pain free shaves.</li>
            <li>They are worth the 15% more cost for the 3000% better product.</li>
            <li>Glides easily, ages well.</li>
            <li>The blades come in an easy to use safety plastic case that you can throw in your bag or drawer.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li>From many years of trying I am very sure there is no other blade better than these on the market at this time.</li>
            <li>I thought these might be extra awesome because of the Titanium Coated Blades, but really I didn&#x27;t notice a difference and if anything I got more ingrown hairs, but that could have just been a fluke.  </li>
            <li>They are fine.</li>
            <li>Works fine.  </li>
            <li>At best, the shave is incredibly close, but for me, that almost always results in a bunch of tiny scabs where any small bumps in my skin are sheared off.  </li>
            <li>The titanium quatro version is by far the best razor I&#x27;ve used in nearly 19 yrs of shaving.</li>
            <li>These blades are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy saving money.     </li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, I am happy to say that I no longer look for the next, great thing to suddenly show up in the shaving aisle.</li>
            <li>Enjoy...</li>
            <li>I got a free Schick razor and 2 blades, and I have changed and never looked back.&lt;br /&gt;SCHICK</li>
            <li>I received a schick razor for free as a promotion and decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>They give you a close smooth shave and the blades</li>
            <li>do really get a nice shave out of it, and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>(when you get free shipping).</li>
            <li>3 as they&#x27;re now up to about $3.30 per cartridge when sold without free Prime shipping.  </li>
            <li>These Quattro&#x27;s come to $2.06 per cartridge since they ship free with Prime.  </li>
            <li>that does seem to be more of a gimmick than a useful feature, and I wish they&#x27;d make a titanuim blade without</li>
            <li>Incredibly smooth shave</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying the 2x4 packages on Subscribe &amp; Save, but I now see that the 8 packs are available at a $2.15 each, even without the S&amp;S.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve also spent a fair amount of time trying to perfect a double-edge shave, with some top-of-the-line Euro, US and Japanese razors and a variety of well-regarded blades.  </li>
            <li>But I am very picky about my online experiences shopping and love my Amazon:)</li>
            <li>A great product that stays sharp longer and feels much more comfortable than your run of the mill shave.  </li>
            <li>Sounds too good to be true, but their commercials are pretty funny.  </li>
            <li>My husband uses these razor blades and has a clean, smooth, close shave every time.</li>
            <li>So it is the original.  </li>
            <li>Instead of more bells and whistles focus on effective blades that last longer.</li>
            <li>Clean shave every time.</li>
            <li>Good Quality, doesn&#x27;t last any longer then the Mach 3&#x27;s do though.</li>
            <li>think it&#x27;s worth it to upgrade to a 5 blade system, but since these replacements are so much cheaper, it&#x27;s probably a better call.</li>
            <li>Time for a quick changeover.</li>
            <li>I find they cut super close</li>
            <li>I have long been searching for a shaving system capable of delivering what I believed a myth: The very close, very comfortable and, of paramount importance, very effective blade</li>
            <li>They stay sharp for many shaves and do a fast good job.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, long lasting razor blades.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended product!!!</li>
            <li>If you have a Schick razor,this is the blade to go with,keeps a good edge for a long time,Great blade!!</li>
            <li>the shave is equal, with the nice bonus of the edge trimmer, and   2)</li>
            <li>Whereas I could only get 2-3 comfortable shaves from the Fusion, I can use the Q Titaniums for a week or more.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t tell that the Fusion Proglide Power is any better than the Mach3 Sensitive.  </li>
            <li>Everything is fine, please don&#x27;t ask for long dissertations on a review, Amazon, I have better things to do.</li>
            <li>Easily snap the handle into a new blade when it&#x27;s time.</li>
            <li>They have one more blade per cartridge than the Xtreme, but cost more than a $1 less per cartridge?  </li>
            <li>Generally speaking 4 is better than 3 and this is the one everybody should have.  </li>
            <li>excellent quality titanium razors that stay sharp for long time.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try Quattro titanium blade because I was wearing through the original variety at a pretty fast pace.</li>
            <li>I got using the Titanium was very close, very comfortable and utterly effective; an unbelievable shave, and I have to shave every morning</li>
            <li>I really like how it also has an edger, which is really good for keeping a mustache within military regulations (I was in ROTC).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that I can get a very comfortable shave for 2 weeks of daily use.</li>
            <li>You can save even more and buy a seemingly identical cartridge at Costco stores under the Edge Brand name, complete with a nice shiny black metal</li>
            <li>About 5 years ago, when the quattro first came out, I did an experiment.</li>
            <li>The razors are great and last a long time, but do not buy this item on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This most recent shipment has a problem.  </li>
            <li>The titanium blades stay sharper longer, but as such cost a bit more.</li>
            <li>You get a consistent shave</li>
            <li>I got exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>SHAVE AFTER A SHOWER, OR PUT A HOT WASHCLOTH ON YOUR FACE FOR</li>
            <li>/&gt;that could give me better result for lesser price.</li>
            <li>likely to buy again when I need more</li>
            <li>My husband is required to be clean shaved for work and has very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Not only is the shave superior, but the blades last forever.  </li>
            <li>My first blade has lasted much longer than Gillette and hence I am now a schick customer.</li>
            <li>Ordered this item, because have been using Schick for a long time and absolutely love them.</li>
            <li>Gave a close shave as good if not better than the competition.</li>
            <li>Only gripe is that hair can get stuck in between the blades quite easy.</li>
            <li>Hardly ever a nick or bump shaving in the shower after a preliminary dry shave with an excellent Panasonic ES8249S.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After using many other brands, my husband is using Schick Quattro titanium since they first introduced them to the market.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very rare that I cut myself shaving now - much less frequent than with the old Gillette Contour blades, so the protective ribs across the front of the razor seem to be quite effective.  </li>
            <li>but since you buy 4 and get 2 extra free you really cant complain.</li>
            <li>It worked really well and continues to do so.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, I can now comfortably shave in almost any direction and regularly shave with, across and against the grain without suffering burn or bumps.</li>
            <li>Buy them and set up the automatic ship feature, as the price is much lower; not to mention the convenience.</li>
            <li>and they don&#x27;t snag or cause much (if any) razor burn.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>The razor was solid and comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>I tried them all and really like the Fusion...until I tried the Quattro Titaniums.  </li>
            <li>It grows fast</li>
            <li>They are very durable.</li>
            <li>My husband went through this pack really fast and didn&#x27;t care for them at all.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price.</li>
            <li>3 MINUTES&lt;br /&gt;3.) INVEST IN A SHAVE BRUSH &amp; REAL SHAVE CREAM&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;The blades seem to hold up much longer than competing brands,</li>
            <li>/&gt;Recommended if you value longevity over absolute keenness in your razor blades.</li>
            <li>Even now I find myself running my palm over my face, marvelling at how smooth it is after my daily morning shave.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to the Subscribe and save program on Amazon, it is a lot cheaper than purchasing at walmart.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>bought them from Amazon and as always my shipment arrived on time and was packaged very well with no problem.  </li>
            <li>This review is going to be extremely short because honestly the only thing to say is.</li>
            <li>a relative bargain at $2.32 each on Amazon (compared to $2.90 for the Mach3 Sensitive and $4 for Fusion Proglide Power cartridges, which don&#x27;t perform any better for me).  </li>
            <li>I wanted to see how long one of these would last and still be better than a new cheap disposable blade.</li>
            <li>Stays sharp 10+ shaves, cheaper than the competition, and the edger blade seems to work better than the competition&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I love this blade and prefer it over the other brands.</li>
            <li>I prefer the Schick Quattro over many of the other brands.  </li>
            <li>They work well and these were priced at a significant savings vs. the local drug store.</li>
            <li>In the review that I wrote here, I suggested that Schick should market a cheaper blade that&#x27;s just as good as the Gillette blade, and then advertise the more expensive Quattro, priced comparably to the Mach3, as lasting 40% longer.     </li>
            <li>I really like how the new titanium blades feel.</li>
            <li>No one has even touched on the main reason I think alot of people will buy this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>highly recommended.</li>
            <li>A high quality blade although I deem it overpriced</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this</li>
            <li>The trade-off in immediate sharpness for longer life is a good one since the normal blades loose their edge in less than a weeks time</li>
            <li>so many, I had become convinced that Gillette products were the best one could expect; something which my face hated and constantly argued against.</li>
            <li>We normally buy these online because the stores don&#x27;t always carry them.</li>
            <li>Finally got to giving it a try and found the shave was good if not better than the ones I got from the 5 blade ones from the &amp;#34;G&amp;#34; blade company at a lot lower price.</li>
            <li>It feels like a smooth plastic rod rather than sharp metal.  </li>
            <li>The blade works OK the first few seconds, and once the gap is plugged up, the blade simply skids over my chin and cheeks.</li>
            <li>&quot; I decided to break protocol and give Schick&#x27;s new offering a chance which resulted in a paradigm shift in a long-held belief</li>
            <li>Face it, razor companies make their money when you buy new blades.</li>
            <li>The new edging blade is supposed to make this the fusion with out the price.</li>
            <li>I use a new one every 2 months though.</li>
            <li>all I can say is these blades (though I do not think the advert is for these blades) live up to that</li>
            <li>Provides a clean and close shave comparable to that of the Fusion for roughly 2/3rds of the price.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin; the sort that has to be treated with moisturizer as soon as I&#x27;m done shaving (or else my face turns into leather.)  </li>
            <li>Reluctantly tried these and was extremely pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li>First time I used this got a big cut.</li>
            <li>Replaces easily with little effort.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve  had enough of Gillettes policy of introducing new product and maintaining high prices on the older blades.</li>
            <li>You could tell they were The blades were actually cheap and did not last very long.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more, the titanium blades last much longer and are second only to a straight razor (which I can&#x27;t use in my dorm due to anti-weapons policies...)</li>
            <li>these are decent razors, ive tried several different types, these do &amp;#34;tug&amp;#34; slightly slightly more than other blades ive tried</li>
            <li>I generally shave every other day (or more frequently), and these blades are easily lasting 2-3 weeks each.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s more profit if they get dull sooner.    </li>
            <li>I had gone back to safety razors, old school, but nothing beats the modern razors.</li>
            <li>I get some nicks with the old razors.</li>
            <li>This Quattro Titanium lasts much longer than the regular Quattro.</li>
            <li>I feel like its tucked too far in the head of the razor</li>
            <li>This razor, the Quattro, is absolutely unsurpassed, in my experience, in providing as close a shave as physically possible WITHOUT razor burn, nicks, or cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shave is nowhere near as close as with the Mach 3.</li>
            <li>really because I don&#x27;t read anything but English.</li>
            <li>i have sensitive skin, close shave without the bumps.</li>
            <li>Was pleasantly surprised to get 2 bonus cartridges per pack.</li>
            <li>These blades are worth the extra money over the regular Quatro blades.  </li>
            <li>The titanium version last much longer over all, but they seem slightly less sharp right out of the box than the original.</li>
            <li>It still gives me an extremely close, comfortable shave, regardless of whether I use commercial canned or tube shaving cream or old-fashioned brush lather.</li>
            <li>Even though it sounded like a good idea when they first came out, the Gillette power razors make make enough noise that you can&#x27;t hear if you&#x27;re cutting stubble and doesn&#x27;t seem to improve the shave in speed, comfort, or closeness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The seller sent 1 package that contained 4 Quattro Titanium cartridges \\&quot;with edging blades\\&quot; as shown in the photograph; however, the second package was an older model of the Quattro Titanum razor blade that does not have the \\&quot;edging blade\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I really do like having pretty high-end razors to shave with, and they shave really well and last a really long time, but man, couldn&#x27;t the price come down a bit on all razors, not just these Quatto</li>
            <li>I even tried the 5 blade gilette once, but concluded that it was no more than a gimmick without any significant inprovement in shave</li>
            <li>SHAVE LIGHTLY TWICE INSTEAD OF PRESSING TOO HARD ONCE&lt;</li>
            <li>the past I have used a straight razor, double sided single blade &amp; twin blades as well as several different types of electric razors and Quattro is my favorite</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the Schick razors last 2-3 times longer than Gillette&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Since we are all in the same boat, you can get 8-10 shaves out of QUATTRO Ti cartridges by using these adult shaving tips:&lt;br /&gt;1.)</li>
            <li>the only one so far that works for me.</li>
            <li>Is consistent when shaving up or down.</li>
            <li>and they don&#x27;t seem to come as sharp as they do from the grocery store or large retailer.  </li>
            <li>I was, maybe, able to get four out of a Gillette before my face and, especially my neck, resembled a constellation of red bumps along with the day-long agony of serious razor burn.</li>
            <li>So far, my Schick Quattro Titanium blades are lasting nearly twice as long as my experience with the Gillette Fusion.</li>
            <li>However, they keep their sharpness for much, much longer (I can get 45-60 days per blade, shaving every other day).</li>
            <li>I have to be careful to switch them at the first sign of drag.&lt;br /&gt;They are incredibly sharp, cheaper than Brand G., and provide an almost unbeatable shave.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> The Schick blades provide virtually perfect shaves for over a week and continue to do so until, I don&#x27;t know, the blades just sort of quit.</li>
            <li> Probably the best blades I used so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This has to be the best razor I have ever used!</li>
            <li> The 4 blade Schick gives a perfect shave.</li>
            <li> The blades gave me an excellent shave.  </li>
            <li> Also, the price was great!</li>
            <li> All in all, he is very happy with them</li>
            <li> but I can say is that 2 years into my quest for finding the perfect blade.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Excellent blades.</li>
            <li> Quattro Titanium blades, however, are very impressive.  </li>
            <li> These blades are perfect.  </li>
            <li> Best Blade Ever.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Almost always the best price and best service</li>
            <li> My fianc√©e has been using these blades for years, so I already knew they were good!</li>
            <li> I got a good deal is what I got!</li>
            <li> I know this is a great item (titanium) but</li>
            <li> Great value.</li>
            <li> Work great.</li>
            <li> Also, Amazon has great prices on the Quattro bladfes.</li>
            <li> and I am happy with the price on amazon.</li>
            <li> Great value and a close shave</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to guess he&#x27;s happy.  </li>
            <li> He was happy, and so am I.</li>
            <li> Great value...</li>
            <li> Great product - great price.</li>
            <li> The price is good on these, but I ordered once</li>
            <li> As the product is a good product either way, I gave it a 2 star instead of a 1 star rating.</li>
            <li> Just be prepared to shell out a good amount of money for a 4 pack every month if you have any kind of beard growth.</li>
            <li> The L&#x27;Occitane shaving cream is pretty awesome so give that a try.</li>
            <li> Not to mention, we got the boxes with 2 more bonus cartridges in them (yay!), totaling 12 in this purchase.</li>
            <li> These blades are everything they are advertised to be and more!  </li>
            <li> The price for this pack is good &amp; I always love the Quattro blades.</li>
            <li> I even prefer these to a safety razor, go ahead and buy them from Amazon, great price, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be pleased.</li>
            <li> The great news is that received bonus packs that were actually 6 packs, (not 4) which made this a very good deal!</li>
            <li> The 5th trimmer blade is handy, too.  </li>
            <li> These cartridges are a great way of getting a clean close shave without nicks and razor burns.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best price for these razors, and it&#x27;s not the off brand, it&#x27;s the real deal! :D</li>
            <li> Very good product at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> Best razor blades I have found so far.  </li>
            <li> These blades are by far the best on the market.</li>
            <li> good clean shave with these blands</li>
            <li> (I haven&#x27;t done the Schick/Gillette test again, however, so I can&#x27;t be sure they didn&#x27;t take my advice.)    </li>
            <li> Nice and smooth shave....</li>
            <li> I have these on auto order and have always been pleased with the quality.  </li>
            <li> With Amazon the price makes them worthwhile.</li>
            <li> I read all these reviews and really was happy that I had just bought this product.</li>
            <li> I travel, I make sure to take my Quattro:</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m sure I will like it if I get a chance an see a need</li>
            <li> When it comes to razors I&#x27;ve tried them all, as most guys have</li>
            <li> and I definitely know these are the best.</li>
            <li> The titanium blades last the longest and give the best shave without nicks,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll type more because my review has to be longer.</li>
            <li> He gets many many uses out of each cartridge (he changes like every 8 weeks, maybe even longer?).</li>
            <li> But for shaving, he insists that he gets these :)    </li>
            <li> It turns out that 3 may be a magic number.</li>
            <li> that means there will be 8 - COUNT &#x27;EM, EIGHT (8) - CARTRIDGES.  </li>
            <li> I used to buy a bag of cheapie BIC razors but they always pulled and never lasted for more than a couple of shaves.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;d rather buy them in the store and pay more knowing where they came from.</li>
            <li> Glad I risked it.</li>
            <li> non-stick) coating make all the difference; it&#x27;s better living through science!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do like the razor blade on top, makes shaving under my nose a lot easier.</li>
            <li> Subscribe and save even more and have automatic delivery just when you need them.</li>
            <li> The Titanium ones are better than the cheaper Schick blades.</li>
            <li> Even after 6 months it was still better.</li>
            <li> I go through a cartridge a week so that would be perfect, especially not to have to worry about running out.  </li>
            <li> I just ordered 2 more in hopes that they are 6 packs as well.</li>
            <li> Much better price than in the store.</li>
            <li> to add six more words.</li>
            <li> The process is a lot slower, with three or four passes, and if you try to hurry, you will bleed even more.  </li>
            <li> better than the newer blades.</li>
            <li> Nice clean shave, no nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li> I embarked on a months long effort to find the best razor/blade combination.  </li>
            <li> It would be an impossibility for me to recommend the Quattro Titanium blades more strongly than I do.</li>
            <li> I have been a Gillette user for more than 10 years and bought this after I tried my free razor from Schick.</li>
            <li> If you want a really good shave and a really lower price, give these a try.</li>
            <li> The combination of the razor and the blades makes for easy shaving.</li>
            <li> I love these Schick blades because they give me a lot of smooth pain free shaves.</li>
            <li> They are worth the 15% more cost for the 3000% better product.</li>
            <li> Glides easily, ages well.</li>
            <li> The blades come in an easy to use safety plastic case that you can throw in your bag or drawer.</li>
            <li> Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li> From many years of trying I am very sure there is no other blade better than these on the market at this time.</li>
            <li> I thought these might be extra awesome because of the Titanium Coated Blades, but really I didn&#x27;t notice a difference and if anything I got more ingrown hairs, but that could have just been a fluke.  </li>
            <li> They are fine.</li>
            <li> Works fine.  </li>
            <li> At best, the shave is incredibly close, but for me, that almost always results in a bunch of tiny scabs where any small bumps in my skin are sheared off.  </li>
            <li> The titanium quatro version is by far the best razor I&#x27;ve used in nearly 19 yrs of shaving.</li>
            <li> These blades are fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy saving money.     </li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, I am happy to say that I no longer look for the next, great thing to suddenly show up in the shaving aisle.</li>
            <li> Enjoy...</li>
            <li> I got a free Schick razor and 2 blades, and I have changed and never looked back.&lt;br /&gt;SCHICK</li>
            <li> I received a schick razor for free as a promotion and decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> They give you a close smooth shave and the blades</li>
            <li> do really get a nice shave out of it, and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> (when you get free shipping).</li>
            <li> 3 as they&#x27;re now up to about $3.30 per cartridge when sold without free Prime shipping.  </li>
            <li> These Quattro&#x27;s come to $2.06 per cartridge since they ship free with Prime.  </li>
            <li> that does seem to be more of a gimmick than a useful feature, and I wish they&#x27;d make a titanuim blade without</li>
            <li> Incredibly smooth shave</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying the 2x4 packages on Subscribe &amp; Save, but I now see that the 8 packs are available at a $2.15 each, even without the S&amp;S.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also spent a fair amount of time trying to perfect a double-edge shave, with some top-of-the-line Euro, US and Japanese razors and a variety of well-regarded blades.  </li>
            <li> But I am very picky about my online experiences shopping and love my Amazon:)</li>
            <li> A great product that stays sharp longer and feels much more comfortable than your run of the mill shave.  </li>
            <li> Sounds too good to be true, but their commercials are pretty funny.  </li>
            <li> My husband uses these razor blades and has a clean, smooth, close shave every time.</li>
            <li> So it is the original.  </li>
            <li> Instead of more bells and whistles focus on effective blades that last longer.</li>
            <li> Clean shave every time.</li>
            <li> Good Quality, doesn&#x27;t last any longer then the Mach 3&#x27;s do though.</li>
            <li> think it&#x27;s worth it to upgrade to a 5 blade system, but since these replacements are so much cheaper, it&#x27;s probably a better call.</li>
            <li> Time for a quick changeover.</li>
            <li> I find they cut super close</li>
            <li> I have long been searching for a shaving system capable of delivering what I believed a myth: The very close, very comfortable and, of paramount importance, very effective blade</li>
            <li> They stay sharp for many shaves and do a fast good job.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, long lasting razor blades.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended product!!!</li>
            <li> If you have a Schick razor,this is the blade to go with,keeps a good edge for a long time,Great blade!!</li>
            <li> the shave is equal, with the nice bonus of the edge trimmer, and   2)</li>
            <li> Whereas I could only get 2-3 comfortable shaves from the Fusion, I can use the Q Titaniums for a week or more.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t tell that the Fusion Proglide Power is any better than the Mach3 Sensitive.  </li>
            <li> Everything is fine, please don&#x27;t ask for long dissertations on a review, Amazon, I have better things to do.</li>
            <li> Easily snap the handle into a new blade when it&#x27;s time.</li>
            <li> They have one more blade per cartridge than the Xtreme, but cost more than a $1 less per cartridge?  </li>
            <li> Generally speaking 4 is better than 3 and this is the one everybody should have.  </li>
            <li> excellent quality titanium razors that stay sharp for long time.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try Quattro titanium blade because I was wearing through the original variety at a pretty fast pace.</li>
            <li> I got using the Titanium was very close, very comfortable and utterly effective; an unbelievable shave, and I have to shave every morning</li>
            <li> I really like how it also has an edger, which is really good for keeping a mustache within military regulations (I was in ROTC).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that I can get a very comfortable shave for 2 weeks of daily use.</li>
            <li> You can save even more and buy a seemingly identical cartridge at Costco stores under the Edge Brand name, complete with a nice shiny black metal</li>
            <li> About 5 years ago, when the quattro first came out, I did an experiment.</li>
            <li> The razors are great and last a long time, but do not buy this item on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This most recent shipment has a problem.  </li>
            <li> The titanium blades stay sharper longer, but as such cost a bit more.</li>
            <li> You get a consistent shave</li>
            <li> I got exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> SHAVE AFTER A SHOWER, OR PUT A HOT WASHCLOTH ON YOUR FACE FOR</li>
            <li> /&gt;that could give me better result for lesser price.</li>
            <li> likely to buy again when I need more</li>
            <li> My husband is required to be clean shaved for work and has very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Not only is the shave superior, but the blades last forever.  </li>
            <li> My first blade has lasted much longer than Gillette and hence I am now a schick customer.</li>
            <li> Ordered this item, because have been using Schick for a long time and absolutely love them.</li>
            <li> Gave a close shave as good if not better than the competition.</li>
            <li> Only gripe is that hair can get stuck in between the blades quite easy.</li>
            <li> Hardly ever a nick or bump shaving in the shower after a preliminary dry shave with an excellent Panasonic ES8249S.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using many other brands, my husband is using Schick Quattro titanium since they first introduced them to the market.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very rare that I cut myself shaving now - much less frequent than with the old Gillette Contour blades, so the protective ribs across the front of the razor seem to be quite effective.  </li>
            <li> but since you buy 4 and get 2 extra free you really cant complain.</li>
            <li> It worked really well and continues to do so.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, I can now comfortably shave in almost any direction and regularly shave with, across and against the grain without suffering burn or bumps.</li>
            <li> Buy them and set up the automatic ship feature, as the price is much lower; not to mention the convenience.</li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t snag or cause much (if any) razor burn.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> The razor was solid and comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> I tried them all and really like the Fusion...until I tried the Quattro Titaniums.  </li>
            <li> It grows fast</li>
            <li> They are very durable.</li>
            <li> My husband went through this pack really fast and didn&#x27;t care for them at all.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price.</li>
            <li> 3 MINUTES&lt;br /&gt;3.) INVEST IN A SHAVE BRUSH &amp; REAL SHAVE CREAM&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;The blades seem to hold up much longer than competing brands,</li>
            <li> /&gt;Recommended if you value longevity over absolute keenness in your razor blades.</li>
            <li> Even now I find myself running my palm over my face, marvelling at how smooth it is after my daily morning shave.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to the Subscribe and save program on Amazon, it is a lot cheaper than purchasing at walmart.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> bought them from Amazon and as always my shipment arrived on time and was packaged very well with no problem.  </li>
            <li> This review is going to be extremely short because honestly the only thing to say is.</li>
            <li> a relative bargain at $2.32 each on Amazon (compared to $2.90 for the Mach3 Sensitive and $4 for Fusion Proglide Power cartridges, which don&#x27;t perform any better for me).  </li>
            <li> I wanted to see how long one of these would last and still be better than a new cheap disposable blade.</li>
            <li> Stays sharp 10+ shaves, cheaper than the competition, and the edger blade seems to work better than the competition&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I love this blade and prefer it over the other brands.</li>
            <li> I prefer the Schick Quattro over many of the other brands.  </li>
            <li> They work well and these were priced at a significant savings vs. the local drug store.</li>
            <li> In the review that I wrote here, I suggested that Schick should market a cheaper blade that&#x27;s just as good as the Gillette blade, and then advertise the more expensive Quattro, priced comparably to the Mach3, as lasting 40% longer.     </li>
            <li> I really like how the new titanium blades feel.</li>
            <li> No one has even touched on the main reason I think alot of people will buy this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> highly recommended.</li>
            <li> A high quality blade although I deem it overpriced</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this</li>
            <li> The trade-off in immediate sharpness for longer life is a good one since the normal blades loose their edge in less than a weeks time</li>
            <li> so many, I had become convinced that Gillette products were the best one could expect; something which my face hated and constantly argued against.</li>
            <li> We normally buy these online because the stores don&#x27;t always carry them.</li>
            <li> Finally got to giving it a try and found the shave was good if not better than the ones I got from the 5 blade ones from the &amp;#34;G&amp;#34; blade company at a lot lower price.</li>
            <li> It feels like a smooth plastic rod rather than sharp metal.  </li>
            <li> The blade works OK the first few seconds, and once the gap is plugged up, the blade simply skids over my chin and cheeks.</li>
            <li> &quot; I decided to break protocol and give Schick&#x27;s new offering a chance which resulted in a paradigm shift in a long-held belief</li>
            <li> Face it, razor companies make their money when you buy new blades.</li>
            <li> The new edging blade is supposed to make this the fusion with out the price.</li>
            <li> I use a new one every 2 months though.</li>
            <li> all I can say is these blades (though I do not think the advert is for these blades) live up to that</li>
            <li> Provides a clean and close shave comparable to that of the Fusion for roughly 2/3rds of the price.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin; the sort that has to be treated with moisturizer as soon as I&#x27;m done shaving (or else my face turns into leather.)  </li>
            <li> Reluctantly tried these and was extremely pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li> First time I used this got a big cut.</li>
            <li> Replaces easily with little effort.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  had enough of Gillettes policy of introducing new product and maintaining high prices on the older blades.</li>
            <li> You could tell they were The blades were actually cheap and did not last very long.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s more, the titanium blades last much longer and are second only to a straight razor (which I can&#x27;t use in my dorm due to anti-weapons policies...)</li>
            <li> these are decent razors, ive tried several different types, these do &amp;#34;tug&amp;#34; slightly slightly more than other blades ive tried</li>
            <li> I generally shave every other day (or more frequently), and these blades are easily lasting 2-3 weeks each.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s more profit if they get dull sooner.    </li>
            <li> I had gone back to safety razors, old school, but nothing beats the modern razors.</li>
            <li> I get some nicks with the old razors.</li>
            <li> This Quattro Titanium lasts much longer than the regular Quattro.</li>
            <li> I feel like its tucked too far in the head of the razor</li>
            <li> This razor, the Quattro, is absolutely unsurpassed, in my experience, in providing as close a shave as physically possible WITHOUT razor burn, nicks, or cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shave is nowhere near as close as with the Mach 3.</li>
            <li> really because I don&#x27;t read anything but English.</li>
            <li> i have sensitive skin, close shave without the bumps.</li>
            <li> Was pleasantly surprised to get 2 bonus cartridges per pack.</li>
            <li> These blades are worth the extra money over the regular Quatro blades.  </li>
            <li> The titanium version last much longer over all, but they seem slightly less sharp right out of the box than the original.</li>
            <li> It still gives me an extremely close, comfortable shave, regardless of whether I use commercial canned or tube shaving cream or old-fashioned brush lather.</li>
            <li> Even though it sounded like a good idea when they first came out, the Gillette power razors make make enough noise that you can&#x27;t hear if you&#x27;re cutting stubble and doesn&#x27;t seem to improve the shave in speed, comfort, or closeness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The seller sent 1 package that contained 4 Quattro Titanium cartridges \\&quot;with edging blades\\&quot; as shown in the photograph; however, the second package was an older model of the Quattro Titanum razor blade that does not have the \\&quot;edging blade\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I really do like having pretty high-end razors to shave with, and they shave really well and last a really long time, but man, couldn&#x27;t the price come down a bit on all razors, not just these Quatto</li>
            <li> I even tried the 5 blade gilette once, but concluded that it was no more than a gimmick without any significant inprovement in shave</li>
            <li> SHAVE LIGHTLY TWICE INSTEAD OF PRESSING TOO HARD ONCE&lt;</li>
            <li> the past I have used a straight razor, double sided single blade &amp; twin blades as well as several different types of electric razors and Quattro is my favorite</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the Schick razors last 2-3 times longer than Gillette&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since we are all in the same boat, you can get 8-10 shaves out of QUATTRO Ti cartridges by using these adult shaving tips:&lt;br /&gt;1.)</li>
            <li> the only one so far that works for me.</li>
            <li> Is consistent when shaving up or down.</li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t seem to come as sharp as they do from the grocery store or large retailer.  </li>
            <li> I was, maybe, able to get four out of a Gillette before my face and, especially my neck, resembled a constellation of red bumps along with the day-long agony of serious razor burn.</li>
            <li> So far, my Schick Quattro Titanium blades are lasting nearly twice as long as my experience with the Gillette Fusion.</li>
            <li> However, they keep their sharpness for much, much longer (I can get 45-60 days per blade, shaving every other day).</li>
            <li> I have to be careful to switch them at the first sign of drag.&lt;br /&gt;They are incredibly sharp, cheaper than Brand G., and provide an almost unbeatable shave.</li>
            <li> These blades are some of the very few that I can use more than once before they get too dull.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the Fusion blades and they do not last as long as the Quattro&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;These</li>
            <li> They also last an extremely long time.  </li>
            <li> LAST a very long time.</li>
            <li> The fact that he doesn&#x27;t want any other brand means a lot to me because he is so absent minded that he generally doesn&#x27;t know what brand of anything he is using.</li>
            <li> but if you wash and dry the cartridge after every use, it will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> Several of the cartridges had only two blades, plus two empty slots!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found this gives a very close shave without the skin irritation that is common to shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Gilette razor guy for a long time.  </li>
            <li> They are in a different league and I could not imagine using any other blades...until I research again.</li>
            <li> but I only bother to shave every other day.  </li>
            <li> My one complaint though is the extra straight edge blade on the black -</li>
            <li> I tried multiple products from a few different companies and I found that this gave me the cleanest and fastest shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since switched to a single blade razor but</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the single blade on the front edge -</li>
            <li> These blades are coated with Ti to improve coating adhesion and prolong service life.&lt;br /&gt;In practice, the uncoated ones last as long IF they are carefully rinsed, dried, and stored.&lt;br</li>
            <li> He is a teacher and shaves every single day!</li>
            <li> It is perhaps a bit less irritating than the Gillette Mach3 Sensitive, while shaving equally close and lasting 10-14 days (compared to about a week for the Mach3).  </li>
            <li> They seem to last a long time for him and he shaves everyday!</li>
            <li> The blades came as described and work as expected.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to say about the blades themselves, but the seller was spot on with delivery and quality.</li>
            <li> do not fit in existing trays to hold extra blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I specifically expected to get the razors with the edging blade</li>
            <li> Work as expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Italian and I have some thick facial hair, I used to go through a razor every 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty expensive though.</li>
            <li> I like the quattro cartridges over any other shave</li>
            <li> I also have never had them knick from an accidental twitch like other blades do.</li>
            <li> Since he is shaving so often his bread is never too long to trapped between the blades, hence the longer lifetime for the cartridge (just for any other brand).</li>
            <li> Stay sharp longer, shave smoother and nick</li>
            <li> Have to be diligent about rinsing after every swipe and once in a while taking a sharp endded toothpick or something and cleaning this out.</li>
            <li> lotion strips don&#x27;t disintegrate like other g* brand razors.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with buying multiple packs of things you are likely to use regularly.</li>
            <li> Sorry, didn&#x27;t mean to make this a free ad for those guys.  </li>
            <li> Lately though, the costs got to high for me to continue without at least trying other blades.</li>
            <li> If I have a couple of week&#x27;s worth of growth, the hairs all get stuck in the safety wires they put over the blades to keep them from cutting you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gillette&#x27;s razors seem to self destruct so that you are forced to replace regularly.  </li>
            <li> You still need to get a good shaving cream and let it set on your face for a minute or two, don&#x27;t go with those nasty grocery store gels.</li>
            <li> I have a very coarse, thick beard.  </li>
            <li> previous handle came apart after 24</li>
            <li> And after buying all the expensive European creams, soaps,and balms, not to mention the razors, the total cost per shave is no bargain, despite the lower cost of blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He swears they give him a close shave and do not irritate his skin like other razors have in the past.</li>
            <li> owe this to Amazon as I usually make my decisions based on what other people think of the products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> a tad expensive, and spent the next 23 or so months trying to find a product</li>
            <li> This time the box was all dusty and written in Chinese or something.</li>
            <li> This is a very sharp durable cartridge to use!</li>
            <li> That said I get over a month out of a blade before they start missing the small hairs.  </li>
            <li> less, at least on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> negative is the little wires protecting the blades and the blades themselves</li>
            <li> In fact I do very little shopping with anyone else except Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I will but again</li>
            <li> I switched to Schick because I was tired of Gillette&#x27;s pricing and found the 5 blade razor to be too wide.  </li>
            <li> If you want to fake out the MBA&#x27;s at Gillette/P&amp;G who charge $4 bucks a cartridge that only lasts a week, try QUATTRO Titanium.</li>
            <li> I use these blades all the time  but for some reason this lot  seemed dull and pulled a lot which hurt my face.</li>
            <li> The except the edger sucks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another thing of note is (I am not exaggerating at all): There is an advertisement by Schick that talks about \\&quot;hydration where you least expect it\\&quot; and</li>
            <li> He hasn&#x27;t complained so</li>
            <li> I switched to Schick after some bad experience with similar cartridges from another company.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t bad enough that I wouldn&#x27;t get these again if they were cheaper than the women&#x27;s version.</li>
            <li> What I know now is that Gillette is utter crap.</li>
            <li> I am not happy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this product shows a lack of usability study, poor customer service, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With that; I take my shaving very seriously:</li>
            <li> Sorry Gillette,</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s difficult to wash it off.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s wrong with them???</li>
            <li> If I could find one thing wrong with these blades I&#x27;d say so:</li>
            <li> I suspect they were using bad steel.</li>
            <li> Awfully damn expensive.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really do like having pretty high-end razors to shave with, and they shave really well and last a really long time, but man, couldn&#x27;t the price come down a bit on all razors, not just these Quatto Titaniums?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s worth it to upgrade to a 5 blade system, but since these replacements are so much cheaper, it&#x27;s probably a better call.</li>
            <li> The price is good on these, but I ordered once and they don&#x27;t seem to come as sharp as they do from the grocery store or large retailer.  Not sure if I will but again</li>
            <li> what can I  say they are razor blades</li>
            <li> These blades are of the highest quality. I switched to Schick after some bad experience with similar cartridges from another company. I suspect they were using bad steel. I was reluctant to go back to the safety razor after all these years with a cartridge system. So I tried these. They are fine. They stay sharp for many shaves and do a fast good job.</li>
            <li> These blades are fantastic.  They have everything that Gillette Fusion has, but at a lower price.  So far, my Schick Quattro Titanium blades are lasting nearly twice as long as my experience with the Gillette Fusion.</li>
            <li> I have used a Schick Quattro since I started shaving (about 3 years ago).  It worked really well and continues to do so.  What&#x27;s more, the titanium blades last much longer and are second only to a straight razor (which I can&#x27;t use in my dorm due to anti-weapons policies...) in closeness of a shave.  I really like how it also has an edger, which is really good for keeping a mustache within military regulations (I was in ROTC).  A great product that stays sharp longer and feels much more comfortable than your run of the mill shave.  Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li> Feels like butter and the hair comes off in one pass.  It feels like a smooth plastic rod rather than sharp metal.  I&#x27;ve been a big fan of the Schick wires which prevent slicing.  I haven&#x27;t cut myself shaving since I started using them years ago.  The titanium quatro version is by far the best razor I&#x27;ve used in nearly 19 yrs of shaving.</li>
            <li> These blades are some of the very few that I can use more than once before they get too dull.  They&#x27;re pretty expensive though.</li>
            <li> This review is going to be extremely short because honestly the only thing to say is. Buy this shaving system. NOW.   Stays sharp 10+ shaves, cheaper than the competition, and the edger blade seems to work better than the competition&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I had gone back to safety razors, old school, but nothing beats the modern razors. I get some nicks with the old razors. The cartridges are more expensive but if you wash and dry the cartridge after every use, it will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> I know this is a great item (titanium) but upset when supplier substitutes when out of stock. But must admit charged lower price.</li>
            <li> I have been a Gillette user since I started shaving over 30 years ago, moving up as they have improved the shaving experience. Lately though, the costs got to high for me to continue without at least trying other blades. I found the Shick Quatro Titanium about six months ago, at about 25% lower cost. After having continued to use the Schick since then, I have to say that:  1) the shave is equal, with the nice bonus of the edge trimmer, and   2) I enjoy saving money.     Sorry Gillette, but I don&#x27;t think I will ever be coming back.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001E76BG0 Schick Quattro Cartridges, Titanium Coated Blades, 4 cartridges (Pack of 2)]] I have long been searching for a shaving system capable of delivering what I believed a myth: The very close, very comfortable and, of paramount importance, very effective blade cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like so many, I had become convinced that Gillette products were the best one could expect; something which my face hated and constantly argued against. However, caught by the simple, white package and the word \\&quot;titanium,\\&quot; I decided to break protocol and give Schick&#x27;s new offering a chance which resulted in a paradigm shift in a long-held belief structure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave I got using the Titanium was very close, very comfortable and utterly effective; an unbelievable shave, and I have to shave every morning (yep, even weekends). What I know now is that Gillette is utter crap. The Schick blades provide virtually perfect shaves for over a week and continue to do so until, I don&#x27;t know, the blades just sort of quit. Time for a quick changeover. I was, maybe, able to get four out of a Gillette before my face and, especially my neck, resembled a constellation of red bumps along with the day-long agony of serious razor burn. Additionally, I can now comfortably shave in almost any direction and regularly shave with, across and against the grain without suffering burn or bumps. The ability to so closely shave in the morning makes the 5 &#x27;o clock a gratefully forgotten memory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I am happy to say that I no longer look for the next, great thing to suddenly show up in the shaving aisle. It would be an impossibility for me to recommend the Quattro Titanium blades more strongly than I do. Buy them and set up the automatic ship feature, as the price is much lower; not to mention the convenience. Enjoy...</li>
            <li> Switched to the Schick Quattro Titanium blades about a year ago after having been a longtime Gillette man (Fusion and prior iterations).  Just could not stomach the prices Gillette was charging.  Reluctantly tried these and was extremely pleasantly surprised!  Provides a clean and close shave comparable to that of the Fusion for roughly 2/3rds of the price.  Finally, these blades last quite awhile.  I generally shave every other day (or more frequently), and these blades are easily lasting 2-3 weeks each.  Great value.</li>
            <li> Face it, razor companies make their money when you buy new blades. There&#x27;s more profit if they get dull sooner.    About 5 years ago, when the quattro first came out, I did an experiment. I had been a Gillette guy for years and was using a Mach3. I bought the Quattro and used them on alternate days. The Quattro lasted 40% longer.     In the review that I wrote here, I suggested that Schick should market a cheaper blade that&#x27;s just as good as the Gillette blade, and then advertise the more expensive Quattro, priced comparably to the Mach3, as lasting 40% longer.     Well, they seem to have done something like that without any invidious comparisons. This Quattro Titanium lasts much longer than the regular Quattro. (I haven&#x27;t done the Schick/Gillette test again, however, so I can&#x27;t be sure they didn&#x27;t take my advice.)    Maybe not as profitable, but if their aim is to gain market share, it worked for me.</li>
            <li> I ordered the razors and it shows that 2 packs of 4 razors would arrive in the box.  If you do the math $12.76 divided by 8 cartridges you get the advertised $1.60 per cartridge.  There was only one pack of 4 razors in the box and I&#x27;m guessing they do that to confuse people into thinking that they just misread the package.  These are going back immediately.    The razors are great and last a long time, but do not buy this item on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My husband insists on using these razors. He swears they give him a close shave and do not irritate his skin like other razors have in the past. I signed up to have them delivered and with the subscribe and save program so now they come to my house whenever we run out.</li>
            <li> Probably the best blades I used so far.&lt;br /&gt;Shaving with it is a pleasure if you only  could call shaving a pleasure.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time. I see no differnce in quality from the ones I have bought in stores. I will defintely purchase them again.</li>
            <li> I have been a Gillette user for more than 10 years and bought this after I tried my free razor from Schick. It has 5 blades and an extra side blade for trimming which I need. My first blade has lasted much longer than Gillette and hence I am now a schick customer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve re-ordered these blades several times. I find they cut super close and they don&#x27;t snag or cause much (if any) razor burn.</li>
            <li> I love this blade and prefer it over the other brands.</li>
            <li> Ihave been using these cartridges for over ten years. That speaks for itself.</li>
            <li> I obtained a Quattro as part of a product bundle with 16 Energizer AA batteries.  I have used the blade about 15 times, and it just won&#x27;t quit!  It still gives me an extremely close, comfortable shave, regardless of whether I use commercial canned or tube shaving cream or old-fashioned brush lather. This has to be the best razor I have ever used!</li>
            <li> These may be intended for men, but I use them to shave my legs. Work great. The price for this pack is good &amp; I always love the Quattro blades.</li>
            <li> My husband like these blades...Nice and smooth shave....</li>
            <li> I switched to Schick because I was tired of Gillette&#x27;s pricing and found the 5 blade razor to be too wide.  I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the Schick razors last 2-3 times longer than Gillette&#x27;s.  Gillette&#x27;s razors seem to self destruct so that you are forced to replace regularly.  The 4 blade Schick gives a perfect shave.</li>
            <li> I have been using Gillete product for over 50 years. I have been using the Fusion blades and they do not last as long as the Quattro&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;These Quattro blades last atleast 2 weeks before they start to wear out. Gillete Fusion lasts about 4 shaves and the blades go dull.&lt;br /&gt;Switch and you will see the differance. I got a free Schick razor and 2 blades, and I have changed and never looked back.&lt;br /&gt;SCHICK #1. Also, Amazon has great prices on the Quattro bladfes.</li>
            <li> I have these on auto order and have always been pleased with the quality.  This most recent shipment has a problem.  The comfort strip falls off after a couple shaves and definitly impacts comfort.  Hopefully this is an anomoly in manufacturing.</li>
            <li> The product speaks for itself. The titanium blades stay sharper longer, but as such cost a bit more. With Amazon the price makes them worthwhile. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I read all these reviews and really was happy that I had just bought this product. First time I used this got a big cut. Since then I have gotten lots of nicks and cuts so I don&#x27;t get how all of you can say that it will never cut you. No one has even touched on the main reason I think alot of people will buy this product. The new edging blade is supposed to make this the fusion with out the price. The except the edger sucks. I feel like its tucked too far in the head of the razor so it doesn&#x27;t really work. I would rather use the regular Quattro blades.</li>
            <li> I use these blades all the time  but for some reason this lot  seemed dull and pulled a lot which hurt my face.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin; the sort that has to be treated with moisturizer as soon as I&#x27;m done shaving (or else my face turns into leather.)  This razor, the Quattro, is absolutely unsurpassed, in my experience, in providing as close a shave as physically possible WITHOUT razor burn, nicks, or cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I travel, I make sure to take my Quattro: nothing else will I ever let get this close to my face except my wife.</li>
            <li> have not used yet but i&#x27;m sure I will like it if I get a chance an see a need</li>
            <li> I prefer the Schick Quattro over many of the other brands.  You get a consistent shave and I like the bonus blade for trimming.  Is consistent when shaving up or down.</li>
            <li> These cartridges are a great way of getting a clean close shave without nicks and razor burns. Highly recommended product!!!</li>
            <li> I received a schick razor for free as a promotion and decided to try it.  The razor was solid and comfortable to hold. The blades gave me an excellent shave.  And one cartridge outlasted the one from another brand that I have been using for years.  The combination of the razor and the blades makes for easy shaving.</li>
            <li> Best razor blades I have found so far.  I highly recommend.  I tried multiple products from a few different companies and I found that this gave me the cleanest and fastest shave.</li>
            <li> I like the quattro cartridges over any other shave and I have noticed I can get a month of shaves from just one cartridge&lt;br /&gt;In the past I have used a straight razor, double sided single blade &amp; twin blades as well as several different types of electric razors and Quattro is my favorite</li>
            <li> When it comes to razors I&#x27;ve tried them all, as most guys have and I definitely know these are the best. The titanium blades last the longest and give the best shave without nicks, razor bumps etc. I&#x27;m Italian and I have some thick facial hair, I used to go through a razor every 2-3 days. These titanium blades shave me well for up to 2 weeks! You still need to get a good shaving cream and let it set on your face for a minute or two, don&#x27;t go with those nasty grocery store gels. The L&#x27;Occitane shaving cream is pretty awesome so give that a try. I even prefer these to a safety razor, go ahead and buy them from Amazon, great price, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be pleased.</li>
            <li> good clean shave with these blands</li>
            <li> I embarked on a months long effort to find the best razor/blade combination.  I tried them all and really like the Fusion...until I tried the Quattro Titaniums.  Not only is the shave superior, but the blades last forever.  Whereas I could only get 2-3 comfortable shaves from the Fusion, I can use the Q Titaniums for a week or more.  They are in a different league and I could not imagine using any other blades...until I research again.</li>
            <li> When I purchased these from Amazon, they were a couple bucks cheaper than the Schick Quattro for women blades.  They&#x27;re totally interchangeable, so check the pricing!  I thought these might be extra awesome because of the Titanium Coated Blades, but really I didn&#x27;t notice a difference and if anything I got more ingrown hairs, but that could have just been a fluke.  My one complaint though is the extra straight edge blade on the black - I didn&#x27;t need it and kept clipping my finger on it - but it&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t bad enough that I wouldn&#x27;t get these again if they were cheaper than the women&#x27;s version.</li>
            <li> this is a Schick brand.  So it is the original.  Works fine.  Came on time.  I&#x27;ll type more because my review has to be longer.</li>
            <li> They cut well and don&#x27;t knick. They also last an extremely long time.  I have a very coarse, thick beard.  It grows fast but I only bother to shave every other day.  That said I get over a month out of a blade before they start missing the small hairs.  They never do pull hairs like some blades do.  I also have never had them knick from an accidental twitch like other blades do.</li>
            <li> Same as the product you buy in the store. works well. I&#x27;ve been using these for awhile and I&#x27;ve had no complaints.</li>
            <li> My fianc√©e has been using these blades for years, so I already knew they were good! Also, the price was great!</li>
            <li> these are decent razors, ive tried several different types, these do &amp;#34;tug&amp;#34; slightly slightly more than other blades ive tried but since you buy 4 and get 2 extra free you really cant complain. atleast i didnt. i bought two packages and they last a while. each blade tends to last me 1.5 weeks and i shave my face and chest. for the price, i would recommend.</li>
            <li> After using many other brands, my husband is using Schick Quattro titanium since they first introduced them to the market. Now he does not want to try a different brand anymore. He is a teacher and shaves every single day! They are very durable. He gets many many uses out of each cartridge (he changes like every 8 weeks, maybe even longer?). Since he is shaving so often his bread is never too long to trapped between the blades, hence the longer lifetime for the cartridge (just for any other brand). The fact that he doesn&#x27;t want any other brand means a lot to me because he is so absent minded that he generally doesn&#x27;t know what brand of anything he is using. But for shaving, he insists that he gets these :)    All in all, he is very happy with them and I am happy with the price on amazon. Not to mention, we got the boxes with 2 more bonus cartridges in them (yay!), totaling 12 in this purchase.</li>
            <li> Gillette hit the bull&#x27;s eye with their Mach razors with 3 blades. It turns out that 3 may be a magic number. With 4 blades, the spacing between the blades is too tiny and the sticky foam and bits of hair clog up the gap and it&#x27;s difficult to wash it off. The blade works OK the first few seconds, and once the gap is plugged up, the blade simply skids over my chin and cheeks. The shave is nowhere near as close as with the Mach 3.</li>
            <li> Another reviewer said he received only 1 pack of 4 cartridges.  Let me tell you - they sent me ONLY 1 PACK OF 4 CARTRIDGES!  The item is around 20 bucks, the description says cost per cartridge is around 2 1/2 bucks.  Do the math - that means there will be 8 - COUNT &#x27;EM, EIGHT (8) - CARTRIDGES.  They sent only 4 cartridges and I had to return it immediately.  How is that possible? What&#x27;s wrong with them???</li>
            <li> The blades came as described and work as expected.  There&#x27;s not much to say about the blades themselves, but the seller was spot on with delivery and quality.</li>
            <li> I love these Schick blades because they give me a lot of smooth pain free shaves. I used to buy a bag of cheapie BIC razors but they always pulled and never lasted for more than a couple of shaves.</li>
            <li> Item as described, arrived on time</li>
            <li> Yup, they work as intended. Only gripe is that hair can get stuck in between the blades quite easy.</li>
            <li> Generally speaking 4 is better than 3 and this is the one everybody should have.  This Schick unit beats them all!!!</li>
            <li> These blades are by far the best on the market.They give you a close smooth shave and the blades LAST a very long time.Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe &amp; Save option  makes the price UNBEATABLE..........</li>
            <li> People who are saying they&#x27;re getting multiple weeks out of one blade must be shaving twice a week or have only peach fuzz. I have to shave daily, and after one week the blade starts nicking and pulling. The lubricating strips are worn away at this point which is probably part of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do really get a nice shave out of it, and will continue to use it. Just be prepared to shell out a good amount of money for a 4 pack every month if you have any kind of beard growth.</li>
            <li> Great value and a close shave</li>
            <li> We normally buy these online because the stores don&#x27;t always carry them. This time the box was all dusty and written in Chinese or something. I can&#x27;t say which language really because I don&#x27;t read anything but English. You could tell they were The blades were actually cheap and did not last very long. My husband went through this pack really fast and didn&#x27;t care for them at all. He&#x27;d rather buy them in the store and pay more knowing where they came from.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price. Excellent product, long lasting razor blades. I&#x27;ve  had enough of Gillettes policy of introducing new product and maintaining high prices on the older blades. 5 blades?!!! Instead of more bells and whistles focus on effective blades that last longer. Today&#x27;s market is about affordability.</li>
            <li> I got exactly what I wanted. I didn&#x27;t get any inferior quality ones as others reported. I got a good deal is what I got! Glad I risked it.</li>
            <li> I like these Schick blades. They work well and these were priced at a significant savings vs. the local drug store. Arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> This is a very sharp durable cartridge to use! I&#x27;ve found this gives a very close shave without the skin irritation that is common to shaving. Replaces easily with little effort. Will buy this again and again!</li>
            <li> QUATTRO Ti blades are a great value and a revelation for the guys that hate shaving regularly, but have to.  If you want to fake out the MBA&#x27;s at Gillette/P&amp;G who charge $4 bucks a cartridge that only lasts a week, try QUATTRO Titanium. The Ti veneer and PTFE (non-stick) coating make all the difference; it&#x27;s better living through science!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since we are all in the same boat, you can get 8-10 shaves out of QUATTRO Ti cartridges by using these adult shaving tips:&lt;br /&gt;1.) USE A PRE-SHAVE OIL&lt;br /&gt;2.) SHAVE AFTER A SHOWER, OR PUT A HOT WASHCLOTH ON YOUR FACE FOR 3 MINUTES&lt;br /&gt;3.) INVEST IN A SHAVE BRUSH &amp; REAL SHAVE CREAM&lt;br /&gt;4.) SHAVE LIGHTLY TWICE INSTEAD OF PRESSING TOO HARD ONCE&lt;br /&gt;5.) AFTER RINSING, USE A SOOTHING LOTION TO REBUILD SKIN</li>
            <li> Good Quality, doesn&#x27;t last any longer then the Mach 3&#x27;s do though. I do like the razor blade on top, makes shaving under my nose a lot easier.</li>
            <li> These blades are worth the extra money over the regular Quatro blades.  Stay sharp longer, shave smoother and nick less, at least on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some have questioned whether one recieves the two packs of blades with this offer. I always have recieved the two-pack.  Subscribe and save even more and have automatic delivery just when you need them.</li>
            <li> the only one so far that works for me. i have sensitive skin, close shave without the bumps. would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> At the supermarket, these are about double the price of here (when you get free shipping). The Titanium ones are better than the cheaper Schick blades. I wanted to see how long one of these would last and still be better than a new cheap disposable blade. Even after 6 months it was still better. I use a new one every 2 months though. I shave in the shower though where I think the &amp;#34;steamed&amp;#34; hair cuts easier and the blades last longer.</li>
            <li> If you have a Schick razor,this is the blade to go with,keeps a good edge for a long time,Great blade!!</li>
            <li> I finally gave up trying to get cartridges for my preferred Schick Xtreme 3 as they&#x27;re now up to about $3.30 per cartridge when sold without free Prime shipping.  These Quattro&#x27;s come to $2.06 per cartridge since they ship free with Prime.  They have one more blade per cartridge than the Xtreme, but cost more than a $1 less per cartridge?  Go figure.  I still prefer Schick to Gillette, but at this rate I think I&#x27;ll try that Dollar Shave Club once I use up this supply.  Their web site shows you get a four blade razor handle with four cartridges for $6 month, that includes S + H, which makes it $1.50 per cartridge, but, they send out another four every month.  I go through a cartridge a week so that would be perfect, especially not to have to worry about running out.  Sounds too good to be true, but their commercials are pretty funny.  Sorry, didn&#x27;t mean to make this a free ad for those guys.  I&#x27;ll check it out and if anybody finds this review helpful I&#x27;ll post an update later to let you know how it goes.</li>
            <li> Works well for my husband. He seems to like them, because-he tells me to find them for him when needed. They seem to last a long time for him and he shaves everyday!</li>
            <li> I tend to shave 1-2 times a week and I find these can last me 2 months easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades seem to hold up much longer than competing brands, especially&lt;br /&gt;If you shave with the grain and not against it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only negative is the little wires protecting the blades and the blades themselves are so close together you get a lot of built up hair in there. Have to be diligent about rinsing after every swipe and once in a while taking a sharp endded toothpick or something and cleaning this out.</li>
            <li> If I do not write a review for these cartridges it will be just a shame.&lt;br /&gt;I owe this to Amazon as I usually make my decisions based on what other people think of the products.&lt;br /&gt;So here goes my review and I hope it helps you make your decision.&lt;br /&gt;What is essential for you guys (or girls) to know is the backdrop. I initially&lt;br /&gt;used these Schick \\&quot;titanium\\&quot; Quattro razor blades about 2 years ago. I found&lt;br /&gt;them a tad expensive, and spent the next 23 or so months trying to find a product&lt;br /&gt;that could give me better result for lesser price. I have tried the Schick Quattro&lt;br /&gt;regular cartridges, and then the 5 blade. This was followed by a trial of Gillette&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;ranging from 2 blades to 5.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t go in details but I can say is that 2 years into my quest for finding the perfect blade.&lt;br /&gt;These blades stood the test of the time.&lt;br /&gt;Another thing of note is (I am not exaggerating at all): There is an advertisement by Schick that talks about \\&quot;hydration where you least expect it\\&quot; and all I can say is these blades (though I do not think the advert is for these blades) live up to that advertisement.&lt;br /&gt;My verdict: From many years of trying I am very sure there is no other blade better than these on the market at this time.</li>
            <li> excellent quality titanium razors that stay sharp for long time.  lotion strips don&#x27;t disintegrate like other g* brand razors.  highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The blades I received didn&#x27;t have the upper edging blade as shown in the picture, the only reason I bought this product.</li>
            <li> The Product Description stated there is an edging blade and the photo of the product package showed and stated edging blade. The product that I received does not have an edging blade. I bought the product specifically because of the edging blade. I am not happy.</li>
            <li> Very good product at a reasonable price.  Will probably order these again.  Appreciate having a retail alternative to minimize cost.</li>
            <li> My husband uses these razor blades and has a clean, smooth, close shave every time. Can&#x27;t go wrong with buying multiple packs of things you are likely to use regularly.</li>
            <li> I just received my order of these, which was already cheaper than in my local grocer. The great news is that received bonus packs that were actually 6 packs, (not 4) which made this a very good deal! I just ordered 2 more in hopes that they are 6 packs as well. Time to stock up!</li>
            <li> I have four problems with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A) Product quality:&lt;br /&gt;My previous handle came apart after 24 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B) Usability:&lt;br /&gt;The handles are entirely different shape and contour between models.&lt;br /&gt;Many do not come with a tray to hold extra blades.&lt;br /&gt;Many do not fit in existing trays to hold extra blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C) Customer Service:&lt;br /&gt;I reported the problem to Shick, which is \\&quot;Energizer Personal Care\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;2 weeks later, they responded with apology, and committment to send me a coupon to replace the handle.&lt;br /&gt;5 weeks after that email, I received the coupon in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;D) The blades clog.  If I have stubble only, then the shaving goo and stubble bits pack into the razor.  It can&#x27;t be rinsed out except maybe by a pressure-washer.  If I have a couple of week&#x27;s worth of growth, the hairs all get stuck in the safety wires they put over the blades to keep them from cutting you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product shows a lack of usability study, poor customer service, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go back to Gillette.  They are worth the 15% more cost for the 3000% better product.</li>
            <li> These blades are coated with Ti to improve coating adhesion and prolong service life.&lt;br /&gt;In practice, the uncoated ones last as long IF they are carefully rinsed, dried, and stored.&lt;br /&gt;If you leave your blade in a puddle of soapy water you won&#x27;t like these, regardless of coating.&lt;br /&gt;Mine last 2 weeks. I have to be careful to switch them at the first sign of drag.&lt;br /&gt;They are incredibly sharp, cheaper than Brand G., and provide an almost unbeatable shave.</li>
            <li> I decided to try Quattro titanium blade because I was wearing through the original variety at a pretty fast pace. The titanium version last much longer over all, but they seem slightly less sharp right out of the box than the original. However, they keep their sharpness for much, much longer (I can get 45-60 days per blade, shaving every other day). The trade-off in immediate sharpness for longer life is a good one since the normal blades loose their edge in less than a weeks time anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended if you value longevity over absolute keenness in your razor blades.</li>
            <li> Pleasing alternative to Gillette. Gave a close shave as good if not better than the competition. Glides easily, ages well. I&#x27;ve since switched to a single blade razor but if I were doing 4 blades this would be the one</li>
            <li> The seller sent 1 package that contained 4 Quattro Titanium cartridges \\&quot;with edging blades\\&quot; as shown in the photograph; however, the second package was an older model of the Quattro Titanum razor blade that does not have the \\&quot;edging blade\\&quot;. I specifically expected to get the razors with the edging blade or I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered this product. I note that the text description does not mention the edging blade but I inferred from the photo that this was what they would send. As the product is a good product either way, I gave it a 2 star instead of a 1 star rating. However, I felt this product was mis-represented by the photograph.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my husband.  He hasn&#x27;t complained so I&#x27;m going to guess he&#x27;s happy.  Much better price than in the store.</li>
            <li> A high quality blade although I deem it overpriced</li>
            <li> Several of the cartridges had only two blades, plus two empty slots!</li>
            <li> I had a sample razor sitting around for years. Finally got to giving it a try and found the shave was good if not better than the ones I got from the 5 blade ones from the &amp;#34;G&amp;#34; blade company at a lot lower price. If you want a really good shave and a really lower price, give these a try. They are now my blade of choice.</li>
            <li> Excellent blades. Same quality as you would get in the store. The blades come in an easy to use safety plastic case that you can throw in your bag or drawer. Easily snap the handle into a new blade when it&#x27;s time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Gilette razor guy for a long time.  I used to use the 2-blade contour razors.  I even tried the 5 blade gilette once, but concluded that it was no more than a gimmick without any significant inprovement in shave quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These Quattro Titanium blades, however, are very impressive.  Even now I find myself running my palm over my face, marvelling at how smooth it is after my daily morning shave.  It&#x27;s also very rare that I cut myself shaving now - much less frequent than with the old Gillette Contour blades, so the protective ribs across the front of the razor seem to be quite effective.  I don&#x27;t use the single blade on the front edge - that does seem to be more of a gimmick than a useful feature, and I wish they&#x27;d make a titanuim blade without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that I can get a very comfortable shave for 2 weeks of daily use.</li>
            <li> I really like how the new titanium blades feel. Nice clean shave, no nicks or cuts. I highly recommend this</li>
            <li> My husband is required to be clean shaved for work and has very sensitive skin. He swears by these and won&#x27;t use anything else. Thanks to the Subscribe and save program on Amazon, it is a lot cheaper than purchasing at walmart.</li>
            <li> Easier then going to the store. Clean shave every time. Even makes me want to shave on a weekend. Thanks</li>
            <li> Everything is fine, please don&#x27;t ask for long dissertations on a review, Amazon, I have better things to do.</li>
            <li> these are Schick Quattro Cartridges, Titanium Coated Blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;what else is there to say?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;have to add six more words.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best price for these razors, and it&#x27;s not the off brand, it&#x27;s the real deal! :D</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for a son-in-law at his request. Wouldn&#x27;t have been my choice, but it suited him. He was happy, and so am I.</li>
            <li> Ordered this item, because have been using Schick for a long time and absolutely love them. Was pleasantly surprised to get 2 bonus cartridges per pack. Great value... (Purchased May/2013)</li>
            <li> Great product - great price.</li>
            <li> likely to buy again when I need more</li>
            <li> These blades are everything they are advertised to be and more!  Incredibly smooth shave, the wires work at holding the blades back from your skin but shave the beard.  I shaved against the grain from start to finish using proper preperation and did not get one cut, one nick and had no razor burn or irritation at all.  I&#x27;m prone to burn, irritation, bumps and ingrown hairs and I&#x27;m on blood thinners which makes any nick a gusher: With that; I take my shaving very seriously:These blades are perfect.  If I could find one thing wrong with these blades I&#x27;d say so: Best Blade Ever.&lt;br /&gt;I bought them from Amazon and as always my shipment arrived on time and was packaged very well with no problem.  In fact I do very little shopping with anyone else except Amazon.  Almost always the best price and best service and no I don&#x27;t work for them.  But I am very picky about my online experiences shopping and love my Amazon:)</li>
            <li> My current wet-shaving razor of choice is the Schick Quattro Titanium.  It is perhaps a bit less irritating than the Gillette Mach3 Sensitive, while shaving equally close and lasting 10-14 days (compared to about a week for the Mach3).  The 5th trimmer blade is handy, too.  Hardly ever a nick or bump shaving in the shower after a preliminary dry shave with an excellent Panasonic ES8249S.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re a relative bargain at $2.32 each on Amazon (compared to $2.90 for the Mach3 Sensitive and $4 for Fusion Proglide Power cartridges, which don&#x27;t perform any better for me).  I&#x27;ve been buying the 2x4 packages on Subscribe &amp; Save, but I now see that the 8 packs are available at a $2.15 each, even without the S&amp;S.  You can save even more and buy a seemingly identical cartridge at Costco stores under the Edge Brand name, complete with a nice shiny black metal razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t tell that the Fusion Proglide Power is any better than the Mach3 Sensitive.  Even though it sounded like a good idea when they first came out, the Gillette power razors make make enough noise that you can&#x27;t hear if you&#x27;re cutting stubble and doesn&#x27;t seem to improve the shave in speed, comfort, or closeness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also spent a fair amount of time trying to perfect a double-edge shave, with some top-of-the-line Euro, US and Japanese razors and a variety of well-regarded blades.  At best, the shave is incredibly close, but for me, that almost always results in a bunch of tiny scabs where any small bumps in my skin are sheared off.  The process is a lot slower, with three or four passes, and if you try to hurry, you will bleed even more.  And after buying all the expensive European creams, soaps,and balms, not to mention the razors, the total cost per shave is no bargain, despite the lower cost of blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just keep coming back to the Schick Quattro Titanium!</li>
            <li> Work as expected. Awfully damn expensive.</li>
            <li> better than the newer blades.</li>
