            <li> This is a great product!  Seems to work a lot like a BB cream.  Not as heavy as a foundation; more dewy with a little bit of light undertone to produce a gentle glow.  Loved this product, until supply got low and the tub separated from the applicator at the base and started leaking.  Otherwise wonderful.  Would buy this again and definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect foundation for me. Light, goes on easily and produces a fresh cover. Love it!</li>
            <li> Revlon Age Defying Spa Face provides just a natural glow to your skin.  I use it as a highlight after other makeup.&lt;br /&gt;It looks natural and healthy and the reflection minimizes wrinkles. The applicator allows you to easily and lightly use it.</li>
            <li> This is the only makeup that I like and it is unfortunately discontinued.  I am so happy that I can still find it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS FACE MAKEUP. CAN&#x27;T FIND IT IN ANY OF THE STORES. I THINK THEY MAY HAVE DISCONTINUED THIS PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;I CAN ONLY GET IT ON AMAZON.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THE WAY IT GOES ON AND ILLUMINATES MY COMPLEXION. I WILL CERTAINLY KEEP BUYING IT ON AMAZON.&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU</li>
            <li> I have used this produce before but I could not find it anymore in the local stores. I LOVE it, it is not heavy, sheer and light, illuminates the skin. It&#x27;s a wonderful product for those who don&#x27;t want heavy make-up.</li>
            <li> Nice product.  I mix it in with my liquid foundation and if gives a nice dewy look without being glittery.  It is what I was looking for to get the look that is popular in all of the magazines.</li>
            <li> I use this on my eyelids, under eyes area. Brightens me up a bit without much sparkle. Will continue to buy this.</li>
            <li> Really love thank you</li>
            <li> This has been discontinued.. and probably because of the packaging.. I had a few that leaked at the seam. But it is so great.. leaves a little sparkle to your face.</li>
            <li> This is just a greasy product that serves no purpose as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  Who wants a shiny face?  If you want illumination, try the powdered mineral type.  It is a natural product and gives a natural glow.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this product on a regular basis. Suddenly it vanished from the stores.&lt;br /&gt;I was happy to find this on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;It gives my face a nice glow and minimizes wrinkles!&lt;br /&gt;I use this shade all year long.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product!</li>
            <li> for some crazy reason, Revlon discontinued this great superlight foundation. i did have problems with the applicator  (leaked out the side after lots of use) but the product itself is wonderful. leaves your skin moist, glowing but not greasy -- works on shoulders, decolletage, anywhere! definitely recommend particularly the bare light color as it really has almost no coverage/color of its own -- just a glow!</li>
            <li> goes on very nice, very pleased!</li>
            <li> I usually purchase this product at my local chain pharmacy. However, when I needed it, they were out! This product adds a very nice, natural-looking glow which makes a very nice difference when you apply it over your makeup....or wear it alone.</li>
            <li> All was good except the ink.  I returned the ink and never received a refund, even after contacting then 3 times.  No more ink.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a little too pink and shimmery for me; if only it were more translucent and less pink shimmer it would be better.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST FOUNDATION/bb cream/primer/moisturizer I have ever used! Buy it I promise ill LOVE IT! REVLON PLEASE BRING IT BACK!!!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this in the stores anymore, love this product! It&#x27;s not heavy and gives you face a healthy glow!</li>
            <li> A good product.  Arrived in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> this is a terrific tinted moisturizer.  the illuminating glow is very subtle...you don&#x27;t see sparkles all over your face like you do with most &#x27;illuminating&#x27; products.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of glittery luminizers, or ones with a lot of pink/gold in them- this does the trick. The particles are very fine, and the color is a warm beige rather. It&#x27;s not too light or too dark on my fair/medium skin, and the tone itself is sheer enough to work on any skin color, though on very dark skin it may function best as a highlighter rather than an overall illuminator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is similar to the Josie Maran luminizer (a product the costs 30$-40$). It&#x27;s Revlon- there are no beneficial ingredients for your skin other than an SPF of 25, and there is clearly fragrance in it. It also does not enhance wrinkle the way some reflective products do.</li>
            <li> THey stop selling these at stores.  it is a great illuminator. It give you a healthy glow and very natural</li>
            <li> Love this. I use it as a light make up and it&#x27;s perfect. I&#x27;m afraid it will soon disappear from Amazon and I will be looking for a replacement</li>
            <li> So glad I can still find this makeup.</li>
