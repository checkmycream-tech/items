            <li>Better than the other brands, at half the price.  </li>
            <li>I actually bought it for use during a really hot summer vacation where we were doing a lot of walking all day long.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Seems to work fine. It is unscented - truly unscented - meaning there isn&#x27;t any medicine smell or anything. That is good. It works well for me when I&#x27;m doing lots of cardio. I&#x27;d buy it again. It is softer than I would think it should be and I can see using a lot of it (thankfully, I bought the 3 pack).</li>
            <li> Awesome always and such a great deal so hard to find in the stores</li>
            <li> Better than the other brands, at half the price.  Goes on smooth and lasts all day. I walk all day at work and this keeps me from chaffing.  * been using this brand exclusively now for over 6 months, highly recommend if you ever chaff. Way better than powders, and it goes on easier and lasts longer than the other rub on types.</li>
            <li> Not as good as Body Glide, but the lower price makes up for the difference. It still works, just doesn&#x27;t seem to last quite as long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used an anti chaffing balm similar to this one for years to keep my compression shorts from doing terrible stuff...down there. I was a little skeptical at first of trying a new brand but for the price I thought it would be worth a shot. Very glad I did! I do not notice any difference in performance of the product compared to the more expensive brand I used on my BODY to GLIDE the fabric on my skin.</li>
            <li> This is an AMAZING product!  I carry it in my purse all summer to use as needed for that always-miserable chub rub.  I HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
            <li> Much better quality that Glide-On.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Works well and no smell at all.</li>
            <li> What not to like, does the job and cost a fraction of the competition.</li>
            <li> 40 year old kinda athletic guy. I walk to work a mile everyday. I use the elliptical trainer at the gym. I use this every morning after my shower for over 6 months now. Just apply at crease of upper leg&#x27;s and groin.... It is smooth and works GREAT. Not greasy and does not stain. This product dose NOT irritate my sensitive skin in any way. I Recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great for runners or anyone who constantly battles heat rash during those adorable spring and summer dress filled hot &amp; humid summer months!</li>
            <li> THIS GOLD BOND FRICTION SOOTHING UNSENTED (1.75OZ) FORMULA IS A GREAT IDEA I DON,T KNOW WHO THOUGHT OF THIS BUT WHO EVER THEY CAME UP WHIT A GREAT IDEA FOR ANYONE THAT NEEDS IT.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best product to prevent adult chaffing....Thank you GoldBond Folks!</li>
            <li> I truly love this product. It glides on easily and smoothly, protects skin on skin problem areas from rubbing, chapping, and irritation. I have had some problem areas since surgery and chemotherapy and after just a few applications the visual and physical skin irritations disappeared. And the best part is with continued use for about a month, they haven&#x27;t returned. I am so happy with this product. I would recommend this to anyone with problems of this nature.</li>
            <li> Really helps prevent my son from chaffing between this muscular thighs.  Works well when he is wet too!</li>
            <li> Long lasting, really works for running, cycling, etc.  Hard to find in stores but much less expensive and goes further that the &amp;#34;popular&amp;#34; stick</li>
            <li> So far so good.  I haven&#x27;t had any issues with my skin chaffing.  Hot weather has not arrived yet; so if there is something new to report I will update my review.</li>
            <li> I was unable to find these locally. Good product. Needed here in the Alabama near 100 degree temperature.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, I carry mail and during hot days it comes in handy</li>
            <li> when you work outside in the heat all day long, this helps saved your skin from uncomfortable rashes.</li>
            <li> This item is fantastic. I actually bought it for use during a really hot summer vacation where we were doing a lot of walking all day long. We put it on our feet every day and it prevented blisters.</li>
            <li> It really does work well. Much better then talc or cornstarch because it doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin, break down when wet or wear off fast. At first it seemed to increase friction but in the end it actually moisturized and kept me comfortable all day.</li>
            <li> I use this to prevent chafing on my belly from my belt and pants. It works well and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. It goes on and feels like a solid deodorant stick but it&#x27;s not greasy so it doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brand and even others are often hard to find in stores so I was glad I could find it on Amazon and glad it is part of the &amp;#34;Add On&amp;#34; program so it would not cost a lot to ship.</li>
            <li> Was really having problems with my skin on my legs with irritation from blue jeans.  Now I just rub this over the area and no more itchy skin.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the summer time, for my chub rub, in my thigh area. I love that it&#x27;s unscented. It really helps to reduce friction, and it also moisturizes the skin nicely.</li>
            <li> Do your thighs rub? Do you feel like you&#x27;re going to set the world on fire when you go walking anywhere? This stuff is amazing, lubricating, and soothing.</li>
            <li> The product is great for runners, gym enthusiasts and people of husky build. I has already been suffering the effects of vigorous activity and chafing. This product upon application was soothing and helped to shorten the length of the rawness. It is waxy in texture and unfortunately has a distinct odor that isn&#x27;t as pleasant as I would expect from Gold Bond. Maybe they could develop a version with a sport, powder or medicated scent?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An otherwise great product that is difficult to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I live in a hot climate and have put on a little weight.  This is great to keep the friction from limiting my wardrobe.  Works great</li>
            <li> As a package delivery driver this has saved me from a lot of pain and uncomfortable days.  I also use this every time I run.  Not slimy like some products but you can tell its there.  Texture is along the lines of dry deodorant sticks as opposed to gel sticks. I find this also slows sweating and reduces odor.  Keeps areas from developing a rash and friction burns while keeping the skin from drying out.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best item of its kind.  Wish we had the item for the last 18 years.  A must for people who work outside in Florida.</li>
            <li> I got this for my son who plays sports in the hot Florida sun and he loves it.  He went to a sports camp and while the other kids were suffering from &amp;#34;swamp butt&amp;#34; he was fine.  It is a must have for hot summer sports!</li>
            <li> This product works great.</li>
            <li> I run frequently, good anti-chafe product, non-greasy, comparable to Body Glide but more moist and easier to apply.  Good value.</li>
            <li> On longer bike rides I&#x27;ve tried other products to reduce friction against the seat, but this seems to be the easiest to apply, most comfortable, and most effective.</li>
            <li> Blisters, chafing, a weird spot of dry skin, new shoes, humid weather...this stuff is fantastic. From April to October, I don&#x27;t leave my house without a stick of this in my bag.</li>
            <li> worked like a charm . I put on after my shower in the morning before my walk and it stopped the inner thigh chaffing. no stickiness or unpleasant feeling.</li>
            <li> As soon as it starts to get warmer outside I start to reach for the Gold Bond Stick. I feel like more people should be aware of this product as it relieves all chafing caused by walking, especially in the heat.</li>
            <li> This stuff is excellent.  I wear a kilt when hiking and often my marble bag rubs my upper thighs and can chafe on longer walks.  Friction Defense to the rescue!</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I use this product when running or on hot days to prevent chafing. It works perfectly. It eliminates all chafing caused by walking, jogging or running in the most hot and humid weather.</li>
            <li> Works fine, I wish it came in smaller sizes that weren&#x27;t expensive.</li>
            <li> so much better the the name brand</li>
