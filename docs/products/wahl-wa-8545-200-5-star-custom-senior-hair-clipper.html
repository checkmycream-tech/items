            <li> This a very nice clipper. Has a really powerful motor. Its all chrome.  Looks beautiful but was hoping for a metal cover but its PLASTIC.  I bought my clipper from B.Y.P.L.E and it looked used.  Finger prints everywhere.  I never buy noting from them again. Other then that I really like it.</li>
