            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>There is no residue buildup and my hair is clean and shiny!</li>
            <li>The scent is fresh and is just barely there which is perfect.</li>
            <li>When I have purchased in a salon the bottle was more full.  </li>
            <li>fortunately I don&#x27;t mind it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny, manageable and feels clean.</li>
            <li>Your hair will still feel clean and after 1 or 2</li>
            <li>Great for my red color treated hair, the scent of there products are great and a little bit does a lot.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still so full, shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li>It has a black tea aroma and is great when used with the nou nou conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have very long hair that tangles easily and using this shampoo, with the corresponding conditioner, makes my hair so silky!!</li>
            <li>My old time favorite was Aveda&#x27;s  Sap Moss and</li>
            <li>I am a swimmer and this shampoo keeps my hair healthy and soft.</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner are the best that I have found for my hair in a long, long time!  </li>
            <li>The price is right, too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably try something less spendy when I run out of this, and hope it does as good as job.</li>
            <li>when that was discontinued, I tried so many brands all of which came up short until I found the Davines Nounou.  </li>
            <li>I used this for the first time today</li>
            <li>and I love having darker low lights in my hair</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve been just allowing it to dry on its own</li>
            <li>I have used the conditioner which it great, and so I thought the shampoo would be too, but it turned out to be a total waste of money for me.</li>
            <li>This one of the line makes your hair really shine</li>
            <li>If you want to really try this product buy it from the website, its a few dollars more but its worth the price.</li>
            <li>Price + shipping was reasonable and came well sealed and packaged.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews for this shampoo and still purchased it because I really like the mask product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Minus one star for the high price-to-amount ratio, though.</li>
            <li>It might just be a normal variation of the product</li>
            <li>I like the scent too - very clean, fresh and subtle.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I generally color my hair every 6 weeks, so I need a shampoo that really takes care of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I actually end up having to use more than a half-dollar-sized amount and mix with a little water to get it to do a decent job.</li>
            <li>A shampoo that doesn&#x27;t strip my hair of natural oils.</li>
            <li>A bottle of shampoo has lasted me several months and while it does not lather well, it cleans really well without stripping the color.</li>
            <li>Also I had some shampoo left in my old bottle and the color wasn&#x27;t exactly the same</li>
            <li>The problem is that the bottle came and was 1/3 empty -- only 2/3s full.  </li>
            <li>I live in a dry climate so my hair needs alot of hydration to be fluffy and full.  </li>

            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for, &amp; with long hair, you need to take extra care!!  </li>
            <li> I have very long tick hair which was starting to get damaged and dry.</li>
            <li> Also lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I usually love this product - but I&#x27;m a little wary.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not using junk but for some reason my hair was still dry.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t get a dry scalp</li>
            <li> I had to use a lot of this small bottle to get it through my hair and resorted to using my old shampoo as this one seemed to dry my hair out.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally blonde hair, but I color it dark brown.</li>
            <li> but after it cooled and I tried it for about a week or so, it just does not have the same effect on my hair as the previous bottle.  </li>
            <li> The smell is a little different</li>
            <li> Takes a little while to get used to little sudsing (no sulfates!), but it makes my hair feel soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I took me over a year with the help of these products and my stylist to restore the damage done by other stylists through over processing.  </li>
            <li> Cleanses &amp; nourishes my hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> but when I compared it to a previous bottle that I purchased from the Davines website, this bottle from Amazon is diluted</li>
            <li> have long thick curly hair</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m a little suspicious...</li>
            <li> It took a little getting used to-</li>
            <li> In order to boost the lather factor, I usually pour half of this and half of some inexpensive grocery store brand into my hand and mix them together.  </li>
            <li> I went through a tough financial period</li>
            <li> I have very long, very thick hair ...until I found Davines my hair was a dried out frizzy mess.  </li>
            <li> No more yanking my hair out when I run a comb through it.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t even have to &#x27;blow out&#x27; my &#x27;do&#x27; for a shiny, slick hair shaft.</li>
            <li> My poor hair was so dull, brittle and dry.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and it does not lather.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it would work with someone with thin silky hair, but forget it for thick hair.  </li>
            <li> It seems as if  this shampoo was diluted as it is way too thin.</li>
            <li> Yes, this is expensive stuff - but use it and discover the difference between this and &amp;#34;store bought&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> At this price, that&#x27;s an awful lot of shampoo!</li>

            <li> This product helps maintain my hair color without fading.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  Takes a little while to get used to little sudsing (no sulfates!), but it makes my hair feel soft and shiny.  Also lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast delivery</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I generally color my hair every 6 weeks, so I need a shampoo that really takes care of my hair.  This is it. Davines!</li>
            <li> Finally! A shampoo that doesn&#x27;t strip my hair of natural oils. My hair is shiny, manageable and feels clean. The scent is fresh and is just barely there which is perfect.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner are the best that I have found for my hair in a long, long time!  I live in a dry climate so my hair needs alot of hydration to be fluffy and full.  My old time favorite was Aveda&#x27;s  Sap Moss and when that was discontinued, I tried so many brands all of which came up short until I found the Davines Nounou.  A bottle of shampoo has lasted me several months and while it does not lather well, it cleans really well without stripping the color.</li>
            <li> I usually love this product - but I&#x27;m a little wary. Did they recently change their product and/or packaging? If so, this came in a smaller bottle but it still says 8.45 oz. Also I had some shampoo left in my old bottle and the color wasn&#x27;t exactly the same and I think the smell was even different. It might just be a normal variation of the product but I&#x27;m a little suspicious...</li>
            <li> This one of the line makes your hair really shine&lt;br /&gt;I alternate between two shampoos&lt;br /&gt;I have long thick curly hair&lt;br /&gt;And sometimes flat iron and use this line to keep nature shine and curl</li>
            <li> Cleanses &amp; nourishes my hair without weighing it down. And I love the scent!  Yes, it&#x27;s a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for, &amp; with long hair, you need to take extra care!!  I will be repurchasing this again &amp; again!</li>
            <li> This stuff is simply incredible. I have very long tick hair which was starting to get damaged and dry. I use pureology daily so I&#x27;m not using junk but for some reason my hair was still dry. I used this for the first time today and I can&#x27;t believe how wonderful my hair feels. It&#x27;s like I just got it cut.</li>
            <li> The best shampoo ever - my hair has more shine and easy to style....</li>
            <li> It took a little getting used to- the shampoo does not lather, but it smells AMAZING!  Your hair will still feel clean and after 1 or 2 uses I am ok without the lather.</li>
            <li> I bought Davines products before and this is just not the same for some reason. It smells like Davines product but when I compared it to a previous bottle that I purchased from the Davines website, this bottle from Amazon is diluted some how. I thought maybe it was because of the heat  (it sat outside for sometime in the heat before I came home and saw it on the door step) but after it cooled and I tried it for about a week or so, it just does not have the same effect on my hair as the previous bottle.  Davines is a great product I love their shampoos, conditioners and even their oil treatment for hair. If you want to really try this product buy it from the website, its a few dollars more but its worth the price.</li>
            <li> Great for my red color treated hair, the scent of there products are great and a little bit does a lot. Price + shipping was reasonable and came well sealed and packaged.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for several years.  There is no residue buildup and my hair is clean and shiny!</li>
            <li> The shampoo is rather watery.  In order to boost the lather factor, I usually pour half of this and half of some inexpensive grocery store brand into my hand and mix them together.  That way I get the smell I like from this shampoo, and still the shine benefits, and it lasts longer.</li>
            <li> I have very long, very thick hair ...until I found Davines my hair was a dried out frizzy mess.  I took me over a year with the help of these products and my stylist to restore the damage done by other stylists through over processing.  Yes, this is expensive stuff - but use it and discover the difference between this and &amp;#34;store bought&amp;#34; stuff.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is the best! I have very long hair that tangles easily and using this shampoo, with the corresponding conditioner, makes my hair so silky!! No more yanking my hair out when I run a comb through it. I like the scent too - very clean, fresh and subtle. I&#x27;ve tried so many shampoos and conditioners out there, both high-end and lower priced, and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> Great nourishing shampoo that doesn&#x27;t leave any feel of waxy residue.  And it&#x27;s healthy for your hair.</li>
            <li> It seems as if  this shampoo was diluted as it is way too thin. I have thick curly hair and it does not lather.  I had to use a lot of this small bottle to get it through my hair and resorted to using my old shampoo as this one seemed to dry my hair out.  Maybe it would work with someone with thin silky hair, but forget it for thick hair.  I have used the conditioner which it great, and so I thought the shampoo would be too, but it turned out to be a total waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo and conditioner for many years.  It is the best.  I have colored hair and it works great.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews for this shampoo and still purchased it because I really like the mask product. It does not lather unless you use a ton of it.you definitely need a conditioner as you cannot comb your hair out if not.</li>
            <li> This product is Eco friendly, has the scent of a spa, and is altogether great. The price is right, too.</li>
            <li> This is great shampoo, leaving my fine hair very clean, shiny, and healthy-feeling without stripping. I don&#x27;t find that my color fades noticeably when I use this (alternating with Tressa color-depositing shampoo).  The fragrance sticks around, but fortunately I don&#x27;t mind it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minus one star for the high price-to-amount ratio, though. I actually end up having to use more than a half-dollar-sized amount and mix with a little water to get it to do a decent job. At this price, that&#x27;s an awful lot of shampoo! I&#x27;ll probably try something less spendy when I run out of this, and hope it does as good as job.</li>
            <li> Great deal for the money and it nourishes color treated hairand leaves your hair more managable. Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little different but I like the way my hair feels and shines.</li>
            <li> one of my favorite shampoos of all time, it smells great and you don&#x27;t get a dry scalp</li>
            <li> Love these products from Italy!!!  Very good to hair and love the smell  -  Great price cheaper than anywhere around!!!  Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> I have naturally blonde hair, but I color it dark brown. I went through a tough financial period so I was using dollar store shampoo. My poor hair was so dull, brittle and dry. Even after lobbing off 4 inches, it just still lacked softness and shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I combine this with the &amp;#34;Davines Conditioner, NouNou Illluminating with Tomato Extract for Colour Treated Hair&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m very happy I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t even have to &#x27;blow out&#x27; my &#x27;do&#x27; for a shiny, slick hair shaft. So far, I&#x27;ve been just allowing it to dry on its own and it&#x27;s still so full, shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. I am a swimmer and this shampoo keeps my hair healthy and soft. I accidentally ordered two bottles on my last order which was greast because one of them leaked during shipment!</li>
            <li> The best shampoo I have used and the price is reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m blonde and I love having darker low lights in my hair, this shampoo held maintain the color while keeping hair healthy &amp; sexy.&lt;br /&gt;Oh and smells amazing :)&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend trying</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it. I have been using it for 5 years. I wish it would be sold in retail stores.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is the best. It has a black tea aroma and is great when used with the nou nou conditioner.</li>
            <li> I buy it all the time and only go to Davines salons.</li>
            <li> The problem is that the bottle came and was 1/3 empty -- only 2/3s full.  When I have purchased in a salon the bottle was more full.  I don&#x27;t understand.  Did someone use some?</li>
