    <ol>
            <li> can not fully empty the bottle because of packaging. It would be better in a jar.</li>
            <li> I have been using this patchouli lotion for years and CONSTANTLY get stopped and asked what I&#x27;m wearing and where I got it. I only wear this lotion - never any perfumes because it just smells so good. It is my &amp;#34;signature scent&amp;#34;. Besides it smelling great it is the best moisturizer I have ever used - and it&#x27;s vegan!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this lotion. And feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this body lotion, it&#x27;s my second buy. I put it on and that&#x27;s it. No need for any other fragrance</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat Indigo Wild&#x27;s products. This is a great lotion, w/ a not-too-strong fragrance.</li>
            <li> I think this is mostly shea butter. The lotion, itself, feels really good. Especially now, in pool weather. My skin gets dry and this feels really nice and soft. But I&#x27;m not going to kid ya - it smells really BAD to me.In fact, it downright stinks to me. My daughter said that it smelled like patchoulli that had gone bad. The good side is that the fragrance does not last but maybe an hour at the very most. So I&#x27;ll keep using it (not out in public, ever) knowing the lotion feels good, and I won&#x27;t have to smell it for long. ...</li>
            <li> Zum Body is a great lotion.  The Patchouli is a little strong, but I love it.  I have other Zum Body fragranced lotions...the scents are wonderful and last a long time!!!</li>
            <li> This lotion is a very good product. Leaves your skin hydrated and soft. Great on hands or entire body except your face. I don&#x27;t like perfume lotions on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked patchouli so my wife surprised me with a bottle of this lotion in my Christmas stocking.  It&#x27;s a great lotion that doesn&#x27;t leave your hands feeling greasy for a long time but does keep them soft.  The patchouli scent isn&#x27;t overpowering but is pretty strong which I think is great as lots of other patchouli scented products are pretty weak at best.  The scent stays with you throughout the day which I think is great.  I would recommend this product to anyone who likes patchouli.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way. Put on your arms just after a shower and the scent is there for a  long time!</li>
            <li> Goes with my Zum body spray. Great scent and lathers well. Good customer service. Would use product and customer again. Thanks</li>
            <li> excellent lotion with a subtle patchouli fragrance</li>
            <li> Sold Patchouli fragrance and not too oily.  I like this product, use it every morning.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. Will be ordering again</li>
            <li> Fragrance doesn&#x27;t last long at all. Small bottle. Lotion is nice but way overpriced for what it is.</li>
            <li> arrived quickly and I really love this product! I wish it was available in a larger bottle!</li>
            <li> This has a very light, plain smell.  Not patchouli-esque at all.</li>
            <li> I gave it three stars because it does not smell like patchouli, and read the ingredients and no patchouli either. It came later than expected (two days later). What I can say all natural ingredients,  it has some amazing ingredients and great consistency pretty bummed that it does not smell like patchouli AT ALL! :(</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, fairly moisturizing without being too oily!</li>
            <li> Kinda oily and not the best patchouli I have smelled.</li>
            <li> Great smell, and made my hands so soft.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer! Use this daily after shower, very pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> Pretty greasy. Smells as expected, when using lightly it&#x27;s okay. But I come back feeling a oily rather than hydrated.</li>
            <li> Absorbs well. Wonderful light smell, just a little pricey.</li>
            <li> Not greasy not watery. Fragrance is so so.</li>
            <li> I love this suff, it&#x27;s expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> No... This one was not for me.  The smell was not correct and out just didn&#x27;t work the way I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and my skin is soft after using it.  It has a strong patchouli smell but I like that.</li>
