            <li>as healthy as it is</li>
            <li>I love the smell and how it works.  </li>
            <li>Since then, I also had a thyroid problem which caused more of my hair to fall out.  </li>

            <li>I use this product at home, I love it, it worked wonders on my hair.</li>
            <li>Smells like love and rainbows and baby kittens and lollipops and a spring meadow on a sunny day.</li>
            <li>It may work better for females?</li>

            <li>and I&#x27;ve seen a significant improvement in the way my hair looks and feels.</li>
            <li>sure how much regrowth of hair.  </li>
            <li>I loved this brand for several years.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise not a bad shampoo... just don&#x27;t expect anything.</li>
            <li>Also, the most clean and full my hair has ever felt as an adult.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>My rating is my package came right away</li>
            <li>I had to cut it short to get rid of most of the damage</li>
            <li>Will definitely order more.</li>
            <li>Really helped with my hair loss in the showers!</li>
            <li>like everything except the shampoo it make sure hair dry and tangled up nothing great!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend it.</li>
            <li>bought a kit and was able to get two and half to three months worth of using it.  </li>
            <li>I still like the smell and the packaging, but my hair gets so much tangled after I shampoo with this product even if I used the Alterna Volumizing Conditioner, my hair still feels course and tangled.</li>
            <li>After using this product, my hair still falls, though not as much as before.</li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>For something that cost this much I should have had no problems.</li>
            <li>You will find your hair growing back thicker and healthier  ,the set is not expensive!!</li>
            <li>I am now a new Alterna Caviar  fan for life!</li>
            <li>I tried so many different products and wanted to find something that was affordable and wouldn&#x27;t break my bank and would last me for awhile.  </li>
            <li>HOWEVER I ordered this one because its cheaper than where I normally buy it.  </li>
            <li>and I am hoping over time I will start getting new hair.</li>
            <li>I love the product line, but it&#x27;s a rip off to have 2/5 of the main product completely empty and dry.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>but this one is the first to actually deliver results beyond any product I&#x27;ve used before.  </li>
            <li>I definitely feel that this works and would highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li>It is not greasy at all and makes your hair feel soft.  </li>
            <li>I have so many hair products, salon and natural products all pretty darn expensive</li>
            <li>I threw out a few products that claimed to make hair grow, moisturize, volumize ... etc because I now have the real deal!!  </li>
            <li>I have natural curly hair and it is the only brand controls my hair.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo makes my hair so fluffy and healthy looking that it does not look nearly as choppy with how soft it looks.  </li>
            <li>I really liked for this product to work for me, but unfortunately, it does not.</li>
            <li>I have spent years and probably way to much money nurturing it back to health</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve had thin hair for years and tried many other products.  </li>
            <li> then I do a few sprays around my scalp on lightly towel dried hair then massage it into my scalp and even while my hair is still wet</li>
            <li> Long story short, save your money...</li>
            <li> Sometimes products lose their oomph after using them for a long period of time ...</li>
            <li> but I use coconut oil as a base on my hair before I put the bleach mixture in and this has also helped tremendously reduce any damage or sticky feel to my hair right after bleaching.  </li>
            <li> I have tried all kinds of other products and I always go back to Alterna.  </li>
            <li> kinda like the old 80&#x27;s shag I usually wear</li>
            <li> I am currently deployed to afghanistan, and little comforts from home are welcomed.  </li>
            <li> so I do bleach it every so often and when I hit 40 I hit a very stressful time in my life, lost a ton of weight and a ton of my hair along with it between poor nutrition and the breakage from bleaching...</li>
            <li> When I received my kit two of the six vials were completely empty</li>
            <li> I am a white 45 year old woman with dirty blonde hair</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use the hair serums every week but tried to remember to do it every other week or every 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> But it definitely does not regrow, not for me at least.  </li>
            <li> This product has made my hair much thicker over time than just the previous usage of random shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> I noticed that my hair was fuller and thicker and noticed that my shedding had dropped down a lot from handfuls to a few strands each time I washed my hair (and I wash my hair everyday!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little background on my hair journey :  </li>
            <li> It may make your hair appear thicker... a little.</li>
            <li> but no matter what I used it still look too choppy for my liking.  </li>
            <li> Not cool!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what i was expecting</li>
            <li> so I use redken cream shampoo to strip everything out at least once a week</li>
            <li> Sad to find out that 2 of the capsules were completely empty!</li>
            <li> I have since been addicted and have been using it for six months now.  </li>
            <li> Too expensive for no results!</li>
            <li> hopefully a bad review will force them to respond&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it was awful.  </li>

            <li> Sad to find out that 2 of the capsules were completely empty! Not cool! Would have given 5 bc I love the product line, but it&#x27;s a rip off to have 2/5 of the main product completely empty and dry.</li>
            <li> Alterna is  the best  as Always! Will by it again an again!</li>
            <li> WOW! I really LOVE this stuff!  I have used this for 3 days now, just the shampoo (no conditioner) then I do a few sprays around my scalp on lightly towel dried hair then massage it into my scalp and even while my hair is still wet the volume is incredible but after blow drying WOW!  I have so many hair products, salon and natural products all pretty darn expensive but this one is the first to actually deliver results beyond any product I&#x27;ve used before.  A little background on my hair journey :  I am a white 45 year old woman with dirty blonde hair so I do bleach it every so often and when I hit 40 I hit a very stressful time in my life, lost a ton of weight and a ton of my hair along with it between poor nutrition and the breakage from bleaching... it was awful.  I have spent years and probably way to much money nurturing it back to health and I am finally there.  I had to cut it short to get rid of most of the damage but it is growing out nicely now however I have alot of layers.. kinda like the old 80&#x27;s shag I usually wear it layered back with curls but no matter what I used it still look too choppy for my liking.  This shampoo makes my hair so fluffy and healthy looking that it does not look nearly as choppy with how soft it looks.  And it holds a curl much better.  I am thoroughly pleased with this purchase and the product.  I haven&#x27;t used the weekly ampules yet .. I don&#x27;t know how it could get any better unless it makes my hair grow longer faster ... as healthy as it is I am hoping it will.  I do still bleach my hair but I use coconut oil as a base on my hair before I put the bleach mixture in and this has also helped tremendously reduce any damage or sticky feel to my hair right after bleaching.  I threw out a few products that claimed to make hair grow, moisturize, volumize ... etc because I now have the real deal!!  Sometimes products lose their oomph after using them for a long period of time ... so I use redken cream shampoo to strip everything out at least once a week and I hope that helps the Alterna Caviar to continue to make my hair look and feel this great.  Oh and I didn&#x27;t even mention the scent .. amazing!  And it lingers and smells so good throughout the day.  As you can see, I could not be happier with it.  I am now a new Alterna Caviar  fan for life!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny. I would certainly recommend it. This stuff is great, I love ,love it! It makes your hair feel and look stronger. I could tell a big difference after the fist time I used it. I have been using the products for about a month and I&#x27;ve seen a significant improvement in the way my hair looks and feels.Will definitely order more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while now.  I love the smell and how it works.  Hope they eventually come out with a conditioner to compliment this kit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with my hair thinning out and falling out after I turned 30.  Since then, I also had a thyroid problem which caused more of my hair to fall out.  I tried so many different products and wanted to find something that was affordable and wouldn&#x27;t break my bank and would last me for awhile.  I was so happy to find this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a kit and was able to get two and half to three months worth of using it.  I didn&#x27;t use the hair serums every week but tried to remember to do it every other week or every 2 weeks.  I noticed that my hair was fuller and thicker and noticed that my shedding had dropped down a lot from handfuls to a few strands each time I washed my hair (and I wash my hair everyday!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even went to my hairstylist and she said she could see a ton of baby hair growing and noticed that my hair was fuller and thicker.  I have since been addicted and have been using it for six months now.  I definitely feel that this works and would highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I really liked for this product to work for me, but unfortunately, it does not. I still like the smell and the packaging, but my hair gets so much tangled after I shampoo with this product even if I used the Alterna Volumizing Conditioner, my hair still feels course and tangled. After using this product, my hair still falls, though not as much as before.</li>
            <li> It really works.  I&#x27;ve had thin hair for years and tried many other products.  Caviar is great - my hair feels and looks much thicker.</li>
            <li> Really helped with my hair loss in the showers! I will use the product forever!!</li>
            <li> I am currently deployed to afghanistan, and little comforts from home are welcomed.  I use this product at home, I love it, it worked wonders on my hair. HOWEVER I ordered this one because its cheaper than where I normally buy it.  I will never make that mistake again.  I ordered this in Dec 2013.  Not only has it not gotten to me, the seller refused to show a tracking number for my order.  Its March 2014! even when I just asked for my money back I still havent recieved a response and I email them once a week! hopefully a bad review will force them to respond&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS SELLER!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Smells like love and rainbows and baby kittens and lollipops and a spring meadow on a sunny day. Also, the most clean and full my hair has ever felt as an adult.</li>
            <li> Smells great!  Does seem to make hair feel thicker.  Used it with the volume conditioner.  Not&lt;br /&gt;yet sure how much regrowth of hair.  Will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I did like the smell of the products and the way my hair felt, but I did not notice a difference with the hair loss. Too expensive for no results!</li>
            <li> Delivery was on time , was an offer and after taste it in two weeks i think is really a good hair tretament for growing hair.  You will find your hair growing back thicker and healthier  ,the set is not expensive!! a good experience !!</li>
            <li> Получила свой заказ, он просто супер! Доставка произошла даже раньше времени, чем обещали, аж в Казахстан!!! Средство супер!!!! Результат после недельного применения)))</li>
            <li> Have used this for about a month with no improvement.  I  would not buy this product again.  I should get my money back.</li>
            <li> I loved this brand for several years.  I have natural curly hair and it is the only brand controls my hair.  I have tried all kinds of other products and I always go back to Alterna.  It is not greasy at all and makes your hair feel soft.  I would recommend Alterna to all my friends and relatives.</li>
            <li> My rating is my package came right away and I would buy something from this seller again.&lt;br /&gt;I like everything except the shampoo it make sure hair dry and tangled up nothing great!&lt;br /&gt;My hair is still falling out I think it just fluffs up your hair .</li>
            <li> This product has made my hair much thicker over time than just the previous usage of random shampoos and conditioners. Would recommend it to all people of thinning hair.</li>
            <li> When I received my kit two of the six vials were completely empty so I only have 5 weeks. For something that cost this much I should have had no problems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what i was expecting but i saw an ad in Men&#x27;s Health. Long story short, save your money... It may make your hair appear thicker... a little. But it definitely does not regrow, not for me at least.  It may work better for females? Otherwise not a bad shampoo... just don&#x27;t expect anything. And you should for this price.</li>
            <li> Nice product and seems to have helped with hairloss</li>
            <li> It is making my hair thicker and more manageable and I am hoping over time I will start getting new hair.</li>
