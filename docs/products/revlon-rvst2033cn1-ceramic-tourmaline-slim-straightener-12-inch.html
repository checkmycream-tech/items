            <li>I love it !!!</li>
            <li>This straightener has been a great companion in cosmetology school.</li>

            <li>Not that great.</li>

            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I found a great product that leaves my hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li>The straightener itself is nice, but it says auto shut off in the description, but it doesn&#x27;t have it.</li>
            <li>Nice on/off switch.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use with good results..</li>
            <li>setting easily straightens my hair with one pass!  </li>
            <li>AND IT CURLS EVEN THE MOST &amp;#34;HARD TO CURL&amp;#34; PIECES OF HAIR.</li>
            <li>This straightener is perfect for short hair styles and smoothing your roots!</li>
            <li>knowing what I know now, I would go with a better quality Straightener.</li>
            <li>Excellent for really short hair.  </li>
            <li>Best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a long time!</li>
            <li>The size is perfect and the multiple heat settings are very useful.</li>
            <li>worth every dime and a more!</li>
            <li>Very good for styling short hair.</li>
            <li>My first hot iron like this worked great for about 3 years.</li>
            <li>The ceramic plates are not level with the housing and therefore easily create crimps in the hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel comfortable using it without that, so it is now just a travel straightener</li>
            <li>It works great for short hair.</li>
            <li>Overall great product.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this \\&quot;straightener\\&quot; that I use for a curling iron...</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get very hot on the highest level.</li>
            <li>heats up fast and does the job!!</li>
            <li>This heats up quickly and is hot</li>
            <li>The 1/2 inch size is perfect for getting close to the root especially for those of you with a tight curl.</li>
            <li>Heat control is useful, it heats up quickly, and is light enough that I can keep it on a rubber hook that is stickied to my bathroom</li>
            <li>I think the heating mechanism is out on this hot iron.</li>
            <li>Thanks!  </li>
            <li>I can curl and heighten my hair styles quickly and easily after blowing dry with the hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>It has a smooth no snag surface that runs with easy down the strands of hair.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no static on your hair after using this iron which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>GAVE THIS 5 STARS BECAUSE IT HEATS UP FAST.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast so it is ready when you are.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast.  </li>
            <li>works very well</li>
            <li>This one is light, which makes it easy to hold, but feels like it could easily break if handled wrong.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair and the high heat</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy and you can hold it comfortably for a long time.</li>
            <li>this product is a great size if you have a pixie cut like I do or if you just want a smaller flat iron to create smaller curls in long hair.</li>
            <li>The plastic on the other side of the heater doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as other sizes, which makes it easy to put right up against your skin without causing damage.  </li>
            <li>The plates are close to the edge so you can get right next to your scalp!  </li>
            <li>The plates are half inch wide which is good for short men&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>I currently have a &amp;#34;pixie cut,&amp;#34; which is ridiculously short on the sides / in the back, with some extra length on top.  </li>
            <li>I have a 1 inch Conair that looks similar, but is much weightier and has taken years of abuse without dying--even after being short-circuited in an outlet overseas, it still works.  </li>
            <li>but I am able to grab the outside of the iron at the tip and not burn my fingers, something I can&#x27;t say about other, more expensive irons.  </li>
            <li>Back in the 70&#x27;s, we just wore our hair long and straight and I never had to learn about curlers, curling irons, etc.  </li>
            <li>I have stick straight short hair with partial unruly gray and have given up on perms.  </li>

            <li> Good product but my finger always gets caught in the clamping mechanism. For some reason</li>
            <li> I have stick straight short hair with partial unruly gray and have given up on perms.  I couldn&#x27;t \\&quot;do\\&quot; the curling irons because of the kink it left.  Back in the 70&#x27;s, we just wore our hair long and straight and I never had to learn about curlers, curling irons, etc.  This 1/2\\&quot; iron is great!  I can curl and heighten my hair styles quickly and easily after blowing dry with the hair dryer.  My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t find this earlier!  The swivel cord is a blessing...never buy an iron without a swivel cord.  I tried other irons but they did not have the swivel...what a mess!  This heats up quickly and is hot but I am able to grab the outside of the iron at the tip and not burn my fingers, something I can&#x27;t say about other, more expensive irons.  Oh...and I forgot about the auto shut off...another great feature!  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this \\&quot;straightener\\&quot; that I use for a curling iron...except thank you Revlon!</li>
            <li> I currently have a &amp;#34;pixie cut,&amp;#34; which is ridiculously short on the sides / in the back, with some extra length on top.  My biggest issue was straightening the sides of my hair, where tiny little wisps come over my ears.  This straightener works perfectly for those super-short pieces and hasn&#x27;t burned my ears or face even once.  The plastic on the other side of the heater doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as other sizes, which makes it easy to put right up against your skin without causing damage.  It also heats up quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lower star is because it does feel a bit flimsier than other straighteners that I&#x27;ve owned.  I have a 1 inch Conair that looks similar, but is much weightier and has taken years of abuse without dying--even after being short-circuited in an outlet overseas, it still works.  This one is light, which makes it easy to hold, but feels like it could easily break if handled wrong.</li>
            <li> Took forever to find a 1/2 inch flat iron with variable heat.  Bought one with out previously and it fried my hair.  I&#x27;ve only used it twice.  I have very short hair and this gives it a bit of lift and &amp;#34;almost curl.&amp;#34;  Got compliments on my hair today and I like the look of it.</li>
            <li> GAVE THIS 5 STARS BECAUSE IT HEATS UP FAST. I HAVE A SHORT HAIR CUT AND IT CURLS EVEN THE MOST &amp;#34;HARD TO CURL&amp;#34; PIECES OF HAIR. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This straightener snagged my hair and pulled it out.  This is not a desired result in a flat iron.  I doubt you would either.  Beware!</li>
            <li> The straightener itself is nice, but it says auto shut off in the description, but it doesn&#x27;t have it. I don&#x27;t feel comfortable using it without that, so it is now just a travel straightener and I have to find another one.</li>
            <li> It works great for short hair.</li>
            <li> heats up fast and does the job!! i like the thin plates cuz i only use it on my bangs.</li>
            <li> I recently got my hair cut very short and needed a hair straightener that could work with shorter, thicker strands of hair. The size is perfect and the multiple heat settings are very useful. Overall great product.</li>
            <li> This straightener is perfect for short hair styles and smoothing your roots! The plates are close to the edge so you can get right next to your scalp!  I have curly hair and the high heat setting easily straightens my hair with one pass!  Best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a long time!</li>
            <li> The plates are half inch wide which is good for short men&#x27;s hair. It&#x27;s not heavy and you can hold it comfortably for a long time. There&#x27;s a manual heat setting dial, a power LED and on/off switch on the set. There&#x27;s no static on your hair after using this iron which is a good thing. This thing isn&#x27;t expensive. The only thing I wished it had was dual voltage compatibility. Otherwise, this thing is good.</li>
            <li> This straightener has been a great companion in cosmetology school. The 1/2 inch size is perfect for getting close to the root especially for those of you with a tight curl. It has a smooth no snag surface that runs with easy down the strands of hair. I don&#x27;t have a single bad thing to say about this straightener!</li>
            <li> I think the heating mechanism is out on this hot iron. It doesn&#x27;t get very hot on the highest level. I&#x27;ve owned this iron before. My first hot iron like this worked great for about 3 years.</li>
            <li> Easy to use with good results.. It heats up fast so it is ready when you are. Good buy from Revlon.</li>
            <li> Very good for styling short hair. I use it to curl my hair back and to the sides. I have 2 inch hair.</li>
            <li> The price is great but the product lacks quality. It pull a little while you&#x27;re using it. knowing what I know now, I would go with a better quality Straightener.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast.  Nice on/off switch.  Does a good job.  Thanks!  Excellent for really short hair.  Would buy from again.</li>
            <li> If I could have rated a 0 I would have. I initially contacted the company about this product but  never received a reply. When my flat iron came it had someone else&#x27;s hair in between the plates. I took pictures of everything. Im not doubting the performance of the item but I will never know because of the way mines came. I will probably purchase another one from another company. Totally not satisfied especially with the customer service!!</li>
            <li> works very well I love it !!!</li>
            <li> worth every dime and a more! this product is a great size if you have a pixie cut like I do or if you just want a smaller flat iron to create smaller curls in long hair. The only con about this porduct is that it doesn&#x27;t have the auto off feature!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very impressed with the design of this iron. The ceramic plates are not level with the housing and therefore easily create crimps in the hair.</li>
            <li> Does as it should, was well priced(comparable with it&#x27;s competitors) and I am happy with the product. Heat control is useful, it heats up quickly, and is light enough that I can keep it on a rubber hook that is stickied to my bathroom wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is excellent for men, shorter hair, travel, or quick adjustments.</li>
            <li> Not that great. When I use this product, it leaves my hair frizzed. (Black hair). I found a great product that leaves my hair silky smooth.</li>
