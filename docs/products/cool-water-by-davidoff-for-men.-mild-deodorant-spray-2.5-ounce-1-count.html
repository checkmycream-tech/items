            <li>I use this as a more daily kind of scent.</li>

            <li>One of my favorite colognes and very affordable as well.</li>
            <li>Cool Water By Davidoff For Men.</li>
            <li>Not even worth $10, let alone the $18 they are charging.</li>
            <li>Worth the price and quality of the cologne.</li>
            <li>On time, right product and right price no complaints.</li>
            <li>He ran out right before Christmas, so I bought it as a stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li>It smells great and better than most body sprays that I have used, but only last for a little while.</li>
            <li>not very strong so thats good..  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Cool Water since high school</li>
            <li>This is still my favorite fragrance and the only one I get.</li>
            <li>It smells good, but is not very long lasting.</li>
            <li>Not as strong as but still provides the same scent just at a lower concentration.</li>
            <li>Smells good last fairly long depends how much you work and sweat.</li>
            <li>i guess i wasnt expecting much anyway.</li>
            <li>But you should not spray too much cauz</li>

            <li>I can&#x27;t beet up on it too much, but still I have no use for a cologne that lasts little more then an hour.</li>
            <li>quick and low price, hah aha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha</li>
            <li>Therefore, I highly recommend this cologne to all of you men out there.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment came in 2 days before early.</li>
            <li>This scent comes off as sporty and clean more than anything, so keep it to a casual wear.</li>
            <li>Smells just like a black ice car freshener if anyone is familiar with that.</li>
            <li>I always get compliments from lady friends when they hug me and not a few bury their faces into my neck.</li>

            <li> Smell lasts long...  2.</li>
            <li> However, the scent does not seem to stay that long..</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Cool Water.</li>
            <li> Smell lasts long.., not very strong</li>
            <li> Although they gave me my money back and let me keep the bottle after I complained, but I had already thrown it out by then.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth to have it.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;mild deodorant&amp;#34; is a SEVERELY watered down body spray with no staying power.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle and definitely not overpowering, I use just a couple of drops on my neck and wrists.</li>
            <li> I use Armani, Polo, and a few celebrity brands, but this one smells hands down the FRESHEST.</li>
            <li> it dont alow me to say few word</li>
            <li> My husband loves this, I bought it for him because he&#x27;d run out and the prices at the stores in our town just for the very small one was too expensive.</li>
            <li> i was unable to receive this product at my home address and was unable to put my po box number for it</li>
            <li> The price is not to bad either.</li>
            <li> I hated it, it&#x27;s nothing compared to the in-store brand.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed but for the price</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like the smell enough said ;o)</li>
            <li> The body spray is just what it says, \\&quot;a body spray\\&quot;.  It smells great and better than most body sprays that I have used, but only last for a little while.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not my favorite scent by any means. Cool Water has a strong smell to it and from my experience changes scent as the day passes.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay more than couple of hours. It looks the same smell but with lower quality. Don\\&quot;t pay more than $15</li>
            <li> Almost no smell at all.  Very disappointed but for the price i guess i wasnt expecting much anyway.</li>
            <li> i was unable to receive this product at my home address and was unable to put my po box number for it</li>
            <li> For its price, it&#x27;s ok. But you should not spray too much cauz it will make strong smell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Cool Water since high school and it&#x27;s always been a winner.  It&#x27;s not over powering and the scent lasts for hours.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with Cool Water.</li>
            <li> Smells great - a nice casual smell I wear to work everyday</li>
            <li> It smells good, but is not very long lasting. For the price I guest I can&#x27;t beet up on it too much, but still I have no use for a cologne that lasts little more then an hour.</li>
            <li> Muy buen producto, lo recomiendo. As this is a perfume so nothing much to say..in points:&lt;br /&gt;1. Smell lasts long.., not very strong so thats good.. Amazing smell...</li>
            <li> Bought this for my bf, thinking it was the COLOGNE. DO NOT BE DECEIVED AS I WAS! This &amp;#34;mild deodorant&amp;#34; is a SEVERELY watered down body spray with no staying power. Not even worth $10, let alone the $18 they are charging. Smell gone in under 10 minutes. BUYER BEWARE.</li>
            <li> Not as strong as but still provides the same scent just at a lower concentration. I have the stronger version as well, forgot the name. I use this one for every day use and and the stronger one on special occasions</li>
            <li> I hated it, it&#x27;s nothing compared to the in-store brand. This is a knock off and the smell lasts maybe 20 minutes. Although they gave me my money back and let me keep the bottle after I complained, but I had already thrown it out by then. Don&#x27;t waste your money here, get the real stuff in store.</li>
            <li> excellent buy and amazing fragrance</li>
            <li> Good product for the money.Smells good last fairly long depends how much you work and sweat.Fast shipment came in 2 days before early.Would recommend.Will order again.Thanks</li>
            <li> This is still my favorite fragrance and the only one I get. It&#x27;s subtle and definitely not overpowering, I use just a couple of drops on my neck and wrists. I always get compliments from lady friends when they hug me and not a few bury their faces into my neck. Amazing.</li>

            <li> I love the smell of this cologne. I use Armani, Polo, and a few celebrity brands, but this one smells hands down the FRESHEST.</li>
            <li> I use this as a more daily kind of scent. A spray or two on my chest after a shower and I smell great for hours. However, don&#x27;t use this for a formal occasion. This scent comes off as sporty and clean more than anything, so keep it to a casual wear.</li>
            <li> More like &amp;#34;Cool water down&amp;#34; cologne!! Spray it on and after 10 mins. it vanishes like a fart in the wind :)</li>

            <li> The products ok.. However, the scent does not seem to stay that long.. But good for the price.. I think.. :)</li>
            <li> My husband had this cologne when we started dating. He ran out right before Christmas, so I bought it as a stocking stuffer. I&#x27;ll tell you; going two weeks without smelling this on my man was torture!</li>
