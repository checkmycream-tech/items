            <li>Tastes like weak coolade, so easy to take.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t have any positive or negative feedback about the product.  </li>

            <li> But in the whole scheme of things, I am paying a little under $2,000 a year for my family to avoid (or at least drastically reduce) sickness - still expensive, but I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>

            <li> with the results being that this product is no better than a morning glass of water and a vitamin, we requested a refund.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I notice a difference the first week using this. My nails and hair seem to grow so much faster.  my energy level increases and I don,t get that blah feeling. Overall I feel so much better when I take this regularly. My only concern was I went to use a bottle that had a little left in it and it had chunks and it smelled bad. It was in the back of the refrigerator and I didn&#x27;t check the expiration date. I will next time.</li>
            <li> I always cringe when I have to order more of my Body Balance....but only because of the price.  I&#x27;ve tried many different supplements and at the end of the day I&#x27;ve never found one that I was even remotely happy with as I am with the BB.  I guess the old saying is true...you get what you pay for.  And I would truly encourage people to spend the money on this - it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any positive or negative feedback about the product.  I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in the product.</li>
            <li> wish this was in a pill form so it would last longer.</li>
            <li> Okay this product in my opinion last time I tried is very tasty. I thought it was really good. I wish that the producers could some how make this a lot cheaper and sell it in like gyms or something as some sort of health drink. But I thought the taste is awesome. I don&#x27;t know about its effectiveness in regards to energy, nutrition or whatever. So as for taste I give this product 5 stars for health claims I am unsure.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Helps me sleep better.  Tastes like weak coolade, so easy to take. Thanks!</li>
            <li> So many healthful ingredients.  I feel that I am drinking good health with every sip. Well worth the reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The best thing about this drink is it seems to ward off illnesses.  My family has been taking this &amp;#34;vitamin drink&amp;#34; for about 2 years.  I have only gotten sick once during this time despite lots of stress (a move to another state, a 9-month work stretch with many weekends and late nights).  My children have nearly all of the sicknesses that have gone around their classrooms (they have been sick twice each).  I compare this with previously catching colds, flus and other bugs fairly regularly (4x/year) and the kids getting sick even more often.  I attribute it to this drink as I&#x27;ve had it almost every day for these last 2 years while my diet has been good and bad, my exercise has been off and on and my general care for my health has been inconsistent - I am overweight and have needed to get back into shape for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t so expensive - I think we spend a little less than $20 a bottle - about $160 a month.  But in the whole scheme of things, I am paying a little under $2,000 a year for my family to avoid (or at least drastically reduce) sickness - still expensive, but I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> It works great as a morning stimulant but I did not observe any noticeable health benefits (I took it for a month).</li>
            <li> Sooooo happy I can buy this on Amazon now.  Have used product for 10+ years, can&#x27;t do without it.</li>
            <li> I have been taking this product for at least 20 years and even though it&#x27;s formula has undergone some changes in that time, I find it to be great tasting and very effective. Try it!</li>
            <li> This is just heavy marketing pyramid scheme sales product. You can search and there are many reviews professionals on this product and is nothing really but a bunch of aloe and some sea vegetables. the nutrients listed come from the Aloe only so what.  Good luck finding percentages of anything. We had someone we meet bother us enough to get us to buy this monthly and told her to buzz off. There a tons of real green food powders you can buy that are far superior to this mystery drink. Your spending a lot of money per ounce for aloe.</li>
            <li> I take a table spoon every morning.  It tastes great whether it&#x27;s taken alone or mixed in a smoothie. I know it is good stuff.</li>
            <li> I appreciate convenience of internet shopping and fast service. Disappointed that you no longer have this product for sale to customers.</li>
            <li> I really thought I had the answer to my Whole30 multivitamin conundrum here...  Unfortunately, the product does contain a preservative:  Potassium benzoate.  I haven&#x27;t read up on this particular preservative yet, but obviously it won&#x27;t work for Whole30.</li>
            <li> I gave this review three stars not based on the product, but based on the fact the cap was busted off when it was delivered. I could not secure the top of the cap and in turn, the product did not stay fresh.</li>
            <li> We tried the Life Force Body Balance faithfully under the advice of neighbors.  Also, we were told that if we were unsatisfied for any reason within 90 days, we would be granted a refund.&lt;br /&gt;So with the results being that this product is no better than a morning glass of water and a vitamin, we requested a refund.  Low and behold we were told that we had to save the empty bottles to get said refund.&lt;br /&gt;STAY AWAY FROM THIS RIP OFF!!!!!!!  This is nothing but a big scam perpetrated by losers that can&#x27;t find a job and need to prey on the unsuspecting.&lt;br /&gt;The long and short....STAY AWAY FROM LIFE FORCE BY BODY BALANCE!!!!</li>
            <li> The taste was good but I wouldn&#x27;t order it again. I didn&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
            <li> I liked this product very much. It gave me energy and made me more flexible and I felt generally better.</li>
