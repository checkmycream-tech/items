            <li> I bought this specifically for my acne prone skjn, after hearing that it works wonders for clearing up complexion. It has not done anything for me except make my face stink.</li>

            <li> Good tea tree oil, it works perfectly for pimples. Got thek for my friend and she loves it. It also help fight the inflammation in your body. My dad uses it to help with the swelling on his fingers.</li>
            <li> This came just as described and pictured. 5 ml bottle- exactly what we needed and a great price. I am pleased.</li>

            <li> Great smell, antibacterial, great for so many things with cleaning and boosting immune system.</li>
            <li> A drop at the back of the tongue at the first sign of a tickly throat may prevent a cold from developing. It doesn&#x27;t taste good and can be put on the outside of the body such as the bottom of the feet.</li>
            <li> good price, arrived in good condion</li>
            <li> This IS a great product for ear infection, rash, toe fungus etc. BUT your picture shows a 15 ml bottle and we received a teeny tiny 5 ml bottle....considering the other lemongrass oil we received from you said 15ml in paperwork, the melaleuca says nothing and look at your ad...photo of 15ml when you could have photographed the mini bottle you were really going to be sending. Very deceptive and on purpose as you didn&#x27;t write the 5ml size in the words either.</li>
