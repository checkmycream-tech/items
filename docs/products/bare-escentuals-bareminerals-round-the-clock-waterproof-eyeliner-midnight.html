            <li>My new best friend!</li>
            <li>this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>The old midnight liner was like a nice powdery consistency that was easy to use and looked beautiful - my favorite!</li>
            <li>still use it occasionally, mostly for evenings out.  </li>
            <li>and I love their eyeliner.</li>
            <li>so , yes this eye liner did that and more.</li>
            <li>I love eyeliner.</li>
            <li>but I still love the product.</li>
            <li>I love the pencil that I can sharpen and the stores do not carry this anymore.</li>
            <li>I DO, however, love the provider of the product.  </li>
            <li>Love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I love that it stays all day (even through tears or allergy eyes).  </li>
            <li>This is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>product also smudges easily.  </li>
            <li>It is waterproof but comes off easily with makeup remover.</li>
            <li>It is very bold and doesn&#x27;t smear or wear</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still holding strong at 8pm.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t get a smooth and precise line, and it irritates my eyes-</li>
            <li>I have successfully used Bare Minerals powered products and had no problems with sensitivity.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s creamy and glides on smoothly.</li>
            <li>It works great for using in the waterline, but not as a regular eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>Best black eye liner ive ever used!</li>
            <li>plus a very good price compare to other stores..</li>
            <li>In other words I LOVED it !</li>
            <li>Product wasn&#x27;t in its original box but was secured to protect it.</li>
            <li>I have tried many drug store and name brand eyeliners, this by far is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love the original Bare Minerals eyeliner, so I was very excited when the waterproof came out.</li>
            <li>Way to obvious and bright.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different kinds and this is my absolute favorite!</li>
            <li>Does smudge easily and is very vibrant.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use any other kind of eyeliner and be as satisfied as I am when I use this product.</li>
            <li>n the first time I used it , the tip broke!</li>
            <li>i love this eyeliner its the best, is really soft n dark!!!!</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite eyeliner ever.</li>
            <li>The main problem with this eyeliner is that it is too fat to make a fine line.  </li>
            <li>but if you need to take it off use Vaseline and it rubs right off.</li>
            <li>Love Bare Minerals products line.  </li>
            <li>I love Bare Minerals</li>
            <li>I love bare escentuals products &amp; this is one of them.</li>
            <li>First eyeliner in this line experiencing this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t put this on  in hot weather unless  </li>
            <li>this was da 2nd time i order this eyerliner:)</li>
            <li>I tried smudging it to make at least it appear more straight and ended up looking like some kind of drug addict.</li>
            <li>But this eyeliner is great n last very long</li>
            <li>First, you have to sharpen it instead of just twist it up like the \\&quot;Big &amp; Bright\\&quot; version allowed, when sharpening it never comes to a clean point and quickly breaks off in clumps</li>
            <li>I am always looking for really jet black colored eye liners who make you&#x27;re eyes look kind of mysterious and sexy  </li>
            <li>reasonable pricing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It stays on very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Order arrived fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the legit real liner.</li>
            <li>The product is good for only the first few uses, until you have to sharpen it.</li>
            <li>It is dark black and lasts a nice amount of time, and it also goes on very evenly and easily.</li>
            <li>I will be going back to my tried and true, even though it&#x27;s not waterproof.</li>
            <li>Sure, a little tiny bit comes off if my eyes water up significantly, but all in all it stays put.</li>
            <li>Has a wide tip, glides on fairly smoothly, but lays a lot thicker line than I</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a long lasting really black eyeliner this is great.  </li>
            <li>I will use the provider again -- and I love Bare Escenutals other products -- just not this one.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the big &amp; bright eyeliner, but sadly Sephora, Ulta, &amp; the Bare Minerals store at my local mall no longer carry it.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite eyeliners I have ever used, and that is saying something because I am big on eyeliner and have tried several different products.</li>
            <li>I strongly suggest buying the BareMinerals sharpener to go with the pencil, since it&#x27;s so smooth (despite being a little more expensive, it&#x27;s made for the product and helps it last longer).</li>
            <li>It is soft so it can be made into a thicker line.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes, and this does not irritate at all.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve tried pretty much all waterproof eyeliners (gel, pencil) and other than Make Up For Ever gel cream eyeliner (which I think they no longer make because I can&#x27;t find it anymore!! )</li>
            <li>only downside is that the pencil needs to be sharpened a lot more than others I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>and I had a full refund within a few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Right on the edge of my eye it doesn&#x27;t move, but if I put it on my lashes at all it will end up smearing down my face.</li>
            <li>No other like it, I&#x27;ve tested about 20 and nothing compares.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now scouring amazon and ebay for the old \\&quot;Big &amp; Bright\\&quot; version.</li>
            <li>LOVE this eyeliner, sad that Bare Minerals discontinued it.</li>

            <li> LOVE this eyeliner, sad that Bare Minerals discontinued it.</li>
            <li> It is hard to apply if the pencil is not sharp and you don&#x27;t have a steady hand.</li>
            <li> to find a wide range of Bare Minerals products on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (Not Bare Minerals)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s truly long lasting and waterproof!</li>
            <li> I purchased 4 to keep it around as long as I can.</li>
            <li> My only complain is that it&#x27;s hard to sharpen and not mess up the color in the middle.</li>
            <li> However, my hopes were quickly dashed when the pencil came off in thick clumps which made it very difficult to achieve a clean line.</li>
            <li> I like the color and the texture, but it doesn&#x27;t apprear to need to be sharpened since the casing is plastic, but it&#x27;s dull and it cannot be twisted to get more volume</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read carefully when I purchased this item.</li>
            <li> The midnight black is definitely too black.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It is a little difficult to sharpen and apply but it is worth it because it stays on all day.</li>
            <li> I still like it, but find myself being very careful when I put it on.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that they did not come in the box that they were sold in in stores, it just makes it harder to store them where I planned on storing them.</li>
            <li> I will ever use any other liner!</li>
            <li> and midnight (dark black) Give it a shot.  </li>
            <li> I got 8 pm (charcoal black), 9pm (choco brown)</li>
            <li> eyeliner was really my first disappointment.  </li>
            <li> only complaint is the mess the sharpener leaves behind, but, hello, that&#x27;s not even a big deal!</li>
            <li> Other eyeliners are a dull black color, this one is a brigh black.</li>
            <li> There was a little debacle when my sharpener kept eating the pencil.</li>
            <li> A little heavy for daytime wear for my taste</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Round</li>
            <li> However the Round the Clock Eyeliner caused my eyes to burn almost as soon as I applied it.</li>
            <li> I tried using it as an under eye liner the next day, but got an even worse reaction.</li>
            <li> This version is soft and difficult to apply except in a garish line.</li>
            <li> I am really sorry that Bare Escentuals changed their eyeliner formula.</li>
            <li> Sad Bare Minerals has discontinued it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased 4 of these eye liners in the past three years.</li>
            <li> SUCH a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually shocked because all I buy is Bare Escentuls!</li>
            <li> No good  at all  </li>
            <li> I heard the new eyeliner is terrible now.</li>
            <li> and I like the way it delivers on being waterproof, but I am disappointed and frankly disgusted with the fact that it is IMPOSSIBLE to sharpen this pencil without making a huge, waterproof mess and without wasting a LOT of the pencil.</li>
            <li> If you like black eyeliner and are sick of wasting money on it, this is the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but this baby delivers.</li>
            <li> It is awful and so not worth the $14.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m afraid to try to sharpen it for fear</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is hard to apply and it smears very badly.</li>
            <li> I have bad allergies and my eyes</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a really bad product...</li>
            <li> They contacted me IMMEDIATELY upon my bad review of the product</li>
            <li> I hate this.  </li>
            <li> Why so awful?</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I LOVE this stuff, won&#x27;t use anything else!!! I have bad allergies and my eyes water all the time, this doesn&#x27;t run or smudge.</li>
            <li> Love Bare Minerals products line.  Have used their line for over, gosh, maybe 16 or so years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This eyeliner was really my first disappointment.  Has a wide tip, glides on fairly smoothly, but lays a lot thicker line than I prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product also smudges easily.  First eyeliner in this line experiencing this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to find a wide range of Bare Minerals products on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very reasonable pricing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say I would recommend this product to anyone desiring a thinner lined look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still use it occasionally, mostly for evenings out.  A little heavy for daytime wear for my taste</li>
            <li> I love Bare Minerals and I love their eyeliner. It is a little difficult to sharpen and apply but it is worth it because it stays on all day. This eyeliner does not smudge a bit. It is waterproof but comes off easily with makeup remover. It&#x27;s a shame they aren&#x27;t selling these anymore. I heard the new eyeliner is terrible now. I&#x27;ll stick with this.</li>
            <li> Wears well, lasts all day. I have tried many drug store and name brand eyeliners, this by far is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the big &amp; bright eyeliner, but sadly Sephora, Ulta, &amp; the Bare Minerals store at my local mall no longer carry it. They are only carrying this version- \\&quot;Round the Clock\\&quot;. It is awful and so not worth the $14. Why so awful? First, you have to sharpen it instead of just twist it up like the \\&quot;Big &amp; Bright\\&quot; version allowed, when sharpening it never comes to a clean point and quickly breaks off in clumps so you don&#x27;t get a smooth and precise line, and it irritates my eyes- they are red within an hour. SUCH a disappointment. I&#x27;m now scouring amazon and ebay for the old \\&quot;Big &amp; Bright\\&quot; version. Please bring it back BareMinerals!!</li>
            <li> I like the color and the texture, but it doesn&#x27;t apprear to need to be sharpened since the casing is plastic, but it&#x27;s dull and it cannot be twisted to get more volume and I&#x27;m afraid to try to sharpen it for fear I&#x27;ll ruin it - HELP!!</li>
            <li> A beautiful, rich color that stays on until you take it off. My only complain is that it&#x27;s hard to sharpen and not mess up the color in the middle.</li>
            <li> LOVE this eyeliner, sad that Bare Minerals discontinued it. I purchased 4 to keep it around as long as I can. My only complaint is that they did not come in the box that they were sold in in stores, it just makes it harder to store them where I planned on storing them. No biggie.</li>
            <li> Best black eye liner ive ever used! Does smudge easily and is very vibrant.</li>
            <li> Aweful!! I&#x27;m actually shocked because all I buy is Bare Escentuls! This eyeliner is hard to apply and it smears very badly. It&#x27;s just a really bad product...</li>
            <li> It is hard to apply if the pencil is not sharp and you don&#x27;t have a steady hand. It will smear.</li>
            <li> I have oily lids and I have watery eyes so I&#x27;ve tried pretty much all waterproof eyeliners (gel, pencil) and other than Make Up For Ever gel cream eyeliner (which I think they no longer make because I can&#x27;t find it anymore!! )nothing stays put.  This is pretty good.  I got 8 pm (charcoal black), 9pm (choco brown) and midnight (dark black) Give it a shot.  I got it alot cheaper on Amazon than the makeup stores in the mall.</li>
            <li> I am an eye liner lover. I am always looking for really jet black colored eye liners who make you&#x27;re eyes look kind of mysterious and sexy  so , yes this eye liner did that and more.In other words I LOVED it !</li>
            <li> I have successfully used Bare Minerals powered products and had no problems with sensitivity. However the Round the Clock Eyeliner caused my eyes to burn almost as soon as I applied it. I tried using it as an under eye liner the next day, but got an even worse reaction. My eyes burned and turned bloodshot.</li>
            <li> i have used eye liner for years and have tried all kinds of waterproof.  this is by far the best.  doesn&#x27;t crease or crack.  really good stuff.</li>
            <li> I love eyeliner. I have tried so many different kinds and this is my absolute favorite! It is soft so it can be made into a thicker line. Other eyeliners are a dull black color, this one is a brigh black. It even lasts while swimming but if you need to take it off use Vaseline and it rubs right off. I will ever use any other liner!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t run and lasts all day. Does require sharpening often but I still love the product. Good price for it too.</li>
            <li> Love the product!!! Very fast and perfect packaging!!! Thank you 😍</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no problems applying this product and I like the way it delivers on being waterproof, but I am disappointed and frankly disgusted with the fact that it is IMPOSSIBLE to sharpen this pencil without making a huge, waterproof mess and without wasting a LOT of the pencil. It breaks off in the sharpener, requiring you to keep sharpening, which causes the pencil to keep breaking off . . . The product is good for only the first few uses, until you have to sharpen it. Then you might as well toss it out and get a self-sharpening pencil from the drug store.</li>
            <li> I need waterproof eye makeup and this works well with an eyeliner brush. It stays on very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it, I think you will like it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a long lasting really black eyeliner this is great.  Right on the edge of my eye it doesn&#x27;t move, but if I put it on my lashes at all it will end up smearing down my face.</li>
            <li> No good  at all  don&#x27;t put this on  in hot weather unless  you wanna  look like a raccoon in minutes I wish I sent this back to get my money back  but it&#x27;s a lesson learned Never again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased 4 of these eye liners in the past three years. I wear it every day, and that&#x27;s the only eyeliner I&#x27;ve purchased. There was a little debacle when my sharpener kept eating the pencil. (and the thing still lasted) I strongly suggest buying the BareMinerals sharpener to go with the pencil, since it&#x27;s so smooth (despite being a little more expensive, it&#x27;s made for the product and helps it last longer). I cannot brag enough about this. If you like black eyeliner and are sick of wasting money on it, this is the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the mess the sharpener leaves behind, but, hello, that&#x27;s not even a big deal!</li>
            <li> This stuff lasts and lasts and lasts...it just doesn&#x27;t come off ALLLLLL day!!  I love it!! My new best friend!</li>
            <li> I love the pencil that I can sharpen and the stores do not carry this anymore.</li>
            <li> I love bare escentuals products &amp; this is one of them. My eyes water just walking from the parking lot to the building I work in which is about 10 steps from my vehicle.</li>
            <li> I hate this.  I asked for a refund and got it.  I DO, however, love the provider of the product.  They contacted me IMMEDIATELY upon my bad review of the product and I had a full refund within a few days.&lt;br /&gt;My problem with the eyeliner is that it smears -- a lot.  I used it once and tossed it.&lt;br /&gt;Again -- thank you to the provider of the product for being so pro-active.  I will use the provider again -- and I love Bare Escenutals other products -- just not this one.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read carefully when I purchased this item. I didn&#x27;t realize it was waterproof. I still like it, but find myself being very careful when I put it on. A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Love this eyeliner. Great price</li>
            <li> Order arrived fast. Product wasn&#x27;t in its original box but was secured to protect it. It&#x27;s the legit real liner. I work in cosmetics and this stuff stays on my waterline all day and doesn&#x27;t bleed out. I&#x27;m bummed BE discontinued this. No other like it, I&#x27;ve tested about 20 and nothing compares.</li>
            <li> Very nice I love that it&#x27;s not no flimsy thing . I have another pencil eye liner n the first time I used it , the tip broke! But this eyeliner is great n last very long</li>
            <li> For someone with allergies, having a waterproof eyeliner is a staple anytime I go out. I was skeptical, but this baby delivers. Sure, a little tiny bit comes off if my eyes water up significantly, but all in all it stays put. On a good day (eyes not watering) I&#x27;ve applied at 9am and it&#x27;s still holding strong at 8pm. Love.This.Eyeliner!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this eyeliner. It is very bold and doesn&#x27;t smear or wear off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that the pencil needs to be sharpened a lot more than others I have used in the past. (Not Bare Minerals)</li>
            <li> i love this eyeliner its the best, is really soft n dark!!!! plus a very good price compare to other stores.. this was da 2nd time i order this eyerliner:) the 1st time i order 1 n dis time i 2 becuase my friend wanted 1 too.. thanks!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am really sorry that Bare Escentuals changed their eyeliner formula. The old midnight liner was like a nice powdery consistency that was easy to use and looked beautiful - my favorite! This version is soft and difficult to apply except in a garish line. Way to obvious and bright.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite eyeliners I have ever used, and that is saying something because I am big on eyeliner and have tried several different products. It is dark black and lasts a nice amount of time, and it also goes on very evenly and easily. I would definitely recommend this product to those who haven&#x27;t tried it.</li>
            <li> I love the original Bare Minerals eyeliner, so I was very excited when the waterproof came out. However, my hopes were quickly dashed when the pencil came off in thick clumps which made it very difficult to achieve a clean line. I tried smudging it to make at least it appear more straight and ended up looking like some kind of drug addict. I will be going back to my tried and true, even though it&#x27;s not waterproof.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite eyeliner ever. It&#x27;s creamy and glides on smoothly. It it&#x27;s truly long lasting and waterproof! I can&#x27;t use any other kind of eyeliner and be as satisfied as I am when I use this product.</li>
            <li> The main problem with this eyeliner is that it is too fat to make a fine line.  They need to develop it in a self sharpening product that will deliver a finer line.  It works great for using in the waterline, but not as a regular eyeliner.  The midnight black is definitely too black.  It might be great for gals in their twenties, but not for anyone over 50.  I will give it another try in a lighter color since it is definitely waterproof.  I have sensitive eyes, and this does not irritate at all.</li>
            <li> Love this eyeliner!  I love that it stays all day (even through tears or allergy eyes).  Sad Bare Minerals has discontinued it.</li>
