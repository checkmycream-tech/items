            <li>Works great on my hair</li>
            <li>so this product doesn&#x27;t work the best for me even when i just spray it on very lightly.</li>
            <li>Good job.</li>
            <li>it holds good for about 5 hours.</li>
            <li>Great that I was able till get this.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Once you try it you will love it!</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and does not make your hair crunchy or feel like it does when you put hair spray in it.</li>
            <li>but it gives it a nice hold.</li>
            <li>This gel is easy to put on and makes my hair look curly and nice without the crunchiness, which I love!  </li>
            <li>My hair is very fine</li>
            <li>Also, the fact that it&#x27;s alcohol free is another plus!</li>
            <li>U\\&quot; sulfate free shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li>Now I like the curling custard spray gel better but still use this off and on</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a cheaper alternative to the Deva gel I love, and this is not the same but the best alternative I&#x27;ve found for the price.</li>
            <li>We were glad to find it here.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad a can still find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It has OK hold</li>
            <li>My favorite spray gel.  </li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>The more you use, the crispier your hair will become.</li>
            <li>Tresemme&#x27;s spray gel is alcohol free, better for the hair, doesn&#x27;t leave the hair crispy, or with any sticky, product feeling.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many spray gels on my curly frizzy hair and this is the ONLY one I love!!</li>
            <li>The only spray gel I use - great smell, holds and not sticky.</li>
            <li>Creates a really good looking with no waste.</li>
            <li>I love it so much that once I heard it was discontinued and no longer in stores, I bought 4 on amazon to stock up!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>You have to have the right product, and then the curls can be</li>
            <li>but they really need to bring it back because it is just amazing.</li>
            <li>Why put that stuff in there in the first place?</li>
            <li>I used this for a certain hairstyle to make the curls defined and it absolutely worked.</li>
            <li>/&gt;(I have medium curly hair, that I straightened for years because it really takes knowing your hair and getting control when the hair&#x27;s curl wants to do</li>
            <li>My daughter has very curly hair that tends to be frizzy.  </li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t need much.  </li>
            <li>Works very well on my curly hair</li>
            <li>It might work better for those with thick full hair.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>It really did leave my hair soft and without the frizz</li>
            <li>Love the product but hate that they discontinued it and now have to pay so much more than it&#x27;s original retail price...</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, no alcohol and long lasting.</li>
            <li>This product makes her curls soft and her hair is frizz-free all day!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if Tresemme makes this any more</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have curly hair, but this product helps my fine hair hold my style when I use a curling iron or a hair dryer and a round brush.</li>
            <li>I love this because it doesnt leave my hair hard and crunchy</li>
            <li>Came as a two bottle package, a little sticky and heavy but holds curl fairly well.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>Pretty much my favorite gel and can hardly get it anywhere!!</li>
            <li>If you want the curls leave it, if you want a wave just use a defusser and start drying it from the bottom up on a warm slow speed and it will dry faster and just pick it out!</li>

            <li> This gel is easy to put on and makes my hair look curly and nice without the crunchiness, which I love!  Also, the fact that it&#x27;s alcohol free is another plus!</li>
            <li> This leaves my hair sticky and heavy when I spray it on wet hair.  Makes it difficult to scrunch while hair is wet. And It&#x27;s a bit crunchy after it air dries so you will have to remember to go back and scrunch out the cast after it&#x27;s fully dried to make it softer.  I may use this as a last resort if I don&#x27;t have anything else lying around.  It might work better for those with thick full hair.  My hair is very fine so this product doesn&#x27;t work the best for me even when i just spray it on very lightly.</li>
            <li> Love the product but hate that they discontinued it and now have to pay so much more than it&#x27;s original retail price...</li>
            <li> This is the stuff I&#x27;m talking about. In my review of Garnier&#x27;s product where I gave their gel only 1 star, I recommended this product. Tresemme&#x27;s spray gel is alcohol free, better for the hair, doesn&#x27;t leave the hair crispy, or with any sticky, product feeling. It really did leave my hair soft and without the frizz and I&#x27;m really happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;(I have medium curly hair, that I straightened for years because it really takes knowing your hair and getting control when the hair&#x27;s curl wants to do it&#x27;s thing.) You have to have the right product, and then the curls can be great.)&lt;br /&gt;((Walmart has \\&quot;Simply U\\&quot; sulfate free shampoo and conditioner! Value all around and great quality.))</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have curly hair, but this product helps my fine hair hold my style when I use a curling iron or a hair dryer and a round brush.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this locally anymore, have used it for a couple of years.  Now I like the curling custard spray gel better but still use this off and on, You can actually spray this on, the other you have to put on your hands and work it through.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I love it so much that once I heard it was discontinued and no longer in stores, I bought 4 on amazon to stock up!  I have naturally curly hair and this is the only thing that tamed it.</li>
            <li> When I wear my hair curly, this makes them extra curly and holds their shape. It&#x27;s a harder hold but looks soft. I wanted a cheaper alternative to the Deva gel I love, and this is not the same but the best alternative I&#x27;ve found for the price.</li>
            <li> I love this because it doesnt leave my hair hard and crunchy but it gives it a nice hold. I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Only spray gel my wife likes. We looked all over for it. We were glad to find it here.Good job.</li>
            <li> Bought this to try it I have naturally loose curly hair.  Gets frizzy in the heat.  Came as a two bottle package, a little sticky and heavy but holds curl fairly well.  Not my favorite.</li>
            <li> Pretty much my favorite gel and can hardly get it anywhere!! Thank goodness for Amazon.</li>
            <li> I used this for a certain hairstyle to make the curls defined and it absolutely worked. great product !! so happy I got the pack of 2 .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried out a lot of curl gels (the majority being more expensive than this product) and I always go back to Treseme! Great gel for the price and helps boost your curls without being crunchy when it dries.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, no alcohol and long lasting. Creates a really good looking with no waste. One of the best in Class.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have cury hair and it can be so hard to manage. This product along with other tresemme curl products gives me curls that last all day. It&#x27;s such a shame it has been discontinued! I&#x27;m glad a can still find it on Amazon.  It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, it does not work as well as the Garnier version of this product. I like the smell, though. It has OK hold and when I put it on my hair when it is wet it holds good for about 5 hours. I usually re- spray my hair a bit at lunchtime though.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair extremely stiff and horribly dry. It has no shine, and feels terrible to the touch.</li>
            <li> Works great on my hair I just spray it on and crunch it up and let it dry.  The next day all I need to do is spray it with water and it still works. If you want the curls leave it, if you want a wave just use a defusser and start drying it from the bottom up on a warm slow speed and it will dry faster and just pick it out!</li>
            <li> My favorite spray gel.  Discontinued!</li>
            <li> This product is great! My daughter has very curly hair that tends to be frizzy.  This product makes her curls soft and her hair is frizz-free all day! Love it...</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> The only spray gel I use - great smell, holds and not sticky.</li>
            <li> I am a Hispanic with constant frizz problems when it comes to curly/wavy hair in constant humidity weather. This product does miracles to my hair. I have been using this product for several years now and its sad they have taking it off the shelves at all local markets. I recommend this product to everyone with curls! Once you try it you will love it!</li>
            <li> Too bad they don&#x27;t make this anymore. Truly a great product with excellent volume and hold. Great that I was able till get this.</li>
            <li> Everything as expected.</li>
            <li> Gave it a try after reading reviews . It left my hair crunchy and sticky. I&#x27;ve tried watering it down so it won&#x27;t be so bad. I would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Very good gel spray for holding permed curls and reducing frizz.  Easy to apply and you don&#x27;t need much.  The more you use, the crispier your hair will become.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many spray gels on my curly frizzy hair and this is the ONLY one I love!! It smells amazing and does not make your hair crunchy or feel like it does when you put hair spray in it. I also curl my hair a lot using my straightener and this stuff works miracles for keeping my curls bouncy and in tact! I&#x27;m not sure if Tresemme makes this any more but they really need to bring it back because it is just amazing.</li>
            <li> Too bad it contains violet dye #2. Deal breaker for me as that stuff is made from coal tar, and arguably toxic. I&#x27;m a cancer survivor and not taking any chances. Why put that stuff in there in the first place?</li>
            <li> Works very well on my curly hair</li>
