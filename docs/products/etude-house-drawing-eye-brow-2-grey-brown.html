            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>but this is definitely the best eyebrow pencil I have used yet</li>

            <li>Nicely packed, good product, and fast delivery...</li>
            <li>I have pretty good brows in the front</li>
            <li>Color was pretty good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The spoole does does a pretty good job of smoothing out your brows.</li>
            <li>, it is a nice neutral shade of brown and isn&#x27;t overwhelming, you can&#x27;t overdo shading in your brows with this product, would stock up since it&#x27;s such a great price and prime shipping was so quick, thank you! :)</li>
            <li>The package looked so cute and came with two free samples of Etude house.</li>
            <li>Gives a great natural look.</li>
            <li>It is very long-lasting, good colors that look natural and great price.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to draw and the color looks very natural!!!!</li>
            <li>Perfect love the shade and the little spooley on the end</li>
            <li>Easy to draw my eye brow</li>
            <li>so it makes it easy to fill in ur brows</li>
            <li>Shape of point makes application easy.</li>
            <li>The angled tip makes shaping and filling in easy.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Easy to draw.</li>
            <li>and it was easy to apply (except for the breaking).</li>
            <li>I am very pleased to have found my new favorite eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li>The package came quicker than expected in very nice packaging with nice samples and everything.</li>
            <li>I would say this brow pencil is best for soft and natural looking brows and mostly for filling in.</li>
            <li>i bought in shade Gray Brown #2 and it suits PERFECTLY with black hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is black (or coffee brown :D )</li>
            <li>I super recommend this product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also super cheap :)</li>
            <li>Its more of an ashy brown color and not as warm which is really good for black hair.</li>
            <li>The little brush is perfect for blending in the color and grooming your brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Unique design with triangular tip, quick way to get believable brows.  </li>
            <li>redeeming quality was that it gave my eyebrows a nice sort of coverage that blended in well with the natural color of my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>It works perfectly to create a soft, natural look.</li>
            <li>It looks great on my Asian tan skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I liked it so much that I bought it again.</li>
            <li>The pencil itself is slanted and it makes a really soft appearance for your brows and the slanted applicator could be good for people who aren&#x27;t used to filling in their brows.</li>
            <li>The angled shape of the applicator is brilliant and the little spooly at the end is pretty nice.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very soft which is a good thing because it allows more control, plus you can build up to get a darker look.</li>
            <li>The slant of the pencil itself makes filling in your eyebrows very easy and fast.</li>
            <li>Happy with this purchase EXCEPT it too way too long to receive.</li>
            <li>love it so much!</li>
            <li>This shade is perfect for a natural daily look.  </li>
            <li>Arrived fast with some samples :-)</li>
            <li>But if I can do it right for the first time, I am sure everyone can use it.</li>
            <li>but this product does, its amazing especially for those natural day - my eyebrows but wayyy better :)</li>
            <li>If you have shaky hands or just have difficulty making your brows perfectly lined, you must purchase this!</li>
            <li>Came fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>It was a great color for my dark hair and cool skin tone.</li>
            <li>Love this product and it looks very natural !</li>
            <li>Easily replaces my box of wax + powder with two brushes, because it&#x27;s much easier to use.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend of the shades you are finding at CVS/Target not quite right, this is LOVELY.</li>
            <li>I would TOTALLY recommend , i love it !</li>
            <li>I do however, have to mention that if you&#x27;re wanting a more natural rather than a bold brow, you&#x27;re going to want to be light-handed with this.</li>
            <li>Although, the product is very buildable and can be worn light or darker.</li>
            <li>It looks a lot more natural than using a brush.</li>
            <li>I do love it for the natural looking shade that matches me so well.</li>
            <li>Love it make my eyebrows natural</li>
            <li>Was worth waiting for.  </li>
            <li>I prefer using these instead of eye shadow and an angled brush because it looks much more natural.</li>
            <li>( and it came a MONTH earlier than i expected it too :D )</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much cheaper, better packaged since it is twistable, same smoothness in application, and in a great flat shape tip.</li>
            <li>I have been using eye brow pencil for decades due to my blackish/brown/gray eye brows and finally found a product that is perfect.</li>
            <li>I was pretty excited the first time I used this pencil.</li>
            <li>the actual pencil part did not break so easily, I would say that this product would easily be in the 4-5 star range.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s just right</li>
            <li>Great color but very little product.</li>
            <li>The color is very natural looking and the formula goes on so smooth.  </li>
            <li>it shipped very fast.</li>
            <li>Definitely good for people with brown to dark brown hair!</li>
            <li>First of all the colors are off.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re worth the price and the shipping is surprisingly fast from China, I believe.</li>
            <li>Tip: If you want filled in, soft eyebrows then you have to gradually fill it in with this pencil.</li>
            <li>The grey-brown color matches my brow color exactly.  </li>
            <li>The line is transparent, yet deposits enough color to look believable, but not overdone.  </li>
            <li>I really appreciated!</li>
            <li>Thanks, Etude House!  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>You can get much more for the same price from NYX and E.L.F.</li>
            <li>At first I tried to color in my brow and the pencil didn&#x27;t worked.  </li>
            <li>It felt soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>(don&#x27;t think if i&#x27;m using the phrase right haha)</li>
            <li>Love the flat angled shape.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a perfect color for my dark brown, nearly black hair.</li>
            <li>I have dark, sparse brows and have always struggled to get them looking tidy.</li>
            <li>A little more reddish brown than greyish brown, but still more greyish brown than most pencils you&#x27;d find, so works well enough, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I love this, the wax with the brush on the other end really filled out my eyebrows while still making them look natural.</li>
            <li>I know maybe I can just buy better eye shadow, but I am kind of lazy and want to do my eyebrows as quickly as possibly.</li>
            <li>The pencil is very practice the brush is a little shorter than my previous pencil but the color is perfect</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not super pigmented which is a good thing if you want that natural eyebrow look.</li>
            <li>The grey brown is more brown than grey, but that&#x27;s good because who wants grey looking eyebrows..?</li>
            <li>A little darker than I expected, but very good.</li>
            <li>i really like this eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li>Consequently, I didn&#x27;t really get to use much of it.</li>
            <li>The inside part felt really brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Work very well.</li>
            <li>Not very obvious perfectly fit my brow&#x27;s color</li>
            <li>Took a while to get here (but reasonable).</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I freaked out since it looked like a taupe-grey-lavender sort of brown and was worried it would be too light especially for my medium complexion.</li>
            <li>I am very picky with eyebrow pencils.  </li>
            <li>I love how it has a slanted angel on the color part, and there&#x27;s a nice, stiff spoolie on the other.</li>
            <li>So I have to clean it on facial tissues occasionally.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Asian with black and dark brown hair and it blends into my eyebrows perfectly.</li>
            <li>color is good for me (Asian with black/ very dark brown</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Love the tip &amp; brush but the color was a little too orange/brown for me.</li>
            <li>Comes from South Korea--wish they&#x27;d state where product comes from--doesn&#x27;t really do much more than the eyebrow pencil from drug store--don&#x27;t waste your time and money</li>
            <li>normally I don&#x27;t write reviews</li>
            <li>Also, the quality of pencile is not as smooth as some other brands but for the price, I am not complaining.</li>
            <li>This is my new go-to eyebrow product.</li>
            <li>It was wrapped so I knew it was new and had a silver security tape on it.</li>
            <li>Love these pencils and received my package 10 days earlier then the expected date.</li>
            <li>It also looks very natural.</li>
            <li>The brush is very soft, but I don&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This color is a great shade for people with naturally black or really dark hair, it looks super natural and does not look too dark.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t know why the brush is necessary.</li>
            <li>Right now, my brow routine is pairing this brow pencil with a brow mascara to keep my brows tame and looking fresh.</li>
            <li>it creates a very soft and natural look.</li>
            <li>I always prefered grey brown over regular brown, which tend to have more red in it.  </li>
            <li>Most eyebrow pencils I&#x27;ve used has a red undertone which did not match my black hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a perfect match for natural undyed Asian hair, you know, because we have those soft light black eyebrows that look really angry when they&#x27;re drawn in with black or even dark brown, but they look out of place when drawn in with light brown.</li>
            <li>It gives a natural look, you will not look like you have drawn brows</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m a frequent business traveler so sometimes need to apply make-up on the go ie.</li>
            <li>but I understand since the distance is quite far.</li>
            <li>but I need to fill them in towards the end of my brows and these are really natural looking and work so well.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t look fake, and the formula applies nicely and isn&#x27;t too intense.</li>
            <li>It cuts the time in half, and it&#x27;s easily to apply outside home</li>
            <li>The only thing is that it is only about 2cm long even when I twist it till the click sound starts.</li>
            <li>I would have preferred if it were a little more on the grey side of brown instead of the warmer side.</li>
            <li>It has a beveled tip that makes it easy to create a narrow tip at end of brow and comb at opposite end for softening and finishing look.</li>
            <li>It runs out very quickly so buy at least 2-3 at once.  </li>
            <li>The colors are very close to the Anastasia pink pencil Medium Ash and Soft Brown color.  </li>
            <li>I would say its a very affordable version of the Anastasia Brow Wiz in Dark Brown.</li>
            <li>You wouldn&#x27;t think it would be difficult to find a good match for dark brown eyebrows, but it IS.</li>
            <li>It looks super natural and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or stiff.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> but this is definitely the best eyebrow pencil I have used yet</li>

            <li> Color was pretty good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The spoole does does a pretty good job of smoothing out your brows.</li>

            <li> The package looked so cute and came with two free samples of Etude house.</li>
            <li> Gives a great natural look.</li>
            <li> It is very long-lasting, good colors that look natural and great price.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to draw and the color looks very natural!!!!</li>
            <li> Perfect love the shade and the little spooley on the end</li>
            <li> Easy to draw my eye brow</li>
            <li> so it makes it easy to fill in ur brows</li>
            <li> Shape of point makes application easy.</li>
            <li> The angled tip makes shaping and filling in easy.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Easy to draw.</li>
            <li> and it was easy to apply (except for the breaking).</li>
            <li> I am very pleased to have found my new favorite eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li> The package came quicker than expected in very nice packaging with nice samples and everything.</li>
            <li> I would say this brow pencil is best for soft and natural looking brows and mostly for filling in.</li>
            <li> i bought in shade Gray Brown #2 and it suits PERFECTLY with black hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is black (or coffee brown :D )</li>
            <li> I super recommend this product!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also super cheap :)</li>
            <li> Its more of an ashy brown color and not as warm which is really good for black hair.</li>
            <li> The little brush is perfect for blending in the color and grooming your brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unique design with triangular tip, quick way to get believable brows.  </li>
            <li> redeeming quality was that it gave my eyebrows a nice sort of coverage that blended in well with the natural color of my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly to create a soft, natural look.</li>
            <li> It looks great on my Asian tan skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I liked it so much that I bought it again.</li>
            <li> The pencil itself is slanted and it makes a really soft appearance for your brows and the slanted applicator could be good for people who aren&#x27;t used to filling in their brows.</li>
            <li> The angled shape of the applicator is brilliant and the little spooly at the end is pretty nice.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very soft which is a good thing because it allows more control, plus you can build up to get a darker look.</li>
            <li> The slant of the pencil itself makes filling in your eyebrows very easy and fast.</li>
            <li> Happy with this purchase EXCEPT it too way too long to receive.</li>
            <li> love it so much!</li>
            <li> This shade is perfect for a natural daily look.  </li>
            <li> Arrived fast with some samples :-)</li>
            <li> But if I can do it right for the first time, I am sure everyone can use it.</li>
            <li> but this product does, its amazing especially for those natural day - my eyebrows but wayyy better :)</li>
            <li> If you have shaky hands or just have difficulty making your brows perfectly lined, you must purchase this!</li>
            <li> Came fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> It was a great color for my dark hair and cool skin tone.</li>
            <li> Love this product and it looks very natural !</li>
            <li> Easily replaces my box of wax + powder with two brushes, because it&#x27;s much easier to use.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend of the shades you are finding at CVS/Target not quite right, this is LOVELY.</li>
            <li> I would TOTALLY recommend , i love it !</li>
            <li> I do however, have to mention that if you&#x27;re wanting a more natural rather than a bold brow, you&#x27;re going to want to be light-handed with this.</li>
            <li> Although, the product is very buildable and can be worn light or darker.</li>
            <li> It looks a lot more natural than using a brush.</li>
            <li> I do love it for the natural looking shade that matches me so well.</li>
            <li> Love it make my eyebrows natural</li>
            <li> Was worth waiting for.  </li>
            <li> I prefer using these instead of eye shadow and an angled brush because it looks much more natural.</li>
            <li> ( and it came a MONTH earlier than i expected it too :D )</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much cheaper, better packaged since it is twistable, same smoothness in application, and in a great flat shape tip.</li>
            <li> I have been using eye brow pencil for decades due to my blackish/brown/gray eye brows and finally found a product that is perfect.</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited the first time I used this pencil.</li>
            <li> the actual pencil part did not break so easily, I would say that this product would easily be in the 4-5 star range.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s just right</li>
            <li> Great color but very little product.</li>
            <li> The color is very natural looking and the formula goes on so smooth.  </li>
            <li> it shipped very fast.</li>
            <li> Definitely good for people with brown to dark brown hair!</li>
            <li> First of all the colors are off.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re worth the price and the shipping is surprisingly fast from China, I believe.</li>
            <li> Tip: If you want filled in, soft eyebrows then you have to gradually fill it in with this pencil.</li>
            <li> The grey-brown color matches my brow color exactly.  </li>
            <li> The line is transparent, yet deposits enough color to look believable, but not overdone.  </li>
            <li> I really appreciated!</li>
            <li> Thanks, Etude House!  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> You can get much more for the same price from NYX and E.L.F.</li>
            <li> At first I tried to color in my brow and the pencil didn&#x27;t worked.  </li>
            <li> It felt soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> (don&#x27;t think if i&#x27;m using the phrase right haha)</li>
            <li> Love the flat angled shape.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a perfect color for my dark brown, nearly black hair.</li>
            <li> I have dark, sparse brows and have always struggled to get them looking tidy.</li>
            <li> A little more reddish brown than greyish brown, but still more greyish brown than most pencils you&#x27;d find, so works well enough, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I love this, the wax with the brush on the other end really filled out my eyebrows while still making them look natural.</li>
            <li> I know maybe I can just buy better eye shadow, but I am kind of lazy and want to do my eyebrows as quickly as possibly.</li>
            <li> The pencil is very practice the brush is a little shorter than my previous pencil but the color is perfect</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super pigmented which is a good thing if you want that natural eyebrow look.</li>
            <li> The grey brown is more brown than grey, but that&#x27;s good because who wants grey looking eyebrows..?</li>
            <li> A little darker than I expected, but very good.</li>
            <li> i really like this eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li> Consequently, I didn&#x27;t really get to use much of it.</li>
            <li> The inside part felt really brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Work very well.</li>
            <li> Not very obvious perfectly fit my brow&#x27;s color</li>
            <li> Took a while to get here (but reasonable).</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I freaked out since it looked like a taupe-grey-lavender sort of brown and was worried it would be too light especially for my medium complexion.</li>
            <li> I am very picky with eyebrow pencils.  </li>
            <li> I love how it has a slanted angel on the color part, and there&#x27;s a nice, stiff spoolie on the other.</li>
            <li> So I have to clean it on facial tissues occasionally.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian with black and dark brown hair and it blends into my eyebrows perfectly.</li>
            <li> color is good for me (Asian with black/ very dark brown</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Love the tip &amp; brush but the color was a little too orange/brown for me.</li>
            <li> Comes from South Korea--wish they&#x27;d state where product comes from--doesn&#x27;t really do much more than the eyebrow pencil from drug store--don&#x27;t waste your time and money</li>
            <li> normally I don&#x27;t write reviews</li>
            <li> Also, the quality of pencile is not as smooth as some other brands but for the price, I am not complaining.</li>
            <li> This is my new go-to eyebrow product.</li>
            <li> It was wrapped so I knew it was new and had a silver security tape on it.</li>
            <li> Love these pencils and received my package 10 days earlier then the expected date.</li>
            <li> It also looks very natural.</li>
            <li> The brush is very soft, but I don&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This color is a great shade for people with naturally black or really dark hair, it looks super natural and does not look too dark.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t know why the brush is necessary.</li>
            <li> Right now, my brow routine is pairing this brow pencil with a brow mascara to keep my brows tame and looking fresh.</li>
            <li> it creates a very soft and natural look.</li>
            <li> I always prefered grey brown over regular brown, which tend to have more red in it.  </li>
            <li> Most eyebrow pencils I&#x27;ve used has a red undertone which did not match my black hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a perfect match for natural undyed Asian hair, you know, because we have those soft light black eyebrows that look really angry when they&#x27;re drawn in with black or even dark brown, but they look out of place when drawn in with light brown.</li>
            <li> It gives a natural look, you will not look like you have drawn brows</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m a frequent business traveler so sometimes need to apply make-up on the go ie.</li>
            <li> but I understand since the distance is quite far.</li>
            <li> but I need to fill them in towards the end of my brows and these are really natural looking and work so well.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look fake, and the formula applies nicely and isn&#x27;t too intense.</li>
            <li> It cuts the time in half, and it&#x27;s easily to apply outside home</li>
            <li> The only thing is that it is only about 2cm long even when I twist it till the click sound starts.</li>
            <li> I would have preferred if it were a little more on the grey side of brown instead of the warmer side.</li>
            <li> It has a beveled tip that makes it easy to create a narrow tip at end of brow and comb at opposite end for softening and finishing look.</li>
            <li> It runs out very quickly so buy at least 2-3 at once.  </li>
            <li> The colors are very close to the Anastasia pink pencil Medium Ash and Soft Brown color.  </li>
            <li> I would say its a very affordable version of the Anastasia Brow Wiz in Dark Brown.</li>
            <li> You wouldn&#x27;t think it would be difficult to find a good match for dark brown eyebrows, but it IS.</li>
            <li> It looks super natural and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or stiff.</li>
            <li> The color was right but the pencil itself is too hard.</li>
            <li> I have tried pencils, powders, and brow mascaras, each with some success and failure.</li>
            <li> The amount of wax you get is less than half the size of the cap!&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the price if you ask me.</li>
            <li> It turns out that there really isn&#x27;t much material in the holder, and at least 50% of the material in my pencil broke off, so I feel like I barely got to use this at all before it was gone.</li>
            <li> The dark brown color doesn&#x27;t have any red tint in it that other brown eyebrow pencils tend to have, it is very dark.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it may not last as long.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still hard enough so that you don&#x27;t get too much color on your eyebrows.</li>
            <li> but it seems that it won&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Right - Anastasia Soft Brown black pencil</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that its hard to be as exact as some other products</li>
            <li> Though it is not as long lasting as its much more expensive counterparts, the color is subtle and natural.</li>
            <li> My brows finally match my dark hair properly.  </li>
            <li> The I bought the grey brown</li>
            <li> The grey brown just came in today and j cant wait to try it.</li>
            <li> I bought #2 grey brown.</li>
            <li> Grey brown isn&#x27;t grey at all.</li>
            <li> color doesn&#x27;t come out too much so that makes it easier to build the color on slowly.</li>
            <li> Too difficult to color the eyebrow, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s original product</li>
            <li> the brow pen &#x27;lead&#x27; was about 3/4 inch long!</li>
            <li> I have used many brands of eye pencils and I have never in my 50 years of using products encountered such a bad product.  </li>
            <li> It was so dry that it kept skipping when I tried to apply it.</li>
            <li> Especially if you have darker eyebrows but don&#x27;t want to fill them in too dark.</li>
            <li> I have silver hair mixed with dark brown/black - and this combination does the trick for me</li>
            <li> brown#1&lt;br /&gt;Bottom - étude grey brown #2&lt;br /&gt;Left - Anastasia Medium Ash pink pencil</li>
            <li> but I should have gotten grey; grey brown is a little too dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it too soft or too hard either, though I tend to like harder brow pencils.</li>
            <li> I bought the #1 dark brown as well as #2 grey brown.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got both #1 dark brown and #2 grey brown.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that the tip of the pen easily gets dirty as I probably have some foundation on my skin before applying this.</li>
            <li> Thirdly these pencils break off or turn to mush and small pieces</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t wanna look like a drag queen, this is a must-have!</li>
            <li> eyebrow pencil has two sides, one is where you use to draw and the other is a spoolie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I never draw my eye browse before, so I don&#x27;t have other products to compare with.</li>
            <li> but i think it may depend on how active you</li>
            <li> It is so hard to find an eyebrow pencil in brown that is not RED.  </li>
            <li> the picture:&lt;br /&gt;Top - étude dark</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ashy dark brown.</li>
            <li> I am Asian with black hair and black eyebrows and my eyebrow hairs are fairly thick.</li>
            <li> I have used the dark brown and black version of these because I could never figure out which one matched my hair&#x27;s tone</li>
            <li> , I have dark brown also black hair.</li>
            <li> The overall design actually makes it difficult to overdo it.  </li>
            <li> I have black hair</li>
            <li> but it cracked in half already</li>
            <li> I have black hair and eye browse.</li>
            <li> The colors are a little dark</li>
            <li> However, after I used it a few times I got the hang of it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months now</li>
            <li> I do wish the &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; (a bit of stiff pipe cleaner) was a little softer and maybe angled, but it&#x27;s...literally a pipe cleaner.</li>
            <li> Hmm... not sure if this is just mine, but mine kept breaking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I did reach the bottom</li>
            <li> , it was DRIED OUT!</li>
            <li> You have to press so hard to get any coverage that it pulls your eyebrows out.</li>
            <li> The pencil isn&#x27;t as hard as a wood brow pencil</li>
            <li> the pencil is very hard to use and not easy to draw</li>
            <li> my problem, the deal breaker, is that there is very little product!</li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed by their products, especially for the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i am no longer buying expensive</li>
            <li> Sorry I cannot recommend.</li>
            <li> I think ill get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it began to crumble and break almost immediately.</li>
            <li> I am not very good at using it and have horrible eyebrows that never want to cooperate with me.</li>
            <li> Totally disappointed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great color but very little product.</li>
            <li> This product makes my eyebrows perfectly.  Most eyebrow pencils I&#x27;ve used has a red undertone which did not match my black hair but this product does, its amazing especially for those natural day - my eyebrows but wayyy better :)</li>
            <li> Happy with this purchase EXCEPT it too way too long to receive.</li>
            <li> I love how it has a slanted angel on the color part, and there&#x27;s a nice, stiff spoolie on the other. The I bought the grey brown and it&#x27;s a perfect color for my dark brown, nearly black hair. Doesn&#x27;t look fake, and the formula applies nicely and isn&#x27;t too intense.</li>
            <li> Need practice with this brow enhancer.  Color is true and perfect.</li>
            <li> This is just a terrific eyebrow pencil.  The color is very natural looking and the formula goes on so smooth.  The slanted shape of the pencil makes it very easy to fill in your arches.  I am very pleased to have found my new favorite eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li> i really like this eyebrow pencil. the color works on me. it shipped very fast.</li>
            <li> 3 1/2 stars.  It runs out very quickly so buy at least 2-3 at once.  Also, the quality of pencile is not as smooth as some other brands but for the price, I am not complaining.</li>
            <li> Love this color! Especially if you have darker eyebrows but don&#x27;t want to fill them in too dark.</li>
            <li> Arrived way earlier than estimated date.&lt;br /&gt;The draw in pen is just absolutely amazing. It is a bit obaque but that is what makes the pen flawless.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this instead of my anastasia&#x27;s brow wiz and i like that it creates a very soft and natural look. would totally get this again cuz i think it gives you more bang for the buck (don&#x27;t think if i&#x27;m using the phrase right haha)</li>
            <li> excellent color...hard to find!  Love this product.</li>
            <li> it is wonderful brow pencil for the price. i am no longer buying expensive but so so pencil from department stores any more.</li>
            <li> First of all the colors are off.  Secondly it took forever to arrive.  Thirdly these pencils break off or turn to mush and small pieces fall on my floor.  I have used many brands of eye pencils and I have never in my 50 years of using products encountered such a bad product.  Sorry I cannot recommend.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love! It has a beveled tip that makes it easy to create a narrow tip at end of brow and comb at opposite end for softening and finishing look.</li>
            <li> Love the flat angled shape. Helps with shaping the brows. Wish they had it in lighter brown/blonde shades too!</li>
            <li> I have been using eye brow pencil for decades due to my blackish/brown/gray eye brows and finally found a product that is perfect. This product blends in perfectly every time, easy to use and is reasonably priced.  I just purchased 4 additional pencils. Love the texture, application and the results.</li>
            <li> easy to apply, nice color</li>
            <li> The color is nice and easy to apply but it is very easy to break.</li>
            <li> MY FAVES!!! I do wish the &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; (a bit of stiff pipe cleaner) was a little softer and maybe angled, but it&#x27;s...literally a pipe cleaner. They&#x27;re worth the price and the shipping is surprisingly fast from China, I believe.</li>
            <li> The color was right but the pencil itself is too hard. You have to press so hard to get any coverage that it pulls your eyebrows out. Ouch!!!</li>
            <li> A little more reddish brown than greyish brown, but still more greyish brown than most pencils you&#x27;d find, so works well enough, especially for the price. I bought &amp;#34;grey-brown #2.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is then best eyebrow pencil for natural looking eyebrows. And it comes with a spooly for grooming your brows. Definitely good for people with brown to dark brown hair!</li>
            <li> This liner makes brow lining easy for anyone! If you have shaky hands or just have difficulty making your brows perfectly lined, you must purchase this! Saves me time and definitely gives awesome result. It gives a natural look, you will not look like you have drawn brows which I notice a lot of times when I&#x27;m within 3 ft of anyone that lined their brows with another product.  If you don&#x27;t wanna look like a drag queen, this is a must-have! It takes time to receive product, so I&#x27;d order about 2-3 a time.</li>
            <li> Tip: If you want filled in, soft eyebrows then you have to gradually fill it in with this pencil. It&#x27;s not super pigmented which is a good thing if you want that natural eyebrow look.</li>
            <li> It is very long-lasting, good colors that look natural and great price. Spooly at one end is convenient.</li>
            <li> I have dark, sparse brows and have always struggled to get them looking tidy. I have tried pencils, powders, and brow mascaras, each with some success and failure. I stumbled upon Étude House while researching Korean skincare. I have not been disappointed by their products, especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the formula and shape of this brow pencil. It just makes sense. I do however, have to mention that if you&#x27;re wanting a more natural rather than a bold brow, you&#x27;re going to want to be light-handed with this. Right now, my brow routine is pairing this brow pencil with a brow mascara to keep my brows tame and looking fresh. I will repurchase!</li>
            <li> Hmm... not sure if this is just mine, but mine kept breaking. Consequently, I didn&#x27;t really get to use much of it. The inside part felt really brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One redeeming quality was that it gave my eyebrows a nice sort of coverage that blended in well with the natural color of my eyebrows. Not greasy or overly bold, which was a great plus for me. I also really liked the slanted angle of the pencil part. It helped with the application process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the actual pencil part did not break so easily, I would say that this product would easily be in the 4-5 star range.</li>
            <li> Easy to draw my eye brow</li>
            <li> This is my new go-to eyebrow product. The pencil tip has a narrower and wider end to taper strokes and fill in details and the brush helps to blend. It looks super natural and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or stiff. This color matches me perfectly and it lasts pretty well even if I dance and sweat for an hour+</li>
            <li> Perfect love the shade and the little spooley on the end</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a product for my skinny, over-plucked brows.  This is it.  The grey-brown color matches my brow color exactly.  The line is transparent, yet deposits enough color to look believable, but not overdone.  I like the shape of tip - it makes it easier to fill in sparse areas.  The overall design actually makes it difficult to overdo it.  Awesome product.</li>
            <li> Great color for my brows. I&#x27;m Asian with black and dark brown hair and it blends into my eyebrows perfectly. The staying power is so so. If I rub it, it will come off so I have to make sure I don&#x27;t touch or scratch my brows.</li>
            <li> Very good pencil for the price.  Came fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> It arrived much earlier than the estimated date! The package looked so cute and came with two free samples of Etude house. I really appreciated! My sister recommended it to me two years ago. and I&#x27;ve been using this eye brow pencil since then. I love the design and the color. It is very easy to draw and the color looks very natural!!!! I super recommend this product! love it so much!</li>
            <li> Arrived fast with some samples :-) and the color is great and had a nice natural look its angled so it makes it easy to fill in ur brows</li>
            <li> Perfect color without a hint of red. One application lasts all day. Shape of point makes application easy. Better than anything I have ever tried. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It is so hard to find an eyebrow pencil in brown that is not RED.  This is just a great color for those of us with cooler undertones.  Win!  Thanks, Etude House!  It&#x27;s affordable, too!</li>
            <li> This is a great eyebrow pencil. The angled tip makes shaping and filling in easy. Gives a great natural look. Terrific product for the price. I prefer it to my Anastasia pencil. I ordered two more.</li>
            <li> Came pretty quickly and the color is perfect. I am not very good at using it and have horrible eyebrows that never want to cooperate with me. I think ill get the hang of it. It looks a lot more natural than using a brush. The grey brown just came in today and j cant wait to try it.</li>
            <li> Work very well. Easy to apply. At first I didn&#x27;t know why the brush is necessary. After trying it out, now I use the brush almost every time.&lt;br /&gt;The color is good for me (Asian with black/ very dark brown hair).&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint is that the tip of the pen easily gets dirty as I probably have some foundation on my skin before applying this. So I have to clean it on facial tissues occasionally.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good staple. Easily replaces my box of wax + powder with two brushes, because it&#x27;s much easier to use. One of my KPIs is the time required for this step. It cuts the time in half, and it&#x27;s easily to apply outside home (I&#x27;m a frequent business traveler so sometimes need to apply make-up on the go ie. in restrooms of airports).</li>
            <li> The product arrived promptly. I do love it for the natural looking shade that matches me so well. I don&#x27;t find it too soft or too hard either, though I tend to like harder brow pencils. The only thing is that it is only about 2cm long even when I twist it till the click sound starts. I&#x27;m not sure if I did reach the bottom but it seems that it won&#x27;t last very long. This where I took a star off.</li>
            <li> This is a great eye brow liner! I always prefered grey brown over regular brown, which tend to have more red in it.  Will buy again.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> You wouldn&#x27;t think it would be difficult to find a good match for dark brown eyebrows, but it IS. This Etude pencil is the PERFECT cool neutral shade for my brows at a very affordable price. Highly recommend of the shades you are finding at CVS/Target not quite right, this is LOVELY.</li>
            <li> Beautiful slant to pen, seems it is made in Korea or someplace like that, but a very nice pencil</li>
            <li> The pencil is very practice the brush is a little shorter than my previous pencil but the color is perfect 👌 I love it n it last the hole day.  It also looks very natural. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I am Asian with black hair and black eyebrows and my eyebrow hairs are fairly thick. I bought the #1 dark brown as well as #2 grey brown. I think that the gray brown suits me more. The grey brown is more brown than grey, but that&#x27;s good because who wants grey looking eyebrows..? The dark brown color doesn&#x27;t have any red tint in it that other brown eyebrow pencils tend to have, it is very dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color doesn&#x27;t come out too much so that makes it easier to build the color on slowly. You don&#x27;t want that painted-on-eyebrow look do you? Unless that is what you&#x27;re going for, I don&#x27;t suggest buying this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eyebrow pencil has two sides, one is where you use to draw and the other is a spoolie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again :)</li>
            <li> Love the tip &amp; brush but the color was a little too orange/brown for me. If I had lighter hair I think it would be much better!</li>
            <li> I love this eyebrow pencil!  It looks great on my Asian tan skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got both #1 dark brown and #2 grey brown. In my opinion, the colors are almost the same. I am a devoted user of the Anastasia eyebrow pencil for the last 6yrs, but I am switching over to étude. It&#x27;s much cheaper, better packaged since it is twistable, same smoothness in application, and in a great flat shape tip. The colors are very close to the Anastasia pink pencil Medium Ash and Soft Brown color.  See the picture below for the side by side comparison. The brush is very soft, but I don&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the picture:&lt;br /&gt;Top - étude dark brown#1&lt;br /&gt;Bottom - étude grey brown #2&lt;br /&gt;Left - Anastasia Medium Ash pink pencil&lt;br /&gt;Right - Anastasia Soft Brown black pencil</li>
            <li> An absolutely perfect shade for cool tone brunettes, my eyebrows look very natural and the triangle tip provides nice precision. Will repurchase.</li>
            <li> I like the angel shape of the pencil it gives you great pointed end of ur eyebrows! Excelent!</li>
            <li> My hair is dyed black/brown and this is a great shade to match.  It&#x27;s not very soft which is a good thing because it allows more control, plus you can build up to get a darker look.</li>
            <li> Love this product and it looks very natural ! It was wrapped so I knew it was new and had a silver security tape on it. It took a while to get here but I understand since the distance is quite far. I would buy this product from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Perfect color for my brown/black hair - love this product and price is unbeatable.  Use to use Brenda Christian but I have converted to this eye brow pencil...</li>
            <li> Love it make my eyebrows natural</li>
            <li> This pencil is absolutely perfect for me!! I have pretty good brows in the front but I need to fill them in towards the end of my brows and these are really natural looking and work so well. This color is a great shade for people with naturally black or really dark hair, it looks super natural and does not look too dark.</li>
            <li> Unique design with triangular tip, quick way to get believable brows.  Grey/brown is a good color. Will repurchase.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s alright, the pencil is very hard to use and not easy to draw</li>
            <li> I would have preferred if it were a little more on the grey side of brown instead of the warmer side.</li>
            <li> A little darker than I expected, but very good. I will try brown one also.</li>
            <li> Not very obvious perfectly fit my brow&#x27;s color I love it</li>
            <li> Too difficult to color the eyebrow, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s original product</li>
            <li> Easy to draw. Impressed.</li>
            <li> The colors are a little dark but this is definitely the best eyebrow pencil I have used yet</li>
            <li> the brow pen &#x27;lead&#x27; was about 3/4 inch long!</li>
            <li> Love these pencils and received my package 10 days earlier then the expected date. Will order again!</li>
            <li> I bought #2 grey brown. It&#x27;s a perfect match for natural undyed Asian hair, you know, because we have those soft light black eyebrows that look really angry when they&#x27;re drawn in with black or even dark brown, but they look out of place when drawn in with light brown. Grey brown isn&#x27;t grey at all. It&#x27;s an ashy dark brown. The pencil isn&#x27;t as hard as a wood brow pencil but it&#x27;s still hard enough so that you don&#x27;t get too much color on your eyebrows. The little brush is perfect for blending in the color and grooming your brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also super cheap :)</li>
            <li> I love this, the wax with the brush on the other end really filled out my eyebrows while still making them look natural. I have black hair but I should have gotten grey; grey brown is a little too dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But my problem, the deal breaker, is that there is very little product! The amount of wax you get is less than half the size of the cap!&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the price if you ask me. You can get much more for the same price from NYX and E.L.F.</li>
            <li> It took over a month for this product to ship but I finally got it and attempted to use it, it was DRIED OUT! It was so dry that it kept skipping when I tried to apply it. Totally disappointed.</li>
            <li> At first I tried to color in my brow and the pencil didn&#x27;t worked.  It only work side way like drawing the brow with the pencil.  It felt soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Great buy! Compares to name brand eyebrow pencils... for a fraction of the price!!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think this would be very good at first.  However, after I used it a few times I got the hang of it.  It doesn&#x27;t go on very smoothly though.  Color was pretty good.</li>
            <li> Took a while to get here (but reasonable). Was worth waiting for.  I have silver hair mixed with dark brown/black - and this combination does the trick for me</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited the first time I used this pencil. It was a great color for my dark hair and cool skin tone. Unfortunately it began to crumble and break almost immediately. It turns out that there really isn&#x27;t much material in the holder, and at least 50% of the material in my pencil broke off, so I feel like I barely got to use this at all before it was gone. It lasted about 3 weeks using it once daily. It was cheap, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll order it again even though the color was great and it was easy to apply (except for the breaking).</li>
            <li> i like the angled pencil but it cracked in half already</li>
            <li> I love it! I have black hair and eye browse. It works perfectly to create a soft, natural look. It last all day (didn&#x27;t get a chance to wear it in the rain or sweat day though). I never draw my eye browse before, so I don&#x27;t have other products to compare with.But if I can do it right for the first time, I am sure everyone can use it. Will definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> My brows finally match my dark hair properly.  This shade is perfect for a natural daily look.  The angled shape of the applicator is brilliant and the little spooly at the end is pretty nice.  This will probably be my go-to brow pencil from now on.</li>
            <li> Comes from South Korea--wish they&#x27;d state where product comes from--doesn&#x27;t really do much more than the eyebrow pencil from drug store--don&#x27;t waste your time and money</li>
            <li> I prefer using these instead of eye shadow and an angled brush because it looks much more natural. I know maybe I can just buy better eye shadow, but I am kind of lazy and want to do my eyebrows as quickly as possibly.</li>
            <li> i bought in shade Gray Brown #2 and it suits PERFECTLY with black hair. My hair is black (or coffee brown :D ) but this color matches it perfectly with a hint of the black(gray) and brown. For me it stays on all day but i think it may depend on how active you are.sweaty. I would TOTALLY recommend , i love it ! ( and it came a MONTH earlier than i expected it too :D ) things from Asia tend to take longer but this one was a quick shipping and came in great condition :)</li>
            <li> This product is very good. The slant of the pencil itself makes filling in your eyebrows very easy and fast. I didn&#x27;t know when I ordered this but it actually comes with a spolie at the end so that you can groom your eyebrows after applying the product. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months now and I liked it so much that I bought it again. I would say its a very affordable version of the Anastasia Brow Wiz in Dark Brown. I like it more than the Anastasia pencil because its 1/5 of the price but also the color is a lot nicer. Its more of an ashy brown color and not as warm which is really good for black hair. The pencil itself is slanted and it makes a really soft appearance for your brows and the slanted applicator could be good for people who aren&#x27;t used to filling in their brows. I decided to buy this over the Anastasia pencil because it&#x27;s almost equal results and I like the color a lot more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spoole does does a pretty good job of smoothing out your brows. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that its hard to be as exact as some other products and it may not last as long. I would say this brow pencil is best for soft and natural looking brows and mostly for filling in. Although, the product is very buildable and can be worn light or darker. I&#x27;ve bought this pencil twice now and I will probably buy it again. The package came quicker than expected in very nice packaging with nice samples and everything.</li>
            <li> Nicely packed, good product, and fast delivery...</li>
            <li> normally I don&#x27;t write reviews but I absolutely loved this product! I have used the dark brown and black version of these because I could never figure out which one matched my hair&#x27;s tone, I have dark brown also black hair. This worked out amazingly, swatched on my hand I freaked out since it looked like a taupe-grey-lavender sort of brown and was worried it would be too light especially for my medium complexion. But it&#x27;s just right, it is a nice neutral shade of brown and isn&#x27;t overwhelming, you can&#x27;t overdo shading in your brows with this product, would stock up since it&#x27;s such a great price and prime shipping was so quick, thank you! :)</li>
            <li> Bought another one immediately. Good product.</li>
            <li> I am very picky with eyebrow pencils.  This one works great.  Stays on despite oily skin</li>
            <li> Though it is not as long lasting as its much more expensive counterparts, the color is subtle and natural. Great product for beginners.</li>
