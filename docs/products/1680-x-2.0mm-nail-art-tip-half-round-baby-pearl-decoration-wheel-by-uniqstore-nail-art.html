            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected. :o</li>
            <li> The cost is so minimal it is not worth returning, but I wanted other buyers to be aware.</li>

            <li> gives a little extra to your nail art, and the price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> but they were a little smaller than I wanted</li>
            <li> The colors are the same and they are neatly packaged in a round wheel.</li>
            <li> Plus they came faster than I expected.</li>
            <li> They sent my order to the wrong address and instead of maybe sending another one out to the right address they tell me there is nothing they can do about it...</li>
            <li> There are only a few black pearls in the wheel.  </li>
            <li> They are 1mm which makes them pretty useless for my project.</li>
            <li> but other</li>
            <li> The beads game quickly but not a good deal.</li>
            <li> the reason I ordered this wheel is because I wanted black.  </li>
            <li> I will have to order black pearls from another vendor.</li>
            <li> Plus, there are little to none pearls in each section like the picture.</li>
            <li> DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li> They are small it took along time to come.</li>
            <li> Very few of the pearl decorations in package.</li>
            <li> At least they won&#x27;t get ripped off.</li>
            <li> Wish I had read the reviews, which I usually do!  </li>
            <li> Im not that mad because they can still be used and its not THAT bad.</li>
            <li> I was quite disappointed.  </li>
            <li> However, I was completely disappointed when they came</li>
            <li> I HATE IT</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Was very excited for this product to take it to my nail salon and use. However received it today and it clearly states 1,680 x 2.0 mm. There is no way in hell 1,680 baby pearls are inside of here. 1680 divided by 12 is 140 pearls per section. my red section has 14 pearls, my blue has 17 take a look at the picture, I&#x27;m pretty sure with all 12 sections combined there isn&#x27;t 140 pearls. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Didnt like it much expected more from the product</li>
            <li> So cute! gives a little extra to your nail art, and the price can&#x27;t be beat! I get lots of compliments on my nails when I use these.</li>
            <li> Looks nothing like the picture shown. Very few of the pearl decorations in package. Will not order this product again.</li>
            <li> Love the colors but was not as full as shown in the picture</li>
            <li> Wish I had read the reviews, which I usually do!  Mine arrived today and I got a total of 160, I guess their machines can&#x27;t count.  It&#x27;s a good thing it was so cheap. I will be sure to show all the people who were waiting to see what mine looked like before they bought some.  At least they won&#x27;t get ripped off.</li>
            <li> This picture is misleading. There are probably about 100 beads in there if that many. 99cents, you get what you pay for. The beads game quickly but not a good deal.</li>
            <li> They should have come with more of them. I combined the two in one and had an extra wheel to use for something else. They are cute!</li>
            <li> Should have read the reviews. The wheel has about 15 beads of each color. Not really helpful for nail designs since you can&#x27;t use more than one of each color per nail.</li>
            <li> Picture not the same as the product</li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t even half as many pearls in the container as they said. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY. The good reviews are placed by them just trying to get you to buy from there company.</li>
            <li> The colors are so pretty! Easy to use! Shipping was very fast and the price was Great! I would recommend these to anyone who wants pearls on their nails!</li>
            <li> i love the variety and size of these nail decorations i have short nails and the colors are great!!! the price for all you get is fabulous!!!</li>
            <li> Great for adding touches to center of flowers or other stamped designs on my handmade cards.</li>
            <li> They are small it took along time to come.</li>
            <li> THERE WAS HARDLEY ANY PEARLS IN THERE  VERY DISSAPPOINTED AND STILL DISSAPPOINTED I HATE IT</li>
            <li> I wish they were bigger</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Good quality</li>
            <li> In the picture, the pearls look way bigger. When I received them it came early which was a plus but it looks like a thing you can buy at the dollar store. Plus, there are little to none pearls in each section like the picture. They are verryy little and look cheap. Im not that mad because they can still be used and its not THAT bad.</li>
            <li> Cute is coming only 200 less than what it says&lt;br /&gt;the color blue is repeated three times the shipping it&#x27;s fast</li>
            <li> A little mixed up from shipping but very nice</li>
            <li> This things are huge and great for that low of a price and they also came earlier than expected</li>
            <li> This product is okay. It arrived quickly and everything was great. I opened the package and the pearls were mixed with the other colors and there were barely any in each section. I counted them (yes I am like that) and there were only about 1000 instead of the full amount. I&#x27;m still going to use the pearls for nail art but I&#x27;m not going to buy from this seller again. Just spend a little more money and get stuff from good sellers or the actual company itself, you will get a lot better products and won&#x27;t get ripped off for the cheap price.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed and wanted</li>
            <li> This was nothing close to 1680 pieces... more like 168 pieces. The cost was good even if it was 168 pieces, but that&#x27;s not what the title says. Other than that, the product is good.</li>
            <li> These came just as picture! Very happy with my order and the process was easy. Love when I get what they picture and describe!</li>
            <li> The pearls make your nails look very pretty...well worth the wait and exactly as shown in the picture &#x3D;] Its a good buy!</li>
            <li> the reason I ordered this wheel is because I wanted black.  There are only a few black pearls in the wheel.  Maybe they fell out or something.  I was quite disappointed.  I will have to order black pearls from another vendor.</li>
            <li> I love them and so do my clients</li>
            <li> I love these for nail designs</li>
            <li> Awesome and perfect size for what I need.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected. :o(</li>
            <li> These are not 2mm pearls. They are 1mm which makes them pretty useless for my project. The cost is so minimal it is not worth returning, but I wanted other buyers to be aware.</li>
            <li> It was just as described. The colors are the same and they are neatly packaged in a round wheel. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love these, they are all nice colors and a good size, they look really cute on nails! Plus they came faster than I expected.</li>
            <li> Got it weeks earlier super happy with my products! Would definitely buy from this seller again and recommend to others</li>
            <li> They sent my order to the wrong address and instead of maybe sending another one out to the right address they tell me there is nothing they can do about it...</li>
            <li> I really liked this product my only problem was it took awhile to get it but other then that Im satisfied... Yes I would recommend this item and company to others</li>
            <li> These beads are so cute! Perfect for my nail art designs. Haven&#x27;t used them yet but so far, no complaints (:</li>
            <li> I opened my package and all the pearls were mixed with each other and everytime i turned the wheel pearls fell out. DONT BUY THIS</li>
            <li> The colors are the same as in the picture, they are small enough to fit nicely on my nails, and they stick well once placed. The paint doesn&#x27;t chip off of them, either, so that&#x27;s pretty nice!</li>
            <li> I love the colors of these pearls as they are not like the other glossy or shiny ones. They are the perfect size and can stick very well to the nails as they are only half round. Plus, there are plenty of them!</li>
            <li> I like the product but they were a little smaller than I wanted but I will still use them! Good product</li>
            <li> It is a good prouduct just not what I thought it would be next time I will have to just go to a craft store.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Good price.</li>
            <li> pearls come in different sizes but cute nevertheless.&lt;br /&gt;the smaller pearls are easy to apply and look cute on nails.</li>
            <li> After reading the mostly positive reviews and seeing the picture, I was excited for these to come in. However, I was completely disappointed when they came in!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: Came in on time.&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Barely looks like anything like the picture - little to no pearls in each section, every time I turn the wheel pearls come out, different colored pearls mixed with each other.</li>
