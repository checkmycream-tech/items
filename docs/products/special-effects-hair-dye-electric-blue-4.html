    <ol>
            <li>it does great on her hair.great product!!</li>
            <li>It said on the bottle \\&quot;works best with bleached hair\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>color was very beautiful though</li>
            <li>But, I&#x27;m still happy with the color!</li>
            <li>The dye took wonderfully.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so brilliant!</li>
            <li>it looked awesome.</li>
            <li>My daughter loved it!</li>
            <li>We each did a streak, and it came out brighter on my bleached section, but it still worked great on hers.</li>
            <li>I used this product on my son after reading great reviews.  </li>
            <li>But still, awesome product :)</li>
            <li>The color and the pigment are bright ...</li>
            <li>I actually loved it .&lt;br</li>
            <li>Had no problems I have strips here and there of Gray hair, that&#x27;s what makes it look good.</li>
            <li>Special Effects is the best hair stain/dye there is.  </li>
            <li>is the more color it takes... like a sponge!</li>
            <li>but I liked the color in the beginning</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s still nice.</li>
            <li>Bright, beautiful,  amazing color, applied to pre-lightened hair, or hair that&amp;#34;s blonde.</li>
            <li>I can usually go a good 2 months without needing to touch up because it stays so vibrant even when it fades... and when it does fade, it&#x27;s to a nice bright purple which is still really cute.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIs ITEM..............</li>
            <li>love love love it.....</li>
            <li>Stays better than any semi permanent out there.</li>
            <li>As someone who wants to color their hair, but is admittedly lazy, this is the PERFECT brand for me because the fadeout looks just as awesome as the dye.</li>
            <li>it turned out pretty good.</li>
            <li>Not so with Special Effects!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Special Affects hair dye for years now and LOVE all of their colors.</li>
            <li>It has already shown up super purple in most lighting, but I don&#x27;t mind it.</li>
            <li>And it washes out much slower than Manic Panic, which is nice, so you don&#x27;t have to reapply color as often.&lt;br</li>
            <li>fun experimenting!</li>
            <li>I moved overseas and despite the fact SFX is U.S based, it&#x27;s definitely worth the $$ to have it shipped over here!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also pretty &amp;#34;durable&amp;#34;; much better than Manic Panic.</li>
            <li>/&gt;\\&quot;Special Effects\\</li>
            <li>All the sisters and his mom were coloring their hair with Special Effects.</li>
            <li>It was good color blue.</li>
            <li>But in areas that&#x27;s more blondish, it turned out more of a darker blue to greenish blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it washed out too quick.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pretty.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased and would definitely considering purchasing from this seller again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This dye makes your hair look exactly like the pictures suggest!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s interesting, but I don&#x27;t recommend using multiple color since it blends easily.</li>
            <li>In fact, I used to live by Manic Panic as I had far better luck with it than most people I&#x27;d heard who had tried it.</li>
            <li>Great color, lasts pretty well and when it fades it&#x27;s a dark purple not a silver/grey color</li>
            <li>It was a great color but it faded very quickly and not a good color when it faded</li>
            <li>The first time around when my color began to fade it turned a little mottled lilac/grey, but after a second good bleaching and dye the second fadeout turned a brilliant purple/pink/rosy violet shade.</li>
            <li>I like Electric Blue because it fades to a nice purple-blue instead of a green-blue, like most blue dyes.  </li>
            <li>Long lasting, with a good scent!</li>
            <li>First of all the product arrived ON TIME and exactly as described-</li>
            <li>It stays in a long time and is a nice vibrant purple.</li>
            <li>part where it turned almost white took color and showed up bright royal blue to even light blue where I didn&#x27;t put much color.</li>
            <li>We are both very pleased with the results, it even gave me a few turquoise highlights!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s my favorite of all the different ones SE offers.</li>
            <li>No ugly green! :)</li>
            <li>Came super fast, got a sticker, and this hair dye in general is the bomb dot com.</li>
            <li>Blue Haired Freak is pretty gorgeous too though, definitely a close second.</li>
            <li>All my friends thought I was trying a new fancy shade/color!</li>
            <li>More dingy blue than electric blue.</li>
            <li>the next day it got mixed, which made my hair more purple...</li>
            <li>It looked good, it was different, and it lasted just long enough.</li>
            <li>Te blue is so rich and deep that in low light you almost miss it, but once you get into direct sunlight your hair seems to EXPLODE with color.</li>
            <li>general the more porous, in other words damaged your hair</li>
            <li>long as you bleach your hair out first to as light of a shade as you can manage (there&#x27;s always conditioners you can buy at beauty supply stores if you&#x27;re scared bleach will ruin your hair), as a darker color will not work well over dark hair, SE&#x27;s blue colors ALWAYS come out fantastic.</li>
            <li>Oh, well, live and learn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>It was the exact Electric Blue color as the pictures shown in the sample.</li>
            <li>They are definitely the most vibrant and long lasting colors out there.</li>
            <li>The blue not so much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been dying my hair various shades of blue for several years now and have gone through many different brands.</li>
            <li>As a first time hair dyer, I did my research first and foremost regarding blue since my first concern was that blue would eventually fade to a gross mossy green.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been dyeing my hair for years, and I have never seen color sink into a bathtub so quickly and completely as this stuff, especially since his hair was still dark blonde when we finished!</li>
            <li>He has dark blonde hair, so while I wasn&#x27;t expecting a vibrant blue, I certainly hoped to see some sort of tint.  </li>
            <li>Maybe if it was washed out after a few hours, or right away then maybe the transferring or blending could have been avoided...</li>
            <li>Electric Blue comes out pretty dark on my hair</li>
            <li>This blue stays in much longer than the other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I have used special effects hair dye in the past, but this color doesn&#x27;t seem to stay in as long.  </li>

            <li> little messy so just be prepared~</li>
            <li> I also did a little test on my naturally dark brown hair, and sadly it did nothing.</li>
            <li> Used it at least twice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and you could seriously see it in the water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also found this stuff doesn&#x27;t do nearly as much damage or have a god awful scent like a lot of cheaper brands</li>
            <li> Not even a tint :(</li>

            <li> LOVE THIs ITEM..............my granddaughter has this in a few different shades.and it does great on her hair.great product!! love love love it.....</li>
            <li> My sister got this product in purple and loves it. It stays in a long time and is a nice vibrant purple. The blue not so much. More dingy blue than electric blue. And this was on blond hair</li>
            <li> Me and my friend both dyed our hair. She has naturally blonde hair, and I bleached my hair. We each did a streak, and it came out brighter on my bleached section, but it still worked great on hers. It said on the bottle \\&quot;works best with bleached hair\\&quot;. We are both very pleased with the results, it even gave me a few turquoise highlights! I also did a little test on my naturally dark brown hair, and sadly it did nothing. Not even a tint :( But still, awesome product :)</li>
            <li> I actually loved it .&lt;br /&gt;The color in the pool washed it out :(&lt;br /&gt;The color was very beautiful though</li>
            <li> It was a great color but it faded very quickly and not a good color when it faded but I liked the color in the beginning would not buy this color again</li>
            <li> Came super fast, got a sticker, and this hair dye in general is the bomb dot com.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bleached the heck out of my hair... from black to almost white with Manic Panic Flash Lightning Hair Bleach Kit 40 Volume[[ASIN:B002BG2T4Q Manic Panic - Flash Lightning Bleach Kit [Health and Beauty]]]. Used it at least twice.&lt;br /&gt;The part where it turned almost white took color and showed up bright royal blue to even light blue where I didn&#x27;t put much color. But in areas that&#x27;s more blondish, it turned out more of a darker blue to greenish blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(In general the more porous, in other words damaged your hair is the more color it takes... like a sponge! But if you over bleach at some point the hair will loose it&#x27;s springiness... not something I&#x27;d recommend.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Special Effects\\&quot; does what it&#x27;s supposed to do well. And it washes out much slower than Manic Panic, which is nice, so you don&#x27;t have to reapply color as often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day I decided to tint the tip of the hair red, and left it over night and went to sleep... the next day it got mixed, which made my hair more purple... it&#x27;s interesting, but I don&#x27;t recommend using multiple color since it blends easily. Maybe if it was washed out after a few hours, or right away then maybe the transferring or blending could have been avoided... Oh, well, live and learn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have fun experimenting!</li>

Blue Haired Freak is pretty gorgeous too though, definitely a close second.</li>
            <li> Special Effects is the best hair stain/dye there is.  I like Electric Blue because it fades to a nice purple-blue instead of a green-blue, like most blue dyes.  It&#x27;s very pretty.</li>
            <li> it washed out too quick. manic panic lasts longer than this. Especially when you blow dry and use vinegar.&lt;br /&gt;it also kept washing out every day and you could seriously see it in the water. I never saw that when I used the manic panic blue.</li>
            <li> First of all the product arrived ON TIME and exactly as described- I am very pleased and would definitely considering purchasing from this seller again.&lt;br /&gt;I have bought a few other brands of hair dye products, but this one really works! The color and the pigment are bright ...It was the exact Electric Blue color as the pictures shown in the sample. My daughter loved it!</li>
            <li> It works great~&lt;br /&gt;A little messy so just be prepared~</li>
            <li> I just dyed my tips onto my half blonde and half black hair a few days ago. I bleached the black side n it turned out pretty good. It has already shown up super purple in most lighting, but I don&#x27;t mind it. The reason I took off a star is because is isn&#x27;t nearly as bright as the picture shows it to be, a little disappointed in that perspective.</li>
            <li> I have used special effects hair dye in the past, but this color doesn&#x27;t seem to stay in as long.  But, I&#x27;m still happy with the color!</li>
            <li> As a first time hair dyer, I did my research first and foremost regarding blue since my first concern was that blue would eventually fade to a gross mossy green. Not so with Special Effects! The dye took wonderfully. Te blue is so rich and deep that in low light you almost miss it, but once you get into direct sunlight your hair seems to EXPLODE with color. It&#x27;s so brilliant! The first time around when my color began to fade it turned a little mottled lilac/grey, but after a second good bleaching and dye the second fadeout turned a brilliant purple/pink/rosy violet shade. All my friends thought I was trying a new fancy shade/color! As someone who wants to color their hair, but is admittedly lazy, this is the PERFECT brand for me because the fadeout looks just as awesome as the dye. I moved overseas and despite the fact SFX is U.S based, it&#x27;s definitely worth the $$ to have it shipped over here!</li>
            <li> This dye makes your hair look exactly like the pictures suggest! It&#x27;s also pretty &amp;#34;durable&amp;#34;; much better than Manic Panic.</li>
            <li> This blue stays in much longer than the other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> All the sisters and his mom were coloring their hair with Special Effects. He wanted to try some punk style hair color as well. He went with Electric blue. It looked good, it was different, and it lasted just long enough.</li>
            <li> Great color, lasts pretty well and when it fades it&#x27;s a dark purple not a silver/grey color so it&#x27;s still nice.</li>
            <li> Stays better than any semi permanent out there. Bright, beautiful,  amazing color, applied to pre-lightened hair, or hair that&amp;#34;s blonde.</li>
            <li> It was good color blue. I actually mixed this color blue and the purple it looked awesome. No harm followed the directions left it in for an hour. Had no problems I have strips here and there of Gray hair, that&#x27;s what makes it look good. Try to get all the oils out of hair before you dye hair. Unless you strip it with bleach or however is different story.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Special Affects hair dye for years now and LOVE all of their colors. They are definitely the most vibrant and long lasting colors out there. I especially like that the colors (including blue) fade into the prettiest colors. No ugly green! :)</li>
            <li> Long lasting, with a good scent!</li>
            <li> I used this product on my son after reading great reviews.  I followed the directions carefully.  He has dark blonde hair, so while I wasn&#x27;t expecting a vibrant blue, I certainly hoped to see some sort of tint.  Not only was his hair not blue at all, rinsing the color out of his hair stained our bathtub.  I&#x27;ve been dyeing my hair for years, and I have never seen color sink into a bathtub so quickly and completely as this stuff, especially since his hair was still dark blonde when we finished!</li>
