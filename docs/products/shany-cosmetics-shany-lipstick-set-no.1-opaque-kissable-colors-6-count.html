            <li>is just an amazing price for a SET of lipstick!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the perfect gift for any occasion</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great for the price</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not happy at all..</li>
            <li>however the quality of the lipstick itself is not that great.</li>
            <li>I like the colors and how they look against my skin tone (medium brown/peanut butter lol).  </li>
            <li>Could have been a very nice product, but just didn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
            <li>awesome colors, lipstick glides on smoothly and is a bang for the buck!&lt;br /&gt;product</li>
            <li>(I freaking LOVE Shany!)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I chose this one because it it amazing.</li>
            <li>I love these lipsticks they have prolonged wear</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product</li>
            <li>i love the products and the quality was great.i will order from shany products again for sure.it&#x27;s what i was looking for.</li>
            <li>its just ok for the price .</li>
            <li>and I just love this set.</li>
            <li>and the red in this is PERFECT for the holidays.</li>
            <li>I love the 6 colors I got.</li>
            <li>I love the colors that I got and use them almost every day since I got them.</li>
            <li>This set of lipsticks is lovely.</li>
            <li>I love the colors alot.....</li>
            <li>Not my favorite.</li>
            <li>I have purchase a lot more then the lip stick, i have there</li>
            <li>and i love them both.</li>
            <li>I just got my order today and tried on most of the colors.  </li>
            <li>and they come in vibrant colors all for a great price</li>
            <li>Thanks for the amazing color and canâ€™t wait to get more of your products!</li>
            <li>The case of the tube is stylish and unique.</li>
            <li>The color is nice and rich, it applies smoothly and overall its a great product.</li>
            <li>However, upon receiving the product, it is not at all kissable, it easily comes off.</li>
            <li>The colors are very vibrant and the best part is they are very moisturizing (which is rare).</li>
            <li>I recently purchased the 6 piece set and all of the colors are beautiful.</li>
            <li>All in all, I would recommend the product due to the fact that it is of nice quality at a great price.</li>
            <li>arrived exactly as described based on sellers picture :-)&lt;br /&gt;i love shany..</li>
            <li>and it has two beautiful bright reds, (One of which was exactly the bright coral red that I was looking for, and the reason I bought this set to begin with) a brownish-plum, a darker more purple-y plum and a light pink.</li>
            <li>Cheap lipstick.</li>
            <li>Feels cheap.</li>
            <li>really loveeee the colors in the kit and the fact that the texture is so nice and smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>highly recommend these for anyone that wants affordable lipstick with great quality.</li>
            <li>I enjoy make up and like discovering new amazing colors at affordable prices...</li>
            <li>The colors are rich purchase today</li>
            <li>are totally worth the purchase!</li>
            <li>They are smooth like lip gloss but bold like lipstick.</li>
            <li>and they are true to their color!&lt;br</li>
            <li>giving me a fresh new look!&lt;br /&gt;Bright sharp colors that gives that perfect touch to the face!&lt;br /&gt;A must to have part of cosmetic kit!</li>
            <li>Overall a great buy, especially for this Fall &#x27;12 season since the fashion trend seems to be more of a darker bold lip like burgundy and plums.</li>
            <li>Their affordable and the quality of the lipstick is amazing and long lasting definitely will be buying more product and with my new product i recieve two free gift customer service is wonderful</li>
            <li>Everyone at work just love the colors and they say I look brand new.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more Shany products soon!</li>
            <li>lipstick packaging itself is very cheap, very plastic and very flimsy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited for the new year--perfect for any occassion!</li>
            <li>From summery light pink and oranges to a bold red for the holidays and ofcourse the berry and plum colors which are really in this season!!!!&lt;br /&gt;The texture is really great</li>
            <li>This is my first lipstick set EVER, so I put a lot of time into choosing the right one.</li>
            <li>I wanted bright and dark reds for the holidays and that is exactly what I got.</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying lipstick</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting married, and want to wear lipstick for the wedding, but I also don&#x27;t want to be leaving lipstick marks on my fiance&#x27;s lips and face.</li>
            <li>when you first out them on, and then while you wear them they feel kinda greasy?</li>
            <li>This is the first time that I have looked in to returning something on amazon in years.</li>
            <li>bought the number 1 set, it came packaged neatly, exactly like the picture</li>
            <li>(For lack of a better word) because of the consistency the lipstick would bleed a bit on the outside of my lips and get all over my teeth, but they&#x27;re very hydrating and after cleaning it up and setting it with a translucent powder, they seem to stay for the majority of the day.</li>
            <li>Even the darker colors didn&#x27;t really have very much pigment to them it seemed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What I really love is that the pink color in this kit is EXACTLY like the first Viva Glam Gaga from MAC which is discontinued, so if you&#x27;re looking for that--definitely get this kit.</li>
            <li>and I certainly dont want to have to add a liner to my routine every time I wear this</li>
            <li>The lip sticks dont really hold well.</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was very disappointed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick to N.Y.X and E.L.F for my go to cheapy brands that I like to mix in with my high end brands!</li>
            <li>I chose to give this product 5 stars because it is a very affordable product, and works like a dream.</li>
            <li>It does not go on very well.</li>
            <li>I could see it working really well on someone with a darker complexion).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>One thing that I didn&#x27;t like as much was the sheerness of the lipstick.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say how long it lasts, because I wiped it off after trying it on, but it seems as though it would come off easily.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This will last really nicely without making your lips feel dry or flake.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But for the price its decent...</li>
            <li>The lipstick seems of decent quality</li>
            <li>And they came earlier than expected which is also always nice.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it, I&#x27;m a make up enthusiast and the shany lipsticks</li>
            <li>short, if I had bought this at my local cvs, or returns were free, I would have returned them.</li>
            <li>The lipsticks are pigmented but very soft.</li>
            <li>I tried to step outside of my comfort zone by getting a really light pink, and I really like how it looks on me.</li>
            <li>Luckily the product inside was heavily bubble wrapped thanks to the sender.</li>
            <li>Well I was happily surprised when I got the product.</li>
            <li>Even when applying them you don&#x27;t really feel as if you are applying a substantial thick and creamy lipstick but more like you are applying a sheer gloss almost.  </li>
            <li>The only ones true to color, were the three dark shades, which wasnt why I bought the kit.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I had to apply a few layers to get a bold color.  </li>
            <li>The only reason it gets a 4 is because they&#x27;re pretty dry</li>
            <li>I got two Berry and 2 Plum lipsticks, 1 Classic Red and 1 Orangey Red.</li>
            <li>I also got there 20 something set of Makeup brushes and love them to and using them has tough me</li>
            <li>I love the different shades; yes the colors are a bit similar to one another, but at least I know when I&#x27;m wearing a different hue, and women who know lipstick will know, too.</li>
            <li>I bought this set after reading all the great reviews on it, but for only 11-ish bucks, I was fully prepared to be disappointed.</li>
            <li>(Which was a little too light for my pale skin, but I was anticipating that, so no issue there.</li>

            <li> (Which was a little too light for my pale skin, but I was anticipating that, so no issue there.</li>
            <li> Also, upon opening the package, one of the lipstick tubes was a mess, the product had fallen out of the bottom tube and gotten stuck completely up in the lid, and is unusable.</li>
            <li> The colors were very sheer and not very opaque at all.  </li>
            <li> They all stay on a long time.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re creamy, they don&#x27;t dry out my lips</li>
            <li> The pretty bubble gummy pink, which was the main reason I bought the kit, is more of a pale washed out boring pink.</li>
            <li> If it weren&#x27;t such a hassle and didn&#x27;t cost me half of what I already paid for the product, I&#x27;d be returning it.</li>
            <li> But for close to six dollars to return its really pointless and I might as well throw them in my back drawer or something.</li>
            <li> , they stay on for a remarkably long time, they don&#x27;t feather or bleed, they barely left a mark on my cup when I was drinking something (A little rubbed off, but hardly any) AND they&#x27;re affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> One issue I have though is that the mail carrier(s) seems to have been careless with the box, because it arrived really smashed up.</li>
            <li> If it were a little thicker and applied a bolder color, then I would have given it 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> And a few of them were cracked as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I am not sure why this is</li>
            <li> A couple of them was delivered broken but nothing that a lip brush and being careful won&#x27;t cure.</li>
            <li> I seriously have no words to describe this</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m quite disappointed that it isn&#x27;t everything it was advertised to be.</li>

            <li> This is my first lipstick set EVER, so I put a lot of time into choosing the right one. I&#x27;m so glad I chose this one because it it amazing. The colors are very vibrant and the best part is they are very moisturizing (which is rare). I&#x27;m excited for the new year--perfect for any occassion!</li>
            <li> For the price, you cannot beat the product. I wanted bright and dark reds for the holidays and that is exactly what I got. I like my lips to be moist so I use a gloss after I apply the lipstick. I will definitely be ordering more Shany products soon!</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying lipstick and I just love this set. Everyone at work just love the colors and they say I look brand new. I am planning on buying set #2.</li>
            <li> I ordered this lipstick specifically because of the \\&quot;kissable\\&quot; aspect of it. I&#x27;m getting married, and want to wear lipstick for the wedding, but I also don&#x27;t want to be leaving lipstick marks on my fiance&#x27;s lips and face. However, upon receiving the product, it is not at all kissable, it easily comes off. The lipstick seems of decent quality and I do like the colors, but I&#x27;m quite disappointed that it isn&#x27;t everything it was advertised to be. Also, upon opening the package, one of the lipstick tubes was a mess, the product had fallen out of the bottom tube and gotten stuck completely up in the lid, and is unusable. Could have been a very nice product, but just didn&#x27;t do it for me. If it weren&#x27;t such a hassle and didn&#x27;t cost me half of what I already paid for the product, I&#x27;d be returning it.</li>
            <li> Very impressed with these lipsticks. The only reason it gets a 4 is because they&#x27;re pretty dry when you first out them on, and then while you wear them they feel kinda greasy? (For lack of a better word) because of the consistency the lipstick would bleed a bit on the outside of my lips and get all over my teeth, but they&#x27;re very hydrating and after cleaning it up and setting it with a translucent powder, they seem to stay for the majority of the day. What I really love is that the pink color in this kit is EXACTLY like the first Viva Glam Gaga from MAC which is discontinued, so if you&#x27;re looking for that--definitely get this kit. It&#x27;s also great for the price (I freaking LOVE Shany!) and the red in this is PERFECT for the holidays. Overall a great buy, especially for this Fall &#x27;12 season since the fashion trend seems to be more of a darker bold lip like burgundy and plums. It will keep you fashionistas ON POINT! Haha.</li>
            <li> The colors were very sheer and not very opaque at all.  Even when applying them you don&#x27;t really feel as if you are applying a substantial thick and creamy lipstick but more like you are applying a sheer gloss almost.  Even the darker colors didn&#x27;t really have very much pigment to them it seemed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lipstick packaging itself is very cheap, very plastic and very flimsy.  I&#x27;ve purchased drug store lipstic for $2 that had nicer packaging.  And a few of them were cracked as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not happy at all.. I don&#x27;t see myself purchasing from this company again at all... I enjoy make up and like discovering new amazing colors at affordable prices... I&#x27;ll stick to N.Y.X and E.L.F for my go to cheapy brands that I like to mix in with my high end brands!</li>
            <li> This product is just amazing!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Have a vast variety of colors every day! giving me a fresh new look!&lt;br /&gt;Bright sharp colors that gives that perfect touch to the face!&lt;br /&gt;A must to have part of cosmetic kit!</li>
            <li> I chose to give this product 5 stars because it is a very affordable product, and works like a dream. I love the 6 colors I got. I got two Berry and 2 Plum lipsticks, 1 Classic Red and 1 Orangey Red. They all stay on a long time. They are smooth like lip gloss but bold like lipstick. I love the colors that I got and use them almost every day since I got them. If someone is looking to add some awesome color and quality to their lipstick collects, I would have to tell them to add these. Thanks for the amazing color and canâ€™t wait to get more of your products!</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I have looked in to returning something on amazon in years. But for close to six dollars to return its really pointless and I might as well throw them in my back drawer or something. The colors dont look at all like they do online. The pretty bubble gummy pink, which was the main reason I bought the kit, is more of a pale washed out boring pink. The oranges and reds are not what are pictured at all. The only ones true to color, were the three dark shades, which wasnt why I bought the kit.&lt;br /&gt;I tried them on tonight and the lipstick feathered. I see that another reviewer had that issue as well. My lipstick never feathers so I am not sure why this is and I certainly dont want to have to add a liner to my routine every time I wear this brand.&lt;br /&gt;In short, if I had bought this at my local cvs, or returns were free, I would have returned them.</li>
            <li> This set of lipsticks is lovely.The packaging is neat, all the lipstick bullets were intact and all the colors are wearable. The case of the tube is stylish and unique. I got everything I was wanting: opaque color and creamy glossy finish that lasts.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the 6 piece set and all of the colors are beautiful. The colors are rich purchase today</li>
            <li> I bought this pack of lipsticks, strictly on the price, cause who can beat 6 lipsticks for 10 bucks? Well I was happily surprised when I got the product. The color is nice and rich, it applies smoothly and overall its a great product. I would highly recommend it, I&#x27;m a make up enthusiast and the shany lipsticks are totally worth the purchase! And they came earlier than expected which is also always nice.</li>
            <li> I love the colors alot..... however the quality of the lipstick itself is not that great. It does not go on very well. Not my favorite.</li>
            <li> I have purchase a lot more then the lip stick, i have there concealer palette and one of there makeup palette and i love them both. I also got there 20 something set of Makeup brushes and love them to and using them has tough me all the different ways i can use the and what to use them for. Now im looking to get some of there blush palette, can wait.</li>
            <li> I bought this set after reading all the great reviews on it, but for only 11-ish bucks, I was fully prepared to be disappointed. However, I was NOT disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;These lipsticks are great! They&#x27;re creamy, they don&#x27;t dry out my lips, they stay on for a remarkably long time, they don&#x27;t feather or bleed, they barely left a mark on my cup when I was drinking something (A little rubbed off, but hardly any) AND they&#x27;re affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the number 1 set, it came packaged neatly, exactly like the picture and it has two beautiful bright reds, (One of which was exactly the bright coral red that I was looking for, and the reason I bought this set to begin with) a brownish-plum, a darker more purple-y plum and a light pink. (Which was a little too light for my pale skin, but I was anticipating that, so no issue there. I could see it working really well on someone with a darker complexion).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these for anyone that wants affordable lipstick with great quality.</li>
            <li> Awesome colors and good quality lipstick set.</li>
            <li> awesome colors, lipstick glides on smoothly and is a bang for the buck!&lt;br /&gt;product arrived exactly as described based on sellers picture :-)&lt;br /&gt;i love shany..</li>
            <li> I just got my order today and tried on most of the colors.  I like the colors and how they look against my skin tone (medium brown/peanut butter lol).  I tried to step outside of my comfort zone by getting a really light pink, and I really like how it looks on me. One thing that I didn&#x27;t like as much was the sheerness of the lipstick.  I had to apply a few layers to get a bold color.  I can&#x27;t say how long it lasts, because I wiped it off after trying it on, but it seems as though it would come off easily.  It may need to be reapplied during the day. This isn&#x27;t a big problem for me since I usually only wear makeup if I am going out for a night on the town.  If it were a little thicker and applied a bolder color, then I would have given it 5 stars.  All in all, I would recommend the product due to the fact that it is of nice quality at a great price. Have already told friends about it.</li>
            <li> I love the different shades; yes the colors are a bit similar to one another, but at least I know when I&#x27;m wearing a different hue, and women who know lipstick will know, too. One issue I have though is that the mail carrier(s) seems to have been careless with the box, because it arrived really smashed up. Luckily the product inside was heavily bubble wrapped thanks to the sender. Great product!</li>
            <li> The lipsticks are pigmented but very soft.A couple of them was delivered broken but nothing that a lip brush and being careful won&#x27;t cure.</li>
