    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The nail clippers are the best-</li>
            <li>This is just a great kit!</li>
            <li>When the baby is born this set will be great for traveling, just toss the case into the diaper bag and go!</li>
            <li>This set is perfect for baby.  </li>
            <li>What I especially liked was the case they come in.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a great price!</li>
            <li>Add a couple bandaids or sterile wipes and you have the perfect travel kit!  </li>
            <li>this kit is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I am a very happy customer</li>
            <li>The emery boards are the best thing to use on your baby&#x27;s nails.  </li>
            <li>A great buy!</li>
            <li>The scissors and emory boards are great too!  </li>
            <li>A great starter kit!</li>
            <li>Great Product!</li>
            <li>I was terrified to cut my newborn&#x27;s nails, but the scissors in this set are wonderful.</li>
            <li>I researched for awhile which set is best for me and fits my needs the best.</li>
            <li>and I found that this and the &amp;quot;deluxe nursery Set&amp;quot; work just perfect.</li>
            <li>The hairbrush is great, and the set would be perfect without the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>This is an ideal gift if you don&#x27;t know the sex of the baby and don&#x27;t just want to buy</li>
            <li>Otherwise, all of the items (except the toothbrush, which I haven&#x27;t had to use yet) have been excellent, and it&#x27;s nice to have it all in one case.</li>
            <li>A great buy.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve used everything in it, and the carry case is great for trips!&lt;BR&gt;highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I got this as a gift, and it&#x27;s great for the diaper bag.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use the toothbrush for brushing teeth, but it worked great when I treated my son for cradle cap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for around the house use and for travel.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a great idea to have all his grooming stuff in one compact case so it can go from nursery to travel bag with you.</li>
            <li>The nail clippers has a great grip.  </li>
            <li>It worked great while we had it, though.  </li>
            <li>The hairbrush is great as are the clippers and mini-emery boards.  </li>
            <li>but I think every parent would be happy having this</li>
            <li>The scissors are great for clipping my sons nails.</li>
            <li>And, my daughter loves being able to hold the toothbrush by herself in order to chew on the bristles!!</li>
            <li>We honestly use this almost every day!  </li>
            <li>but i have used all the rest of the things.the price is good too but what actually impressed me was the case.i thought it would fit neatly into the daiper</li>
            <li>I think this is a good purchase, with a variety of items you will need.</li>
            <li>This would be a good gift item.</li>
            <li>This is a good product to carry in your diaper bag.</li>
            <li>Definetly a good thing to have.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a good size to throw in the diaper bag.</li>
            <li>But all in all, I am very glad we have this kit.</li>
            <li>Great product, love the idea that I have everything in one place.  </li>
            <li>I love the nail clippers and emery boards, and the hair brush, as my son had a lot of hair when he was born!  </li>
            <li>We love this product!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>I love this set!  </li>
            <li>The nail clippers are great and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>--it&#x27;s been nice.  </li>
            <li>I would have liked to have a thermometer included</li>
            <li>[She] LOVES having her own \\&quot;travel</li>
            <li>I really liked that all these things were packed up together in a nice zipper bag.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great kit at a great price!</li>
            <li>The case makes it nice because nothing gets lost.</li>
            <li>This kit has all the things that you need to keep your baby looking  nice.  </li>
            <li>The case is handy.</li>
            <li>I really liked the set except the nail scissors.</li>
            <li>This is a nice kit to have since it contains everything you need.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very nice, handy and cheap product.</li>
            <li>(Would love to be more organized on my own, but I am a working mom!)  </li>
            <li>The brush is great, so is the comb and the nail clippers are SUPER.  </li>
            <li>The nail clippers are perfect and the brush is very soft.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice having everything in one kit, but I haven&#x27;t been pleased with the quaility of this one.  </li>
            <li>I always have it handy for when we go to get pictures taken, easy way to straighten up baby&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>The brush is perfect and is good to use on baby with little hair.  </li>
            <li>The brush and comb went to my daughters dolls :)</li>
            <li>I bought this as a baby shower gift, even though I knew most baskets contain some, if not all of these items.  </li>
            <li>I think we would have been better off purchasing what we needed separately.</li>
            <li>Got this as a gift and love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this set</li>
            <li>This cute grooming set contains a baby nail clipper with a handle</li>
            <li>My favorite things in this kit are the comb and the nail clippers.  </li>
            <li>It just glides over the top of her hair, so I never use it.  </li>
            <li>The nail files are better used on the toe nails rather than the finger nails.  </li>
            <li>The curved scissors where excellent in the beginning especially because I was scared using the clippers.  </li>
            <li>My favorite part is the grippy handles on the brush, comb, and toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I love that it has a wider handle.  </li>
            <li>The comb and brush in this set are OK</li>
            <li>This cute kit has everything you need, except the nasal aspirator.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll find it helpful.</li>
            <li>We had to buy a better nail clipper than the one included.</li>
            <li>I love the gum stimulator.  </li>
            <li>and the scissors seem about as safe as you can make a tool designed for cutting.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>good quality product and a useful gift.</li>
            <li>The finger tooth brush will be great and easy to use when the teeth first start to cut.</li>
            <li>They had put it on their registry, and have told us they are very happy with the tools in the kit, and find the implements to be safe and effective for grooming their little one.</li>
            <li>The nail clippers are pretty good, but I&#x27;ve never used the scissors.</li>
            <li>I got this set when shopping for my baby, and I think it&#x27;s great, has everything needed for a new baby.</li>
            <li>The clippers are very nice, brush and comb normal.</li>
            <li>This comes in such a great, handy storage bag that keeps everything neat and easy.  </li>
            <li>Personally I am more comfortable using the scissors to clip my baby&#x27;s nails, &amp;amp; not all of them include those.</li>
            <li>I loved this product so much.</li>
            <li>True, we do not use the comb or toothbrush, but the organization of the product makes up for that!  </li>
            <li>The case isnt bulky and easy to tote.</li>
            <li>The carry case is cute, but the products are definitely nothing great.  </li>
            <li>They are easy to use on my baby.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s too easy to accidentally clip the skin).  </li>
            <li>Easy to use carrying case</li>
            <li>The shape of the clippers (easy to hold when you have a squirmy baby!)&lt;BR&gt;Nice brush and comb...</li>
            <li>I bought this while browsing through the local Babies R Us store, and consider this one of the best and most essential baby items I own.  </li>
            <li>THE BEST TOOL FOR CLIPPING INFANT NAILS IS A NORMAL ADULT CUTICLE CLIPPER.</li>
            <li>the way, I read the review from the lady who&#x27;s zipper broke, but I&#x27;ve had mine for over 2 years, and my zipper still works fine.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it is a fine kit.</li>
            <li>I would have been just fine with one pair of clippers and not the rest of the kit.</li>
            <li>They are very sharp and the perfect size, and the bulb shape fits comfortably in our hands and helps us to stabilize the clippers.  </li>
            <li>Plus, the little emory boards are wonderful.</li>
            <li>Great for clipping on tiny fingers.</li>
            <li>IMPORTANT:</li>
            <li>They fit in my hand well</li>
            <li>It seems to me that it is a cute and useful set for your baby.</li>
            <li>When she has more hair the comb will be useful.  </li>
            <li>I never used the emery boards, and my scissors got confiscated at the airport shortly after Sept. 11, but the nail clippers are just great.  </li>
            <li>(you&#x27;ll get one at the hospital, but its great to have an extra one or two!)</li>
            <li>They contain EVERYTHING that i have found to need and isnt filled with things i will never use just to drive up the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s has been very useful.</li>
            <li>Everything together in one little pack was appealing to me--it seemed more economical to purchase the items included this way and the case great for travel and keeping track of the stuff.  </li>
            <li>ANY KIND OF PROMOTIONS OR FREE OFFERS</li>
            <li>This comes in so handy and its in a package my four year old can bring to me when I need it!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use and is of high quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going nuts right now trying to find the toothbrush packaged by itself!</li>
            <li>And, if I break a nail I have clippers and a nail file right there!</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is a good first brush for a baby, being quite soft</li>
            <li>I bought it since my wife is expecting our second child in three months, she loved it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know how much of the stuff I would use, but figured better to have and not need it.</li>
            <li>The nail clippers are really easy to use, and the sissors are very easy to use - it has really made the chore of clipping my kids nails into a much nicer experience.  </li>
            <li>I use the clippers every other day - they work great although I need to lean them inwards in order to stay away from snipping the skin.  </li>
            <li>I received this as a shower gift and have used it from the very first day I took my son home from the hospital.  </li>
            <li>I hope that it will become more useful as she gets older.</li>
            <li>I was given this as a gift for the arrival of my new baby, and I LOVE this kit.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend the nail nippers because of the safety grip that fits nicely in the palm of your hand to steady your clipping.</li>
            <li>All the items are of excellent quality and come in a soft green case so you can keep them in one place.</li>
            <li>I use the comb every day to smooth out her bedhead, and she really enjoys getting her hair combed.  </li>
            <li>I am able to use it for my newborn and my 2 year old - it is so helpful.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just going to be personal preference which you&#x27;re most comfortable with.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s still too young for the toothbrush, also, and we have a better one we plan on using.  </li>
            <li>this pack has some items you will find useful, but some of them I just don&#x27;t see myself using at all.</li>
            <li>I love the brush and comb, even though  my 11 month old doesn&#x60;t</li>
            <li>have much hair he will take the soft brush and try to brush his own hair.  </li>
            <li>The other products are OK, but most people get a lot of them anyway.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a nice little handy kit if you remember you have it!</li>
            <li>The quality seems good, but i havent used the theromoter in the other set</li>
            <li>And I was right</li>
            <li>Everything is right there when I need it.  </li>
            <li>Everything is right there</li>
            <li>They are just the right size for her to hold, too.  </li>
            <li>For such a low price, to have everything handy in one little kit is wonderful!  </li>
            <li>The bristles are light enough that they can move through her hair easily without causing pulls or snags.  </li>
            <li>I love the comb - the handle is so soft and easy to use, and the brush is so soft on my baby&#x27;s head, plus I can use it when bathing my baby to prevent cradle cap - really convienient!  </li>
            <li>This is a great small kit to keep in the diaper bag.  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;But, its still a great set, and since its not very expensive its a nice baby present if you just need something small to give someone.</li>
            <li>the big bulb on the end makes it super easy to use.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s probably better off to take the emblem off, rather then to have it fall off at a later date without your knowledge, and have your baby put it in his/her mouth and risk choking.</li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t get this whole kit, buy Safest 1st nail clippers!</li>
            <li>For a newborn, I found this grooming set to be pretty helpful.  </li>
            <li>It has every grooming item you could possible need and they are all of a respectable quality.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve bought several more of these nail clippers</li>
            <li>Most of all, it comes in a very convenient bag which makes it easy to store and retrieve - less chance of loosing any piece from the set.</li>
            <li>Unlike other reviewers, I think the toothbrush is GREAT for a toddler to hold and \\&quot;scrub\\&quot; with on their own (other children&#x27;s toothbrushes have little bristle heads that require more precision than a toddler is capable of).  </li>
            <li>You might also want to reconsider if you are planning to buy the other matching set - Hospital&#x27;s Choice Deluxe Care Kit.</li>
            <li>the little emry boards are cute and very useful.</li>
            <li>Overall, for the number of things I really use from this set, I don&#x27;t think it was worth it; however, if you think you&#x27;ll use more than half of what&#x27;s in the kit, it&#x27;s a convenient way to get all the items at once at a reasonable price and with a handy carrying case to boot.</li>
            <li>First of all, I think having the toothbrush as a part of this set is very unsanitary.</li>
            <li>I was really upset with it when the first time I opened it the zipper part broke.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I haven&#x27;t touhed any of the other items, but the scissors are perfectly curved for cutting nails ---</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found a use for the emory boards; I&#x27;m pretty pro at cutting the nails without leaving edges, so I kind of hijacked the emory boards for my own manicure use, haha.&lt;br /&gt;Overall,</li>
            <li>and it was fine, although I prefer the one I got from the hospital because it&#x27;s larger and teddy-bear shaped (easier to hold as well as keep track of).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for travel and the little carrying case is large enough to throw in a bulb syringe and a thermometer.</li>
            <li>Enough said, this would be a great gift for someone expecting a little one.  </li>
            <li>i think its a good investment as all my baby,s grooming items are kept neatly in a compact kit otherwise it might be a hard job for me to keep all these tiny things organized where u have a lot more things with a baby to do.my baby is still too young for the tooth brush</li>
            <li>Very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Still, you could purchase all of these items seperately, although I doubt you&#x27;d save much money.</li>
            <li>I really like the case it comes in</li>
            <li>my baby&#x27;s nail grow so fast...</li>
            <li>I love the wide handle on the nail clippers and</li>
            <li>It already contains a nail clipper and scissors - do you really need 2 of those?</li>
            <li>I agree that the toothbrush is a bit unnecessary, but the rest of the items are great.  </li>
            <li>It also comes with what you REALLY need ,</li>
            <li>If you were to buy various kits separately for the items you will use, it would add up to the same cost without the benefit of one nice bit storage bag.  </li>
            <li>The nail clippers are also great because they have an easy grip bulbous end that help you to hold them and are small enough to maneuver around her tiny nails.  </li>
            <li>I love that it keeps everything in one place and that the items are small enough for use on a newborn, but are still able to be used on a toddler.  </li>
            <li>The brush and comb are just right for baby soft hair, and the sturdy grips mean that baby can have a go at brushing his own hair if he feels like it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li>it costs a little more, but I then get quality items</li>
            <li>I love the storage aspect of the 30-piece kit as it zips up neatly and allows enough room to consolidate other relevant things such as teethers.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to throw into the diaper bag or even a large purse when you&#x27;re on the run and don&#x27;t want to remember every little detail.</li>
            <li>The handles on each item are big enough to make use easy for myself as well as my husband.  </li>
            <li>I thought I would get alot of use out of this handy little kit, but I&#x27;ve only used the clippers!  </li>
            <li>I NEVER had a probblem with any of the items and am infact hoping to get a new kit for the child Im about to have.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product for any new mom.</li>
            <li>So I ended up getting her a new comb and giving this one to my baby.</li>
            <li>I will be using them again with my new baby.</li>
            <li>I needed a new one...</li>
            <li>We gave this as a gift to friend of ours having a new baby.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to any new mom.</li>
            <li>I would recomend to any new mom this and the &amp;quot;Deluxe Nursery Set</li>
            <li>The brush, comb, and toothbrush have bigger handles so that when baby is old enough they can grab them easily.  </li>
            <li>This one is heavy dutie, the real deal not that cheap material others are made out of.</li>
            <li>I love this little set for baby!  </li>
            <li>brush is very soft and can be soothing on baby&#x27;s head.  </li>
            <li>It is easier to manage and you won&#x27;t clip off pieces of their fingers, as I have done with the infant nail clipper (and many other mothers have done the same I have since learned).  </li>
            <li>I used the emery boards for his nails during the first 2 months and later have been using the scissors for his fingernails.   </li>
            <li>I use the nail clippers on almost a daily basis (babies&#x27; nails DO grow fast!), and I use the hair brush every day, even though my daughter is practically bald.  </li>
            <li>I thought the toothbrush was silly and kind of out of place, but my son loves it!</li>
            <li>One of the reviewers was kind enough to list all the items in the 30-piece kit, which I found extremely helpful when I initially registered for the kit.  </li>
            <li>By the time your baby is old enough to use it, the toothbrush will probably be full of bacteria and germs considering you&#x27;ve kept it in there along with the brush and comb that you use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>but I was so excited about it and was let down.</li>
            <li>Instead of buying a kit, purchasing individual pieces and a little makeup bag to hold them in makes more sense...</li>
            <li>He is now 2 yrs old and we are still using the comb and nail clippers.  </li>
            <li>I use the clippers &amp;amp; scissors on my daughters toenails, they are much easier because they do not have to be as short as her fingernails.  </li>
            <li>Even now I still use the clippers on my now 17 month old son.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve had to replace the toothbrush, but that&#x27;s just because those things get old and worn.  </li>
            <li>My pediatrician said to use regular boards, which worked much better.&lt;BR</li>
            <li>I have used everything in this so far, except for the tooth brush</li>
            <li>Part of that may be that our 6 month old still doesn&#x27;t have a lot of hair.</li>
            <li>The brush is really soft</li>
            <li>My daughter wasn&#x27;t able to use the brush because it was to soft for her thick curly hair.  </li>
            <li>The brush and comb are nice and sturdy, which means extended use beyond thin infant hair.</li>
            <li>The  few items within the kit are very useful.  </li>
            <li>If you are buying it solely for the first few months, just get clippers and a brush instead of buying the whole shebang.&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first, I thought the tiny emery boards were ridiculous, but now I find them indispensable.</li>
            <li>so you can grab it better, curved scissors, also specially designed for your baby&#x27;s soft and diminute nails, a soft hair brush and a  small comb suited for a baby&#x27;s delicate hair, a set of nail files and finally a tooth brush that you will not be using soon.  </li>
            <li>The other drawback is that the Safety first emblem on the nail trimmer came off within days of using it..</li>
            <li>I honestly have used something, anything from this kit maybe 4 times in the past year and a half.</li>
            <li>A good pair of scissors well suited for this is hard to find - these are curved well to get only nail and not skin, and have carefully bluted points -- trust me, DO NOT use your own nail scissors --- those guys can flail their hands and you&#x27;ll find yourself nearly stabbing the baby or yourself.</li>
            <li>My son is 8 months old now, and I&#x27;ve never cut his fingers with these scissors, he actually enjoys the process!</li>
            <li>and my son is only two months old.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are soft for baby&#x27;s little head, the toothbrush was actually very helpful in brushing out cradle cap.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, are you really going to use that toothbrush?</li>
            <li>the comb isn&#x27;t strong enough for long thick hair.</li>
            <li>- I didn&#x27;t find the brush too hard as another reviewer did, but I think the comb is too short; I would have preferred that the whole comb have teeth instead of having such a short toothed section and such a large handle.  </li>
            <li>My only problem is that I bought it for my 2 year old daughter who has long hair and</li>
            <li>I really shouldn&#x27;t have worried - I wound up getting a little comb and brush set myself and</li>
            <li>Other products similar to this are ok but not good quality.</li>
            <li>I really like this little kit.</li>

            <li> A great starter kit!</li>
            <li> Great Product!</li>
            <li> I was terrified to cut my newborn&#x27;s nails, but the scissors in this set are wonderful.</li>
            <li> I researched for awhile which set is best for me and fits my needs the best.</li>
            <li> and I found that this and the &amp;quot;deluxe nursery Set&amp;quot; work just perfect.</li>
            <li> The hairbrush is great, and the set would be perfect without the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> This is an ideal gift if you don&#x27;t know the sex of the baby and don&#x27;t just want to buy</li>
            <li> Otherwise, all of the items (except the toothbrush, which I haven&#x27;t had to use yet) have been excellent, and it&#x27;s nice to have it all in one case.</li>
            <li> A great buy.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used everything in it, and the carry case is great for trips!&lt;BR&gt;highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift, and it&#x27;s great for the diaper bag.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use the toothbrush for brushing teeth, but it worked great when I treated my son for cradle cap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for around the house use and for travel.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a great idea to have all his grooming stuff in one compact case so it can go from nursery to travel bag with you.</li>
            <li> The nail clippers has a great grip.  </li>
            <li> It worked great while we had it, though.  </li>
            <li> The hairbrush is great as are the clippers and mini-emery boards.  </li>
            <li> but I think every parent would be happy having this</li>
            <li> The scissors are great for clipping my sons nails.</li>
            <li> And, my daughter loves being able to hold the toothbrush by herself in order to chew on the bristles!!</li>
            <li> We honestly use this almost every day!  </li>
            <li> but i have used all the rest of the things.the price is good too but what actually impressed me was the case.i thought it would fit neatly into the daiper</li>
            <li> I think this is a good purchase, with a variety of items you will need.</li>
            <li> This would be a good gift item.</li>
            <li> This is a good product to carry in your diaper bag.</li>
            <li> Definetly a good thing to have.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a good size to throw in the diaper bag.</li>
            <li> But all in all, I am very glad we have this kit.</li>
            <li> Great product, love the idea that I have everything in one place.  </li>
            <li> I love the nail clippers and emery boards, and the hair brush, as my son had a lot of hair when he was born!  </li>
            <li> We love this product!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> I love this set!  </li>
            <li> The nail clippers are great and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> --it&#x27;s been nice.  </li>
            <li> I would have liked to have a thermometer included</li>
            <li> [She] LOVES having her own \\&quot;travel</li>
            <li> I really liked that all these things were packed up together in a nice zipper bag.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great kit at a great price!</li>
            <li> The case makes it nice because nothing gets lost.</li>
            <li> This kit has all the things that you need to keep your baby looking  nice.  </li>
            <li> The case is handy.</li>
            <li> I really liked the set except the nail scissors.</li>
            <li> This is a nice kit to have since it contains everything you need.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very nice, handy and cheap product.</li>
            <li> (Would love to be more organized on my own, but I am a working mom!)  </li>
            <li> The brush is great, so is the comb and the nail clippers are SUPER.  </li>
            <li> The nail clippers are perfect and the brush is very soft.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice having everything in one kit, but I haven&#x27;t been pleased with the quaility of this one.  </li>
            <li> I always have it handy for when we go to get pictures taken, easy way to straighten up baby&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> The brush is perfect and is good to use on baby with little hair.  </li>
            <li> The brush and comb went to my daughters dolls :)</li>
            <li> I bought this as a baby shower gift, even though I knew most baskets contain some, if not all of these items.  </li>
            <li> I think we would have been better off purchasing what we needed separately.</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift and love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this set</li>
            <li> This cute grooming set contains a baby nail clipper with a handle</li>
            <li> My favorite things in this kit are the comb and the nail clippers.  </li>
            <li> It just glides over the top of her hair, so I never use it.  </li>
            <li> The nail files are better used on the toe nails rather than the finger nails.  </li>
            <li> The curved scissors where excellent in the beginning especially because I was scared using the clippers.  </li>
            <li> My favorite part is the grippy handles on the brush, comb, and toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I love that it has a wider handle.  </li>
            <li> The comb and brush in this set are OK</li>
            <li> This cute kit has everything you need, except the nasal aspirator.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll find it helpful.</li>
            <li> We had to buy a better nail clipper than the one included.</li>
            <li> I love the gum stimulator.  </li>
            <li> and the scissors seem about as safe as you can make a tool designed for cutting.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> good quality product and a useful gift.</li>
            <li> The finger tooth brush will be great and easy to use when the teeth first start to cut.</li>
            <li> They had put it on their registry, and have told us they are very happy with the tools in the kit, and find the implements to be safe and effective for grooming their little one.</li>
            <li> The nail clippers are pretty good, but I&#x27;ve never used the scissors.</li>
            <li> I got this set when shopping for my baby, and I think it&#x27;s great, has everything needed for a new baby.</li>
            <li> The clippers are very nice, brush and comb normal.</li>
            <li> This comes in such a great, handy storage bag that keeps everything neat and easy.  </li>
            <li> Personally I am more comfortable using the scissors to clip my baby&#x27;s nails, &amp;amp; not all of them include those.</li>
            <li> I loved this product so much.</li>
            <li> True, we do not use the comb or toothbrush, but the organization of the product makes up for that!  </li>
            <li> The case isnt bulky and easy to tote.</li>
            <li> The carry case is cute, but the products are definitely nothing great.  </li>
            <li> They are easy to use on my baby.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s too easy to accidentally clip the skin).  </li>
            <li> Easy to use carrying case</li>
            <li> The shape of the clippers (easy to hold when you have a squirmy baby!)&lt;BR&gt;Nice brush and comb...</li>
            <li> I bought this while browsing through the local Babies R Us store, and consider this one of the best and most essential baby items I own.  </li>
            <li> THE BEST TOOL FOR CLIPPING INFANT NAILS IS A NORMAL ADULT CUTICLE CLIPPER.</li>
            <li> the way, I read the review from the lady who&#x27;s zipper broke, but I&#x27;ve had mine for over 2 years, and my zipper still works fine.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it is a fine kit.</li>
            <li> I would have been just fine with one pair of clippers and not the rest of the kit.</li>
            <li> They are very sharp and the perfect size, and the bulb shape fits comfortably in our hands and helps us to stabilize the clippers.  </li>
            <li> Plus, the little emory boards are wonderful.</li>
            <li> Great for clipping on tiny fingers.</li>
            <li> IMPORTANT:</li>
            <li> They fit in my hand well</li>
            <li> It seems to me that it is a cute and useful set for your baby.</li>
            <li> When she has more hair the comb will be useful.  </li>
            <li> I never used the emery boards, and my scissors got confiscated at the airport shortly after Sept. 11, but the nail clippers are just great.  </li>
            <li> (you&#x27;ll get one at the hospital, but its great to have an extra one or two!)</li>
            <li> They contain EVERYTHING that i have found to need and isnt filled with things i will never use just to drive up the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s has been very useful.</li>
            <li> Everything together in one little pack was appealing to me--it seemed more economical to purchase the items included this way and the case great for travel and keeping track of the stuff.  </li>
            <li> ANY KIND OF PROMOTIONS OR FREE OFFERS</li>
            <li> This comes in so handy and its in a package my four year old can bring to me when I need it!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use and is of high quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going nuts right now trying to find the toothbrush packaged by itself!</li>
            <li> And, if I break a nail I have clippers and a nail file right there!</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is a good first brush for a baby, being quite soft</li>
            <li> I bought it since my wife is expecting our second child in three months, she loved it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know how much of the stuff I would use, but figured better to have and not need it.</li>
            <li> The nail clippers are really easy to use, and the sissors are very easy to use - it has really made the chore of clipping my kids nails into a much nicer experience.  </li>
            <li> I use the clippers every other day - they work great although I need to lean them inwards in order to stay away from snipping the skin.  </li>
            <li> I received this as a shower gift and have used it from the very first day I took my son home from the hospital.  </li>
            <li> I hope that it will become more useful as she gets older.</li>
            <li> I was given this as a gift for the arrival of my new baby, and I LOVE this kit.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend the nail nippers because of the safety grip that fits nicely in the palm of your hand to steady your clipping.</li>
            <li> All the items are of excellent quality and come in a soft green case so you can keep them in one place.</li>
            <li> I use the comb every day to smooth out her bedhead, and she really enjoys getting her hair combed.  </li>
            <li> I am able to use it for my newborn and my 2 year old - it is so helpful.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just going to be personal preference which you&#x27;re most comfortable with.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s still too young for the toothbrush, also, and we have a better one we plan on using.  </li>
            <li> this pack has some items you will find useful, but some of them I just don&#x27;t see myself using at all.</li>
            <li> I love the brush and comb, even though  my 11 month old doesn&#x60;t</li>
            <li> have much hair he will take the soft brush and try to brush his own hair.  </li>
            <li> The other products are OK, but most people get a lot of them anyway.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a nice little handy kit if you remember you have it!</li>
            <li> The quality seems good, but i havent used the theromoter in the other set</li>
            <li> And I was right</li>
            <li> Everything is right there when I need it.  </li>
            <li> Everything is right there</li>
            <li> They are just the right size for her to hold, too.  </li>
            <li> For such a low price, to have everything handy in one little kit is wonderful!  </li>
            <li> The bristles are light enough that they can move through her hair easily without causing pulls or snags.  </li>
            <li> I love the comb - the handle is so soft and easy to use, and the brush is so soft on my baby&#x27;s head, plus I can use it when bathing my baby to prevent cradle cap - really convienient!  </li>
            <li> This is a great small kit to keep in the diaper bag.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;But, its still a great set, and since its not very expensive its a nice baby present if you just need something small to give someone.</li>
            <li> the big bulb on the end makes it super easy to use.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s probably better off to take the emblem off, rather then to have it fall off at a later date without your knowledge, and have your baby put it in his/her mouth and risk choking.</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t get this whole kit, buy Safest 1st nail clippers!</li>
            <li> For a newborn, I found this grooming set to be pretty helpful.  </li>
            <li> It has every grooming item you could possible need and they are all of a respectable quality.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve bought several more of these nail clippers</li>
            <li> Most of all, it comes in a very convenient bag which makes it easy to store and retrieve - less chance of loosing any piece from the set.</li>
            <li> Unlike other reviewers, I think the toothbrush is GREAT for a toddler to hold and \\&quot;scrub\\&quot; with on their own (other children&#x27;s toothbrushes have little bristle heads that require more precision than a toddler is capable of).  </li>
            <li> You might also want to reconsider if you are planning to buy the other matching set - Hospital&#x27;s Choice Deluxe Care Kit.</li>
            <li> the little emry boards are cute and very useful.</li>
            <li> Overall, for the number of things I really use from this set, I don&#x27;t think it was worth it; however, if you think you&#x27;ll use more than half of what&#x27;s in the kit, it&#x27;s a convenient way to get all the items at once at a reasonable price and with a handy carrying case to boot.</li>
            <li> First of all, I think having the toothbrush as a part of this set is very unsanitary.</li>
            <li> I was really upset with it when the first time I opened it the zipper part broke.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I haven&#x27;t touhed any of the other items, but the scissors are perfectly curved for cutting nails ---</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found a use for the emory boards; I&#x27;m pretty pro at cutting the nails without leaving edges, so I kind of hijacked the emory boards for my own manicure use, haha.&lt;br /&gt;Overall,</li>
            <li> and it was fine, although I prefer the one I got from the hospital because it&#x27;s larger and teddy-bear shaped (easier to hold as well as keep track of).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for travel and the little carrying case is large enough to throw in a bulb syringe and a thermometer.</li>
            <li> Enough said, this would be a great gift for someone expecting a little one.  </li>
            <li> i think its a good investment as all my baby,s grooming items are kept neatly in a compact kit otherwise it might be a hard job for me to keep all these tiny things organized where u have a lot more things with a baby to do.my baby is still too young for the tooth brush</li>
            <li> Very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Still, you could purchase all of these items seperately, although I doubt you&#x27;d save much money.</li>
            <li> I really like the case it comes in</li>
            <li> my baby&#x27;s nail grow so fast...</li>
            <li> I love the wide handle on the nail clippers and</li>
            <li> It already contains a nail clipper and scissors - do you really need 2 of those?</li>
            <li> I agree that the toothbrush is a bit unnecessary, but the rest of the items are great.  </li>
            <li> It also comes with what you REALLY need ,</li>
            <li> If you were to buy various kits separately for the items you will use, it would add up to the same cost without the benefit of one nice bit storage bag.  </li>
            <li> The nail clippers are also great because they have an easy grip bulbous end that help you to hold them and are small enough to maneuver around her tiny nails.  </li>
            <li> I love that it keeps everything in one place and that the items are small enough for use on a newborn, but are still able to be used on a toddler.  </li>
            <li> The brush and comb are just right for baby soft hair, and the sturdy grips mean that baby can have a go at brushing his own hair if he feels like it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li> it costs a little more, but I then get quality items</li>
            <li> I love the storage aspect of the 30-piece kit as it zips up neatly and allows enough room to consolidate other relevant things such as teethers.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to throw into the diaper bag or even a large purse when you&#x27;re on the run and don&#x27;t want to remember every little detail.</li>
            <li> The handles on each item are big enough to make use easy for myself as well as my husband.  </li>
            <li> I thought I would get alot of use out of this handy little kit, but I&#x27;ve only used the clippers!  </li>
            <li> I NEVER had a probblem with any of the items and am infact hoping to get a new kit for the child Im about to have.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for any new mom.</li>
            <li> So I ended up getting her a new comb and giving this one to my baby.</li>
            <li> I will be using them again with my new baby.</li>
            <li> I needed a new one...</li>
            <li> We gave this as a gift to friend of ours having a new baby.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to any new mom.</li>
            <li> I would recomend to any new mom this and the &amp;quot;Deluxe Nursery Set</li>
            <li> The brush, comb, and toothbrush have bigger handles so that when baby is old enough they can grab them easily.  </li>
            <li> This one is heavy dutie, the real deal not that cheap material others are made out of.</li>
            <li> I love this little set for baby!  </li>
            <li> brush is very soft and can be soothing on baby&#x27;s head.  </li>
            <li> It is easier to manage and you won&#x27;t clip off pieces of their fingers, as I have done with the infant nail clipper (and many other mothers have done the same I have since learned).  </li>
            <li> I used the emery boards for his nails during the first 2 months and later have been using the scissors for his fingernails.   </li>
            <li> I use the nail clippers on almost a daily basis (babies&#x27; nails DO grow fast!), and I use the hair brush every day, even though my daughter is practically bald.  </li>
            <li> I thought the toothbrush was silly and kind of out of place, but my son loves it!</li>
            <li> One of the reviewers was kind enough to list all the items in the 30-piece kit, which I found extremely helpful when I initially registered for the kit.  </li>
            <li> By the time your baby is old enough to use it, the toothbrush will probably be full of bacteria and germs considering you&#x27;ve kept it in there along with the brush and comb that you use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> but I was so excited about it and was let down.</li>
            <li> Instead of buying a kit, purchasing individual pieces and a little makeup bag to hold them in makes more sense...</li>
            <li> He is now 2 yrs old and we are still using the comb and nail clippers.  </li>
            <li> I use the clippers &amp;amp; scissors on my daughters toenails, they are much easier because they do not have to be as short as her fingernails.  </li>
            <li> Even now I still use the clippers on my now 17 month old son.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had to replace the toothbrush, but that&#x27;s just because those things get old and worn.  </li>
            <li> My pediatrician said to use regular boards, which worked much better.&lt;BR</li>
            <li> I have used everything in this so far, except for the tooth brush</li>
            <li> Part of that may be that our 6 month old still doesn&#x27;t have a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> The brush is really soft</li>
            <li> My daughter wasn&#x27;t able to use the brush because it was to soft for her thick curly hair.  </li>
            <li> The brush and comb are nice and sturdy, which means extended use beyond thin infant hair.</li>
            <li> The  few items within the kit are very useful.  </li>
            <li> If you are buying it solely for the first few months, just get clippers and a brush instead of buying the whole shebang.&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first, I thought the tiny emery boards were ridiculous, but now I find them indispensable.</li>
            <li> so you can grab it better, curved scissors, also specially designed for your baby&#x27;s soft and diminute nails, a soft hair brush and a  small comb suited for a baby&#x27;s delicate hair, a set of nail files and finally a tooth brush that you will not be using soon.  </li>
            <li> The other drawback is that the Safety first emblem on the nail trimmer came off within days of using it..</li>
            <li> I honestly have used something, anything from this kit maybe 4 times in the past year and a half.</li>
            <li> A good pair of scissors well suited for this is hard to find - these are curved well to get only nail and not skin, and have carefully bluted points -- trust me, DO NOT use your own nail scissors --- those guys can flail their hands and you&#x27;ll find yourself nearly stabbing the baby or yourself.</li>
            <li> My son is 8 months old now, and I&#x27;ve never cut his fingers with these scissors, he actually enjoys the process!</li>
            <li> and my son is only two months old.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are soft for baby&#x27;s little head, the toothbrush was actually very helpful in brushing out cradle cap.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, are you really going to use that toothbrush?</li>
            <li> the comb isn&#x27;t strong enough for long thick hair.</li>
            <li> - I didn&#x27;t find the brush too hard as another reviewer did, but I think the comb is too short; I would have preferred that the whole comb have teeth instead of having such a short toothed section and such a large handle.  </li>
            <li> My only problem is that I bought it for my 2 year old daughter who has long hair and</li>
            <li> I really shouldn&#x27;t have worried - I wound up getting a little comb and brush set myself and</li>
            <li> Other products similar to this are ok but not good quality.</li>
            <li> I really like this little kit.</li>
            <li> I have a seven month old, and have never needed the other items.  </li>
            <li> The scissors that are included with the kit aren&#x27;t great for cutting really small nails though.</li>
            <li> When I brought him home, I was a little nervous about cutting his nails, so it was good to have options.</li>
            <li> I received the green bag, that was without the toothbrush (but wouldn&#x60;t of minded having one since my little one go his first tooth at 4 months old)from my Mom.   </li>
            <li> they have an extra wide grip handle.  </li>
            <li> The case has pockets for slipping in bandages (toddlers are always getting scrapes and bumps) and when traveling, I&#x27;ve found it roomy enough for travel-sized toothpaste and diaper rash cream.  </li>
            <li> The nail clippers work well as long as your baby is not too wriggly</li>
            <li> , they stayed sharp enought to cut and not pull for a long time, and they are tiny enought for the littlest of nails.   </li>
            <li> Child Care Kit contains everything here and other items I have used such as the hairbrush (my son loves the feeling of this brush on his scalp and it was helpful with cradle cap), medicine dropper, rectal thermometer, and nail clipper.  </li>
            <li> Thank goodness for the case because in the hectic of everyday life I would of misplaced some of the items and not found  them when I really needed them.</li>
            <li> If you buy them individually, they are less than $1.  </li>
            <li> The pack is a little larger than I thought it would be, but I took all the tools out and keep them in a canister on one of the racks of our changing table.  </li>
            <li> It may be tempting to try to trim your little person&#x27;s hair with the &amp;quot;Safety&amp;quot; scissors from this kit but be extra careful.  </li>
            <li> I was told that they provide a brush for baby&#x27;s hair (it was a hard comb that left his head red after the nurses combed his hair).  </li>
            <li> She even tries to use it on herself.  </li>
            <li> They are to rough for finger nail.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really sanitary.&lt;BR</li>
            <li> ...helps a forgetful, sleep deprived mom to keep track of things.  </li>
            <li> so when your hands are wet from the bath you don&#x27;t lose the brush.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> Other nail clippers I have tried to use do not work as well as this one.  </li>
            <li> ,t usually need it in a daiper bag when going out on short trips.</li>
            <li> It is so hard, I was afraid to use it, I thought for sure it could scrape up our daughter&#x27;s gums.</li>
            <li> I know it seems silly, but I absolutely loe these nail clippers.  </li>
            <li> (Often when I am breast-feeding him and he swipes me with a sharp little nail.)  </li>
            <li> scissors are definatly helpful; tiny and very sharp, but they come with blunt end bumps on the sharp end, so that there is no way to accidently cut baby if you are cutting a hair or thread near her wiggling body.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll also be missing out on the changing pad and baby wipe container none of the other kits come with.</li>
            <li> He brushes his teeth at least twice a day, and would do it all day long if I let him.</li>
            <li> a little generic.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> This little set has the basics that you need, without a lot of unneccesary stuff.  </li>
            <li> This set contains almost all the little tools for a baby&#x27;s grooming.</li>
            <li> We just had our second daughter in late July!  </li>
            <li> The bristle brush is worthless on fine baby hair though.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback to this is the the nailclippers are a little flimsy, and not as &amp;quot;sharp&amp;quot; as I&#x27;d like them to be (especially, when your baby is squirming around, and instead of cutting the nail, you end up bending the nail).</li>
            <li> When I was in the hospital with my first child they didn&#x27;t have fingernail clippers and my son scratched his face up really badly before his pictures.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;All pieces of this kit are made toughly, (although the zipper of our one was broken) and are still in use now our baby is one year old.</li>
            <li> We have found this little set invaluable!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the scissors a couple of times to trim my daughter&#x27;s bangs, and I feel they are a little dull.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think too much of the matching nursery care kit, but this kit isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> &#x27;Grab the green kit&#x27; is a common phrase in our household for brushing hair after a bath, clipping or filing fingernails, etc.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what the small brush is....</li>
            <li> The brush is SO HARD.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used either the nail clipper or scissor because the doctors told us not to use them on delicate baby nails</li>
            <li> Nail files are not effective, nor is biting their fingernails!  </li>
            <li> --we are a thin haired family, hehe.  </li>
            <li> I had to return this kit because the quality was so poor-</li>
            <li> It was already broken.  </li>
            <li> They seemed a little thick and awkward for cutting my son&#x27;s nails.</li>
            <li> I tried using the emery boards, but have found all baby emery boards to be useless.  </li>
            <li> Except for the toothbrush, which is useless, we&#x27;ve got a lot of use out of it.  </li>
            <li> Now that we got the hang of cutting nails</li>
            <li> are things that I wasn&#x27;t crazy about:&lt;br /&gt;Emery boards just didn&#x27;t get the job done.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush is AWFUL.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I think this is a good purchase, with a variety of items you will need. Personally I am more comfortable using the scissors to clip my baby&#x27;s nails, &amp;amp; not all of them include those. Recommended.</li>
            <li> This grooming kit has everything that you need for an infant. The brushes are soft for baby&#x27;s little head, the toothbrush was actually very helpful in brushing out cradle cap.  The nail clippers are the best- they have an extra wide grip handle.  Great for clipping on tiny fingers.</li>
            <li> I was given this as a gift for the arrival of my new baby, and I LOVE this kit.  I am able to use it for my newborn and my 2 year old - it is so helpful.  The nail clippers are really easy to use, and the sissors are very easy to use - it has really made the chore of clipping my kids nails into a much nicer experience.  I love the comb - the handle is so soft and easy to use, and the brush is so soft on my baby&#x27;s head, plus I can use it when bathing my baby to prevent cradle cap - really convienient!  This is just a great kit!</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift 3 years ago when I was going to have my son. He still uses the nail clippers. The brush and comb went to my daughters dolls :) I NEVER had a probblem with any of the items and am infact hoping to get a new kit for the child Im about to have. I loved this product so much. Very sturdy. The case isnt bulky and easy to tote. Over all...2 thumbs way up!!</li>
            <li> The carry case is cute, but the products are definitely nothing great.  The brush is SO HARD.  I can&#x27;t imagine using it on a babies head!  The other products are OK, but most people get a lot of them anyway.</li>
            <li> The Hospital&#x27;s Choice 30 Piece All-in-one Child Care Kit contains everything here and other items I have used such as the hairbrush (my son loves the feeling of this brush on his scalp and it was helpful with cradle cap), medicine dropper, rectal thermometer, and nail clipper.  IMPORTANT: THE BEST TOOL FOR CLIPPING INFANT NAILS IS A NORMAL ADULT CUTICLE CLIPPER. It is easier to manage and you won&#x27;t clip off pieces of their fingers, as I have done with the infant nail clipper (and many other mothers have done the same I have since learned).  Nail files are not effective, nor is biting their fingernails!  I have tried everything.  I love the storage aspect of the 30-piece kit as it zips up neatly and allows enough room to consolidate other relevant things such as teethers.  If you were to buy various kits separately for the items you will use, it would add up to the same cost without the benefit of one nice bit storage bag.  One of the reviewers was kind enough to list all the items in the 30-piece kit, which I found extremely helpful when I initially registered for the kit.  You&#x27;ll also be missing out on the changing pad and baby wipe container none of the other kits come with.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think too much of the matching nursery care kit, but this kit isn&#x27;t too bad. Still, you could purchase all of these items seperately, although I doubt you&#x27;d save much money. The nail clippers are pretty good, but I&#x27;ve never used the scissors. It&#x27;s just going to be personal preference which you&#x27;re most comfortable with. At first, I thought the tiny emery boards were ridiculous, but now I find them indispensable. We&#x27;ll see about the rest once we&#x27;ve got hair &amp; teeth to worry about.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviews.  The hairbrush is great, and the set would be perfect without the toothbrush.  I especially like the mini emery boards.  They are easy to use on my baby.</li>
            <li> I love this little set for baby!  When I was in the hospital with my first child they didn&#x27;t have fingernail clippers and my son scratched his face up really badly before his pictures.  I was told that they provide a brush for baby&#x27;s hair (it was a hard comb that left his head red after the nurses combed his hair).  This time I will be prepaired when this baby decides to come out!  I really like the case it comes in, I can just toss it into my hospital bag and not have to worry where everything is at.  When the baby is born this set will be great for traveling, just toss the case into the diaper bag and go!</li>
            <li> I received this set after registering for it.  Everything together in one little pack was appealing to me--it seemed more economical to purchase the items included this way and the case great for travel and keeping track of the stuff.  And I was right--it&#x27;s been nice.  The nail clippers are perfect and the brush is very soft.  I tried using the emery boards, but have found all baby emery boards to be useless.  We haven&#x27;t used the comb or toothbrush yet, but when we do need them, I know where they are!</li>
            <li> This set is perfect for baby.  Everything is in one place.  The brush is perfect and is good to use on baby with little hair.  I have no problems with the emery boards.  The tooth brush isn&#x27;t needed yet...but in the future we&#x27;ll have it.  To keep the toothbrush (and finger toothbrush) sanitary we bought one of those travel tooth brush cases this way its not in the same case as the comb/brush.  The finger tooth brush will be great and easy to use when the teeth first start to cut.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a baby shower gift, even though I knew most baskets contain some, if not all of these items.  What I especially liked was the case they come in.  It&#x27;s easy to throw into the diaper bag or even a large purse when you&#x27;re on the run and don&#x27;t want to remember every little detail.</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t use everything in this kit.  I think we would have been better off purchasing what we needed separately.</li>
            <li> I thought I would get alot of use out of this handy little kit, but I&#x27;ve only used the clippers!  I would purchase these things seperate when or if needed.</li>
            <li> I received this as a shower gift.  I love that it keeps everything in one place and that the items are small enough for use on a newborn, but are still able to be used on a toddler.  The only drawback to this is the the nailclippers are a little flimsy, and not as &amp;quot;sharp&amp;quot; as I&#x27;d like them to be (especially, when your baby is squirming around, and instead of cutting the nail, you end up bending the nail). The other drawback is that the Safety first emblem on the nail trimmer came off within days of using it..so it&#x27;s probably better off to take the emblem off, rather then to have it fall off at a later date without your knowledge, and have your baby put it in his/her mouth and risk choking.</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift and love it.  Everything is right there when I need it.  The nail clippers are great and easy to use.  I recommend this product for any new mom.</li>
            <li> This kit was given to me when my son was born.  He is now 2 yrs old and we are still using the comb and nail clippers.  Everything in here worked as advertised, I never had any problems with anything.  I would have liked to have a thermometer included, that would be my only drawback.  I am expecting soon and will use everything in the same kit, except the toothbrush of course!  I would recomend it.</li>
            <li> If you buy them individually, they are less than $1.  I know it seems silly, but I absolutely loe these nail clippers.  They fit in my hand well, they stayed sharp enought to cut and not pull for a long time, and they are tiny enought for the littlest of nails.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Even if you don&#x27;t get this whole kit, buy Safest 1st nail clippers!</li>
            <li> I love this set and it&#x27;s a great price! My only problem is that I bought it for my 2 year old daughter who has long hair and the comb isn&#x27;t strong enough for long thick hair. So I ended up getting her a new comb and giving this one to my baby.</li>
            <li> I bought this when my practically bald 15-month-old wanted to brush her hair just like big sister.  [She] LOVES having her own \\&quot;travel kit\\&quot; - just like sister and Mommy!  Unlike other reviewers, I think the toothbrush is GREAT for a toddler to hold and \\&quot;scrub\\&quot; with on their own (other children&#x27;s toothbrushes have little bristle heads that require more precision than a toddler is capable of).  The case has pockets for slipping in bandages (toddlers are always getting scrapes and bumps) and when traveling, I&#x27;ve found it roomy enough for travel-sized toothpaste and diaper rash cream.  I agree, though, that the kit becomes incomplete when the toothbrush needs changing.  I&#x27;m going nuts right now trying to find the toothbrush packaged by itself!</li>
            <li> For a newborn, I found this grooming set to be pretty helpful.  The pack is a little larger than I thought it would be, but I took all the tools out and keep them in a canister on one of the racks of our changing table.  &lt;br /&gt;The brush is very soft and can be soothing on baby&#x27;s head.  The bristles are light enough that they can move through her hair easily without causing pulls or snags.  I haven&#x27;t had to use the comb yet--we are a thin haired family, hehe.  She&#x27;s still too young for the toothbrush, also, and we have a better one we plan on using.  The one with this kit is a little generic.&lt;br /&gt;The scissors are definatly helpful; tiny and very sharp, but they come with blunt end bumps on the sharp end, so that there is no way to accidently cut baby if you are cutting a hair or thread near her wiggling body.  The nail clippers are also great because they have an easy grip bulbous end that help you to hold them and are small enough to maneuver around her tiny nails.  I haven&#x27;t found a use for the emory boards; I&#x27;m pretty pro at cutting the nails without leaving edges, so I kind of hijacked the emory boards for my own manicure use, haha.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this pack has some items you will find useful, but some of them I just don&#x27;t see myself using at all.</li>
            <li> I love the nail clippers and emery boards, and the hair brush, as my son had a lot of hair when he was born!  The only problem I&#x27;ve had is the zipper kept breaking and now I finally have given up on it.  Otherwise, all of the items (except the toothbrush, which I haven&#x27;t had to use yet) have been excellent, and it&#x27;s nice to have it all in one case.</li>
            <li> I use the brush often. When my baby had the cradle cap I would brush his hair with mineral oil to loosen it before shampooing.  And you can&#x27;t be without the nail clipper my baby&#x27;s nail grow so fast...</li>
            <li> For such a low price, to have everything handy in one little kit is wonderful!  &#x27;Grab the green kit&#x27; is a common phrase in our household for brushing hair after a bath, clipping or filing fingernails, etc.  (Often when I am breast-feeding him and he swipes me with a sharp little nail.)  We toss it in our suitcase or diaperbag when we travel.  Everything is right there and we never have to rummage for anything.  (Would love to be more organized on my own, but I am a working mom!)  True, we do not use the comb or toothbrush, but the organization of the product makes up for that!  Remove the toothbrush and insert an aspirator or a thermometer.  Add a couple bandaids or sterile wipes and you have the perfect travel kit!  Get this bag!</li>
            <li> This cute grooming set contains a baby nail clipper with a handle so you can grab it better, curved scissors, also specially designed for your baby&#x27;s soft and diminute nails, a soft hair brush and a  small comb suited for a baby&#x27;s delicate hair, a set of nail files and finally a tooth brush that you will not be using soon.  All the items are of excellent quality and come in a soft green case so you can keep them in one place.It seems to me that it is a cute and useful set for your baby.I bought it since my wife is expecting our second child in three months, she loved it. A great buy.</li>
            <li> this kit is wonderful.  i&#x27;ve used everything in it, and the carry case is great for trips!&lt;BR&gt;highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I really liked that all these things were packed up together in a nice zipper bag. But I find that by 4 months, I have only used the fingernail clippers and the brush (until all baby&#x27;s hair fell out!).&lt;br /&gt; I hope that it will become more useful as she gets older. If you are buying it solely for the first few months, just get clippers and a brush instead of buying the whole shebang.&lt;br /&gt; This would be a good gift item.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift, and it&#x27;s great for the diaper bag.  The problem I have is the brush is falling apart.  It&#x27;s nice having everything in one kit, but I haven&#x27;t been pleased with the quaility of this one.  I also got a similar kit made by the 1st Years.  I recommend that one.</li>
            <li> I had to return this kit because the quality was so poor-I definitely got what I paid for.  Instead of buying a kit, purchasing individual pieces and a little makeup bag to hold them in makes more sense... it costs a little more, but I then get quality items and I don&#x27;t have to pay for items that I won&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Excellent!  Item arrived when it was promised.  I am a very happy customer</li>
            <li> My favorite things in this kit are the comb and the nail clippers.  My daughter actually sits contently while we use them to cut her fingernails.  They are very sharp and the perfect size, and the bulb shape fits comfortably in our hands and helps us to stabilize the clippers.  I use the comb every day to smooth out her bedhead, and she really enjoys getting her hair combed.  She even tries to use it on herself.  The bristle brush is worthless on fine baby hair though.  It just glides over the top of her hair, so I never use it.  And I&#x27;ve never used the toothbrush because it looks too big.  I just use the nubby rubber brushes that slide over my finger.  I&#x27;ve used the scissors a couple of times to trim my daughter&#x27;s bangs, and I feel they are a little dull.  But all in all, I am very glad we have this kit.</li>
            <li> We have been using this set since the day we came home from the hospital.  The emery boards are the best thing to use on your baby&#x27;s nails.  I use the clippers &amp;amp; scissors on my daughters toenails, they are much easier because they do not have to be as short as her fingernails.  She was born with a lot of hair and after taking a bath she loves having her hair brushed.  When she has more hair the comb will be useful.  She does not have teeth yet so the tooth brush has not been used.  We love this product!</li>
            <li> I got this set when shopping for my baby, and I think it&#x27;s great, has everything needed for a new baby. I love the wide handle on the nail clippers and the little emry boards are cute and very useful. Even now I still use the clippers on my now 17 month old son. I will be using them again with my new baby. I however never had any use for the scissors or the comb, but I found a use for everything else. I didn&#x27;t use the toothbrush for brushing teeth, but it worked great when I treated my son for cradle cap.</li>
            <li> We have found this little set invaluable!  It has every grooming item you could possible need and they are all of a respectable quality.  The sleek carrying case is compact and convenient!  We honestly use this almost every day!  A great buy!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I have one in my diaper station and one in the diaper bag.  It&#x27;s great for around the house use and for travel.  I always have it handy for when we go to get pictures taken, easy way to straighten up baby&#x27;s hair.  The scissors and emory boards are great too!  This is a must have for every mom!</li>
            <li> This little set has the basics that you need, without a lot of unneccesary stuff.  The nail clippers work great and have an enlarged base so that they are easier to hold.  The brush, comb, and toothbrush have bigger handles so that when baby is old enough they can grab them easily.  I highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li> First of all, I think having the toothbrush as a part of this set is very unsanitary. By the time your baby is old enough to use it, the toothbrush will probably be full of bacteria and germs considering you&#x27;ve kept it in there along with the brush and comb that you use on a daily basis. If you insist on purchasing this set, buy the generic brand &amp;quot;Especially For Baby.&amp;quot; It is cheaper and the colors are nicer. You might also want to reconsider if you are planning to buy the other matching set - Hospital&#x27;s Choice Deluxe Care Kit. It already contains a nail clipper and scissors - do you really need 2 of those?</li>
            <li> I received this as a shower gift and have used it from the very first day I took my son home from the hospital.  I used the emery boards for his nails during the first 2 months and later have been using the scissors for his fingernails.   Now I have also been using the clippers for his toe nails.  My son was born with lots of hair so I use the brush quite often and he loves it when I do.  The downside is the zipper broke after the 2nd week.  ALthough I can try to have it replaced, I simply don&#x27;t have the time to deal with it.  I think it&#x27;s a great idea to have all his grooming stuff in one compact case so it can go from nursery to travel bag with you.</li>
            <li> I bought this while browsing through the local Babies R Us store, and consider this one of the best and most essential baby items I own.  Everything you will need for day-to-day grooming for your baby is in this kit.  I use the nail clippers on almost a daily basis (babies&#x27; nails DO grow fast!), and I use the hair brush every day, even though my daughter is practically bald.  The kit also comes with 2 nail files, nail scissors, a comb, and a baby toothbrush.  Overall, this is a great kit at a great price!</li>
            <li> I recieved this as a gift.  The  few items within the kit are very useful.  My daughter wasn&#x27;t able to use the brush because it was to soft for her thick curly hair.  but the comb works wonders in both our hair.  The tooth brush is being used as a teething tool as well as cleaning her gums and tounge.  The nail clippers has a great grip.  Other nail clippers I have tried to use do not work as well as this one.  The nail files are better used on the toe nails rather than the finger nails.  They are to rough for finger nail.  The scissors are being used for my sewing kit.  I needed a new one...smiles...The medicine dropper is used daily.  My daughter needs to take several oral meds for a reflux problem.  It&#x27;s has been very useful.</li>
            <li> I JUST FOUND OUT LAST WEEK THAT MY DAUGHTER IS HAVING TWINS.&lt;BR&gt;IS THERE ANY KIND OF PROMOTIONS OR FREE OFFERS THAT BABYRUS HAS THEY I COULD REGISTER HER FOR?&lt;br /&gt;THANKS,&lt;BR&gt;MRS. REINHARDT</li>
            <li> I received the green bag, that was without the toothbrush (but wouldn&#x60;t of minded having one since my little one go his first tooth at 4 months old)from my Mom.   I have used this grooming set almost on daily basis for both of my children.  The curved scissors where excellent in the beginning especially because I was scared using the clippers.  Now that we got the hang of cutting nails we use the cilppers. I love the brush and comb, even though  my 11 month old doesn&#x60;t have much hair he will take the soft brush and try to brush his own hair.  Enough said, this would be a great gift for someone expecting a little one.  Even if she receives one from someone else, it wouldn&#x60;t hurt to have an extra in the diaper bag.  Thank goodness for the case because in the hectic of everyday life I would of misplaced some of the items and not found  them when I really needed them.</li>
            <li> I bought this product over 2 years ago, when I had my daughter.  Since then we have gotten a lot of use out of it.  We&#x27;ve had to replace the toothbrush, but that&#x27;s just because those things get old and worn.  It worked great while we had it, though.  My favorite part is the grippy handles on the brush, comb, and toothbrush.  The brush and the comb we still use, but now she has to do it all by herself.  They are just the right size for her to hold, too.  I never used the emery boards, and my scissors got confiscated at the airport shortly after Sept. 11, but the nail clippers are just great.  I love that it has a wider handle.  That has made it easier for me to hold on to it, while holding on to my squirming minchkin.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I read the review from the lady who&#x27;s zipper broke, but I&#x27;ve had mine for over 2 years, and my zipper still works fine.</li>
            <li> This comes in such a great, handy storage bag that keeps everything neat and easy.  I have no problems with the quality of the items in the grooming set.</li>
            <li> This set contains almost all the little tools for a baby&#x27;s grooming. It&#x27;s very easy to use and is of high quality. Most of all, it comes in a very convenient bag which makes it easy to store and retrieve - less chance of loosing any piece from the set.</li>
            <li> I never used the nail scissors- I just didn&#x27;t trust my coordination.  The brush is great, so is the comb and the nail clippers are SUPER.  We&#x27;ve bought several more of these nail clippers separately- the big bulb on the end makes it super easy to use.  The toothbrush is AWFUL.  It is so hard, I was afraid to use it, I thought for sure it could scrape up our daughter&#x27;s gums.</li>
            <li> I registered for this kit because I didn&#x27;t want to have to worry about getting all these things separately.  I really shouldn&#x27;t have worried - I wound up getting a little comb and brush set myself and the hospital gave us a baby emery board that I&#x27;ve used since day 1.  The comb and brush in this set are OK - I didn&#x27;t find the brush too hard as another reviewer did, but I think the comb is too short; I would have preferred that the whole comb have teeth instead of having such a short toothed section and such a large handle.  I haven&#x27;t used either the nail clipper or scissor because the doctors told us not to use them on delicate baby nails (it&#x27;s too easy to accidentally clip the skin).  I used the emory board from this set once and it was fine, although I prefer the one I got from the hospital because it&#x27;s larger and teddy-bear shaped (easier to hold as well as keep track of).  I haven&#x27;t used the toothbrush, either - until my baby gets teeth, I&#x27;ll just wipe her gums with a damp cloth.  Overall, for the number of things I really use from this set, I don&#x27;t think it was worth it; however, if you think you&#x27;ll use more than half of what&#x27;s in the kit, it&#x27;s a convenient way to get all the items at once at a reasonable price and with a handy carrying case to boot.</li>
            <li> This is a good product to carry in your diaper bag. You never have to worry if you have a brush, clippers, etc. The case makes it nice because nothing gets lost. Definetly a good thing to have.</li>
            <li> It may be tempting to try to trim your little person&#x27;s hair with the &amp;quot;Safety&amp;quot; scissors from this kit but be extra careful.  My son&#x27;s ear got caught between the handles (not the blades) and it cut his ear badly enough that it bled for quite a while. Otherwise it is a fine kit.</li>
            <li> This kit has all the things that you need to keep your baby looking  nice.  I agree that the toothbrush is a bit unnecessary, but the rest of the items are great.  A great starter kit!</li>
            <li> We opened this item and went to zipper the &amp;quot;convenient&amp;quot; carrying case and it wouldn&#x27;t zip.  It was already broken.  &lt;BR&gt;Aside from that, there are a lot of items used to deal with fingernails.  Are three options truly necessary?&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This cute kit has everything you need, except the nasal aspirator. Everything works well. It&#x27;s great for travel and the little carrying case is large enough to throw in a bulb syringe and a thermometer.</li>
            <li> I got this when I was pg. I didn&#x27;t know how much of the stuff I would use, but figured better to have and not need it. I thought the toothbrush was silly and kind of out of place, but my son loves it! He brushes his teeth at least twice a day, and would do it all day long if I let him. I like that there are emery boards (which I use on his toes)nail clippers and scissors. When I brought him home, I was a little nervous about cutting his nails, so it was good to have options.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift and I use it all of the time.  The handles on each item are big enough to make use easy for myself as well as my husband.  It comes with everything you could want all in one convenient case.  And, my daughter loves being able to hold the toothbrush by herself in order to chew on the bristles!!</li>
            <li> This is a helpful product for not a lot of money.  Except for the toothbrush, which is useless, we&#x27;ve got a lot of use out of it.  The hairbrush is great as are the clippers and mini-emery boards.  It&#x27;s also a good size to throw in the diaper bag.</li>
            <li> I honestly have used something, anything from this kit maybe 4 times in the past year and a half. I keep it in the diaper bag and forget I even have it! The case is handy. The clippers are very nice, brush and comb normal. Other than that, are you really going to use that toothbrush? It&#x27;s not really sanitary.&lt;BR&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a nice little handy kit if you remember you have it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very nice, handy and cheap product. You keep everything in one place. We basically use the nail care products but I think every parent would be happy having this set.&lt;BR&gt;I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll find it helpful.</li>
            <li> I love this set!  Easy to use carrying case...helps a forgetful, sleep deprived mom to keep track of things.  &lt;BR&gt;Here are the things I liked:&lt;br /&gt;The price&lt;BR&gt;The carrying case&lt;BR&gt;The shape of the clippers (easy to hold when you have a squirmy baby!)&lt;BR&gt;Nice brush and comb...rubber grip so when your hands are wet from the bath you don&#x27;t lose the brush.&lt;br /&gt;Here are things that I wasn&#x27;t crazy about:&lt;br /&gt;Emery boards just didn&#x27;t get the job done.  My pediatrician said to use regular boards, which worked much better.&lt;BR&gt;Not sure what the small brush is....&lt;BR&gt;Could use a nasal aspirator with kit...(you&#x27;ll get one at the hospital, but its great to have an extra one or two!)</li>
            <li> I use the clippers every other day - they work great although I need to lean them inwards in order to stay away from snipping the skin.  I have a seven month old, and have never needed the other items.  I would have been just fine with one pair of clippers and not the rest of the kit.</li>
            <li> I got this as a shower gift, and it has everythig you need. Other products similar to this are ok but not good quality. This one is heavy dutie, the real deal not that cheap material others are made out of. It also comes with what you REALLY need , not all that extra stuff that you never even use plus you can take it with you everywhere in it&#x27;s case. Great Product!</li>
            <li> I was terrified to cut my newborn&#x27;s nails, but the scissors in this set are wonderful. My son is 8 months old now, and I&#x27;ve never cut his fingers with these scissors, he actually enjoys the process! I also like the hairbrush. We haven&#x27;t used nail files (and probably won&#x27;t), or any of the toothbrushing stuff yet.</li>
            <li> I got this set as a shower gift. I really liked the set except the nail scissors. They seemed a little thick and awkward for cutting my son&#x27;s nails. The brush and comb are nice and sturdy, which means extended use beyond thin infant hair. I highly recommend the nail nippers because of the safety grip that fits nicely in the palm of your hand to steady your clipping.</li>
            <li> This is a great small kit to keep in the diaper bag.  It has everything in one spot that you may need if you are out and about!</li>
            <li> This is a nice kit to have since it contains everything you need. The scissors that are included with the kit aren&#x27;t great for cutting really small nails though. I got a pair from another company to leave as a spare in the diaper bag and now I only use those. &lt;br /&gt;But, its still a great set, and since its not very expensive its a nice baby present if you just need something small to give someone.</li>
            <li> I have used everything in this so far, except for the tooth brush and my son is only two months old.  After I use the nail clippers I file his nails so he wil not get this face.  Sug, clip the babies nails while he is sleeping.</li>
            <li> We gave this as a gift to friend of ours having a new baby. They had put it on their registry, and have told us they are very happy with the tools in the kit, and find the implements to be safe and effective for grooming their little one.</li>
            <li> Great product, love the idea that I have everything in one place.  Only thing I thought could go was the toothbrush do not find a toothbrush as a necessary item in a baby grooming kit.  Also since you replace toothbrushes every 3-6 months soon the set will be incomplete.</li>
            <li> We got this and have not used any of it. Part of that may be that our 6 month old still doesn&#x27;t have a lot of hair. We had to buy a better nail clipper than the one included.</li>
            <li> I got this at my baby shower.  I take it with me when I travel.  It has all her grooming needs.  I love the gum stimulator.  My daughter loves when I use it to rub her gums.  Plus, the little emory boards are wonderful.</li>
            <li> I really like this little kit. The scissors are great for clipping my sons nails. I just couldn&#x27;t get the hang of the clippers and the scissors were a snap! I keep the kit in his diaper bag, that way I always know where it is. And, if I break a nail I have clippers and a nail file right there! The brush is really soft so he doesn&#x27;t mind me brushing his hair at all. I would recommend this to any new mom.</li>
            <li> We just had our second daughter in late July!  This comes in so handy and its in a package my four year old can bring to me when I need it!  Has everything you could possibly need.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I haven&#x27;t touhed any of the other items, but the scissors are perfectly curved for cutting nails --- a stressful activity if ever there was one.  A good pair of scissors well suited for this is hard to find - these are curved well to get only nail and not skin, and have carefully bluted points -- trust me, DO NOT use your own nail scissors --- those guys can flail their hands and you&#x27;ll find yourself nearly stabbing the baby or yourself.</li>
            <li> i think its a good investment as all my baby,s grooming items are kept neatly in a compact kit otherwise it might be a hard job for me to keep all these tiny things organized where u have a lot more things with a baby to do.my baby is still too young for the tooth brush but i have used all the rest of the things.the price is good too but what actually impressed me was the case.i thought it would fit neatly into the daiper bag.but i don,t usually need it in a daiper bag when going out on short trips.</li>
            <li> This is an ideal gift if you don&#x27;t know the sex of the baby and don&#x27;t just want to buy clothes.&lt;br /&gt;All pieces of this kit are made toughly, (although the zipper of our one was broken) and are still in use now our baby is one year old. The brush and comb are just right for baby soft hair, and the sturdy grips mean that baby can have a go at brushing his own hair if he feels like it. The nail clippers work well as long as your baby is not too wriggly (tip: wait till he falls asleep!) and the scissors seem about as safe as you can make a tool designed for cutting.&lt;br /&gt;The emery boards are a bit of a mystery - why would you want to file a baby&#x27;s nails. No doubt there will be parents who have an answer for this though. The toothbrush is a good first brush for a baby, being quite soft it helps him get used to the idea of having it in his mouth.&lt;br /&gt;A good quality product and a useful gift.</li>
            <li> I researched for awhile which set is best for me and fits my needs the best. This is my third baby and I found that this and the &amp;quot;deluxe nursery Set&amp;quot; work just perfect. They contain EVERYTHING that i have found to need and isnt filled with things i will never use just to drive up the price. The quality seems good, but i havent used the theromoter in the other set so i cant comment on that. I would recomend to any new mom this and the &amp;quot;Deluxe Nursery Set</li>
            <li> We registered for this for our shower and we received it. I was really upset with it when the first time I opened it the zipper part broke. I was just simply looking at all the stuff in it and I was done looking at it and went to zip it up and the zipper broke. I don&#x27;t know if I had a defected one or what but I was so excited about it and was let down. I am going to contact the company as I didn&#x27;t have a receipt for it to take it back. So watch out for the zipper part!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I got this for a friend who had just had a baby, and she used it almost daily. Her daughter is now a toddler, and she has one on the way and is still using this kit. It has everything you need and it&#x27;s durable.</li>
