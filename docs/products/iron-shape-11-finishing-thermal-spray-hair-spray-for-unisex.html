            <li>Best spray I&#x27;ve used to straighten my hair yet!</li>

            <li>I have my hair bleached and couldn&#x27;t iron my hair because it would burn every time, but with this product and in the lowest temperature in the iron is the perfect product for my hair.</li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li>Very pleasant smell.</li>

            <li>I tried the 11 but its not as good as the 15  </li>
            <li>I have had good results with it.</li>
            <li>They changed the formula and it is not so good anymore...</li>
            <li>Redken is a good product</li>
            <li>My hair is layered with a fair amount of curl.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple years and love it!</li>
            <li>Gives nice lift and volume.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>Great product and really fast shipment!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product as my hair has been keeping shiny and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>Love this product and would buy it again.  </li>
            <li>Need to find another better product for my hair.</li>
            <li>I love this thermal protectant spray.</li>
            <li>This was an okay product.  </li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite hair products.</li>
            <li>It was okay</li>
            <li>, I have another that I like more.</li>
            <li>It just felt to have more water in the product.  </li>
            <li>so it would not feel like I was getting more steam from the heat of the flatiron</li>
            <li>I love the Redken Iron Shape Thermal Spray.</li>
            <li>(I wish there was a fragrance free option!)</li>
            <li>Love it, and also love Redken&#x27;s heat glide.</li>
            <li>I love redken products and would recommend this to anyone I know.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this products.</li>
            <li>So my hair smells awesome all day long while being protected.</li>
            <li>The seller got it to me very quickly and the price I paid was fantastic compared to a salon!</li>
            <li>I recently just bought a new straightener for my hair and decided that it was probably best to invest in a good heat protectant for my hair.</li>
            <li>Just spray it on your hair brush and comb through hair all over before you start, and it should work fine.</li>
            <li>Very protective and adds nice shine.</li>
            <li>Spray not half as good as the product it replaced #15.  </li>
            <li>I recommend getting this product, it is worth every cent!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad smell</li>
            <li>Another benefit is the fresh and fruity smell.</li>
            <li>my old redken starch- love it.</li>
            <li>It does hold the hair in place as you blow dry and smoothes the frizzies kind of like a mild hair spray.</li>
            <li>Curls stay tight and bouncy all day and it smells amazing too!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a hot product without the crunchy buildup.</li>
            <li>organix flat iron spray is not flammable and is more moisterizing</li>
            <li>Totally makes a huge difference to apply this spray before using a flatiron.  </li>
            <li>I straighten my hair daily, and iron shape helps protect it, keeps it smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>but it really does work.  </li>
            <li>Much smoother, shinier hair.</li>
            <li>I even use it to boosts curls after a few days after washing, when I have frizz and not so spectacular curls.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if this product is effective or not as I have only used it a couple of times.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li>I use this before I straighten or blow dry my hair, and I think it protects it pretty well.</li>
            <li>The only time I have had an issue when using this is when the humidity is really high.  </li>
            <li>Product arrived very fast and works just as expected.</li>
            <li>If you need a solid hold on a style such as a curl, then this will do it.&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t create touchable soft hair as much as this creates hair that won&#x27;t budge and it stays where you need</li>
            <li>It really helps keep my frizz at bay prior to flat ironing.</li>
            <li>My hair is thin and baby fine.</li>

            <li> Using this spray before I using a curling iron gives me long lasting results!</li>
            <li> but we use it to flat iron?</li>
            <li> I have dry curly hair that I like to use heat on from time to time (flat iron, ghd curler).</li>
            <li> I do not like the bottle that it comes in because it sprays such a wide distance that I end up getting spray all over my face.  </li>
            <li> THE BOTTLE LASTS A LONG TIME.</li>
            <li> I tried various other sprays to get my curls to stay put</li>
            <li> I will finish off this spray and then go back to my other product.</li>
            <li> Although this is intended for use with thermal stylers, I also find it works extremely well when hair is damp after a shower, before blow drying with a regular hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very long hair.</li>
            <li> It definitely helps my hair hold a style without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> It will help you have less frizz and help the curl/volumn last longer</li>
            <li> Really no different from a product I could have purchased at Walmart for less.</li>
            <li> which is to be expected.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> not too much can go wrong w/</li>
            <li> It weighs your hair down, so use sparingly.</li>
            <li> My previous styling product was discontinued a few years ago</li>
            <li> Spray a few times through your hair.  </li>
            <li> and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li> It also calms the hair, so that helps tame it while straightening.</li>
            <li> Finally I&#x27;ve found a product that doesn&#x27;t smell too bad</li>
            <li> I was very very disappointed in this product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought the thermal spray because my hair stylist recommended it. Great product and really fast shipment!</li>
            <li> This has a definite perfumey smell.  I&#x27;d prefer if it didn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s not a bad smell but I&#x27;m allergic to perfume.  It does hold the hair in place as you blow dry and smoothes the frizzies kind of like a mild hair spray.</li>
            <li> Not the standard of Spray Starch #15 but close and does the job.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Best spray I&#x27;ve used to straighten my hair yet! The seller got it to me very quickly and the price I paid was fantastic compared to a salon!</li>
            <li> ...and smells so good!</li>
            <li> I recently just bought a new straightener for my hair and decided that it was probably best to invest in a good heat protectant for my hair. I absolutely love this product as my hair has been keeping shiny and healthy looking. I recommend getting this product, it is worth every cent!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser turned me on to this. Use spray on you hair after drying before styling.  Spray a few times through your hair.  It will help you have less frizz and help the curl/volumn last longer</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this product is effective or not as I have only used it a couple of times.  I do not like the bottle that it comes in because it sprays such a wide distance that I end up getting spray all over my face.  If they could just improve the container, then I would be happy to try it again.,</li>
            <li> A SPRITZ ON HAIR BEFORE YOU USE YOUR CURLING IRON.. GIVES A GREAT SET WITHOUT FEELING STICKY.  THE BOTTLE LASTS A LONG TIME.</li>
            <li> I use this before I straighten or blow dry my hair, and I think it protects it pretty well. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love this product and would buy it again.  Great protection for your hair</li>
            <li> It weighs your hair down, so use sparingly. And don&#x27;t use it between layers either. Just spray it on your hair brush and comb through hair all over before you start, and it should work fine.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that protects hair and helps it hold a set. My hair is thin and baby fine. Using this spray before I using a curling iron gives me long lasting results!</li>
            <li> Spray not half as good as the product it replaced #15.  Need to find another better product for my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this thermal protectant spray. It really helps keep my frizz at bay prior to flat ironing. It also calms the hair, so that helps tame it while straightening. Another benefit is the fresh and fruity smell. I would order this again.</li>
            <li> This was an okay product.  Really no different from a product I could have purchased at Walmart for less.</li>
            <li> Smells &amp;#34;dusty&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use anything but Redken! I have recommended this to many of my friends for great protectant! Great price too!</li>
            <li> Very nice as any product from Redken.</li>
            <li> I tried the 11 but its not as good as the 15  Could you tell me where I can find the 15 (heat styling shaper?)</li>
            <li> not too much can go wrong w/ this if you know you want it.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite hair products. I straighten my hair daily, and iron shape helps protect it, keeps it smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> This is not as advertised. I was very very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> This spray works great.  I tried various other sprays to get my curls to stay put and they fell out every time.  Until I came across this.  I was skeptical at first but it really does work.  The only time I have had an issue when using this is when the humidity is really high.  My hair did fall then which is to be expected.  Other than that I have had good results with it.</li>
            <li> I have Redken shampoo and thought I would try this thermal spray.  It was okay, I have another that I like more. It just felt to have more water in the product.  I tried using the spray different ways so it would not feel like I was getting more steam from the heat of the flatiron but nothing seem to work.  I will finish off this spray and then go back to my other product.</li>
            <li> They changed the formula and it is not so good anymore...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like my old redken starch- love it.</li>
            <li> Although this is intended for use with thermal stylers, I also find it works extremely well when hair is damp after a shower, before blow drying with a regular hair dryer.  Gives nice lift and volume.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple years and love it! It&#x27;s a hot product without the crunchy buildup.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any hair.</li>
            <li> I have my hair bleached and couldn&#x27;t iron my hair because it would burn every time, but with this product and in the lowest temperature in the iron is the perfect product for my hair.</li>
            <li> Redken is a good product but I find this to be drying to the hair but it adds a lot of shine!  it concerns me for the bottle says FLAMMABLE but we use it to flat iron? organix flat iron spray is not flammable and is more moisterizing</li>
            <li> I love the Redken Iron Shape Thermal Spray. I iron my hair a lot and it&#x27;s very long hair. This helps protect my hair from heat damage. Very pleasant smell. Leaves my hair soft. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Works well with my frizzy hair which resists styling and it helps get it straightened out.  My hair dresser turned me onto this product.</li>
            <li> Definitely cheaper to buy this here instead of locally.  Works as advertised.  Totally makes a huge difference to apply this spray before using a flatiron.  Much smoother, shinier hair.</li>
            <li> This product does what it says, holds a curl.  I use every time I&#x27;m curling my hair.</li>
            <li> My previous styling product was discontinued a few years ago so I&#x27;ve tried several different products in the interim. Finally I&#x27;ve found a product that doesn&#x27;t smell too bad (I wish there was a fragrance free option!) and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling stiff or sticky. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year now, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to build up a residue like some others do. It definitely helps my hair hold a style without weighing it down. My hair is layered with a fair amount of curl.</li>
            <li> The smell!!!!!!!  Gives my hair great shine and eliminates the frizzies as well.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! I have dry curly hair that I like to use heat on from time to time (flat iron, ghd curler). I stay this product all over every inch of my hair and do my hair when it dries. Very protective and adds nice shine. I even use it to boosts curls after a few days after washing, when I have frizz and not so spectacular curls. It gives my hair life and a second go at things before I wash again! Love it, and also love Redken&#x27;s heat glide. Have been using that for ten years or so!</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me, but I haven&#x27;t found that it does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t fool around. If you need a solid hold on a style such as a curl, then this will do it.&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t create touchable soft hair as much as this creates hair that won&#x27;t budge and it stays where you need it.&lt;br /&gt;I could see using this if I were creating vintage curls that I neededto last all day or all night.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
            <li> Product arrived very fast and works just as expected. I love redken products and would recommend this to anyone I know.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this products. Curls stay tight and bouncy all day and it smells amazing too!</li>
            <li> Besides the fact that this stuff works so well, it smells amazing! So my hair smells awesome all day long while being protected.</li>
            <li> Works well.  I spray it in to my hands and rub it it in.  Also softens my hand</li>
