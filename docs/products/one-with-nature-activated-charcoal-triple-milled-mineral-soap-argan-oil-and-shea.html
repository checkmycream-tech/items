            <li>Mildly scented and has a great lather.</li>
            <li>This soap will suprize you with light and pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>I just would have liked more scent.</li>
            <li>It lathers better than most popular brands on the market.  </li>
            <li>I love this soap.  </li>

            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It lathers really nice and makes me feel squeaky clean when I am done with the bath.</li>
            <li>Just a nice, clean feeling and smell.</li>
            <li>This soap does not seem to dissolve very fast either which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>smelled good at first, then smells like nothing and turns to goop.</li>
            <li>I bought a great variety of different soaps recently, trying to find a nice balance of a soap that had the &amp;#34;Dead Sea Minerals&amp;#34; in it to assist in my battles with eczema, a nice &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; to the soap, a good &amp;#34;lather&amp;#34;, smell and ...</li>
            <li>Very nice, leaves clean and soft</li>
            <li>Light fragrance, that by the time you are done with your shower is almost gone.</li>
            <li>I bought it as a fill-in to get Free shipping</li>
            <li>The soap smells amazing and it is very hydrating.</li>
            <li>I like it, but the Lilac bar seems to fall apart faster than the original.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s just my friendly warning.</li>
            <li>Lathers great &amp; lasts a really long time!</li>
            <li>Old fashioned kind of  soap with that soapy smell.</li>
            <li>It really just smells more like an unscented soap.</li>
            <li>A good, old fashioned bar soap that cleans well, smell nice, lathers well, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>It leaves a clean and fresh feel.</li>
            <li>I would want just a little more fragrance, but a great bar, large and non drying.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant odor, but to me it is not much like lilac.  </li>
            <li>It also has a nice slick feel to it and is nice for shaving</li>
            <li>Love that the soap is all natural.</li>
            <li>True enough after a week of using the soap, the acne started to clear and my daughter&#x27;s skin is now on the way to full recovery.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, it has been good</li>
            <li>Love the lilac fragrance and the way it leaves my skin soft after a bath/shower.  </li>
            <li>For the price, its worth it.</li>
            <li>so I was excited about this soap, but I don&#x27;t think it really smells like lilacs.</li>
            <li>Leave a clean feel without too much moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Gets your skin really clean without drying it out too much.</li>
            <li>I happen to like lilac very much</li>
            <li>so I very much like this soap.</li>
            <li>In about 5 or 6 days of use, I couldn&#x27;t believe how much softer the skin on my elbows had become!</li>
            <li>It does smell very &#x27;lilacey&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li>very large..should last a long time..and smells great</li>
            <li>other brands and liked them.</li>
            <li>Good size bar, so it&#x27;ll last a long time.</li>
            <li>It is hard to find a good soap if you suffer from allergies.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really smell like anything.</li>
            <li>really like this soap.  </li>
            <li>It lathers really well.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t foam much, which I like.</li>
            <li>Fast ship</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably go back to the original bar after this one is over.</li>
            <li>Overall love the product, but the fragrance could last a bit longer.</li>
            <li>Rich lather and the bar lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>This was too harsh for me...and was probably more about my skin than the soap.  </li>
            <li>I love all the One With Nature dead sea mineral soaps.</li>
            <li>So many lilac soaps smell overwhelmingly of little old lady, but this one just has a whiff of floral scent.</li>
            <li>Compared to some of  the other &amp;#34;mineral&amp;#34; soaps I purchased, which seem to have difficulty lathering and/or keeping a lather for very long at all, this soap lathers quite nicely.  </li>
            <li>This is after doing some research and finding out how effective dead sea minerals can be for such condition.</li>
            <li>Nothing worse than having you favorite soap melt away way too soon!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s natural though</li>
            <li>It all natural.</li>
            <li>The lilac scent is subtle but authentic.</li>
            <li>I actually did not even feel well absorbing the extra salts...</li>
            <li>No dry skin after using this bar of soap.</li>

            <li> No dry skin after using this bar of soap.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it really helps my skin - I&#x27;m usually really dry and itchy in the winter, but I haven&#x27;t had a problem since I switch to Dead Sea soap.</li>
            <li> it smelled kind of unpleasant, and was damaged while shipped</li>
            <li> It made my skin feel dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> Since using these I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin isn&#x27;t itchy or dry.</li>
            <li> It is made in Jordan from dead sea salt and other natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> The biggest complaint I could muster is that the bar doesn&#x27;t last very long, but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a smaller bar.</li>
            <li> A total waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Maybe if you shove your nose in there, it smells a little bit of lavender, but</li>
            <li> I bought this bar for the Dead Sea Minerals as I have&lt;br /&gt;tried</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage daughter who has bad acne on her back and neck area.  </li>
            <li> It got rid of that rough, dry skin that drives me crazy in the winter.</li>
            <li> At least not like any lilac I&#x27;ve ever smelled.</li>
            <li> This was a big disappointment.  </li>
            <li> Product arrived damaged and very late.</li>
            <li> but i kept it anyway, i do like dead sea mineral soap but not this smell, and was disappointed with the packaging</li>
    </ol>

            <li> perfect size smells amazing and feels good to.</li>
            <li> I have no problems with the soap.  It has a pleasant odor, but to me it is not much like lilac.  However I am quite happy with it.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  It lathers better than most popular brands on the market.  Yes, I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love this soap! The lilac scent is subtle but authentic. Love that the soap is all natural. And one bar lasts for weeks and weeks.</li>
            <li> Smells GREAT!!! This is a really nice size bar of soap and makes a great gift.</li>
            <li> LOve the smell and makes your skin feel wounderful</li>

            <li> All of these soaps are excellent. I actually have tried every one I can.</li>
            <li> One of the best soaps I have every tried.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage daughter who has bad acne on her back and neck area.  This is after doing some research and finding out how effective dead sea minerals can be for such condition.

            <li> nice texture and aroma!</li>
            <li> very large..should last a long time..and smells great</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really smell like anything. Maybe if you shove your nose in there, it smells a little bit of lavender, but not the warm inviting lilac scent I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> I do wish that I could have used this soap.  It is hard to find a good soap if you suffer from allergies.  This was too harsh for me...and was probably more about my skin than the soap.  I actually did not even feel well absorbing the extra salts...my guess.  I did like the feel of my skin at first...but later started itching.  Try it for yourself though.  Everyone has their own skin to deal with.</li>
            <li> The price is good, and it&#x27;s an ok soap for that price, but the scent is that of Pez candy. Ew.</li>
            <li> I would want just a little more fragrance, but a great bar, large and non drying.</li>
            <li> smelled good at first, then smells like nothing and turns to goop.</li>
            <li> Everything about this soap is nice. It is made in Jordan from dead sea salt and other natural ingredients. Mildly scented and has a great lather. Old fashioned kind of  soap with that soapy smell. Very nice on the skin and leaves the skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> The only thing lilac about this soap is the color. It really just smells more like an unscented soap. It does lather nice and my skin feels good after using it. I just would have liked more scent.</li>
            <li> Smells Amazing! Lathers great &amp; lasts a really long time!</li>
            <li> Light fragrance, that by the time you are done with your shower is almost gone. Leave a clean feel without too much moisturizer. Overall love the product, but the fragrance could last a bit longer.</li>
            <li> it lathers perfectly and smells amazing! the smell doesn&#x27;t linger on my skin and i kind of wish that it did, but it&#x27;s natural though so I understand why it doesn’t.</li>
            <li> Love the lilac fragrance and the way it leaves my skin soft after a bath/shower.  I bought this bar for the Dead Sea Minerals as I have&lt;br /&gt;tried other brands and liked them.</li>
            <li> I bought a great variety of different soaps recently, trying to find a nice balance of a soap that had the &amp;#34;Dead Sea Minerals&amp;#34; in it to assist in my battles with eczema, a nice &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; to the soap, a good &amp;#34;lather&amp;#34;, smell and ... well, result--how it makes my skin feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this soap.  It lathers really well.  Compared to some of  the other &amp;#34;mineral&amp;#34; soaps I purchased, which seem to have difficulty lathering and/or keeping a lather for very long at all, this soap lathers quite nicely.  It also has a nice slick feel to it and is nice for shaving with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it has a really nice lilac smell, which I like.</li>
            <li> Nice lather but scent is barefly detectable. Would like a more signifant scent.</li>
            <li> Has a great smell. So many lilac soaps smell overwhelmingly of little old lady, but this one just has a whiff of floral scent. It doesn&#x27;t foam much, which I like. I&#x27;m not a sudser! The best part is how moisturizing it is. In about 5 or 6 days of use, I couldn&#x27;t believe how much softer the skin on my elbows had become! It got rid of that rough, dry skin that drives me crazy in the winter. The biggest complaint I could muster is that the bar doesn&#x27;t last very long, but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a smaller bar.</li>
            <li> Very nice, leaves clean and soft</li>
            <li> I like it. Smells wonderful (can&#x27;t beat Lilac except maybe Lavender).  Lathers good, too.  Good size bar, so it&#x27;ll last a long time.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of lilac so I was excited about this soap, but I don&#x27;t think it really smells like lilacs. At least not like any lilac I&#x27;ve ever smelled. Nice scent, but not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I like it, but the Lilac bar seems to fall apart faster than the original. I&#x27;ll probably go back to the original bar after this one is over. The smell isn&#x27;t what I was hoping either. Otherwise, it really helps my skin - I&#x27;m usually really dry and itchy in the winter, but I haven&#x27;t had a problem since I switch to Dead Sea soap.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a fill-in to get Free shipping but I absolutely LOVE it!  I got all kinds of body wash for Christmas, but none of it is as wonderful as this and it smells so good too!</li>
            <li> LOVE this soap! No dry skin after using this bar of soap. Rich lather and the bar lasts a long time. Nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> Product arrived damaged and very late. Can&#x27;t give as gift.</li>
            <li> If you like the smell of lilac you will like this soap, I think. I happen to like lilac very much so I very much like this soap. It lathers really nice and makes me feel squeaky clean when I am done with the bath. I am very pleased with this soap. I would again say that if you do not lilac, do not purchase this soap. That&#x27;s just my friendly warning. It does smell very &#x27;lilacey&amp;#34;! This soap does not seem to dissolve very fast either which is a good thing. Nothing worse than having you favorite soap melt away way too soon! I do recommend this soap to all lilac lovers.</li>
            <li> This was a big disappointment.  It had no lilac scent to it what so ever.  A total waste of my money. It made my skin feel dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> I love all the One With Nature dead sea mineral soaps. Gets your skin really clean without drying it out too much. Since using these I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin isn&#x27;t itchy or dry. No breakouts. Just a nice, clean feeling and smell.</li>
            <li> Smells great.  Fast ship</li>
            <li> The soap smells amazing and it is very hydrating. For the price, its worth it.</li>
            <li> Love it. get you some</li>
            <li> Love this soap and the smell is wonderful.</li>
            <li> This soap is the best!</li>
            <li> This soap will suprize you with light and pleasant smell. It leaves a clean and fresh feel. Bonus! It all natural.</li>
