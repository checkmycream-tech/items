            <li>but i should have bought fair.</li>

            <li>and it is good to go again.  </li>
            <li>Fun product with great results!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve gotten the hang of it so much that my cowrkers are commenting on how my skin looks so fresh and flawless :D</li>
            <li>I ordered the fair makeup colors and love the choices.</li>
            <li>I own three Air Compressors:  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It covered nicely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m thrilled.</li>
            <li>So worth it!!!</li>
            <li>Very happy with my decision to purchase DINAIR, would highly recommend</li>
            <li>Easy too use and great finishing :)</li>
            <li>I have normal skin and find it best to mix a drop of the &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; with the makeup rather than spray the dewy on after.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, goes on so even and smooth, and feels great on my face.</li>
            <li>Great product, quick shipping</li>
            <li>Makeup goes on light and does a good job at coverage.  </li>
            <li>So far, I am very happy with the system.</li>
            <li>It came on so even and perfect and left a nice dewy finish.</li>
            <li>and I can tell you if you clean it good after each use you will have this for years.  </li>
            <li>It feels VERY light.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I have to rewrite my review because I was able to fix the problem I had with the air gun.</li>
            <li>I really love how the makeup looks on me.</li>
            <li>I also found it best to use my regular concealer than try to spray it on.  </li>
            <li>I wish I got more use out of it for the price</li>
            <li>The makeup goes on so light!</li>
            <li>For the record, I am in no way connected to Dinair; I just love their makeup.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find that their makeup is able to cover the scars so they are literally &amp;#34;blurred&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Remember if you have problem areas or like more coverage you can always move closer to face with nozzle</li>
            <li>The makeup it comes with is just OKAY.  </li>
            <li>more control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it, but lots of people absolutely love the stuff.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it, but lots of people absolutely love the stuff.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this item.</li>
            <li>Hope that helps because the makeup is wonderful and you only need to use 2-3 drops at a time!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I figured that me trying to conceal as best as I can with traditional makeup concealer.....</li>
            <li>Even if it gives out because the Dinair airbrush is not of the best quality, you can always replace it with a different brand.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s way to healing :)</li>
            <li>I love doing my makeup with airbrush.</li>
            <li>Is the best a ever use wanderful last for hours my mom use it</li>
            <li>and she love it to my sis</li>
            <li>we love it</li>
            <li>Love the results from this machine and makeup, however, the airbrush itself stopped working after about 1 month of use.&lt;br /&gt;First, somehow the auxiliary lever fell out of the machine and was lost.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it has been well worth the money for me!!</li>
            <li>While the reviews and tutorials from bloggers like xSparkage do provide a lot of great information about the differences between all the consumer-grade machines available, none of them really give you the airbrush basics beyond how to use the machine.</li>
            <li>The air gun sprays a fine mist of makeup and it feels so refreshing.</li>
            <li>most importantly, it can breathe and is on</li>
            <li>I love my dinair machine , it was worth every penny !</li>
            <li>Very quick and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This system is so incredibly easy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After each use, make sure you clean out your gun.</li>
            <li>This is especially true for water-based foundations, particularly Dinair&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>This is especially true for water-based foundations, particularly Dinair&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Customer service was fairly good and replaced with a new updated compressor.  </li>
            <li>I have some fine lines under my eyes and I avoid this area because I feel like it accentuates these fine lines.</li>
            <li>It settles into fine lines</li>
            <li>It settles into fine lines</li>
            <li>Reading the previous reviews convinced me that this was the perfect one.</li>
            <li>Made well and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>When I got it i thought it better be worth the S&amp;H expenses.</li>
            <li>Love love this product helps so much with my skin.</li>
            <li>So far the system works great and is fun to use.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>I have a small buiness and it works out perfect for all the events I do !</li>
            <li>It is worth it!</li>
            <li>, I love that you can control the pressure, and how much makeup comes out at a time!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, working great do far ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li>(I use the Paramedical line and they say that you need rubbing alcohol to clean the system when using that line.)</li>
            <li>I quickly learned little &amp;#34;tricks&amp;#34; to customize my makeup application for my skin and it was flawless - on my FIRST try!</li>
            <li>Keep good distance with good trigger control, moving in small circles and thin layers, and you will get perfect</li>
            <li>Believe me, I have tried everything; under-eye primer, eye cream, different distances and trigger pulls, nothing makes this look good under the eyes.</li>
            <li>Believe me, I have tried everything; under-eye primer, eye cream, different distances and trigger pulls, nothing makes this look good under the eyes.</li>
            <li>so I do not use this for a quick makeup session.  </li>
            <li>Makes me feel very pretty</li>
            <li>WELL FIRST (w/ Cap ON)!  </li>
            <li>After I fixed it, it was as good as new.</li>
            <li>They certainly have the widest range of cosmetic colors available, from foundations to adjusters to brights and shimmers.</li>
            <li>They certainly have the widest range of cosmetic colors available, from foundations to adjusters to brights and shimmers.</li>
            <li>I emailed Dinair specifics on the foundation colors my skin was professionally matched to along with my photo to get information on appropriate eyeshadow colors.  </li>
            <li>: There&#x27;s a bit of a learning curve, but it&#x27;s worth the effort and investment IMO.</li>
            <li>: There&#x27;s a bit of a learning curve, but it&#x27;s worth the effort and investment IMO.</li>
            <li>I called Dinair and they were extremely nice and are sending me 2 samples of different colors.</li>
            <li>It gives a much more natural, un-cakey look.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s soooo worth it.</li>
            <li>DINAIR makes it very user friendly.</li>
            <li>Not sure I will ever be able to spray on my eyeliner, but that&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t try this for the first time when you are going somewhere...</li>
            <li>It takes practice, and at first it&#x27;ll take time.</li>
            <li>Just do your research first.</li>
            <li>After the first use the system clogged up after just 1/2 of one side of my face.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s going to take a little more practice, but even the first two times I used it I could easily go out in public and be confident I look fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Come in too close, and you&#x27;ll spray too much makeup in one place (creating a \\&quot;hot spot\\&quot;).</li>
            <li>First I want to say that this company sent it REALLY fast.</li>
            <li>I am not normally a daily makeup wearer, but this is so easy to use, that I may change that.  </li>
            <li>One time I ordered the large and didn&#x27;t like how it dispensed at all, so just a heads-up</li>
            <li>Maybe with a good primer it would be fine, but I think the less, the better and like to avoid putting more chemicals on my face than necessary, especially in the delicate eye area.&lt;br</li>
            <li>some people think with airbrushes you can never put too much on or look &#x27;cakey&#x27;</li>
            <li>Their customer service not so much.  </li>
            <li>but it absolutely works.  </li>
            <li>Some people prefer dual-action, I don&#x27;t really see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;The toughest things to get the hang of are distance and trigger control.</li>
            <li>The manufacturer says you can use it under the eyes, but every MUA on ModelMayhem and every MUA I know in real life disagrees.</li>
            <li>The manufacturer says you can use it under the eyes, but every MUA on ModelMayhem and every MUA I know in real life disagrees.</li>
            <li>The seller was fast to deliver both things I ordered.</li>
            <li>now the real test was my mother...</li>
            <li>So now she wants one lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The whole process from moisturizer to cleaning the system took about 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know how they stay in business.  </li>
            <li>Run away from this site and don&#x27;t look back and consider yourself fortunate</li>
            <li>It will cost a lot cheaper than purchasing a whole new system again!</li>
            <li>I havn&#x27;t had it that long, but so far I love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get that down to 5-7 minutes in no time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am still learning, and I think the blush they gave me is too dark, but I apply it very lightly and it will work until the new color comes in.  </li>
            <li>After I go over my whole face once or twice I just concentrate on the heavily scarred areas and then make sure they are blended well with the rest of my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s been a lot of interest in airbrushing lately, and there also seems to be a pretty distinct lack of good information on the subject that doesn&#x27;t come from one of the companies producing/selling the machines or foundations.</li>
            <li>A professional airbrush system!!</li>
            <li>The Dinair system is the most affordable and versatile of the consumer-level systems available (offering PSI control where the Luminess system does not, and the ability to custom-blend colors or use other brands of cosmetics where Temptu does not), is absolutely tiny, and fairly quiet.</li>

            <li>This does NOT mean that it&#x27;s sheer coverage; as you&#x27;ll see shortly, it is very buildable and definitely capable of full coverage without looking gross.</li>
            <li>Worth noting that while you CAN blush/highlight/contour with an airbrush system, I prefer to use traditional cosmetics.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s so dark that when she tries to cover it up with even the most expensive product that promises to do so flawlessly, it looked gray and you can still see the melasma through it all...</li>
            <li>This is something I use most everyday</li>
            <li>and I later got it repaired right before my wedding in January &#x27;15.</li>
            <li>I can see charging $25 for cleaning but a refund of the $25 dollars would be nice if it is truley an airbrush failure.</li>
            <li>and it is one of the things that I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li>but this is now my new fav.</li>
            <li>I had to dig pretty deep into YouTube and the ModelMayhem forums to find answers to some issues and questions I had, so to make everything easier for you, here&#x27;s my review of the Dinair Personal/Pro kit and answers to questions that SHOULD be answered on the manufacturer&#x27;s site, but aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Do your under-eye concealing and color correcting with traditional makeup first, then airbrush your foundation so that the texture blends around the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I already have blush and contour tones I love, and I am just not interested in spending the money and time necessary to try out a bunch of airbrush blushes and</li>

            <li>I already have blush and contour tones I love, and I am just not interested in spending the money and time necessary to try out a bunch of airbrush blushes and</li>
            <li>Dinair foundation sets on contact with your skin, and is (for the most part) used as both concealer and foundation; to conceal, you go in reeeeally close (one to two inches) and just rock the trigger back slightly until the blemish is blended in with your skin.</li>
            <li>The makeup goes on light and blends well, even if the shade is a little off.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just a huge waste.</li>
            <li>Pull the trigger back too far, you&#x27;ll release too much makeup</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 27 years old</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a makeup artist and have mature skin</li>
            <li>but I had complete coverage.  </li>
            <li>The Personal/Pro and Studio Beauty kits are nearly identical; so identical, in fact, that when I ordered my Personal/Pro kit, Dinair sent me all the extras for the Studio Beauty edition instead.</li>
            <li>Apply one layer to the whole face, step back and examine your work, then apply additional layers as needed.</li>
            <li>paramedical line gives me complete coverage without looking cakes</li>
            <li>My husband surprised me with this.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, Dinair systems ship with a couple of black bands on the gun to function as guides for how far you should pull back the trigger for different jobs (foundation, blush, concealer, eyeshadow, blah blah).</li>
            <li>Still, much closer to silent than the larger models (like Temptu Pro, OCC, and Graftobian Walk-around).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>-for multiple people &amp; when I need constant hours of use,  a Large LOUD one for Body Art and this Dinair  for TRAVEL &amp; PERSONAL Face</li>
            <li>When I removed it the first time, the tip was inside the nozzle so I was not aware it was there.</li>
            <li>A lot of this information will apply broadly to any airbrush system, not just Dinair&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Dinair systems come with a small bottle of cleaner, but for the most part, you only need to use that for deep cleans or to soak out a clog</li>
            <li>Makeup!&lt;br /&gt;Ive tried other small ones that Look like Dinair, only for them to fall off counter and break upon FIRST use!!!!  </li>
            <li>An amazing yet EXPENSIVE Iwata</li>
            <li>I paid.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely not worth it though since a lot of people say it breaks within the first 6 months of getting it.</li>
            <li>so I will not waste my time trying to pursue them for satisfaction just to be neglected which would lead to total frustration.  </li>
            <li>The extra shades they sent me were topaz (shimmery gold eyeshadow), sage green (shimmery emerald eyeshadow), peach beige (very light pink blush) and cinnabar (very red blush or lip color).</li>
            <li>That doesn&#x27;t really matter if you intend to stick with Dinair products, but I had other plans and so decided to spring for</li>
            <li>I have oily, acne-prone skin with large pores and I tend to get dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>The regular Personal machine is where things are different; aside from fewer extras, the compressor only has four PSI settings, from low to high, instead of a dial that allows you to adjust the PSI anywhere from 1 to 15.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, the first few times you airbrush your foundation, it will probably look cakey and overdone.</li>
            <li>Followed that with some They&#x27;re Real mascara (Benefit) and a little eyeliner and lipstick.  </li>
            <li>use my airbrush EVERYDAY, not just for special occasions, and I find it no more time consuming than my old makeup routine.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, you can just rinse out the cup with water, spray water through the gun until it runs clear, then wet dock it until the next day.</li>

            <li> and it is good to go again.  </li>
            <li> Fun product with great results!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve gotten the hang of it so much that my cowrkers are commenting on how my skin looks so fresh and flawless :D</li>
            <li> I ordered the fair makeup colors and love the choices.</li>
            <li> I own three Air Compressors:  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It covered nicely.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m thrilled.</li>
            <li> So worth it!!!</li>
            <li> Very happy with my decision to purchase DINAIR, would highly recommend</li>
            <li> Easy too use and great finishing :)</li>
            <li> I have normal skin and find it best to mix a drop of the &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; with the makeup rather than spray the dewy on after.  </li>
            <li> I love this product, goes on so even and smooth, and feels great on my face.</li>
            <li> Great product, quick shipping</li>
            <li> Makeup goes on light and does a good job at coverage.  </li>
            <li> So far, I am very happy with the system.</li>
            <li> It came on so even and perfect and left a nice dewy finish.</li>
            <li> and I can tell you if you clean it good after each use you will have this for years.  </li>
            <li> It feels VERY light.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I have to rewrite my review because I was able to fix the problem I had with the air gun.</li>
            <li> I really love how the makeup looks on me.</li>
            <li> I also found it best to use my regular concealer than try to spray it on.  </li>
            <li> I wish I got more use out of it for the price</li>
            <li> The makeup goes on so light!</li>
            <li> For the record, I am in no way connected to Dinair; I just love their makeup.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find that their makeup is able to cover the scars so they are literally &amp;#34;blurred&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Remember if you have problem areas or like more coverage you can always move closer to face with nozzle</li>
            <li> The makeup it comes with is just OKAY.  </li>
            <li> more control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it, but lots of people absolutely love the stuff.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it, but lots of people absolutely love the stuff.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this item.</li>
            <li> Hope that helps because the makeup is wonderful and you only need to use 2-3 drops at a time!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I figured that me trying to conceal as best as I can with traditional makeup concealer.....</li>
            <li> Even if it gives out because the Dinair airbrush is not of the best quality, you can always replace it with a different brand.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s way to healing :)</li>
            <li> I love doing my makeup with airbrush.</li>
            <li> Is the best a ever use wanderful last for hours my mom use it</li>
            <li> and she love it to my sis</li>
            <li> we love it</li>
            <li> Love the results from this machine and makeup, however, the airbrush itself stopped working after about 1 month of use.&lt;br /&gt;First, somehow the auxiliary lever fell out of the machine and was lost.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it has been well worth the money for me!!</li>
            <li> While the reviews and tutorials from bloggers like xSparkage do provide a lot of great information about the differences between all the consumer-grade machines available, none of them really give you the airbrush basics beyond how to use the machine.</li>
            <li> The air gun sprays a fine mist of makeup and it feels so refreshing.</li>
            <li> most importantly, it can breathe and is on</li>
            <li> I love my dinair machine , it was worth every penny !</li>
            <li> Very quick and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> This system is so incredibly easy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After each use, make sure you clean out your gun.</li>
            <li> This is especially true for water-based foundations, particularly Dinair&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This is especially true for water-based foundations, particularly Dinair&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Customer service was fairly good and replaced with a new updated compressor.  </li>
            <li> I have some fine lines under my eyes and I avoid this area because I feel like it accentuates these fine lines.</li>
            <li> It settles into fine lines</li>
            <li> It settles into fine lines</li>
            <li> Reading the previous reviews convinced me that this was the perfect one.</li>
            <li> Made well and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> When I got it i thought it better be worth the S&amp;H expenses.</li>
            <li> Love love this product helps so much with my skin.</li>
            <li> So far the system works great and is fun to use.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I have a small buiness and it works out perfect for all the events I do !</li>
            <li> It is worth it!</li>
            <li> , I love that you can control the pressure, and how much makeup comes out at a time!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, working great do far ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> (I use the Paramedical line and they say that you need rubbing alcohol to clean the system when using that line.)</li>
            <li> I quickly learned little &amp;#34;tricks&amp;#34; to customize my makeup application for my skin and it was flawless - on my FIRST try!</li>
            <li> Keep good distance with good trigger control, moving in small circles and thin layers, and you will get perfect</li>
            <li> Believe me, I have tried everything; under-eye primer, eye cream, different distances and trigger pulls, nothing makes this look good under the eyes.</li>
            <li> Believe me, I have tried everything; under-eye primer, eye cream, different distances and trigger pulls, nothing makes this look good under the eyes.</li>
            <li> so I do not use this for a quick makeup session.  </li>
            <li> Makes me feel very pretty</li>
            <li> WELL FIRST (w/ Cap ON)!  </li>
            <li> After I fixed it, it was as good as new.</li>
            <li> They certainly have the widest range of cosmetic colors available, from foundations to adjusters to brights and shimmers.</li>
            <li> They certainly have the widest range of cosmetic colors available, from foundations to adjusters to brights and shimmers.</li>
            <li> I emailed Dinair specifics on the foundation colors my skin was professionally matched to along with my photo to get information on appropriate eyeshadow colors.  </li>
            <li> : There&#x27;s a bit of a learning curve, but it&#x27;s worth the effort and investment IMO.</li>
            <li> : There&#x27;s a bit of a learning curve, but it&#x27;s worth the effort and investment IMO.</li>
            <li> I called Dinair and they were extremely nice and are sending me 2 samples of different colors.</li>
            <li> It gives a much more natural, un-cakey look.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s soooo worth it.</li>
            <li> DINAIR makes it very user friendly.</li>
            <li> Not sure I will ever be able to spray on my eyeliner, but that&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t try this for the first time when you are going somewhere...</li>
            <li> It takes practice, and at first it&#x27;ll take time.</li>
            <li> Just do your research first.</li>
            <li> After the first use the system clogged up after just 1/2 of one side of my face.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s going to take a little more practice, but even the first two times I used it I could easily go out in public and be confident I look fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Come in too close, and you&#x27;ll spray too much makeup in one place (creating a \\&quot;hot spot\\&quot;).</li>
            <li> First I want to say that this company sent it REALLY fast.</li>
            <li> I am not normally a daily makeup wearer, but this is so easy to use, that I may change that.  </li>
            <li> One time I ordered the large and didn&#x27;t like how it dispensed at all, so just a heads-up</li>
            <li> Maybe with a good primer it would be fine, but I think the less, the better and like to avoid putting more chemicals on my face than necessary, especially in the delicate eye area.&lt;br</li>
            <li> some people think with airbrushes you can never put too much on or look &#x27;cakey&#x27;</li>
            <li> Their customer service not so much.  </li>
            <li> but it absolutely works.  </li>
            <li> Some people prefer dual-action, I don&#x27;t really see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;The toughest things to get the hang of are distance and trigger control.</li>
            <li> The manufacturer says you can use it under the eyes, but every MUA on ModelMayhem and every MUA I know in real life disagrees.</li>
            <li> The manufacturer says you can use it under the eyes, but every MUA on ModelMayhem and every MUA I know in real life disagrees.</li>
            <li> The seller was fast to deliver both things I ordered.</li>
            <li> now the real test was my mother...</li>
            <li> So now she wants one lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The whole process from moisturizer to cleaning the system took about 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know how they stay in business.  </li>
            <li> Run away from this site and don&#x27;t look back and consider yourself fortunate</li>
            <li> It will cost a lot cheaper than purchasing a whole new system again!</li>
            <li> I havn&#x27;t had it that long, but so far I love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get that down to 5-7 minutes in no time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am still learning, and I think the blush they gave me is too dark, but I apply it very lightly and it will work until the new color comes in.  </li>
            <li> After I go over my whole face once or twice I just concentrate on the heavily scarred areas and then make sure they are blended well with the rest of my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s been a lot of interest in airbrushing lately, and there also seems to be a pretty distinct lack of good information on the subject that doesn&#x27;t come from one of the companies producing/selling the machines or foundations.</li>
            <li> A professional airbrush system!!</li>
            <li> The Dinair system is the most affordable and versatile of the consumer-level systems available (offering PSI control where the Luminess system does not, and the ability to custom-blend colors or use other brands of cosmetics where Temptu does not), is absolutely tiny, and fairly quiet.</li>

            <li> This does NOT mean that it&#x27;s sheer coverage; as you&#x27;ll see shortly, it is very buildable and definitely capable of full coverage without looking gross.</li>
            <li> Worth noting that while you CAN blush/highlight/contour with an airbrush system, I prefer to use traditional cosmetics.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s so dark that when she tries to cover it up with even the most expensive product that promises to do so flawlessly, it looked gray and you can still see the melasma through it all...</li>
            <li> This is something I use most everyday</li>
            <li> and I later got it repaired right before my wedding in January &#x27;15.</li>
            <li> I can see charging $25 for cleaning but a refund of the $25 dollars would be nice if it is truley an airbrush failure.</li>
            <li> and it is one of the things that I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li> but this is now my new fav.</li>
            <li> I had to dig pretty deep into YouTube and the ModelMayhem forums to find answers to some issues and questions I had, so to make everything easier for you, here&#x27;s my review of the Dinair Personal/Pro kit and answers to questions that SHOULD be answered on the manufacturer&#x27;s site, but aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Do your under-eye concealing and color correcting with traditional makeup first, then airbrush your foundation so that the texture blends around the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I already have blush and contour tones I love, and I am just not interested in spending the money and time necessary to try out a bunch of airbrush blushes and</li>

            <li> Dinair foundation sets on contact with your skin, and is (for the most part) used as both concealer and foundation; to conceal, you go in reeeeally close (one to two inches) and just rock the trigger back slightly until the blemish is blended in with your skin.</li>
            <li> The makeup goes on light and blends well, even if the shade is a little off.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just a huge waste.</li>
            <li> Pull the trigger back too far, you&#x27;ll release too much makeup</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 27 years old</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a makeup artist and have mature skin</li>
            <li> but I had complete coverage.  </li>
            <li> The Personal/Pro and Studio Beauty kits are nearly identical; so identical, in fact, that when I ordered my Personal/Pro kit, Dinair sent me all the extras for the Studio Beauty edition instead.</li>
            <li> Apply one layer to the whole face, step back and examine your work, then apply additional layers as needed.</li>
            <li> paramedical line gives me complete coverage without looking cakes</li>
            <li> My husband surprised me with this.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, Dinair systems ship with a couple of black bands on the gun to function as guides for how far you should pull back the trigger for different jobs (foundation, blush, concealer, eyeshadow, blah blah).</li>
            <li> Still, much closer to silent than the larger models (like Temptu Pro, OCC, and Graftobian Walk-around).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> -for multiple people &amp; when I need constant hours of use,  a Large LOUD one for Body Art and this Dinair  for TRAVEL &amp; PERSONAL Face</li>
            <li> When I removed it the first time, the tip was inside the nozzle so I was not aware it was there.</li>
            <li> A lot of this information will apply broadly to any airbrush system, not just Dinair&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dinair systems come with a small bottle of cleaner, but for the most part, you only need to use that for deep cleans or to soak out a clog</li>
            <li> Makeup!&lt;br /&gt;Ive tried other small ones that Look like Dinair, only for them to fall off counter and break upon FIRST use!!!!  </li>
            <li> An amazing yet EXPENSIVE Iwata</li>
            <li> I paid.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely not worth it though since a lot of people say it breaks within the first 6 months of getting it.</li>
            <li> so I will not waste my time trying to pursue them for satisfaction just to be neglected which would lead to total frustration.  </li>
            <li> The extra shades they sent me were topaz (shimmery gold eyeshadow), sage green (shimmery emerald eyeshadow), peach beige (very light pink blush) and cinnabar (very red blush or lip color).</li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t really matter if you intend to stick with Dinair products, but I had other plans and so decided to spring for</li>
            <li> I have oily, acne-prone skin with large pores and I tend to get dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> The regular Personal machine is where things are different; aside from fewer extras, the compressor only has four PSI settings, from low to high, instead of a dial that allows you to adjust the PSI anywhere from 1 to 15.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, the first few times you airbrush your foundation, it will probably look cakey and overdone.</li>
            <li> Followed that with some They&#x27;re Real mascara (Benefit) and a little eyeliner and lipstick.  </li>
            <li> use my airbrush EVERYDAY, not just for special occasions, and I find it no more time consuming than my old makeup routine.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, you can just rinse out the cup with water, spray water through the gun until it runs clear, then wet dock it until the next day.</li>
            <li> far, it seems to be a gamble on the longevity of the airbrushes, according to other buyers who have had the same or similar issues as I have.</li>
            <li> Even with an airbrush, if you put too much on, you will look like a cake mess!</li>
            <li> Normally my makeup would disappear in a few hours.  </li>
            <li> and my acne is bu far less irritated and my skin is smooth.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I spend less money on \\&quot;base\\&quot; cosmetics than I used to, since I now only need regular concealer for use under my eyes, don&#x27;t have to use a setting powder if I&#x27;m using Dinair&#x27;s foundation, and only use one 1oz bottle of foundation over two months of daily application, at $25.ion to the multi-purpose foundation is under the eyes.</li>

            <li> The makeup lasts a long time; In the year+ I&#x27;ve had my airbrush</li>
            <li> Took me several tries to get the distance from my face.  </li>
            <li> Makeup stays on all day, and It doesn&#x27;t take long to learn how to use it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that traditional makeup felt heavy until I started airbrushing; on the two occasions I&#x27;ve worn traditional foundation since purchasing an airbrush, it has felt heavy and looked gross without getting anywhere near the coverage given by airbrush makeup.</li>
            <li> (in the above picture, I&#x27;m deep cleaning it; that&#x27;s what&#x27;s up with the black caps and rubber band).</li>
            <li> Lasted all day long, too!  </li>
            <li> If you have extremely dry skin, I can see the product being a necessity.</li>
            <li> If you have extremely dry skin, I can see the product being a necessity.</li>
            <li> but I want to give no stars because in my opinion they never deserved a single star.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from acne and dark marks though it is not severe, it is always on the same area (my cheek)</li>
            <li> At some point, it will become necessary to completely dismantle your gun for a serious cleaning session.</li>
            <li> With a dual-action system, you press down on the trigger to get air, and then pull back to release makeup.</li>
            <li> It took a little while to get it, which was frustrating, but the first time I used it (last night)</li>
            <li> Wet docking prevents clogs, and also uses the rubber band and black caps pictured above (unless you have a docking jar, but I don&#x27;t).</li>
            <li> You may be intimidated when you set it up but spend a little time in your makeup chair experimenting and before you know it, it will be second nature.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally matte, and since it sets on contact, it can be a little drying.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally matte, and since it sets on contact, it can be a little drying.</li>
            <li> summer time and a little lighter and very yellow toned winter.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint that I have is that I ordered a silver compressor and received a sparkly red one instead.</li>
            <li> I took some tweezers and pulled it out and firmly set it back over the needle.</li>
            <li> I have kept mine in wet dock between uses as instructed by Dinair videos.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not fast at applying the makeup or cleaning the the airbrush</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to bend your needle at all, or the thing will be out of commission until Dinair sends you another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now it takes me about two, including time spent cleaning out the gun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> The makeup that comes with it is not as &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; as regular bottled makeup, so coverage is minimal and you may have to spray over a few times to get the desired coverage.  </li>
            <li> But, now that I&#x27;ve had it for a while, it definitely takes me less time than liquid foundation, plus it doesn&#x27;t make a mess like some foundations do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I emailed customer service pointing out that they had typed me incorrectly and again giving them the correct foundation and blush information, no one bothered to follow up with other makeup recommendations.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue using their compressor (until the airbrush breaks, from reading other reviews here) but from now on I&#x27;m buying my makeup from their competition.</li>
            <li> I have other airbrush machines</li>
            <li> I know a lot of people say that the gun gives out after a couple uses, just wet dock it after every use or every night!</li>
            <li> I am waiting to see if this qualifies for the warranty, and if not, I am not willing to spend $80/month for replacement</li>
            <li> It wears really well, even after a 12 hour day, whereas other makeups I&#x27;ve tried tend to make my oily skin unbearably greasy after mere hours.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews and several negative one&#x27;s, I ordered this kit.  </li>
            <li> It took a few tries to get the color which is why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> When I came down my husband kept using the word &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> WELL then tilt SIDEWAYS- not Upside Down- as there is a metal ball inside to mix product and will get stuck if you turn bottle upside down when squeezing.  </li>
            <li> See here, pictured with a variety of foundations and a couple of other little things.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Basic Beauty set(100) from Dinair website and was really kinda shocked that I had to pay 70</li>
            <li> to Dinair&#x27;s foundation: Airbrush foundation is, in general, about as thin as milk.</li>
            <li> To apply foundation, you come in from around six inches away, trigger pulled back around 3/4 of the way, and move in small, slow circles.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had my airbrush for a little over a year</li>
            <li> I think my color is a little off.</li>
            <li> The problem I had was that they color matched me a little off.  </li>
            <li> It is not even included in their replacement airbrushes offered on their website, and the only replacement offered is $80 + Shipping, a little expensive for me after already spending a small fortune on the kit + extra makeup.</li>
            <li> I was a little leery</li>
            <li> Cleaning it takes a little time</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t put this on a heavily wrinkled face, either...</li>
            <li> I think it took me a few times to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll have hotspots, it&#x27;ll be uneven, and you&#x27;ll want to cry because you&#x27;ll think you just wasted $300 on a piece of junk.</li>
            <li> I have had a few issues with clogging, but am chalking it up to the learning curve.  </li>
            <li> I have chalked this up to one of the most expensive failed purchases of my life!  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any other brands but one of my makeup container lids will not close due to poor design.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be discouraged, though; airbrushing is genuinely not as easy as it sounds, and certainly not as easy as the manufacturers and beauty gurus make it look.</li>
            <li> You need so very little makeup</li>
            <li> usually just once a week when I have time.  </li>
            <li> Like, fits in your hand small.</li>
            <li> Sprayed some Moist and Dewy over the cheeks so that it doesn&#x27;t look dried out or cakes and voila!</li>
            <li> Compressor failed approximately 5 months later.  </li>
            <li> After agreeing to refund two items 100% on the telephone after I was steered to buy the wrong products by their customer service department, they arbitrarily decided to take a 30% restocking fee.  </li>
            <li> For Dinair&#x27;s foundation, since it&#x27;s so thin, you want the dial set to somewhere around noon.</li>
            <li> After 50 years, I can say this is the worst purchase I have ever made, with the absolute worst level of satisfaction and customer service possible.  </li>
            <li> They retyped everything to a yellow-based foundation and blush color recommendation that is simply wrong.  </li>
            <li> I found this appliance difficult and time consuming, makeup does not come out evenly.  </li>
            <li> The product description did not indicate that this expensive product is NON-REFUNDABLE</li>
            <li> BAD on her cheeks.</li>
            <li> I am so frustrated at this point</li>
            <li> can dollars for S&amp;H :(</li>
            <li> (In a bad way)!</li>
            <li> You will NOT be disappointed!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this product. I have used it three times and the hair is almost gone. I no longer have to shave daily.</li>
            <li> I have to rewrite my review because I was able to fix the problem I had with the air gun. It was sputtering and leaving speckles all over my face after 2 weeks of regular use. I finally called customer service and the operator told me to remove the nozzle tip and inside should be another cone shaped tip. When I removed it the first time, the tip was inside the nozzle so I was not aware it was there. I took some tweezers and pulled it out and firmly set it back over the needle. After I fixed it, it was as good as new. I am so glad it works again!!! The air gun sprays a fine mist of makeup and it feels so refreshing. I really love how the makeup looks on me.</li>
            <li> Very quick and easy to use.  The makeup that comes with it is not as &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; as regular bottled makeup, so coverage is minimal and you may have to spray over a few times to get the desired coverage.  I have normal skin and find it best to mix a drop of the &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; with the makeup rather than spray the dewy on after.  I also found it best to use my regular concealer than try to spray it on.  Not sure I will ever be able to spray on my eyeliner, but that&#x27;s okay.  It comes with lots of samples which lets you try out different colors.  All in all a good product for the price.  I am happy I bought it.</li>
            <li> I got the dinair Airbrush around June &#x27;14 and I loved how my makeup looked when I used it. It came on so even and perfect and left a nice dewy finish. It stopped working about 3 months after I got it and I later got it repaired right before my wedding in January &#x27;15. After using it just once after repair it broke again and dinair will not contact me back about it. I wish I got more use out of it for the price I paid.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely not worth it though since a lot of people say it breaks within the first 6 months of getting it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 27 years old and I&#x27;ve had my airbrush for a little over a year and it is one of the things that I can&#x27;t live without. I have oily, acne-prone skin with large pores and I tend to get dark circles under my eyes. The makeup goes on so light! The prompting for this review was actually because I ran out of makeup for my airbrush and had to use regular foundation and my goodness WHAT A DIFFERENCE (In a bad way)! For the record, I am in no way connected to Dinair; I just love their makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use my airbrush EVERYDAY, not just for special occasions, and I find it no more time consuming than my old makeup routine. The makeup goes on light and blends well, even if the shade is a little off. I have a LOT of acne scarring on my face. I find that their makeup is able to cover the scars so they are literally &amp;#34;blurred&amp;#34; out and this is with the regular makeup, not the paramedical line and without concealer. It wears really well, even after a 12 hour day, whereas other makeups I&#x27;ve tried tend to make my oily skin unbearably greasy after mere hours. I haven&#x27;t had a lessening in my breakouts since switching to Dinair also!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have great customer service! I ordered makeup 2 days ago (regular shipping) and it is already here (and it went from California to Ohio). The makeup lasts a long time; In the year+ I&#x27;ve had my airbrush I&#x27;ve only ordered makeup 3x. I always get the medium sized bottles. One time I ordered the large and didn&#x27;t like how it dispensed at all, so just a heads-up there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some things to watch out for though..&lt;br /&gt;  THIS IS MAKEUP- some people think with airbrushes you can never put too much on or look &#x27;cakey&#x27; but that is definitely not the case. Even with an airbrush, if you put too much on, you will look like a cake mess! After I go over my whole face once or twice I just concentrate on the heavily scarred areas and then make sure they are blended well with the rest of my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I wouldn&#x27;t put this on a heavily wrinkled face, either... I have some fine lines under my eyes and I avoid this area because I feel like it accentuates these fine lines. Maybe with a good primer it would be fine, but I think the less, the better and like to avoid putting more chemicals on my face than necessary, especially in the delicate eye area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  There is a LEARNING CURVE! I wouldn&#x27;t try this for the first time when you are going somewhere... I think it took me a few times to get the hang of it. But, now that I&#x27;ve had it for a while, it definitely takes me less time than liquid foundation, plus it doesn&#x27;t make a mess like some foundations do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it has been well worth the money for me!!</li>
            <li> I love this machine!! It works great and the foundation is perfect! Remember if you have problem areas or like more coverage you can always move closer to face with nozzle and it&#x27;s a heavier application. Further away is lighter coverage. Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> It worked well for brows.. couldn&#x27;t get good coverage for foundation.</li>
            <li> Love love this product helps so much with my skin. Feels like I&#x27;m not even wearing any makeup. Makes me feel very pretty</li>
            <li> Purchased a Dinair Pro Kit 12/06/12.  Compressor failed approximately 5 months later.  Customer service was fairly good and replaced with a new updated compressor.  Warning, the airbrush itself does NOT have a warranty only the compressor.  Compressor still works great but my airbrush stopped working and will cost $25.00 to return the airbrush for deep cleaning and repair with replacement if needed.  They did offer to walk thru a cleaning by phone but that is not the problem.  What appears as the problem is a seal breakdown at the tip just inside the tip cap that is causing the air brush to back bubble only.  I have kept mine in wet dock between uses as instructed by Dinair videos.  I can see charging $25 for cleaning but a refund of the $25 dollars would be nice if it is truley an airbrush failure.</li>
            <li> I read reviews about different airbrush machines but this one stood out above the rest. I am so happy that I bought this one. It works great and does the job well. The compressor is pretty quiet and small. The only complaint that I have is that I ordered a silver compressor and received a sparkly red one instead. When I contacted the company they said that even if you choose a silver one you may I get a different color regardless. I wasn&#x27;t very happy about this but I needed to use the airbrush on a client so I kept it regardless.</li>
            <li> This review is about ordering Dinair online from their corporate headquarters store at Laurel Canyon Blvd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The makeup system is good.  Their customer service not so much.  Dinair doesn&#x27;t care about their customers.  I&#x27;m taking my business elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Weeks of repeat emails and phone calls are required to get promised refunds issued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Twice now I&#x27;ve received opened and used makeup in shipped orders.  Dinair makes the customer pay to return opened product to get it swapped for unused makeup ~ and that is not right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  After agreeing to refund two items 100% on the telephone after I was steered to buy the wrong products by their customer service department, they arbitrarily decided to take a 30% restocking fee.  This was after Dinair let my authorized return just sit on their desks for five weeks without doing anything about it, ignoring emails inquiring about the status of the return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  The &amp;#34;Color Matching&amp;#34; service is also a joke.  I emailed Dinair specifics on the foundation colors my skin was professionally matched to along with my photo to get information on appropriate eyeshadow colors.  They retyped everything to a yellow-based foundation and blush color recommendation that is simply wrong.  I can understand that they&#x27;re making decisions based on the color they see in photos, but if someone tells them &amp;#34;the correct foundation shade for me is your XYZ product, which eyeshadows should I buy&amp;#34; then they should believe that.  When I emailed customer service pointing out that they had typed me incorrectly and again giving them the correct foundation and blush information, no one bothered to follow up with other makeup recommendations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue using their compressor (until the airbrush breaks, from reading other reviews here) but from now on I&#x27;m buying my makeup from their competition.</li>
            <li> I love my dinair machine , it was worth every penny ! I have a small buiness and it works out perfect for all the events I do ! Easy too use and great finishing :)</li>
            <li> This system is so incredibly easy.  You may be intimidated when you set it up but spend a little time in your makeup chair experimenting and before you know it, it will be second nature.  I quickly learned little &amp;#34;tricks&amp;#34; to customize my makeup application for my skin and it was flawless - on my FIRST try! I&#x27;m not a makeup artist and have mature skin so I studied up on the online videos on Dinair&#x27;s website and also went on YouTube to watch others apply. You need so very little makeup it almost seems inconceivable but it absolutely works.  When I came down my husband kept using the word &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34;.  He said it didn&#x27;t look like I had makeup on at all but I had complete coverage.  Lasted all day long, too!  Be patient and experiment - it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> Great product, quick shipping</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my granddaughter as she is a makeup artist. She is going into this field after graduation this year. She loves this airbrush makeup machine. This was a good choice.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Made well and easy to clean.  Makeup goes on light and does a good job at coverage.  I don&#x27;t use it daily but usually just once a week when I have time.  I&#x27;m not fast at applying the makeup or cleaning the the airbrush so I do not use this for a quick makeup session.  Took me several tries to get the distance from my face.  The makeup it comes with is just OKAY.  I haven&#x27;t tried any other brands but one of my makeup container lids will not close due to poor design.  I plan to research and buy a different brand of makeup to use with this airbrush.</li>
            <li> Hey, ladies and gents! There&#x27;s been a lot of interest in airbrushing lately, and there also seems to be a pretty distinct lack of good information on the subject that doesn&#x27;t come from one of the companies producing/selling the machines or foundations. While the reviews and tutorials from bloggers like xSparkage do provide a lot of great information about the differences between all the consumer-grade machines available, none of them really give you the airbrush basics beyond how to use the machine. I had to dig pretty deep into YouTube and the ModelMayhem forums to find answers to some issues and questions I had, so to make everything easier for you, here&#x27;s my review of the Dinair Personal/Pro kit and answers to questions that SHOULD be answered on the manufacturer&#x27;s site, but aren&#x27;t. A lot of this information will apply broadly to any airbrush system, not just Dinair&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Review&lt;br /&gt;Dinair sells three different kits. The Personal/Pro and Studio Beauty kits are nearly identical; so identical, in fact, that when I ordered my Personal/Pro kit, Dinair sent me all the extras for the Studio Beauty edition instead. The regular Personal machine is where things are different; aside from fewer extras, the compressor only has four PSI settings, from low to high, instead of a dial that allows you to adjust the PSI anywhere from 1 to 15. That doesn&#x27;t really matter if you intend to stick with Dinair products, but I had other plans and so decided to spring for more control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The compressor itself is tiny. Like, fits in your hand small. See here, pictured with a variety of foundations and a couple of other little things. It&#x27;s also fairly quiet, but if you keep it on a ceramic sink like I do, you&#x27;ll get some additional noise from the vibrations. Still, much closer to silent than the larger models (like Temptu Pro, OCC, and Graftobian Walk-around).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That dial you see is both the on/off switch and your PSI control. For Dinair&#x27;s foundation, since it&#x27;s so thin, you want the dial set to somewhere around noon. For blush, bronzer, highlighting, or eyeshadow, you want it around ten. All of this info is in the brochure you get with the machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After each use, make sure you clean out your gun. Dinair systems come with a small bottle of cleaner, but for the most part, you only need to use that for deep cleans or to soak out a clog (in the above picture, I&#x27;m deep cleaning it; that&#x27;s what&#x27;s up with the black caps and rubber band). Otherwise, you can just rinse out the cup with water, spray water through the gun until it runs clear, then wet dock it until the next day. Wet docking prevents clogs, and also uses the rubber band and black caps pictured above (unless you have a docking jar, but I don&#x27;t). At some point, it will become necessary to completely dismantle your gun for a serious cleaning session. Just be careful not to bend your needle at all, or the thing will be out of commission until Dinair sends you another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to application. This is a continuous airflow system, meaning if the compressor is on, air is flowing. With a dual-action system, you press down on the trigger to get air, and then pull back to release makeup. Since Dinair&#x27;s gun is continuous airflow, all you have to do is pull back on the trigger. Some people prefer dual-action, I don&#x27;t really see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;The toughest things to get the hang of are distance and trigger control. Come in too close, and you&#x27;ll spray too much makeup in one place (creating a \\&quot;hot spot\\&quot;). Pull the trigger back too far, you&#x27;ll release too much makeup and it&#x27;s just a huge waste. Fortunately, Dinair systems ship with a couple of black bands on the gun to function as guides for how far you should pull back the trigger for different jobs (foundation, blush, concealer, eyeshadow, blah blah). You&#x27;re not trying to make it look like you&#x27;re wearing foundation; you&#x27;re trying to make it look like your skin is naturally perfect. Keep good distance with good trigger control, moving in small circles and thin layers, and you will get perfect skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, the first few times you airbrush your foundation, it will probably look cakey and overdone. You&#x27;ll have hotspots, it&#x27;ll be uneven, and you&#x27;ll want to cry because you&#x27;ll think you just wasted $300 on a piece of junk. Don&#x27;t be discouraged, though; airbrushing is genuinely not as easy as it sounds, and certainly not as easy as the manufacturers and beauty gurus make it look. It takes practice, and at first it&#x27;ll take time. When I got mine, it took me ten minutes to do my foundation. Now it takes me about two, including time spent cleaning out the gun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to Dinair&#x27;s foundation: Airbrush foundation is, in general, about as thin as milk. Some are a bit thicker than that, some thinner. Dinair foundation is somewhere around watery (think skim) milk. This does NOT mean that it&#x27;s sheer coverage; as you&#x27;ll see shortly, it is very buildable and definitely capable of full coverage without looking gross. Dinair foundation sets on contact with your skin, and is (for the most part) used as both concealer and foundation; to conceal, you go in reeeeally close (one to two inches) and just rock the trigger back slightly until the blemish is blended in with your skin. To apply foundation, you come in from around six inches away, trigger pulled back around 3/4 of the way, and move in small, slow circles. Apply one layer to the whole face, step back and examine your work, then apply additional layers as needed. It feels VERY light. I didn&#x27;t realize that traditional makeup felt heavy until I started airbrushing; on the two occasions I&#x27;ve worn traditional foundation since purchasing an airbrush, it has felt heavy and looked gross without getting anywhere near the coverage given by airbrush makeup. I&#x27;m not talking about drugstore foundation, either; I&#x27;m talking about NARS Sheer Glow on one occasion, and Bobbi Brown Foundation Stick on the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The exception to the multi-purpose foundation is under the eyes. Believe me, I have tried everything; under-eye primer, eye cream, different distances and trigger pulls, nothing makes this look good under the eyes. It settles into fine lines I didn&#x27;t know I had (I&#x27;m only 22!) and looks gross. The manufacturer says you can use it under the eyes, but every MUA on ModelMayhem and every MUA I know in real life disagrees. Do your under-eye concealing and color correcting with traditional makeup first, then airbrush your foundation so that the texture blends around the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t wear blush or contour and highlight now, you&#x27;ll need to start. This is especially true for water-based foundations, particularly Dinair&#x27;s. It&#x27;s totally matte, and since it sets on contact, it can be a little drying. To combat this, they also make a product called Moist and Dewey, to be applied before, after, or with your foundation depending on your needs. I don&#x27;t use it, but lots of people absolutely love the stuff. If you have extremely dry skin, I can see the product being a necessity. Worth noting that while you CAN blush/highlight/contour with an airbrush system, I prefer to use traditional cosmetics. I already have blush and contour tones I love, and I am just not interested in spending the money and time necessary to try out a bunch of airbrush blushes and bronzers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overview: There&#x27;s a bit of a learning curve, but it&#x27;s worth the effort and investment IMO. The Dinair system is the most affordable and versatile of the consumer-level systems available (offering PSI control where the Luminess system does not, and the ability to custom-blend colors or use other brands of cosmetics where Temptu does not), is absolutely tiny, and fairly quiet. They certainly have the widest range of cosmetic colors available, from foundations to adjusters to brights and shimmers. I spend less money on \\&quot;base\\&quot; cosmetics than I used to, since I now only need regular concealer for use under my eyes, don&#x27;t have to use a setting powder if I&#x27;m using Dinair&#x27;s foundation, and only use one 1oz bottle of foundation over two months of daily application, at $25.ion to the multi-purpose foundation is under the eyes.

            <li> Love, love, love this item. I do onsite makeup for brides and this is an awesome addition to my arsenal of makeup goodies. I have other airbrush machines but this is now my new fav. I ordered the fair makeup colors and love the choices. The seller was fast to deliver both things I ordered.</li>
            <li> I found this appliance difficult and time consuming, makeup does not come out evenly.  The product description did not indicate that this expensive product is NON-REFUNDABLE so keep that in mind before you order as seller will not accept returns or issue a refund!!!</li>
            <li> I own three Air Compressors:  An amazing yet EXPENSIVE Iwata -for multiple people &amp; when I need constant hours of use,  a Large LOUD one for Body Art and this Dinair  for TRAVEL &amp; PERSONAL Face Makeup!&lt;br /&gt;Ive tried other small ones that Look like Dinair, only for them to fall off counter and break upon FIRST use!!!!  Ive had my durable Dinair for a year now and it is QUALITY!&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy- You will LOVEEEEEE it!&lt;br /&gt;CHRISSY&lt;br /&gt;PS: regards to the reviewer above whos product would not come out of the bottle...SHAKE WELL then tilt SIDEWAYS- not Upside Down- as there is a metal ball inside to mix product and will get stuck if you turn bottle upside down when squeezing.  BUT SHAKE THE PRODUCT WELL FIRST (w/ Cap ON)!  Hope that helps because the makeup is wonderful and you only need to use 2-3 drops at a time!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this a couple a days. First I want to say that this company sent it REALLY fast. I ordered on a Thursday and got it on a Monday. They also got me a different color compressor, (they said they would try but were not promising).&lt;br /&gt;I like the system. I think my color is a little off. I called Dinair and they were extremely nice and are sending me 2 samples of different colors. So far the system works great and is fun to use. I ordered the hair shadow and it did a great job of covering my roots!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Basic Beauty set(100) from Dinair website and was really kinda shocked that I had to pay 70 can dollars for S&amp;H :( to canada. When I got it i thought it better be worth the S&amp;H expenses. So I unbowed it and gave it a try the next day.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It covered nicely. The problem I had was that they color matched me a little off.  They said I was tan ( I&#x27;m Nc40) summer time and a little lighter and very yellow toned winter.  So the next day or 2 I discovered that I could have gotten my Dinair within Canada and pay only 15$ s&amp;h from a distributor called distribution dinair.  So that where I ordered my foundation colors. Lighter colors so I can mix the darker ones and also purchased the paramedical line....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;amazing!!!!,!,! I suffer from acne and dark marks though it is not severe, it is always on the same area (my cheek) so therefore there&#x27;s a lot of discoloration :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I figured that me trying to conceal as best as I can with traditional makeup concealer..... I&#x27;m talking about packing it on because it will always show through ( I used Mac studio fix concealer&amp;#34;.. EstÃ©e Lauder etc) was aggravating my situation. No matter if I washed my brushes every use.It was always irritated and bumpy..... It&#x27;s been about a week since I&#x27;m using my dinair ( NO hands / brushes on my face) and my acne is bu far less irritated and my skin is smooth.&amp;#34; No longer bumpy. Yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paramedical line gives me complete coverage without looking cakes and I&#x27;ve gotten the hang of it so much that my cowrkers are commenting on how my skin looks so fresh and flawless :D now the real test was my mother...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has melasma.. BAD on her cheeks. It&#x27;s so dark that when she tries to cover it up with even the most expensive product that promises to do so flawlessly, it looked gray and you can still see the melasma through it all... Then I decided I&#x27;m going to try it on her to put the paramedics line to test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I use the paramedical line as a concealer around her areas where she&#x27;s dis colored and then went over with a neutral tone in the glamour line.... Sprayed some Moist and Dewy over the cheeks so that it doesn&#x27;t look dried out or cakes and voila! It was perfect!! My mother was the biggest critic and didn&#x27;t believe in airbrushing and when she saw her face.... She was sold. So now she wants one lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get it. Especially if you suffer from acne/melasma. It is worth it! It is waterbased and there is no chance for cross contamination to flare up break outs. I know a lot of people say that the gun gives out after a couple uses, just wet dock it after every use or every night! Even if it gives out because the Dinair airbrush is not of the best quality, you can always replace it with a different brand. Just do your research first. It will cost a lot cheaper than purchasing a whole new system again! Once your compressor is good, there&#x27;s hope!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s only been a week and My face is smooth and flawless LOOKING. most importantly, it can breathe and is on it&#x27;s way to healing :) I can feel the difference big time Mann!!</li>
            <li> Bought this from Dinair.  It took a little while to get it, which was frustrating, but the first time I used it (last night), all was forgiven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for the second time today.  Did my foundation, blush, and eye shadow with the airbrush.  Followed that with some They&#x27;re Real mascara (Benefit) and a little eyeliner and lipstick.  I&#x27;m good to go.  The whole process from moisturizer to cleaning the system took about 15 minutes.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get that down to 5-7 minutes in no time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dinair is photoshop for your face!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s going to take a little more practice, but even the first two times I used it I could easily go out in public and be confident I look fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thrilled.</li>
            <li> I love doing my makeup with airbrush. It gives a much more natural, un-cakey look. I bought the medium complexion one but i should have bought fair. I definently recomend watching some how-to videos before you get started. That helped me alot. The extra shades they sent me were topaz (shimmery gold eyeshadow), sage green (shimmery emerald eyeshadow), peach beige (very light pink blush) and cinnabar (very red blush or lip color).</li>
            <li> Is the best a ever use wanderful last for hours my mom use it and she love it to my sis use too we love it</li>
            <li> Love the results from this machine and makeup, however, the airbrush itself stopped working after about 1 month of use.&lt;br /&gt;First, somehow the auxiliary lever fell out of the machine and was lost. I replaced it, and still the same issue: airbrush does not mix in the makeup, I get only air. The faulty airbrush that was included with the kit is the CX005481. It is not even included in their replacement airbrushes offered on their website, and the only replacement offered is $80 + Shipping, a little expensive for me after already spending a small fortune on the kit + extra makeup. I am waiting to see if this qualifies for the warranty, and if not, I am not willing to spend $80/month for replacement airbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;And yes, I cleaned it after each use and wet-docked it nightly.&lt;br /&gt;So far, it seems to be a gamble on the longevity of the airbrushes, according to other buyers who have had the same or similar issues as I have.</li>
            <li> I havn&#x27;t had it that long, but so far I love it, I love that you can control the pressure, and how much makeup comes out at a time! Love it</li>
            <li> I purchased the Dinair airbrush system along with extra make up.  After the first use the system clogged up after just 1/2 of one side of my face.  I took it apart, cleaned it all out and five minutes into the the next try it was clogged up again.  I am so frustrated at this point so I decided to write Dinair for an inquiry about returning the product.  I sent that request on July 7th, it is Sept. 5th and I have yet to receive a reply.  I have no faith in this company so I will not waste my time trying to pursue them for satisfaction just to be neglected which would lead to total frustration.  I have chalked this up to one of the most expensive failed purchases of my life!  After 50 years, I can say this is the worst purchase I have ever made, with the absolute worst level of satisfaction and customer service possible.  I really don&#x27;t know how they stay in business.  There is a star rating required to leave the feedback so I will give one star but I want to give no stars because in my opinion they never deserved a single star.  I would not recommend purchasing the Dinair Airbrush System!  Run away from this site and don&#x27;t look back and consider yourself fortunate you were not one of us with a faulty system with nowhere to turn for assistance!</li>
            <li> I researched the different types of airbrush kits before I purchased DINAIR. Reading the previous reviews convinced me that this was the perfect one. DINAIR makes it very user friendly. The dvd guide to use gave helpful hints. Best of all...The makeup stays on all day! Very happy with my decision to purchase DINAIR, would highly recommend</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading/watcthing reviews. I was a little leery but I went ahead. I must say I LOVE this machine!! It took a few tries to get the color which is why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars. Cleaning it takes a little time but it&#x27;s soooo worth it. I was FaceTimeing with my sister and she said she loved the way my skin looked with this product. So worth it!!!</li>
            <li> Thank you! Fast shipping, working great do far ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews and several negative one&#x27;s, I ordered this kit.  I watched the video before I took the kit out of the box and followed the directions.  This is something I use most everyday and I can tell you if you clean it good after each use you will have this for years.  It&#x27;s a tool every woman should have.</li>
            <li> Dinair ROCKS the house!! A professional airbrush system!! You will NOT be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> Fun product with great results!</li>
            <li> My husband surprised me with this.  We made a day of it and actually went to their studio in Hollywood to pick it up.  I am not normally a daily makeup wearer, but this is so easy to use, that I may change that.  Normally my makeup would disappear in a few hours.  I have had a few issues with clogging, but am chalking it up to the learning curve.  I just stop and run some rubbing alcohol through once (I use the Paramedical line and they say that you need rubbing alcohol to clean the system when using that line.) and it is good to go again.  I am still learning, and I think the blush they gave me is too dark, but I apply it very lightly and it will work until the new color comes in.  I am looking forward to learning to apply eyeliner with it.  So far, I am very happy with the system.</li>
            <li> I love this product, goes on so even and smooth, and feels great on my face. Makeup stays on all day, and It doesn&#x27;t take long to learn how to use it. I ordered a second one for a friend she loves it too!</li>
