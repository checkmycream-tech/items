    <ol>
            <li>Over all it is a great product for the amount of money!</li>
            <li>I needed a set for traveling and this size fits perfect in the suit case.  </li>
            <li>Excellent, it works amazingly well!</li>
            <li>Paid like 14$ rollers are good clips are useless.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love Amazon.com!</li>
            <li>So glad they still make them!</li>
            <li>I love the clips that come with them as well!</li>
            <li>However, she tried it and said that she loved it and her hair never looked better.</li>
            <li>I did not pay that kind of money for mine 4 years ago</li>
            <li>They heat up fast and the clips hold the rods in perfectly.  </li>
            <li>They heat fairly quickly (in about 10 mins) and the clips are tight-fitting, making great curls.  </li>
            <li>and It is also my favorite</li>
            <li>you need more time.  </li>
            <li>I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>I bought this set about 6 months ago, and have really enjoyed it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like having to remove the top all the way off to get to the rollers.</li>
            <li>Love the rollers ..</li>
            <li>I would buy 2 or 3 more sets for my daughters and sister.</li>
            <li>I have used this set of heat rollers for years and love them.  </li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly and I&#x27;m very satisfied with performance.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and makes my hair look really nice.</li>
            <li>Great hot rollers that heat up quickly (about 10 minutes).</li>
            <li>These worked ok for me and my fine hair,</li>
            <li>Just prop the top open a bit to keep the surface of the rollers from cracking or melting over time and you should be happy with it.</li>
            <li>But it did get hot and the set is nice.  </li>
            <li>The majority of the rollers are medium-sized (black), which is perfect.  </li>
            <li>but they still work fine.</li>
            <li>Curlers work fine and heat up well.  </li>
            <li>I thought they heated up fine and all, but I think the quality is a bit lacking.  </li>
            <li>easy to clean unlike the velvet ones that have product stick to it and cant be cleaned as easily.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and the rollers stay secure.  </li>
            <li>Great product\\&quot; I also have the Red travel set</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product that gets hot quickly and lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;These are my favorite Hot Rollers.</li>
            <li>totally worth the $ ... no problems!</li>
            <li>definitely worth getting it!</li>
            <li>The soft curls look best on longer hair and in my opinion, curlers such as these are way safer to use than hot curling irons.</li>
            <li>I bought them when I needed a set quickly since they were inexpensive.</li>
            <li>I have a Remington blow dryer and travel quick-heat rollers, and I really like both, but this set is just too cheaply made.</li>
            <li>And the clips either don&#x27;t hold very well, or won&#x27;t even fit over the roller once your hair is in it.</li>
            <li>My old set like this broke after many years, so I tried another brand that had the flocked type of roller with the clips that clamp on.</li>
            <li>This product is deffinaly worth the money.</li>
            <li>This product is great for fine hair especially for the fact that the clips are NOT the one size fits all roller sizes like the other products have.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased that this product, which I was not able to find in any store, was available for purchase online--found it on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Hot rollers since 1974.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>That was years ago - and I have yet to have any problems with the first one purchased.</li>
            <li>Before I retired, I used these hot rollers every weekday.  </li>
            <li>Heats up really fast!</li>
            <li>Although you should still be careful with these as they warm up a lot.</li>
            <li>Also, &#x27;small&#x27; rollers were still fair to large.</li>
            <li>Love them and could not live without them.</li>
            <li>I will give these to my teenage daughter who has fine hair.</li>
            <li>They kept the curlers in but the curlers were so \\&quot;friendly to the touch\\&quot; that they weren&#x27;t hot enough to curl my hair.</li>
            <li>The butterfly clips didn&#x27;t hold very well, either.</li>
            <li>It made my holiday shopping so much easier this year.</li>
            <li>Makes it so much easier to do my hair.</li>
            <li>Also the dot that tells you when they are ready no longer works.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready to return it.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to cause much damage.</li>
            <li>Actually for many years I had the exact same product.  </li>
            <li>They do not stay warm long enough after you put them in for the heat to penetrate your hair.</li>
            <li>I received this product quickly, however, it never really got hot even after 25 minutes.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t get hot enough to do much of anything.</li>
            <li>The price is also a bargain unlike the new types of models.</li>
            <li>I have had mine for almost a year and they still heat like they were new.</li>
            <li>They used to heat up in about 3min when they were new</li>
            <li>I thought I had them in securely, but a few of them just popped off while I was sitting on the couch.</li>
            <li>I tried using the clips from my old set.</li>
            <li>These might look old fashioned, but they WORK like a charm.</li>
            <li>I am old school.</li>
            <li>The case is really small, so it&#x27;s easy to pack for overnight trips.  </li>
            <li>It works really well and lasted a very long time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used electric rollers for many years and this is the worse one by far.  </li>
            <li>Generally speaking?</li>
            <li>I have always used the &amp;#34;wax core&amp;#34; curlers, however they are becoming HARD TO FIND these days!</li>
            <li>the &#x27;medium&#x27; or &#x27;large&#x27; I get with previous rollers.</li>
            <li>I have another set by a different company with the one size clip with the spring that is sapose to fit all roller sizes but the rolers that are medium and small slip out because the clips are too loose.</li>
            <li>I even purchased the wire clips which as they were not designed for these specific rollers do not secure the hot roller.  </li>
            <li>They create soft looking waves or loose curls</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I was afraid that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find another to replace it when it burned out some day, so I purchased a second one as insurance.</li>
            <li> I only gave it four stars because it does take a little longer than i would like for them to heat up</li>
            <li> A weak point is it&#x27;s not quick to hot</li>
            <li> Their small is equal to</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had various sets of rollers for the past 20 yrs, and these are my favorites.</li>
            <li> The Rollers are not quite small enough for my hair.  </li>
            <li> Im gonna buy some other clips to use.</li>
            <li> You would think that such a trusted name, as Remington would not have used such a poorly designed clip.  </li>
            <li> It takes too long to heat, doesn&#x27;t hold the curl; clips are hard to stay in place; don&#x27;t care for the size of the rollers; rollers are difficult to put back in place except for the jumbo ones that&#x27;s marked.  </li>
            <li> No more long lines,irritable shoppers.</li>
            <li> it does NOT work well for thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d take the curlers out and my hair wouldn&#x27;t be curled, just slightly wavy.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T waste your $ on the flocked type of rollers.</li>
            <li> I used it almost everyday.  </li>
            <li> I have had this for a few years.</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s a few rollers that come in each of the three sizes.</li>
            <li> I rolled my hair (which is thin, by the way), waited 20 minutes, had some curls for maybe 5 or 7 minutes, then my hair went flat.  </li>
            <li> Again, don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> This design flaw was surely not tested or they would have seen the results of securing the roller on your hair.  </li>
            <li> Also doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space but needed to store clips in a small box I got at the dollar store.</li>
            <li> however the package of clips that hold the rollers on were mostly broken (into little pieces) upon arrival.  </li>
            <li> I have used hot rollers since I was a child, over 30 years, and these do the worst job of any set I have had at curling my hair.</li>
            <li> just wish they were not so expensive!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll hate them.</li>
            <li> I really hate those stupid pin things!</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE experience!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am very pleased that this product, which I was not able to find in any store, was available for purchase online--found it on Amazon.com.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> It smells like burning plastic.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;These are my favorite Hot Rollers. I have been using Hot rollers since 1974. My last Remington Rolls last over 5 years. Great product\\&quot; I also have the Red travel set and It is also my favorite</li>
            <li> I guess you get what you pay for? It took longer to heat up that it said it would. Also, &#x27;small&#x27; rollers were still fair to large. Their small is equal to the &#x27;medium&#x27; or &#x27;large&#x27; I get with previous rollers. The butterfly clips didn&#x27;t hold very well, either. I thought I had them in securely, but a few of them just popped off while I was sitting on the couch. I guess I&#x27;ll be paying about $30-$50 for rollers after all!</li>
            <li> I bought this when it was 12.99 in my gold bow.  The quality is soso but the quantity is enough.  Every morning use this and this equipment makes me convenient.  A weak point is it&#x27;s not quick to hot you need more time.  Generally speaking? I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> I received this product quickly, however, it never really got hot even after 25 minutes.  The dot that was supposed to darken once heated never happened.  I rolled my hair (which is thin, by the way), waited 20 minutes, had some curls for maybe 5 or 7 minutes, then my hair went flat.  Again, don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I love Amazon.com! It made my holiday shopping so much easier this year. Especially with the way the economy has affected everyone including myself, we had to do Christmas on a \\&quot;budget\\&quot;. Amazon made the comparison shopping a breeze and the stress of shopping was gone! No more long lines,irritable shoppers. I will do all my on line shopping with amazon.com from now on! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I bought this set about 6 months ago, and have really enjoyed it.  The case is really small, so it&#x27;s easy to pack for overnight trips.  They heat fairly quickly (in about 10 mins) and the clips are tight-fitting, making great curls.  The majority of the rollers are medium-sized (black), which is perfect.  I&#x27;ve had various sets of rollers for the past 20 yrs, and these are my favorites.</li>
            <li> it does NOT work well for thick, coarse hair. I have used hot rollers since I was a child, over 30 years, and these do the worst job of any set I have had at curling my hair. They do not stay warm long enough after you put them in for the heat to penetrate your hair. I bought them when I needed a set quickly since they were inexpensive. I have a Remington blow dryer and travel quick-heat rollers, and I really like both, but this set is just too cheaply made. I am back on Amazon today looking for a replacement. I will give these to my teenage daughter who has fine hair.</li>
            <li> This product is great for fine hair especially for the fact that the clips are NOT the one size fits all roller sizes like the other products have. I have fine hair and the rollers stay secure.  I have another set by a different company with the one size clip with the spring that is sapose to fit all roller sizes but the rolers that are medium and small slip out because the clips are too loose.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product that gets hot quickly and lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised--heats up in about 5 minutes.  Product arrived quickly and I&#x27;m very satisfied with performance.</li>
            <li> The Rollers are not quite small enough for my hair.  But it did get hot and the set is nice.  I don&#x27;t like having to remove the top all the way off to get to the rollers.</li>
            <li> You would think that such a trusted name, as Remington would not have used such a poorly designed clip.  These clips leave ridges in your hair no matter how you roll and clip them.  This design flaw was surely not tested or they would have seen the results of securing the roller on your hair.  I even purchased the wire clips which as they were not designed for these specific rollers do not secure the hot roller.  Rethink your purchase.</li>
            <li> My old set like this broke after many years, so I tried another brand that had the flocked type of roller with the clips that clamp on. HORRIBLE experience! The clips didn&#x27;t hold the curlers so they&#x27;d fall out. I tried using the clips from my old set. They kept the curlers in but the curlers were so \\&quot;friendly to the touch\\&quot; that they weren&#x27;t hot enough to curl my hair. I&#x27;d take the curlers out and my hair wouldn&#x27;t be curled, just slightly wavy. These might look old fashioned, but they WORK like a charm. The price is also a bargain unlike the new types of models. DON&#x27;T waste your $ on the flocked type of rollers. You&#x27;ll hate them. I bought another set of these. So glad they still make them!</li>
            <li> This product is deffinaly worth the money. I have had mine for almost a year and they still heat like they were new. I love the clips that come with them as well! Makes it so much easier to do my hair. I really hate those stupid pin things! I only gave it four stars because it does take a little longer than i would like for them to heat up (6-7min)&gt; They used to heat up in about 3min when they were new but they still work fine. Also the dot that tells you when they are ready no longer works. Over all it is a great product for the amount of money!</li>
            <li> Curlers work fine and heat up well.  The clips dont work at all for me.  They&#x27;re cheap plastic with poor design.  Im gonna buy some other clips to use.</li>
            <li> I am old school. I have used this every morning for years. Just prop the top open a bit to keep the surface of the rollers from cracking or melting over time and you should be happy with it. I was afraid that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find another to replace it when it burned out some day, so I purchased a second one as insurance. That was years ago - and I have yet to have any problems with the first one purchased.</li>
            <li> Before I retired, I used these hot rollers every weekday.  Now, only several times per week.  Love them and could not live without them. The rollers hold your hair...I am not a fan of felt/flock rollers.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set in March for $21.99 and I&#x27;m ready to return it.  It takes too long to heat, doesn&#x27;t hold the curl; clips are hard to stay in place; don&#x27;t care for the size of the rollers; rollers are difficult to put back in place except for the jumbo ones that&#x27;s marked.  I&#x27;ve given it sufficient time to make me want to keep it.  I&#x27;ve used electric rollers for many years and this is the worse one by far.  I don&#x27;t recommend it at all.</li>
            <li> I gave these a try, but taking them back. They don&#x27;t get hot enough to do much of anything. Once they are heated, the glue that holds the ends of the rollers on melts, and the ends pop off constantly. And the clips either don&#x27;t hold very well, or won&#x27;t even fit over the roller once your hair is in it. I will be moving on up to a more expensive set.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as a replacement.  Actually for many years I had the exact same product.  I used it almost everyday.  It works really well and lasted a very long time.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> totally worth the $ ... no problems! easy to clean unlike the velvet ones that have product stick to it and cant be cleaned as easily. definitely worth getting it!</li>
            <li> Love the rollers ..just wish they were not so expensive! I would buy 2 or 3 more sets for my daughters and sister. I do wish the picks were longer.</li>
            <li> Got it for the wife for a X-Mas present only realizing later that she had a spare in the walk in closet. However, she tried it and said that she loved it and her hair never looked better. She is now using this one and got rid of the set she was using. Heats up really fast!</li>
            <li> These worked ok for me and my fine hair, however the package of clips that hold the rollers on were mostly broken (into little pieces) upon arrival.  Therefore I can only use about 1/3 of the rollers at a time.  I thought they heated up fine and all, but I think the quality is a bit lacking.  Be warned that you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> what???&lt;br /&gt; I did not pay that kind of money for mine 4 years ago&lt;br /&gt;I Paid like 14$ rollers are good clips are useless.&lt;br /&gt;it helps to to wear a plastic shower cap on your&lt;br /&gt;head to keep heat in,</li>
            <li> I have had this for a few years. It heats up quickly and makes my hair look really nice. Doesn&#x27;t seem to cause much damage. Also doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space but needed to store clips in a small box I got at the dollar store.</li>
            <li> Great hot rollers that heat up quickly (about 10 minutes). They create soft looking waves or loose curls and there&#x27;s a few rollers that come in each of the three sizes. The soft curls look best on longer hair and in my opinion, curlers such as these are way safer to use than hot curling irons. Although you should still be careful with these as they warm up a lot.</li>
            <li> I have always used the &amp;#34;wax core&amp;#34; curlers, however they are becoming HARD TO FIND these days!</li>
            <li> I have used this set of heat rollers for years and love them.  They heat up fast and the clips hold the rods in perfectly.  I needed a set for traveling and this size fits perfect in the suit case.  I even take them on the Harley when we travel over night.</li>
            <li> Excellent, it works amazingly well!</li>
