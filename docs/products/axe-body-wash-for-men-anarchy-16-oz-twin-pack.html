            <li>Good lather and smells good.</li>
            <li>It smells good but its not chocolate.</li>
            <li>I love smelling good.  </li>
            <li>I was always a bar of soap kind of guy.</li>
            <li>My husband used this on a whim when in a pinch and actually liked the smell.</li>
            <li>it on everywhere and great fun to share!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>The most immediate thing you&#x27;ll notice about</li>
            <li>Love the smell</li>
            <li>and I love the compliments.</li>
            <li>My huband and I both love when he uses this product.  </li>
            <li>Funky smell on, much better smell off.  </li>
            <li>This scent has more of a dank musky smell than what I was hoping to get.  </li>
            <li>I decided I liked the smell so much that I bought him some more.</li>
            <li>One star for fair amount of lather and easy rinse, and only one more star for the scent (which just wasn&#x27;t for me, or my neighbors, or any of God&#x27;s creatures).  </li>
            <li>Good body wash on his sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, but the scent doesn&#x27;t hang around a long time after my shower which is nice.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice change of pace to your normal, cologne smelling soap or gel.</li>
            <li>It gets me clean and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>it smells more like cologne than other soap fragrances, and got it for a good price.</li>
            <li>I think they put some type of magic in the mix because after I get out of the shower I feel so alive</li>
            <li>Obviously works as a soap, but the scent is really nice.  </li>
            <li>The price is right.</li>
            <li>first don&#x27;t remember which one</li>
            <li>Smells funky at first, but then the smell changes.  </li>
            <li>My boyfriend bought this shower gel a few months ago and I loved the smell.</li>
            <li>If you love the smell, but don&#x27;t want to waste money on the body sprays (let&#x27;s be honest, they smell like a chemical factory and teenage boys)</li>
            <li>I keep a bottle of it very manly smell</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I am definitely not the target market for this product as I am in my 40&#x27;s, but I do enjoy it.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, Dark Temptation reminds me somewhat more of cough syrup spilled on an old leather couch in the back room of a smokey dive bar than it does for creating a manly intriguing scent.  </li>
            <li>Obviously, just by looking at the product marketing, I knew this wasn&#x27;t going to be one of those fresh crisp smelling scents that wake you up in the morning, but I&#x27;d thought I&#x27;d give  something different a try.  </li>
            <li>it was new and they had it on sale that was over a year ago</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t have this one on the new subscibe and save</li>
            <li>Not sure how much more I can write about shower gel.</li>
            <li>I feel cleaner and my skin is not dried out.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if its just an old bottle</li>
            <li>all I can say it great to bad</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Dark?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was intentional, but that&#x27;s what dark temptation seems to be &amp;#34;inspired&amp;#34; by.</li>
            <li> Axe can get a bad rap sometimes, but this is one of the nicer smells and gets a decent lather going.</li>
            <li> Not a good product to mail.</li>
            <li> Tough to review, body wash is body wash.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I love it and I&#x27;m going to keep ording from Amazon thank you</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this for over a year now and we still like the smell.  It cleans well.  The price is right.</li>
            <li> Smells great and cleans well.</li>
            <li> I was never a body wash person it always seemed like you could never get the soap out of your washcloth but I gave AXE a try I tried one of the other fragrance first don&#x27;t remember which one but it didn&#x27;t do anything for me I belive this one had just come out it was new and they had it on sale that was over a year ago I keep a bottle of it very manly smell I love smelling good.  it never clashes with my cologne I think they put some type of magic in the mix because after I get out of the shower I feel so alive all I can say it great to bad they don&#x27;t have this one on the new subscibe and save I would have on my delivery date each month work on that Amazon</li>
            <li> Not sure how much more I can write about shower gel. Good lather and smells good. Scent doesn&#x27;t last very long but I don&#x27;t expect it too.</li>
            <li> Ever since Axe came out with dark temptation, it&#x27;s been my go to body wash/deodorant. The most immediate thing you&#x27;ll notice about it&#x27;s aroma is it smells like chocolate. If you love the smell, but don&#x27;t want to waste money on the body sprays (let&#x27;s be honest, they smell like a chemical factory and teenage boys) then pick up some Diesel Plus Plus cologne. I&#x27;m not sure if it was intentional, but that&#x27;s what dark temptation seems to be &amp;#34;inspired&amp;#34; by.</li>
            <li> Best stuff out there!!!!</li>
            <li> I was always a bar of soap kind of guy. My brother had me try the shower gel and I decided to use axe dark temptation. Love the smell and I love the compliments. I feel cleaner and my skin is not dried out.</li>
            <li> I like that it smells more like cologne than other soap fragrances, and got it for a good price. Plus I prefer shower gels over bar soap any day.</li>
            <li> Tough to review, body wash is body wash. I just didn&#x27;t care for this specific one.</li>
            <li> I took a shower used this and went to a football game. And i got some that night by some female i met at the game and she said my god the soap your using smells bomb so yeah recommend product 😎</li>
            <li> Ooooh beeeeehave. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah baby!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rub it on everywhere and great fun to share!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Groovy baby!</li>
            <li> My huband and I both love when he uses this product.  Obviously works as a soap, but the scent is really nice.  I like it when my man smells like a man...</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I have been using it for almost 2 years.  It gets me clean and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  It smells nice, but the scent doesn&#x27;t hang around a long time after my shower which is nice.  I am definitely not the target market for this product as I am in my 40&#x27;s, but I do enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if its just an old bottle but it does not smell like chocolate.  It smells good but its not chocolate.</li>
            <li> Not a good product to mail. Two got broke open and made two big messes.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend bought this shower gel a few months ago and I loved the smell. I decided I liked the smell so much that I bought him some more. It&#x27;s a nice change of pace to your normal, cologne smelling soap or gel.</li>
            <li> Funky smell on, much better smell off.  I used the snake skin desert type for months but eventually wanted something smoother.. and gave this a try.  Smells funky at first, but then the smell changes.  I&#x27;m still not going to buy it again.  I&#x27;ll try another until I get something 100% pleasing for my tastes.</li>
            <li> This scent has more of a dank musky smell than what I was hoping to get.  Obviously, just by looking at the product marketing, I knew this wasn&#x27;t going to be one of those fresh crisp smelling scents that wake you up in the morning, but I&#x27;d thought I&#x27;d give  something different a try.  Unfortunately, Dark Temptation reminds me somewhat more of cough syrup spilled on an old leather couch in the back room of a smokey dive bar than it does for creating a manly intriguing scent.  One star for fair amount of lather and easy rinse, and only one more star for the scent (which just wasn&#x27;t for me, or my neighbors, or any of God&#x27;s creatures).  The aroma also has a tendency to burn and irritate my eyes all morning until it wears off.  Dark? Yes.  Temptation? Don&#x27;t think so.</li>
            <li> My husband used this on a whim when in a pinch and actually liked the smell. Axe can get a bad rap sometimes, but this is one of the nicer smells and gets a decent lather going. Good body wash on his sensitive skin.</li>
